hey guys welcome to the action brick
today<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:01.920> have<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.070> mock<00:00:02.280> presentation<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.240> the

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
today I have a mock presentation of the

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.539 
today I have a mock presentation of the
windmill<00:00:04.170> now<00:00:04.410> this<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.859> not<00:00:05.220> from<00:00:05.490> a

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
windmill now this is not from a

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.650 
windmill now this is not from a
particular<00:00:06.089> theme

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
a windmill in clash of clans because of

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.109 
a windmill in clash of clans because of
the<00:00:17.730> decorations<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.840> stuff<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
the decorations and stuff this is a

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.269 
the decorations and stuff this is a
basically<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.779> custom<00:00:22.529> thing<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.250> I

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
basically just custom thing that I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.880 
basically just custom thing that I
decided<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.880> make<00:00:24.029> right<00:00:24.390> before<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.109> leave

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
decided to make right before I leave

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.929 
decided to make right before I leave
next<00:00:26.220> week<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.880> summer<00:00:27.180> camp<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:29.220> want

next week for summer camp and so I want

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.600 
next week for summer camp and so I want
to<00:00:30.000> make<00:00:30.179> sure<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.390> got<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.869> video<00:00:31.289> posted<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.219> so

to make sure I got a video posted and so
without<00:00:33.000> further<00:00:33.059> ado<00:00:33.450> let's<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:33.840> take<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> look

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
without further ado let's go take a look

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.440 
without further ado let's go take a look
at<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.559> windmill<00:00:34.940> alright<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> base

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
at the windmill alright so at the base

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.780 
at the windmill alright so at the base
of<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.200> see<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.160> kind<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.550> motor

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
of this you can see or the kind of motor

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.030 
of this you can see or the kind of motor
that<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.379> windmill<00:00:40.710> actually

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that I have here the windmill actually

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.060 
that I have here the windmill actually
does<00:00:41.219> work<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.500> because<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.920> can

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
does work and because of that you can

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.979 
does work and because of that you can
actually<00:00:44.100> put<00:00:44.579> any<00:00:44.789> type<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> custom<00:00:45.840> motor

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
actually put any type of custom motor

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.590 
actually put any type of custom motor
that<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> want<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.829> different<00:00:47.190> functions

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
that you want to do different functions

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.750 
that you want to do different functions
but<00:00:48.600> around<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.700> some

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
but around here you can see we got some

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.200 
but around here you can see we got some
hinge<00:00:51.180> pieces<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.840> create<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.289> angular<00:00:53.210> legs

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
hinge pieces to create the angular legs

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.779 
hinge pieces to create the angular legs
of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.930> windmill<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.280> I'll<00:00:56.550> show<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
of the windmill and so I'll show you

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.119 
of the windmill and so I'll show you
what<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.120> does<00:00:57.360> later<00:00:57.629> moving<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.770> can

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
what this does later moving up you can

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.520 
what this does later moving up you can
see<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> meets<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> point<00:01:00.870> where<00:01:01.230> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
see that it meets up to a point where it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.640 
see that it meets up to a point where it
reaches<00:01:02.039> meets<00:01:02.520> these<00:01:02.760> hinges<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.650> finally

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
reaches meets these hinges and finally

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190 
reaches meets these hinges and finally
we<00:01:04.739> got<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> propeller<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
we got the propeller right here or the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
we got the propeller right here or the
windmill<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.100> don't<00:01:08.520> know<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> call<00:01:08.939> them

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
windmill I don't know what you call them

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
windmill I don't know what you call them
I'm<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> call<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.229> propeller<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
I'm just going to call it propeller and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.210 
I'm just going to call it propeller and
I<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:12.090> Kerr<00:01:12.840> made<00:01:13.140> them<00:01:13.320> curved<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.070> that

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
I actually Kerr made them curved so that

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.760 
I actually Kerr made them curved so that
the<00:01:14.520> wind<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.909> actually<00:01:15.390> push<00:01:16.320> against<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the wind will actually push against it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.210 
the wind will actually push against it
and<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.850> way<00:01:18.740> not<00:01:19.740> by<00:01:19.890> not

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and then they go that way not by not

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.100 
and then they go that way not by not
from<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.580> left<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.570> spin<00:01:21.930> like

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
from right to left but it will spin like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.050 
from right to left but it will spin like
that<00:01:22.320> I'll<00:01:22.830> show<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.340> demonstration<00:01:23.520> later

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that I'll show you a demonstration later

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.050 
that I'll show you a demonstration later
but<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.380> see<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.220> gears

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
but as you can see we have the gears

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.819 
but as you can see we have the gears
that<00:01:27.299> turn<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.020> windmill<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.710> how

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that turn the windmill you can see how

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.359 
that turn the windmill you can see how
that<00:01:28.979> works<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.619> fin<00:01:31.950> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that works and the this little fin that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.420 
that works and the this little fin that
is<00:01:33.000> pushed<00:01:33.630> by<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.900> wind<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.890> it's

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
is pushed by the wind so that it's

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.120 
is pushed by the wind so that it's
facing<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.939> right<00:01:36.180> direction<00:01:36.890> alright<00:01:37.890> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
facing the right direction alright so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550 
facing the right direction alright so
before<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> shot<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.200> windmill

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
before I get to the shot of the windmill

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.039 
before I get to the shot of the windmill
in<00:01:40.799> action<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.430> want<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> point<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.780> I'm

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
in action I want to point out that I'm

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.289 
in action I want to point out that I'm
going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.380> put<00:01:43.619> some<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> these<00:01:44.100> wheat<00:01:44.790> tiles

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
going to put some of these wheat tiles

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.030 
going to put some of these wheat tiles
I'm<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> call<00:01:46.049> them<00:01:46.200> wheat<00:01:46.470> I'm

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
I'm just going to call them wheat I'm

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.090
