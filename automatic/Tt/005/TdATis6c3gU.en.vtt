00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.100
 what a very good day friends of the simplex bloc he 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.610
 today we are going to work 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.800
 in combination with microsoft trade mur 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.940
 this in order to perform Latin pressure 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.909
 d labels 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.130
 in this case 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.269
 we will use them to send correspondence 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.449
 so that the only thing we have to do is 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.820
 to cut the label or take off the format and paste it into the envelope 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.250
 we have a database 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 p corresponding to the addresses 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.650
 and the information of the clients 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.170
 what we need to do now is entel a guard 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.130
 use the correspondence tool to combine correspondence 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.149
 so 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.720
 we are going to 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.290
 be in mugardos 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.290
 we go to the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.110
 here we have different ways of working with these elements of 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.400
 correspondence 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.580
 for now we are going to use the wizard to link the combination 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.790
 of tve corresponds let's read the step-by-step step for copado gabriel with him the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.810
 assistant 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.159
 and we do not have to ask ourselves in the type of documents that we are going to do 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.790
 print labels 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.480
 Once we select labeled, we click on next 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.010
 let's adopt percent works art cool change the design of the document 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.540
 current 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.540
 and we go option to select the options of the labels 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.340
 In the market there are many types of labels, many label brands 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.390
 we are going to use the ivry accepts that are the most common 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.040
 and within those e hybrid we are going to use model 81 60 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.360
 the model 81 60 days a quite acceptable size to do the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.390
 label printing 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.689
 we looked for it 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.070
 here it is 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.440
 i have your measurements are delkÃ¡der two-point pickaxe 54 centimeters 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 high by six points 68 centimeters 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.419
 we click on accept 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.789
 and we already see the configuration of what has been the city that 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.889
 we click on next 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.429
 and we are wrong to select those from you and the recipients say them and we are going to 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:37.809
 use an existing unwise list minus two data or contacts 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:38.839
 outlook 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:43.400
 or write a new list in this case use a list that already exists stick 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.399
 click on that examine 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.419
 here we are going to both handle the room now 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.909
 I have it 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.299
 let's open lom 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.299
 we have desktop ekin 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.599
 let's open the one called print 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.319
 petit 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 is the one that we go to the serna 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.859
 and here I have it 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.019
 and it also tells us that the first row of data contains the headers 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.019
 of the columns we click on accept 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.749
 here to second 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.079
 one in it shows us 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.199
 the elements that are involved 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.279
 in what corresponds 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.210
 our our database 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.360
 here we with the popcorn can click on those elements that do not 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.980
 we want them to print for the moment mouse use 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.739
 all those elements 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.739
 we click on accept 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:50.799
 we clicked on it now the next step after six the exile and 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.799
 cenieh the labels we click on next 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:57.929
 and here we are going to add some preventive elements 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.369
 but more elements are still useful to us 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:06.189
 which correspond to the headers d not extrabase data 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.779
 I'm going to give you the field called the company name 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:14.749
 which corresponds to the name of the company 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.749
 I'm also going to add the field called address 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.889
 what is called a colony 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.539
 the city 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.430
 the state 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.569
 and also the zip code 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.770
 who are some elements that I want to be 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.930
 included in the label 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.379
 the piquense 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.430
 now if he told you he put us all 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.430
 all continuous then I am going to be for haiti city 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.849
 benite wheel to appear in a single line 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.270
 and also here in the direction 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.819
 mockus an address we were going to give venter to which direction 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.879
 and colony 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.420
 appear in a single line let's say 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.710
 here we separate 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.449
 new elements 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.449
 because 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.449
 if I have address city-state colony and zip code 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.169
 we are going to 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.199
 percent 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.320
 although obama left this element of this label of types of information 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.110
 nothing else is going to look like the primate information the elements 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.319
 I have to do 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.999
 it is worth replicating the labels that we serve to collect these elements in all the 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:29.279
 I'll give the labels then click on the button to update all the 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.669
 labels 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.669
 ibaka that affects copying all the fields 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.760
 other labels 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.760
 we click on next preview 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.580
 and here is showing me already 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.639
 the 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.279
 percent 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.490
 and the corresponding elements 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.710
 percent assimilated 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.559
 my labels 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:57.259
 until the first second third company 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.969
 4th 5th and 6th label 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:01.530
 it was really completed 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.409
 the name of the company 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.409
 your adress 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:07.960
 the street 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.219
 the number 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:10.550
 what colony 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.669
 what city 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.669
 in what state and the code 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.639
 what we can do afterwards 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:18.600
 to complete 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.800
 the combination we click now incomplete 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.689
 the combination 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.369
 Obviously if I have many more elements, they are going to be done, 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:30.850
 nothing else one can do 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.850
 several sheets of labels 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.090
 the dressmaker foresee when and to whom it would be to dedicate yourself to print the step 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.839
 next would print 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.050
 we would click on print and obviously all would be displayed 

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:47.389
 our labels towards the 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.940
 imprecise what we can see is also 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.949
 save the document 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:54.430
 the voice foot in save 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.430
 as a word document 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.219
 and we put the psychiatrist cicpc 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:03.949
 As name 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.809
 bouquets 

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:09.749
 and we have already saved the labels in such a way that for the next times 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:13.499
 with simple and simply open that commented we can send print the 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:17.399
 this is how the 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:21.550
 mail merge for intel xeon tags 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.250
 hoping that this information has been taken 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.120
 we said goodbye not without first reminding them not to leave it 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.849
 to follow the example 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:31.350
 simplex the point blogspot dotcom 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.699
 and that we are also in 

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.360
 twitter in @ simple c's that have an excellent day 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.219
 until next time
