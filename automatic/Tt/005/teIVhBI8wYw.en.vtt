throw you two a cat outside of something
I<00:00:49.649> don't<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.829> why<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.250> anyway<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
I don't know why I do that anyway I

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.680 
I don't know why I do that anyway I
don't<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> told<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.329> didn't<00:00:51.600> do

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
don't know what I told you I didn't do

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
don't know what I told you I didn't do
that<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.649> wasn't<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.160> rage<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that but it wasn't because of rage I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700 
that but it wasn't because of rage I
think<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.449> press<00:00:54.690> down<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
think it's just because I press down the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.099 
think it's just because I press down the
spring<00:00:55.949> button<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:57.210> hard<00:00:57.539> when<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> play<00:00:58.079> I

spring button so hard when I play I
don't<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.379> why<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.559> do<00:00:58.829> e<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.070> my<00:00:59.160> thumb<00:00:59.399> must

don't know why I do e to my thumb must

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.099 
don't know why I do e to my thumb must
be<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.149> most<00:01:00.270> powerful<00:01:00.510> thing<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> world

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
out I've really wanted one and the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
out I've really wanted one and the
easiest<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> set<00:01:24.240> up

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
easiest way to get one is just to set up

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.480 
easiest way to get one is just to set up
with<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.659> team<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.080> nine<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.560> play<00:01:26.189> ground

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
with like a team of nine and play ground

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.310 
with like a team of nine and play ground
war<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.210> spawn<00:01:27.420> trapping<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.229> but

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
war and just spawn trapping I but but

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.719 
war and just spawn trapping I but but
that's<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> want<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> want<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that's not what I want to do I want to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
that's not what I want to do I want to
play<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.240> own<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:31.020> nonlethals<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
play on my own on these nonlethals on a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
play on my own on these nonlethals on a
go<00:01:32.070> around<00:01:32.369> playing<00:01:32.729> how<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> usually<00:01:33.299> would

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
go around playing how I usually would

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.420 
go around playing how I usually would
and<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> 30<00:01:34.590> gunstreak<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and I want to get a 30 gunstreak and you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.789 
and I want to get a 30 gunstreak and you
see<00:01:35.549> me<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> 21<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.110> game<00:01:37.320> plane<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
see me get a 21 in this game plane and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.580 
see me get a 21 in this game plane and
then<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> kind<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.840> even<00:01:39.960> p<00:01:40.170> grenaded

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
then I kind of I get even p grenaded

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
then I kind of I get even p grenaded
when<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.100> V<00:01:41.250> SAT<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.210> start

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
when I have a V SAT up and I start

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.880 
when I have a V SAT up and I start
rushing<00:01:42.780> because<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.110> know<00:01:43.200> there's<00:01:43.380> only<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
rushing because I know there's only I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.920 
rushing because I know there's only I
think<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:44.759> 10<00:01:44.970> kills<00:01:45.210> left<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> needed

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
think it was 10 kills left and I needed

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.929 
think it was 10 kills left and I needed
nine<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> nuclear<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.310> then

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
nine of them to get the nuclear and then

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.520 
nine of them to get the nuclear and then
I<00:01:48.030> die<00:01:48.090> because<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.630> tried<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> throw<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.320> for

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
I die because I tried to throw see for

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.649 
I die because I tried to throw see for
that<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.799> didn't<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.640> eventually<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.420> won't

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that I didn't have so eventually I won't

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.330 
that I didn't have so eventually I won't
get<00:01:51.780> snotty<00:01:52.049> nuclear<00:01:52.439> I'm<00:01:52.619> pretty<00:01:52.890> confident

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
get snotty nuclear I'm pretty confident

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
get snotty nuclear I'm pretty confident
i<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.850> I've<00:01:54.060> gone<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.600> some<00:01:54.869> very<00:01:55.049> good

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
i can get it I've gone on some very good

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.170

I've got a month to get it and I'm
pretty<00:02:04.590> confident<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.490> well<00:02:05.670> I'm<00:02:05.850> not

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
pretty confident on it so well I'm not

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.490

pretty I'm not sure if I get it with the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.619 
pretty I'm not sure if I get it with the
ballista<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.729> day<00:02:08.879> aside<00:02:09.149> because<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.509> go

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
ballista or the day aside because I go

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.669 
ballista or the day aside because I go
through<00:02:09.750> stages<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.259> preferring<00:02:10.560> one

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
through stages of preferring one

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.640 
through stages of preferring one
together<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.640> DSR<00:02:12.090> has<00:02:12.180> got<00:02:12.330> more<00:02:12.450> damage<00:02:13.379> but

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
together the DSR has got more damage but

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.100 
together the DSR has got more damage but
it's<00:02:13.739> got

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
it's got

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.800 
it's got
reload<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:15.010> slower<00:02:15.280> zooming<00:02:15.700> time<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.180> if

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
reload and a slower zooming time and if

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.000 
reload and a slower zooming time and if
you're<00:02:16.930> good<00:02:17.140> with<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.350> blister<00:02:17.680> if<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.860> can

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
you're good with the blister if you can

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.590 
you're good with the blister if you can
aim<00:02:18.160> from<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.550> chest<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.150> prefer<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
aim from the chest up I prefer the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.110 
aim from the chest up I prefer the
sniper<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.170> DSR<00:02:20.620> which<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.980> not<00:02:21.880> that

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
sniper to the DSR which is not that

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.420 
sniper to the DSR which is not that
