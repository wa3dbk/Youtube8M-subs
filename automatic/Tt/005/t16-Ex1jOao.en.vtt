enter<00:02:07.050> needs<00:02:07.230> because<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.830> kind<00:02:08.040> of

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
enter needs because I think that kind of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.810 
enter needs because I think that kind of
defeats<00:02:08.430> the<00:02:08.550> purpose<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:10.619> lip<00:02:11.100> tattoo

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
defeats the purpose of this lip tattoo

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.020 
defeats the purpose of this lip tattoo

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.040 
think you're supposed to apply a thick
enough<00:02:21.750> layer<00:02:22.080> where<00:02:22.950> it'll<00:02:23.670> dry<00:02:23.970> evenly<00:02:24.540> but

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
enough layer where it'll dry evenly but

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.510 
enough layer where it'll dry evenly but
not<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.530> thick<00:02:25.830> where<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.040> takes<00:02:26.220> like<00:02:26.370> forever

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
not so thick where it takes like forever

not so thick where it takes like forever
to<00:02:26.940> dry<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.540> gonna<00:02:27.780> think<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:30.210> purple

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780
