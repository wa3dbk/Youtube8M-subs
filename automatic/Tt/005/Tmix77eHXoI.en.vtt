00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
what we're going to be looking at today

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
what we're going to be looking at today
so<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.340> got<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.549> default<00:01:39.030> your<00:01:39.479> white<00:01:39.780> light

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so you got your default your white light

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.950 
so you got your default your white light
blue<00:01:40.320> blue<00:01:40.680> purple<00:01:41.009> pink<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:41.970> and

blue blue purple pink all of these and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.170 
blue blue purple pink all of these and
it's<00:01:43.259> pretty<00:01:43.470> cool<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.070> when<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.880> up

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
it's pretty cool I think when you do up

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.389 
it's pretty cool I think when you do up
or<00:01:45.630> change<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.320> color<00:01:46.500> though<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.950> takes<00:01:47.220> a

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
or change the color though it takes a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.149 
or change the color though it takes a
minute<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.759> update<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.799> some<00:01:49.979> odd<00:01:50.130> reason

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
minute to update so for some odd reason

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.389 
minute to update so for some odd reason
I'm<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.640> completely<00:01:51.149> sure<00:01:51.180> why<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:52.399> it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
I'm not completely sure why that is it

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.230 
I'm not completely sure why that is it
does<00:01:53.640> take<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> minute<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.509> even<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:56.240> kill

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
does take a minute so even if you kill

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.490 
does take a minute so even if you kill
yourself

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
yourself

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.010 
yourself

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
this what we're going to do is go to all

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.699 
this what we're going to do is go to all
the<00:04:19.220> way<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.669> end<00:04:19.850> where<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:20.449> can<00:04:20.780> find<00:04:21.290> so

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
the way to the end where you can find so

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.200 
the way to the end where you can find so
here<00:04:21.979> actually<00:04:22.160> I<00:04:22.370> should<00:04:22.639> approach<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:23.000> so

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
here actually I should approach a so

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.300 
here actually I should approach a so
it's<00:04:23.690> start<00:04:23.930> with<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.169> steam<00:04:24.410> then<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:25.160> go<00:04:25.250> to

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
it's start with the steam then you go to

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.820 
it's start with the steam then you go to
steam<00:04:25.580> apps<00:04:25.790> common<00:04:26.350> they<00:04:27.350> kind<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.680> strike

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
steam apps common they kind of strike

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.550 
steam apps common they kind of strike
global<00:04:27.949> offensive<00:04:28.190> so<00:04:28.970> we're<00:04:29.510> in<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:30.320> same

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
global offensive so we're in the same

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.930 
global offensive so we're in the same
one<00:04:31.520> here<00:04:31.760> then<00:04:31.940> we<00:04:32.030> go<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.180> csgo<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:33.940> then

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
one here then we go to csgo and then

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.110 
one here then we go to csgo and then
resource<00:04:35.710> whose<00:04:36.710> resource<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:38.350> then<00:04:39.350> flash

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
resource whose resource and then flash

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.029 
resource whose resource and then flash
flash<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.930> you're<00:04:42.169> going<00:04:42.289> to<00:04:42.320> drag<00:04:42.710> both

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
flash and you're going to drag both

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.400 
flash and you're going to drag both
these<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.580> here<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.199> can<00:04:45.320> copy<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:46.010> paste

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
these in here so you can copy and paste

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.620 
these in here so you can copy and paste
them<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.370> say<00:04:49.669> replace<00:04:50.060> files<00:04:50.330> and

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
it but there you go

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.850 
it but there you go
so<00:05:16.940> I<00:05:17.330> mean<00:05:17.539> go<00:05:17.660> to<00:05:17.720> offline<00:05:18.110> with<00:05:18.289> bots<00:05:18.500> again

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
so I mean go to offline with bots again

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.900 
so I mean go to offline with bots again
and<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:20.030> think<00:05:20.270> less<00:05:21.139> in<00:05:21.500> this<00:05:21.860> menu<00:05:22.460> and<00:05:22.699> more

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
and I think less in this menu and more

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.909 
and I think less in this menu and more
in<00:05:23.150> game<00:05:23.539> this<00:05:24.229> font<00:05:24.530> looks<00:05:24.770> really<00:05:25.039> good

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
in game this font looks really good

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.070 
in game this font looks really good
because<00:05:27.919> it's<00:05:28.250> more<00:05:28.460> about<00:05:28.699> you<00:05:29.660> know<00:05:29.690> being

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
because it's more about you know being

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.500 
because it's more about you know being
able<00:05:30.169> to<00:05:30.320> see<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.680> numbers<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:31.430> less<00:05:32.270> about

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
able to see the numbers and less about

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.920 
able to see the numbers and less about
reading<00:05:32.990> stuff<00:05:33.289> it's<00:05:33.949> not<00:05:34.099> the<00:05:34.250> best<00:05:34.720> font<00:05:35.720> for

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
reading stuff it's not the best font for

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.110 
reading stuff it's not the best font for
reading<00:05:36.289> things<00:05:36.590> but<00:05:37.280> I<00:05:37.310> do<00:05:37.400> think<00:05:37.760> it<00:05:37.940> looks

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
reading things but I do think it looks

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.810 
reading things but I do think it looks
pretty<00:05:38.330> cool<00:05:38.539> in-game<00:05:39.229> I<00:05:39.560> know<00:05:40.310> a<00:05:40.460> couple<00:05:40.610> of
