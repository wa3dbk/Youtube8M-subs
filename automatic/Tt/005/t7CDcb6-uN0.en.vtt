all<00:01:27.670> this<00:01:27.850> horsepower<00:01:28.240> now<00:01:28.600> you're<00:01:28.720> gonna<00:01:28.810> be

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
all this horsepower now you're gonna be

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.870 
all this horsepower now you're gonna be
slinging<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.350> stuff<00:01:29.590> all<00:01:29.740> over<00:01:29.950> no<00:01:30.130> now<00:01:30.490> put

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
slinging that stuff all over no now put

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.510 
slinging that stuff all over no now put
the<00:01:31.000> pad<00:01:31.270> down<00:01:31.479> first<00:01:31.750> turn<00:01:32.049> it<00:01:32.140> on<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.369> then

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
the pad down first turn it on and then

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:46.600 
the pad down first turn it on and then
I'm<00:01:33.610> just<00:01:33.670> gonna<00:01:33.909> rub<00:01:34.240> this<00:01:34.450> back<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.320> forth

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.150 

okay<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:48.480> that'll<00:01:49.050> effectively<00:01:49.590> remove<00:01:49.890> all

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
okay now that'll effectively remove all

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.640 
okay now that'll effectively remove all
the<00:01:50.490> water<00:01:50.640> spots<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.450> any<00:01:51.840> road<00:01:52.200> film<00:01:52.500> that's

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
the water spots and any road film that's

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.170 
the water spots and any road film that's
on<00:01:52.830> there<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.190> don't<00:01:53.280> wanna<00:01:53.460> let<00:01:53.550> this<00:01:53.700> dry<00:01:54.000> so

I didn't polish Oh smooth as glass for
this<00:02:04.650> glass<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.580> this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.790> amazingly<00:02:06.240> rough

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
this glass and this is amazingly rough

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.640 
this glass and this is amazingly rough
you<00:02:06.720> get<00:02:06.840> over<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.110> where<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:07.290> haven't<00:02:07.500> hit

thing we're gonna do is put the pinnacle
glass<00:02:14.070> coat<00:02:14.430> window<00:02:14.910> sealant<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.930> rain

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
glass coat window sealant with rain

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.060 
glass coat window sealant with rain
repellant

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
repellant

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.130 
repellant
and<00:02:17.220> what<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.330> going<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:19.050> to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
and what this is going to do is going to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.290 
and what this is going to do is going to
seal<00:02:19.470> all<00:02:19.620> those<00:02:19.800> microscopic<00:02:20.370> pores<00:02:20.940> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
seal all those microscopic pores and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.449 
seal all those microscopic pores and
create<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> hydrophobic<00:02:22.830> surface<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.430> that

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
create a hydrophobic surface so that

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.190 
create a hydrophobic surface so that
means<00:02:23.730> water<00:02:24.030> fearing<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.660> water's<00:02:24.990> going<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
means water fearing so water's going to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.530 
means water fearing so water's going to
want<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:25.650> away<00:02:25.830> from<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.400> glass<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.120> you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
want to get away from that glass and you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
want to get away from that glass and you
know<00:02:27.570> you're<00:02:28.020> not<00:02:28.140> gonna<00:02:28.350> use<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.890> machine<00:02:29.190> on

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
know you're not gonna use a machine on

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.680 
know you're not gonna use a machine on
this<00:02:29.490> it's<00:02:29.670> actually<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.970> hand<00:02:30.150> applied<00:02:30.480> this

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
this it's actually a hand applied this

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.980 
this it's actually a hand applied this
is<00:02:30.900> hand<00:02:31.140> applied<00:02:31.470> shocked<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:33.390> for<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.810> you

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
is hand applied shocked and for this you

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.630 
is hand applied shocked and for this you
just<00:02:34.110> want<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.380> come<00:02:34.590> down<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.130> really<00:02:35.490> work

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
just want to come down and really work

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.120 
just want to come down and really work
this<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.940> nice<00:02:36.270> even<00:02:36.840> coating<00:02:37.200> over<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> glass

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
this a nice even coating over the glass

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.930 
this a nice even coating over the glass
and<00:02:38.959> then<00:02:39.959> normally<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:41.160> would<00:02:41.280> let<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.610> dry

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
and then normally you would let this dry

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.230 
and then normally you would let this dry
ten<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.510> fifteen<00:02:42.990> minutes<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.760> then<00:02:44.760> wipe<00:02:45.030> it

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
ten to fifteen minutes and then wipe it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.510 
ten to fifteen minutes and then wipe it
off<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.470> could<00:02:46.650> add<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> second<00:02:47.340> coat

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
off and then you could add a second coat

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.790 
off and then you could add a second coat
and<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.150> uniform<00:02:48.660> coverage<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.380> to

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
and that's for uniform coverage and to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.290 
and that's for uniform coverage and to
make<00:02:49.950> sure<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.190> got<00:02:50.340> every<00:02:50.790> square<00:02:51.090> inch

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
make sure you got every square inch

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.750 
make sure you got every square inch
covered<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.900> then<00:02:52.050> what<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.620> does<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.370> we

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
covered and then what this does is we

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.490 
covered and then what this does is we
need<00:02:53.910> any<00:02:54.209> time<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.510> use<00:02:54.600> your<00:02:54.660> wiper<00:02:54.930> blades

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
need any time you use your wiper blades

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.650 
need any time you use your wiper blades
the<00:02:55.830> water's<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:56.280> going<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.670> clear<00:02:57.060> quickly

with<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> wiper<00:02:58.050> blades<00:02:58.410> your<00:02:58.739> blades<00:02:59.040> will

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
with the wiper blades your blades will

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.370 
with the wiper blades your blades will
last<00:02:59.459> longer<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.180> actually<00:03:00.630> over<00:03:01.230> about
