 once 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.580
 crunches and carries a weapon of you see that entered 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.070
 to steal is still that his intention is not 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.599
 It's fine then the minimum 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.599
 I can do is offer you a cup of tea 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.630

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.980
 old boss peter blake want to see me 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.980

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.960
 this relationship you have with beverly and 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.150

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.640
 miracles since I have reason to use the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.280
 yours is the kind of love that illuminates the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.050
 world the kind of love that can save her 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.050
 but you're going to save anyone 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.579
 ah 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.119

 it's called green 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.409
 what is happening 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.280
 that keep me alive maybe there's 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.280
 something that you are still destined to do 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.040

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.040
 how is he alive 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.310
 it is possible to love someone so much that 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.310
 prevent you from dying 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.700
