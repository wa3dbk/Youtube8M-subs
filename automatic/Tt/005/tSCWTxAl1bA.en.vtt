gear and turn the thing off I took the

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.930 
gear and turn the thing off I took the
wheel<00:00:03.750> off<00:00:03.990> so<00:00:04.770> I'm<00:00:04.920> going<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.100> take<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.609> clip

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
wheel off so I'm going to take this clip

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.730 
wheel off so I'm going to take this clip
off<00:00:06.560> because<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:08.220> axle<00:00:09.120> nut<00:00:09.420> has<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.590> be

off because this axle nut has to be

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.430 
off because this axle nut has to be
removed<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:12.950> to<00:00:13.950> make<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> job<00:00:14.610> easy<00:00:15.260> the<00:00:16.260> way

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
spring I took it off it and then I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.670 
spring I took it off it and then I
usually<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.040> car<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.370> got<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> pop<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.149> in

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
usually on this car we got to pop it in

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
usually on this car we got to pop it in
but<00:00:40.680> not<00:00:40.920> all<00:00:41.129> cars<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.790> them<00:00:42.000> though<00:00:42.239> well

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
but not all cars have them though well

but not all cars have them though well
the<00:00:42.960> steel<00:00:43.260> wheels<00:00:43.559> don't<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.129> them<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.520> you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the steel wheels don't have them so you

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
the steel wheels don't have them so you
don't<00:00:45.210> need<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.930> if<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.530> steel

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
don't need to do that if you have steel

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.790 
don't need to do that if you have steel
wheels<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.270> I'm<00:00:48.420> doing<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.590> make

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.850 

and<00:01:30.299> maybe<00:01:31.790> but<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.030> again<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.689> also<00:01:34.439> make

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
and maybe but then again I also make

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.510 
and maybe but then again I also make
sure<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.570> if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.170> good<00:01:37.470> quality<00:01:37.770> tools

sure that if you have good quality tools
there's<00:01:39.360> guaranteed<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.590> come<00:01:40.799> off<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.400> way

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
there's guaranteed to come off this way

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.380 
there's guaranteed to come off this way
it<00:01:41.880> happen<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.720> worked<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.350> me<00:01:43.530> every<00:01:44.070> time

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
it happen it worked for me every time

to<00:04:41.930> deface<00:04:42.920> this<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:44.330> make<00:04:44.510> it<00:04:44.690> harder<00:04:45.050> for

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
to deface this and make it harder for

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.190 
to deface this and make it harder for
you<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.350> put<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.740> back<00:04:45.890> on<00:04:46.720> you<00:04:47.720> know<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:47.900> could

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
you to put it back on you know you could

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.390 
you to put it back on you know you could
probably<00:04:48.410> use<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.680> piece<00:04:49.010> of<00:04:49.040> wood<00:04:49.370> or

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
probably use a piece of wood or

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.400 
probably use a piece of wood or
something<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.300> avoid<00:04:50.390> it<00:04:50.750> but<00:04:50.960> did<00:04:51.200> this

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
something to avoid it but did this

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.460 
something to avoid it but did this
hammer<00:04:51.740> is<00:04:52.010> great<00:04:52.370> for<00:04:52.640> this<00:04:52.760> job<00:04:53.120> that's<00:04:53.870> left

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
hammer is great for this job that's left

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.130 
hammer is great for this job that's left
usually<00:04:55.220> doesn't<00:04:55.490> Nutan<00:04:56.000> that<00:04:56.270> much<00:04:56.510> pounding

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
usually doesn't Nutan that much pounding

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.290 
usually doesn't Nutan that much pounding
those<00:04:57.290> not<00:04:57.590> too<00:04:57.830> much<00:04:58.810> yeah<00:05:00.250> now<00:05:01.250> now<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.120> just

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
those not too much yeah now now I just

got<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:02.750> remove<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.470> bolts<00:05:04.010> in<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.840> back<00:05:06.080> of

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
got to remove the bolts in the back of

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.890 
got to remove the bolts in the back of
this<00:05:06.620> that<00:05:07.580> I<00:05:07.610> remove<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.150> four<00:05:08.510> that

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
this that I remove the four that

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.020 
this that I remove the four that
that<00:05:10.320> one<00:05:12.050> this<00:05:13.050> one<00:05:13.320> as<00:05:13.530> well<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:16.380> one<00:05:16.650> and

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
that one this one as well that one and

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.110 
that one this one as well that one and
then<00:05:18.030> go<00:05:18.509> on<00:05:18.660> down<00:05:18.690> here<00:05:19.289> four<00:05:20.039> bolts<00:05:20.520> that

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
then go on down here four bolts that

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.610 
then go on down here four bolts that
holding<00:05:21.750> this<00:05:22.500> entire<00:05:23.039> hub<00:05:23.430> together<00:05:24.620> it's

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
holding this entire hub together it's

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.300 
holding this entire hub together it's
four<00:05:25.919> bolt<00:05:26.220> but<00:05:26.850> this<00:05:27.150> fondle<00:05:27.840> on<00:05:28.169> the<00:05:28.830> upper

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
four bolt but this fondle on the upper

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.460 
four bolt but this fondle on the upper
left<00:05:30.060> that's<00:05:30.630> going<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:30.960> be<00:05:31.139> a<00:05:31.169> little

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
left that's going to be a little

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.969 
left that's going to be a little
trickier<00:05:32.100> to<00:05:32.340> do<00:05:32.660> because<00:05:33.660> I<00:05:34.199> cannot<00:05:34.620> really

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
trickier to do because I cannot really

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.460 
trickier to do because I cannot really
access<00:05:35.639> it<00:05:35.880> really<00:05:36.240> well<00:05:36.449> because<00:05:36.690> this<00:05:37.169> gets

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
access it really well because this gets

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.680 
access it really well because this gets
in<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.710> way<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:40.650> I<00:05:40.680> may<00:05:41.009> have<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.370> actually

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
in the way so I may have to actually

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.350 
in the way so I may have to actually
remove<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:43.169> remove<00:05:43.350> this<00:05:43.910> entire<00:05:44.910> assembly

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
remove and remove this entire assembly

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.529 
remove and remove this entire assembly
some<00:05:46.169> but<00:05:46.740> as<00:05:47.070> of<00:05:47.310> right<00:05:47.340> now<00:05:47.490> I've<00:05:47.940> used<00:05:47.970> this

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
some but as of right now I've used this

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:54.439 
some but as of right now I've used this
wrench<00:05:49.070> to<00:05:50.070> loosen<00:05:50.539> the<00:05:51.539> bolts<00:05:52.250> there<00:05:53.449> that

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
wrench to loosen the bolts there that

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.439 
wrench to loosen the bolts there that
support<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.229> hub<00:05:55.470> and<00:05:55.860> I'm<00:05:56.850> able<00:05:57.060> to<00:05:57.210> access

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
support the hub and I'm able to access

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.230 
support the hub and I'm able to access
three<00:05:58.020> of<00:05:58.169> them<00:05:58.350> using<00:05:58.770> this<00:05:59.010> but<00:05:59.850> I<00:05:59.880> may<00:06:00.120> have

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
three of them using this but I may have

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.300 
three of them using this but I may have
to<00:06:00.389> use<00:06:00.510> a<00:06:00.539> special<00:06:00.930> tool<00:06:01.470> for<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.919> other<00:06:02.070> one

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
to use a special tool for the other one

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.420 
to use a special tool for the other one
now<00:06:02.849> about<00:06:03.270> this<00:06:03.630> bolt<00:06:04.080> since<00:06:04.740> you<00:06:04.979> cannot

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430

more like more in here or or for what I
did<00:06:19.740> is<00:06:19.949> I<00:06:20.160> just<00:06:20.270> used<00:06:21.270> a<00:06:21.539> ratchet<00:06:22.289> like<00:06:22.710> this<00:06:23.039> a

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
did is I just used a ratchet like this a

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.409 
did is I just used a ratchet like this a
short<00:06:24.000> a<00:06:24.210> shallow<00:06:24.539> socket<00:06:25.400> 17<00:06:26.400> millimeter<00:06:26.909> to

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
short a shallow socket 17 millimeter to

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.370 
short a shallow socket 17 millimeter to
access<00:06:28.080> this<00:06:28.830> one<00:06:29.130> in<00:06:29.310> to<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:30.050> since<00:06:31.050> there's

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
access this one in to and since there's

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.370 
access this one in to and since there's
not<00:06:31.680> enough<00:06:32.010> clearance<00:06:32.360> because<00:06:33.360> of<00:06:33.690> this

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
not enough clearance because of this

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.100 
not enough clearance because of this
axle<00:06:35.130> being<00:06:35.370> in<00:06:35.460> the<00:06:35.580> way<00:06:35.789> I<00:06:35.820> cannot<00:06:36.449> put<00:06:36.870> the

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
axle being in the way I cannot put the

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.790 
axle being in the way I cannot put the
ratchet<00:06:38.099> in<00:06:38.310> here<00:06:38.880> because<00:06:39.500> Axel's<00:06:40.500> in<00:06:40.680> the

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
ratchet in here because Axel's in the

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.820 
ratchet in here because Axel's in the
way<00:06:41.030> so<00:06:42.030> what<00:06:42.330> I<00:06:42.360> do<00:06:42.510> is<00:06:42.990> I<00:06:43.139> just<00:06:43.169> get<00:06:43.620> one<00:06:43.800> of

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
way so what I do is I just get one of

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.839 
way so what I do is I just get one of
these<00:06:44.630> extenders<00:06:45.630> and<00:06:46.039> I<00:06:47.039> just<00:06:47.310> throw<00:06:47.580> it<00:06:47.639> in

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
these extenders and I just throw it in

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:49.820 
these extenders and I just throw it in
there<00:06:48.060> and<00:06:48.210> now<00:06:48.630> there's<00:06:48.930> enough<00:06:49.260> clearance

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
there and now there's enough clearance

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:56.029 
there and now there's enough clearance
so<00:06:50.699> I<00:06:50.760> could<00:06:51.000> put<00:06:51.240> this<00:06:51.539> in<00:06:51.810> here<00:06:54.770> well<00:06:55.770> I<00:06:55.800> just

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
so I could put this in here well I just

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.810 
so I could put this in here well I just
finished<00:06:56.669> removing<00:06:57.330> all<00:06:57.630> four<00:06:58.050> bolts<00:06:58.820> now

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
finished removing all four bolts now

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.099 
finished removing all four bolts now
this<00:07:00.180> one<00:07:00.419> is<00:07:00.510> ready<00:07:00.840> to<00:07:01.080> be<00:07:01.260> pounded<00:07:01.949> off
