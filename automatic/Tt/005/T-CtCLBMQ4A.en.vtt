to you by ram kings now when i first
played<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.480> map<00:00:15.660> i<00:00:15.870> was<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> little<00:00:16.859> bit

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
played this map i was a little bit

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.920 
played this map i was a little bit
skeptical<00:00:17.520> because<00:00:17.670> i<00:00:17.910> didn't<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.720> about

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
skeptical because i didn't know about

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.170 
skeptical because i didn't know about
filters<00:00:19.500> which<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.400> state<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.820> talked<00:00:21.000> about

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
filters which of state that talked about

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.029 
filters which of state that talked about
before<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.810> previous<00:00:22.170> videos<00:00:22.439> however<00:00:22.800> i

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
before in previous videos however i

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.200 
before in previous videos however i
think<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.400> filter<00:00:23.699> worked<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:23.970> pretty<00:00:24.060> well

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
think the filter worked out pretty well

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.609 
think the filter worked out pretty well
on<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.420> map<00:00:24.600> now<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> free<00:00:25.380> roam

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
on this map now it is a free roam

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.779

infection map and haha i love infection
as<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.029> guys<00:00:30.179> probably<00:00:30.449> already<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:31.380> i<00:00:31.410> know

a lot of you guys are big infection fans

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.270 
a lot of you guys are big infection fans
but<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.260> again<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.469> lot<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.800> guys<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.070> not

but then again a lot of you guys are not
infection<00:00:35.700> events<00:00:35.940> however<00:00:36.090> i'm<00:00:36.239> trying<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
infection events however i'm trying to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.940 
infection events however i'm trying to
give<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.630> guys<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> little<00:00:36.989> balance<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.860> what

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
give you guys a little balance of what

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
give you guys a little balance of what
I'm<00:00:38.070> bringing<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.640> tend<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.210> kind<00:00:39.540> of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
I'm bringing out I just tend to kind of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.569 
I'm bringing out I just tend to kind of
gravitate<00:00:40.350> towards<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.430> these

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
gravitate towards more of these

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
gravitate towards more of these
infection<00:00:42.030> maps<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:43.079> thought<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.620> this

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
infection maps and I thought that this

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
infection maps and I thought that this
infection<00:00:44.309> map<00:00:44.460> was<00:00:44.670> done<00:00:44.820> particularly<00:00:45.239> well

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
infection map was done particularly well

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.260 
infection map was done particularly well
there<00:00:46.410> has<00:00:46.559> been<00:00:46.739> quite<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.129> few<00:00:47.460> journey<00:00:48.000> maps

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
there has been quite a few journey maps

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.750 
there has been quite a few journey maps
as<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> late<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> thought<00:00:50.129> maybe<00:00:50.190> I'd<00:00:50.579> give

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
as of late so I thought maybe I'd give

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.240 
as of late so I thought maybe I'd give
you<00:00:50.850> guys<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.270> option<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.289> refreshing<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you guys the option of refreshing it and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
you guys the option of refreshing it and
bringing<00:00:53.550> some<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:53.850> life<00:00:54.180> into<00:00:54.449> free

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
bringing some more life into free

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.260 
bringing some more life into free
roaming<00:00:55.410> infection<00:00:55.890> maps<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
roaming infection maps because it is a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420 
roaming infection maps because it is a
fun<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.899> mean<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.469> being<00:00:58.680> forgotten<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
fun I mean it's being forgotten it is a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639 
fun I mean it's being forgotten it is a
fun<00:00:59.730> genre<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.480> infection<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.170> think

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
fun genre of infection that I think

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.869 
fun genre of infection that I think
people<00:01:01.680> should<00:01:01.890> start<00:01:02.129> trying<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.399> play<00:01:02.670> again

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
people should start trying to play again

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
people should start trying to play again
nonetheless<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.170> we're<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.619> talking

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
nonetheless so we're going to be talking

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.230 
nonetheless so we're going to be talking
about<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.280> map<00:01:05.519> which<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:05.970> very

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
about this map which I was very

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
about this map which I was very
impressed<00:01:06.420> by<00:01:06.810> I've<00:01:07.619> always<00:01:07.799> been<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.130> sucker

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
one thing I found out well playing this

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.690 
one thing I found out well playing this

of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> map<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> tiny<00:02:11.489> bit<00:02:11.790> of

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
of the map there is a tiny bit of

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.300 
of the map there is a tiny bit of
flashing<00:02:12.450> but

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
flashing but

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.770 
flashing but
I wasn't<00:02:13.550> really<00:02:13.790> gonna<00:02:13.880> hold<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.330> too<00:02:14.569> much

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
I wasn't really gonna hold that too much

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.660 
I wasn't really gonna hold that too much
against<00:02:15.290> him<00:02:15.440> because<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.800> did<00:02:16.250> really<00:02:16.520> enjoy

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
against him because I did really enjoy

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.400 
against him because I did really enjoy
the<00:02:17.000> aesthetics<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.599> maps<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.080> sometimes

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the aesthetics of the maps and sometimes

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.780 
the aesthetics of the maps and sometimes
you<00:02:18.560> gotta<00:02:18.709> make<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.890> sacrifice<00:02:19.099> plus<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
you gotta make a sacrifice plus the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.460 
you gotta make a sacrifice plus the
flashing<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.239> only<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.510> back<00:02:20.690> corner<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.290> I

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
flashing is only in back corner so I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.229 
flashing is only in back corner so I
wasn't<00:02:21.980> too<00:02:22.160> concerned<00:02:22.280> about<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:22.970> only

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
wasn't too concerned about it only

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.850 
wasn't too concerned about it only
affected<00:02:23.630> me<00:02:23.750> maybe<00:02:23.930> once<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.530> that's<00:02:24.650> when<00:02:24.770> I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
affected me maybe once and that's when I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.949 
affected me maybe once and that's when I
was<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.010> Islam<00:02:25.400> be<00:02:25.580> flying<00:02:25.849> into<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> map<00:02:26.420> so

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
was like Islam be flying into the map so

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.570 
was like Islam be flying into the map so
I<00:02:27.020> wasn't<00:02:27.200> really<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.590> worrying<00:02:28.340> where<00:02:28.459> that

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
I wasn't really a worrying where that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.540 
I wasn't really a worrying where that
too<00:02:28.700> much<00:02:28.849> but<00:02:29.090> as<00:02:29.239> you<00:02:29.480> can<00:02:29.599> see<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
too much but as you can see just the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.759 
too much but as you can see just the
buildings<00:02:31.550> themselves<00:02:31.610> are<00:02:32.060> very<00:02:32.420> very

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
buildings themselves are very very

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.780 
buildings themselves are very very
aesthetically<00:02:33.769> pleasing<00:02:33.890> they<00:02:34.370> all<00:02:34.519> look

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
aesthetically pleasing they all look

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
good it's really got this nice destroyed

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.410 
good it's really got this nice destroyed
feel<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.700> can<00:02:37.819> actually<00:02:37.970> feel<00:02:38.239> like<00:02:38.330> these

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
feel you can actually feel like these

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.690 
feel you can actually feel like these
buildings<00:02:38.840> have<00:02:38.870> started<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.260> decay<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.860> rot

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
buildings have started to decay and rot

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.580 
buildings have started to decay and rot
apart<00:02:41.120> which<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.450> like<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:42.530> a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
apart which I like I like it's a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.630 
apart which I like I like it's a
different<00:02:42.860> type<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.130> destruction<00:02:43.489> that

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
different type of a destruction that

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.130 
different type of a destruction that
he's<00:02:43.790> done<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.209> thought<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.870> looked<00:02:44.900> really

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
he's done I thought it looked really

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.900 
he's done I thought it looked really
good<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.620> see<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.400> every<00:02:46.670> building

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
good you can see just on every building

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.640 
good you can see just on every building
it's<00:02:47.299> really<00:02:47.690> taking<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:48.019> hit<00:02:48.140> from<00:02:48.260> maybe<00:02:48.500> an

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
it's really taking a hit from maybe an

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.380 
it's really taking a hit from maybe an
earthquake<00:02:48.739> they<00:02:49.160> went<00:02:49.310> through<00:02:49.489> here<00:02:49.760> or<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
earthquake they went through here or a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.270 
earthquake they went through here or a
giant<00:02:50.840> fat<00:02:51.230> zombie<00:02:51.530> that's<00:02:51.860> sat<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.130> one<00:02:52.160> of

giant fat zombie that's sat on one of
the<00:02:52.370> buildings<00:02:52.670> if<00:02:53.090> we<00:02:53.180> take<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.360> look<00:02:53.420> inside

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
the buildings if we take a look inside

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.420 
the buildings if we take a look inside
of<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.470> can<00:02:54.500> see<00:02:54.620> there's<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.190> so

of this one you can see there's just so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.800 
of this one you can see there's just so
many<00:02:55.549> levels<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:56.390> many<00:02:56.510> different<00:02:56.690> places

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
many levels in so many different places

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.050 
many levels in so many different places
do<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> hideout<00:02:57.620> I'm<00:02:57.920> now<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.400> area<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.910> map
