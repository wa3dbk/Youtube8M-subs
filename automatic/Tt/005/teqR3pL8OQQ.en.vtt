00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.630 
right on the bottom it's the same way
with<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.410> I<00:02:21.440> don't<00:02:21.530> think<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.310> would<00:02:22.460> help

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
with this so I don't think it would help

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.310 
with this so I don't think it would help
to<00:02:23.170> try<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> stir<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.050> butter

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
to try to stir it in to the butter

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.530 
to try to stir it in to the butter
before<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.980> put<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.610> canner<00:02:28.910> because

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
before you put it in the canner because

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.240 
before you put it in the canner because
even<00:02:29.900> at<00:02:30.080> when<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.410> comes<00:02:30.590> out<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.920> canner

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
even at when it comes out of the canner

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.220 
even at when it comes out of the canner
and<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:31.550> shake<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:31.850> up<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:32.750> settles

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
and you shake it up it just settles

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.630 
and you shake it up it just settles
right<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.620> bottom<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.190> got<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.370> keep

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
right to the bottom you just got to keep

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.070 
right to the bottom you just got to keep
shaking<00:02:35.680> takes<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.800> lot<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.040> shakin<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:41.080> the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
shaking takes a lot of shakin but the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.330 
shaking takes a lot of shakin but the
the<00:02:43.040> one<00:02:43.280> third<00:02:43.730> cup<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:44.390> honey<00:02:44.650> was<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:46.190> was

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
the one third cup of honey was it was

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.010 
the one third cup of honey was it was
pretty<00:02:46.580> good<00:02:46.850> i<00:02:46.910> just<00:02:47.090> wanted<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.660> little<00:02:47.690> bit

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
how that's going to taste but you can

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.580 
how that's going to taste but you can
see<00:03:01.640> though<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.880> still<00:03:05.270> not<00:03:05.540> set<00:03:05.989> up<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:06.470> you

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
see though it's still not set up but you

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.790 
see though it's still not set up but you

just can't get that shaken off at the
bottom<00:03:10.720> even<00:03:11.720> when<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.020> was<00:03:12.140> still<00:03:12.350> hot<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.640> it

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.229 
bottom even when it was still hot and it
was<00:03:14.120> really<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.840> liquid<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:16.580> was<00:03:16.760> still<00:03:16.970> stuck

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
was really the liquid it was still stuck

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.610

goo<00:03:19.459> on<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.790> bottom<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.910> that<00:03:24.459> might<00:03:25.459> be<00:03:25.489> a

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
goo on the bottom so that might be a

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.600 
goo on the bottom so that might be a
