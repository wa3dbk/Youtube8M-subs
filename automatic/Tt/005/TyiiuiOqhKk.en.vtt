00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.380 
second coat on and they're quite dark
you<00:01:50.890> can<00:01:51.040> still<00:01:51.250> see<00:01:51.430> through<00:01:51.610> them<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:52.000> little

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
you can still see through them a little

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.670 
you can still see through them a little
bit<00:01:52.479> more<00:01:52.690> than<00:01:52.869> than<00:01:53.170> what<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.380> camera<00:01:53.619> is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
bit more than than what the camera is

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.260 
bit more than than what the camera is
actually<00:01:53.770> showing<00:01:54.130> up<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.790> we<00:01:54.939> will<00:01:55.090> go<00:01:55.240> over

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
actually showing up and we will go over

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.050 
actually showing up and we will go over
again<00:01:55.630> with<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.960> third<00:01:56.140> coat<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.939> I'll

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
again with the third coat and and I'll

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.110 
again with the third coat and and I'll
get<00:01:58.720> back<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:58.990> again

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.360 

again<00:02:04.120> this<00:02:04.960> is<00:02:05.170> not<00:02:05.500> as<00:02:05.650> dark<00:02:05.920> as<00:02:06.130> what<00:02:06.280> it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
again this is not as dark as what it

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.760 
again this is not as dark as what it
looks<00:02:06.580> but<00:02:06.910> you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:09.720> still<00:02:10.720> see<00:02:10.990> through<00:02:11.200> I'm

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
looks but you can still see through I'm

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.870 
looks but you can still see through I'm
just<00:02:12.010> gonna<00:02:12.100> leave<00:02:12.280> them<00:02:12.370> like<00:02:12.490> this<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.730> is

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
just gonna leave them like this this is

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.990 
just gonna leave them like this this is
a<00:02:12.940> third<00:02:13.150> coat<00:02:14.010> looks<00:02:15.010> fine<00:02:15.250> obviously<00:02:15.460> still

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
a third coat looks fine obviously still

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.580 
a third coat looks fine obviously still
wet<00:02:16.180> because<00:02:16.390> they're<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.690> shiny<00:02:16.900> but<00:02:17.500> what

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
wet because they're so shiny but what

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.280 
wet because they're so shiny but what
we'll<00:02:17.710> do<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:17.950> we'll<00:02:18.070> wait<00:02:18.640> for<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:20.260> dry

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
we'll do is we'll wait for that to dry

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.470 
we'll do is we'll wait for that to dry
off<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.860> should<00:02:20.890> go<00:02:21.190> dull<00:02:21.400> when<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.120> dries<00:02:22.300> I'm

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
off it should go dull when it dries I'm

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.240 
off it should go dull when it dries I'm
pretty<00:02:22.660> sure<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.350> haven't<00:02:23.710> actually<00:02:23.890> sprayed

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
pretty sure I haven't actually sprayed

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.460 
pretty sure I haven't actually sprayed
with<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.550> nice<00:02:24.700> shades<00:02:24.970> before<00:02:25.120> but<00:02:25.540> it

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
with this nice shades before but it

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.170 
with this nice shades before but it
should<00:02:26.650> go<00:02:26.770> dull<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.190> then<00:02:27.610> once<00:02:27.790> that's<00:02:27.910> dull

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
should go dull and then once that's dull

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.540 
should go dull and then once that's dull
what<00:02:28.390> we'll<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.660> we'll<00:02:29.610> grab<00:02:30.870> some<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.290> pack

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
I guess I'm been roughly 40 now is that

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.680 
I guess I'm been roughly 40 now is that
probably<00:03:12.580> safe<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:12.940> mean<00:03:13.060> I'm<00:03:13.330> probably<00:03:13.570> a

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
probably safe I mean I'm probably a

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.540 
probably safe I mean I'm probably a
little<00:03:13.720> bit<00:03:13.930> more<00:03:13.959> pretty<00:03:14.200> 14<00:03:14.620> -<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:15.040> know<00:03:15.400> it

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
little bit more pretty 14 - I know it

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.660 
little bit more pretty 14 - I know it
obviously<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.810> 2-pack<00:03:17.140> clear<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:18.100> now<00:03:18.519> on

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
little bit it's over there they are

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.570 
little bit it's over there they are
anyway

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.670 

anyway<00:03:33.580> certainly<00:03:33.970> quite<00:03:34.630> honest<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.260> kind<00:03:35.650> of

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
anyway certainly quite honest I kind of

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.890 
anyway certainly quite honest I kind of
wanted<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.920> keep<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.250> factory<00:03:36.660> sort<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.750> look

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
wanted to keep that factory sort of look

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.240 
wanted to keep that factory sort of look
but<00:03:38.170> just<00:03:39.240> make<00:03:40.240> sure<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.510> they<00:03:40.780> actually<00:03:41.250> to

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
but just make sure that they actually to

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.640 
but just make sure that they actually to
look<00:03:42.460> good
