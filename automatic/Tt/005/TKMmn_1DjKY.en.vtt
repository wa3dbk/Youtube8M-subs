00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
so long in this game I think it at the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.800 
so long in this game I think it at the
end<00:01:49.649> they<00:01:49.890> needed<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> 70<00:01:50.939> something<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.570> four

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
end they needed a 70 something for four

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.819

I saw it collapsed a bit after I died
the<00:01:56.040> first<00:01:56.189> time<00:01:56.460> because<00:01:56.729> my<00:01:56.880> adrenaline<00:01:56.939> was

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the first time because my adrenaline was

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.030 
the first time because my adrenaline was
pumping<00:01:57.329> because<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.170> flawless<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:58.920> so

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040

long I think end up going in the 60s I
was<00:02:02.460> 60<00:02:02.820> something<00:02:03.180> for<00:02:03.329> nothing<00:02:03.479> at<00:02:03.780> one

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
was 60 something for nothing at one

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.499

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
which it seems to be doing a lot I'll

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.920 
which it seems to be doing a lot I'll
pretty<00:02:17.819> much<00:02:17.880> all<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> time<00:02:18.239> if<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.630> do<00:02:18.690> and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
pretty much all the time if I do and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.229 
pretty much all the time if I do and
check<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.530> game<00:02:20.100> which<00:02:20.310> may<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:20.819> last<00:02:21.060> about

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
check it a game which may be last about

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.400 
check it a game which may be last about
10<00:02:21.450> minutes<00:02:21.569> on<00:02:21.720> domination<00:02:22.140> because<00:02:22.290> they

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
10 minutes on domination because they

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.680 
10 minutes on domination because they
usually<00:02:22.590> last<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.400> lot<00:02:23.580> longer<00:02:23.640> than<00:02:24.060> TDM<00:02:24.510> and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
usually last a lot longer than TDM and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.380 
usually last a lot longer than TDM and
it's<00:02:25.650> only<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.920> few<00:02:26.100> minutes<00:02:26.280> long<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:27.120> don't

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
it's only a few minutes long so I don't

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.449 
it's only a few minutes long so I don't
know<00:02:27.510> maybe<00:02:27.690> Trey<00:02:28.530> axe<00:02:28.709> fucked<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:29.130> somewhere

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
know maybe Trey axe fucked up somewhere

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.630 
know maybe Trey axe fucked up somewhere
but<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.810> past<00:02:30.959> I've<00:02:31.800> seen<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
but in the past I've seen it so it's the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.949 
but in the past I've seen it so it's the
full<00:02:32.790> game<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.390> don't<00:02:33.569> know<00:02:33.630> what's<00:02:33.780> going

full game so I don't know what's going

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.620 
full game so I don't know what's going
on<00:02:34.489> but<00:02:35.489> yeah<00:02:35.610> i'm<00:02:35.700> using<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.000> usual<00:02:36.480> kill

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.180 
on but yeah i'm using the usual kill
streaks<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.050> for<00:02:37.410> once<00:02:37.530> i<00:02:37.680> didn't<00:02:37.950> get<00:02:38.130> my

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
streaks and for once i didn't get my

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.250 
streaks and for once i didn't get my
chopper<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.180> same<00:02:39.360> time<00:02:39.569> as<00:02:39.630> my<00:02:39.959> dogs

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
chopper out at the same time as my dogs

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.890 
chopper out at the same time as my dogs
i<00:02:40.560> wanted<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.670> carry<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.269> getting<00:02:42.510> some<00:02:42.630> kills

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
i wanted to carry on getting some kills

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.680 
i wanted to carry on getting some kills
and<00:02:43.319> you<00:02:43.830> guys<00:02:43.950> has<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.850> suggested<00:02:45.450> that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
and you guys has have suggested that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.040 
and you guys has have suggested that
this<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.590> what<00:02:46.709> i<00:02:46.739> do<00:02:47.330> get<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.450> dogs<00:02:48.630> out<00:02:48.780> then

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
this is what i do get the dogs out then

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.570 
this is what i do get the dogs out then
get<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.319> chopper<00:02:49.620> out<00:02:49.680> after<00:02:49.980> they've<00:02:50.130> gone<00:02:50.340> I

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
get the chopper out after they've gone I

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.280 
get the chopper out after they've gone I
think<00:02:51.330> maybe<00:02:51.510> it's<00:02:51.720> probably<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.019> good<00:02:52.050> way<00:02:52.260> of

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
think maybe it's probably a good way of

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.320 
think maybe it's probably a good way of
doing<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.709> my<00:02:53.310> dogs<00:02:53.580> did<00:02:53.790> get<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> shitload<00:02:54.209> of

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
doing it my dogs did get a shitload of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.160 
doing it my dogs did get a shitload of
kills<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:56.569> now<00:02:57.569> i<00:02:57.600> get<00:02:57.780> my<00:02:57.870> chopper<00:02:58.110> I'll

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
kills and now i get my chopper I'll

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.479 
kills and now i get my chopper I'll

get quite a few kills in this chopper as
well<00:03:01.790> even<00:03:02.790> though<00:03:03.110> if<00:03:04.110> these<00:03:04.440> guys<00:03:04.590> any

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
well even though if these guys any

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.949 
well even though if these guys any
brains<00:03:05.069> they'd<00:03:05.280> just<00:03:05.459> stay<00:03:05.640> inside<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.269> hide

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
brains they'd just stay inside and hide

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.900 
brains they'd just stay inside and hide
away<00:03:07.160> but<00:03:08.160> clearly<00:03:08.400> they<00:03:08.519> don't<00:03:08.580> but<00:03:08.850> they

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
away but clearly they don't but they

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.960 
away but clearly they don't but they
were<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.480> spawn<00:03:10.319> in<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.620> good<00:03:10.769> place<00:03:10.940> they<00:03:11.940> I

were a spawn in a good place they I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.360
