00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.240
 how good yesterday we had a news 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.910
 incredible that the jailbreak of is to 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.320
 point to leave for ios 6.1 but that's not 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.570
 is the news of today I have them 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.820
 news related to videogames 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.169
 consoles and so on not the important one 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.610
 today that's why I have to do this 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.800
 very fast video recorded on the computer and 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.010
 everything and talking like fucking is drugged 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.420
 the point is that the beta has already been released 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.580
 or whatever you want to call crisis 3 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.380
 is available for xbox playstation and 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.060
 pc obviously do not have to do 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.190
 playstation plus net to download it I think 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.260
 that do have to be xbox live gold or 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.270
 whatever you call it to download it in the xbox and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.980
 on the pc, it's also free but 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.989
 obviously your pc has to be a PC 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.030
 that supports a game like crysis what 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.579
 it's a very heavy game in graphics in 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.100
 order this nothing else I wanted to give you that 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.680
 news because I get very excited right now 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.559
 they told me that if this one if it goes 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.420
 that already came out sorry is that I have to 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.100
 do this without cuts and all that and good 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.750
 I put it down then then right now 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.410
 I already have 21%, I think it's going to end 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.370
 to download 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.500
 very fast but it weighs 1.4 you get 1.5 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.120
 you arrive then you know you are 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.860
 internet is good no more or less how much 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.430
 they will take me will take less than 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.540
 half an hour now, but this is down 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.030
 then if you want to play with me in the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.830
 playstation I'll be fucking you 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.330
 all day until the end of the 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.910
 beta I think it's over in two weeks 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.760
 something like this from today that is 29 of 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.990
 January this then go down what 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.060
 add the playstation 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.700
 I'm a long 118 gave it to him with the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.979
 description and good because nothing else wanted 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.210
 give them that news I do not take advantage fast 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.640
 to talk about two other things very 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.080
 fast I'm using a new good not a 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.080
 microphone if the change is made a lot 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.390
 this one I'm friends like something short 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.070
 but then turn up the volume and achieve 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.360
 Now I want you to tell me how you hear 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.190
 all that because I do not even know 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.920
 ok but I want you to tell me how I am 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.930
 the volume the quality and so on 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.479
 The second thing is that with respect to 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.830
 play station now that I had updated 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.240
 that update the store made for 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.620
 to be able to download the game they are going to have to 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.990
 do the same 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.460
 and update the store and the store had 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.320
 a change of look completely not a 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.690
 changing look functionality all that 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.190
 and well then based on that I in my 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.900
 personal opinion is that if there is going to be a 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.270
 play station 4 you have to see the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.040
 store with precision 4 good to my only 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.719
 and unique 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.439
 idea of ​​why to say that it has to do 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:24.019
 something is because when it is not that 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.599
 store that store that here just 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.340
 put right now or whatever you call it is a 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.790
 store that seems very futuristic to me 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.519
 very very very I do not know I do not know just 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.409
 see it and you will see what I 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.859
 I mean more or less the point is that this 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.420
 store looks like that very different from the 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:45.290
 outdated not digital 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.790
 as they tell you the point is that I think 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.069
 that the store is designed for 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.810
 playstation 4 then that's why I think 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.859
 very likely that the playstation 4 yes 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.329
 come out in this one because it's supposed to be 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.629
 rumored that will come out as in Christmas 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.879
 of this year that is within about 11 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.549
 months something like that then nothing else 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.349
 I wanted to give you that opinion of this one 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.730
 of the playstation as it is called 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.220
 playstation 4 as they will call it 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.780
 orbis I think it's called right now 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.300
 Well, I just wanted to give you those 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.920
 those news run to really lower it 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.170
 I highly recommend this game if you never 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.510
 they have played it really play it for 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.940
 please once I ask you, I repeat, no 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.590
 compare it with several three or banfield 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.790
 four with what they want to compare or 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.760
 with call of duty is a game 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.980
 completely different from those two this 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.600
 just play it and see it as if 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.310
 they were game completely apart 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.920
 if you have not played it if you have already played 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.720
 simply because this because you know that 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.239
 it's price is then now yes that's 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.190
 everything either the 911 a locker and here I 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.500
 dismissal sorry for speaking like drugged and 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.280
 stutter a lot for talking so fast 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.280
 but here you will see us
