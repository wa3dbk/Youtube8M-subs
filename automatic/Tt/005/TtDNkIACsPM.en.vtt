00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone with you on the topic today to me 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.700
 This package arrived from Germany with 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.759
 inscription on the kingdoms goods from china 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.380
 in general, let's see what's there and so 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.910
 the guys talked with the developers of this 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.980
 same things quite a long time and is such 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.439
 sticks later and on the number of months she 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.609
 arrived in Ukraine is wireless 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.960
 charge 1 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.960
 built-in charging 2 and connect nicknames 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.670
 which will go to the back of the iPhone 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.140
 connect to latin in fact 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.550
 charge without any wires and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.260
 is it in this envelope 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.960
 Now we look at the whole thing 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.690
 I will tell you a little more detail about ratings 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.520
 later for now let's start with the first 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 forannan charger in the form of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.590
 rectangle hall nation 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.539
 Here are these two stubs in lightning 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.149
 that is, if we don't use nothing 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.760
 lightning this charge, you can simply 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.100
 protect the connector there is no dust 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.109
 got water and god forbid or else 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.670
 something also a little instruction 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.820
 how is that where the plugs go in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.489
 but this we know ourselves also goes to 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.990
 bundled usb cable which 1 again 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.729
 is connected to the computer by the second side 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.390
 charging just grief charging then 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.710
 running there is jesus foot I'm charging myself 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.060
 which nobody sachets 2 chicks 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.979
 get the age out let the charge itself 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.570
 very mark leaves finger only and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.030
 in general, we see that it is at 5 volts 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.920
 500 milliamps that is basically 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.079
 will be charged and the background will be on such a charge 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.119
 quite long but without wires with and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.770
 charging we figured out however iphone from 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.360
 it is not charged until sometime this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.579
 charging will not be connected to computer 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.470
 and strictly speaking on the iPhone will not 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.600
 go to which is in this 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.850
 envelope let's now unpack this 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.340
 object let's see what we have in 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.470
 complete just such a piece of paper on 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.630
 which is the instruction and the connector itself 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.719
 which will connect la king to 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.740
 iPhone and will be back as 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.009
 to pull out of experience everything is not broken 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.860
 somehow squeeze, let 's see here the connector itself 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.039
 he is very subtle and the scenario is very easy 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.680
 no form increase or do it 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.510
 harder to bend how it sat works 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.410
 love spell connector connected year 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.110
 as follows to boot 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.480
 all connectors must be pushed all the way 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.610
 vladin g and take cover any cover 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.550
 which we have today we measure 2 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.739
 it 's also this one 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:39.690
 does this whole thing work 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:41.010
 iphone in the case see that everything is in principle 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.940
 attracted however will be that small 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.090
 bulge because all the same this thing 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.380
 not fat but has your mouth and let's 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.510
 put the iphone on top and and see what 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.630
 charging went so let me move 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.190
 damn it all I went charge we can invest 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.160
 connector as soon as you want for example 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.170
 so here and again charging went then 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.820
 there is no matter how we put 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.890
 will charge and background wirelessly 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.570
 the main way is to connect and here 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.070
 this 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.680
 Adapter that fits kite 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.750
 Jesus is in grief charging through him 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.049
 home put the connector on under this 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.959
 snowflake that is, occasionally will go to any 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.090
 In case of trying all of these you take turns 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.549
 my shift of what I wear now 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.660
 most belts also chooses but it 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.190
 okay after all charging and 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.380
 the last third case is the thickest 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.090
 which was home connector sell 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.829
 a little crooked thrust there however i think 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.480
 it's okay now try 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.670
 put in the thickest case which 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.500
 I was on a bribe and we'll see 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.970
 to charge 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.280
 Yes, everything is fine, charging also leads then 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.859
 there we see that this convectors and this 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.380
 charger works with us with 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.960
 all kinds of covers of some of the thickest 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.360
 the thinnest in the case here, these 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.190
 and of course we have options this 2 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.940
 vip charger let's it 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.360
 we will unpack it in such 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.320
 square box circle this charger 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:18.580
 the device is round how to open does not 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:21.340
 break down eat and pull out a set of us 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:25.120
 exactly the same then that this instruction 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.510
 these plugs are a cable to connect 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.030
 computer itself charging which is very 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.710
 small and very circle and see how 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.540
 it will all work so guys by 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.220
 shoulder i am a second charger with 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.450
 using the hut computer and see what 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.000
 green light is on which 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.610
 shows that the device is ready 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.530
 what we uploaded to him iphone think 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.140
 one of these chargers 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.700
 will stand on the table so I come 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.980
 she slips no side because 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.810
 that there is such a thing about denin thing 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.640
 which does not allow to have to look for different 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.160
 I rather carry countries now 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.450
 than pushing take the iphone put and 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.190
 I went charging I think that this one 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.410
 build with you stand on my desk i 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.250
 I will come and so here and put 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.410
 phone on charge and charge using 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.620
 wireless device i think is all 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.870
 enjoy very easy very simple and 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.090
 pretty effective if you sat down 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.010
 for example the computer allows backgrounds and 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.300
 just sit iphone you don't need it 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.740
 lies out and charges 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.139
 and the last thing we have left with you 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.849
 talk it at the valuable roots and promised 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.610
 first talk about the collector who 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.979
 luggage is connected mgu it costs 21 euros 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.220
 This is a wireless charging in the form of 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.810
 a rectangle costs 25 euros and here it is 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.419
 here's a round wireless charging worth 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.539
 27 euros apparently due to its shape 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.669
 that she is small and so he and here she is 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.650
 the most expensive of all according to this 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.409
 expensive however it is very convenient to come 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.210
 set forgot left here for now i'm all 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.740
 spoke iphone was already born as much as 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.319
 three percent that is basically everything 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.330
 quickly everything is beautiful and most importantly all 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.250
 authorized pool this is your 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.659
 the battery does not deteriorate 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.539
 charge not to think that you are so 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:07.370
 use batteries on it all with you 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.930
 were those places for the first time subscribe to 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.909
 channel put your finger up because it's 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.039
 importantly thumbs up generally motivates on 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.449
 many reviews and there will be a future scientist 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.580
 so put your finger up subscribe 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.580
 on the channel and forget the clouds while
