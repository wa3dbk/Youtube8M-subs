8 war base anti 3 star and this
including<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> new<00:00:14.820> air<00:00:15.030> sweeper<00:00:15.540> as<00:00:15.719> well<00:00:16.020> as

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
including the new air sweeper as well as

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.400 
including the new air sweeper as well as
is<00:00:16.590> anti<00:00:17.100> dragon<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.570> main<00:00:18.720> idea<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.140> this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
is anti dragon the main idea of this

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.130 
is anti dragon the main idea of this
base<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.680> not<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.340> get<00:00:20.460> 3<00:00:20.730> stars<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.869> got<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
base is not to get 3 stars and I got the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.590 
base is not to get 3 stars and I got the
air<00:00:22.260> sweeper<00:00:22.740> sweep<00:00:23.070> pointing<00:00:23.939> down<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.449> way

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
air sweeper sweep pointing down that way

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.269 
air sweeper sweep pointing down that way
it<00:00:24.720> covers<00:00:24.960> both<00:00:25.170> these<00:00:25.380> air<00:00:25.590> defense<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.160> they

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it covers both these air defense so they

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.040 
it covers both these air defense so they
have<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> attack<00:00:26.789> from<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> top<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.480> they're

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
have to attack from the top and they're

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.259 
have to attack from the top and they're
at<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.470> they're<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> disadvantage<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.150> they

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
at it they're at a disadvantage so they

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
at it they're at a disadvantage so they
won't<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.570> able<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.900> 3<00:00:31.140> star<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.430> all

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
won't be able to 3 star with it with all

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.860 
won't be able to 3 star with it with all
dragons<00:00:33.149> if<00:00:33.390> they<00:00:33.630> attack<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> top<00:00:34.640> cuz

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
dragons if they attack from the top cuz

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.900

cuz I bottom Eric to defense and the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
cuz I bottom Eric to defense and the
Town<00:00:39.360> Hall<00:00:39.390> doesn't<00:00:39.870> really<00:00:40.020> matter<00:00:40.290> because
