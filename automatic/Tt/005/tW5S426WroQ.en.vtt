Tarzan swing when you're not using your

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.010 
Tarzan swing when you're not using your
pulley<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.300> black<00:00:42.540> strap<00:00:42.840> right

pulley you have this black strap right

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.600 
pulley you have this black strap right
here<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.559> use<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.190> slide<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> through

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
here you can use just slide it through

here you can use just slide it through
both<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> those<00:00:45.329> rungs<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.079> clips<00:00:46.469> up<00:00:48.950> all

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
both of those rungs and clips up all

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.660 
both of those rungs and clips up all
right<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.340> once<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> ladder

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
right so once we get to a ladder

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.220 
right so once we get to a ladder
each<00:00:53.670> beginning<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.570> each<00:00:54.660> site<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.079> have

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
each beginning of each site we do have

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
each beginning of each site we do have
these<00:00:55.350> ladders<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:56.670> attach<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> safety

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
these ladders to attach to the safety

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.709 
these ladders to attach to the safety
system<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.350> called<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.649> safety<00:00:59.420> stop<00:01:00.420> Paul

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
system this is called a safety stop Paul

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.319 
system this is called a safety stop Paul
I<00:01:00.899> apologize<00:01:01.320> um<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:02.340> works<00:01:02.489> exactly<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.149> does

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
from falling it works just like a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.000 
from falling it works just like a
seatbelt<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> fall<00:01:07.260> it'll<00:01:07.530> lock<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.830> on

signs before each of them so you can

are<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.840> know<00:02:55.870> we<00:02:56.110> have<00:02:56.230> different<00:02:56.849> different

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
obstacles for each one of them so it

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.350

that's<00:03:04.239> what<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.420> was<00:03:04.480> gonna<00:03:04.599> ask<00:03:04.750> like<00:03:05.170> is

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
that's what I was gonna ask like is

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.140 
that's what I was gonna ask like is
there<00:03:05.920> any<00:03:06.069> chance<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.549> might<00:03:06.700> get<00:03:06.880> stuck

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
there any chance you might get stuck

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.880 
there any chance you might get stuck
right<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.540> middle<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.200> don't<00:03:08.380> swing

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
right in the middle and you don't swing

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.740 
right in the middle and you don't swing
or<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.370> like<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.610> physics<00:03:10.030> question<00:03:10.510> that

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.150 

you<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:13.810> wait<00:03:14.139> you<00:03:14.350> swing<00:03:14.560> your<00:03:14.709> legs<00:03:14.950> to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
you just wait you swing your legs to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.520 
you just wait you swing your legs to
move<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:16.090> most<00:03:16.299> cases<00:03:16.569> if<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:17.019> are<00:03:17.230> stuck

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
move in in most cases if you are stuck

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.650 
move in in most cases if you are stuck
in<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.739> middle<00:03:17.980> it's<00:03:18.160> gonna<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.519> in<00:03:18.819> on<00:03:19.420> some

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
in the middle it's gonna be in on some

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.330 
in the middle it's gonna be in on some
of<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.810> harder<00:03:20.109> crossings<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.889> there's

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
of the harder crossings and there's

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.009 
of the harder crossings and there's
always<00:03:21.549> something<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.180> can<00:03:22.269> grab<00:03:22.750> onto

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
always something that you can grab onto

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.160 
always something that you can grab onto
and<00:03:26.670> times<00:03:27.670> they<00:03:27.880> do<00:03:28.030> this<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.750> actually<00:03:28.900> just

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
and times they do this is actually just

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.840 
and times they do this is actually just
one<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.889> different<00:03:30.190> types<00:03:30.310> of<00:03:30.400> crossings

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850

a<00:03:31.000> lot<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.299> them<00:03:31.389> will<00:03:31.510> have<00:03:31.540> planks<00:03:32.139> about<00:03:32.319> two

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
wires have planks between em so you're

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:44.580 
wires have planks between em so you're
