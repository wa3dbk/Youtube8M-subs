00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
rare dial office all versions so we have

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.430 
rare dial office all versions so we have
reason<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.390> believe<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:46.750> because<00:02:47.230> these

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
reason to believe that because these

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.530 
reason to believe that because these
were<00:02:47.680> late<00:02:47.920> mondo<00:02:48.490> actually<00:02:48.820> put<00:02:49.000> out<00:02:49.150> more<00:02:49.420> of

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
were late mondo actually put out more of

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.110 
were late mondo actually put out more of
these<00:02:49.720> than<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.800> standard<00:02:51.310> black<00:02:51.550> version

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
these than the standard black version

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.400 
these than the standard black version
and<00:02:52.300> we're<00:02:52.450> super<00:02:52.660> excited<00:02:53.200> about<00:02:53.230> that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
and we're super excited about that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.410 
and we're super excited about that
because<00:02:53.710> this<00:02:54.520> was<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.850> version<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.300> we

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
because this was the version that we

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.450 
because this was the version that we
were<00:02:55.540> hoping<00:02:55.750> for<00:02:55.960> so<00:02:56.560> here<00:02:56.800> we<00:02:56.890> have<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.220> B

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
were hoping for so here we have the B

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.880 
were hoping for so here we have the B
variant<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.180> actually<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.630> one<00:02:58.900> was<00:02:59.110> harder

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
variant and actually this one was harder

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.930 
variant and actually this one was harder
to<00:02:59.920> get<00:03:00.130> hold<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.930> initially<00:03:01.980> now<00:03:02.980> with<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
to get hold of initially now with the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.290 
to get hold of initially now with the
dial<00:03:04.210> office<00:03:04.480> or<00:03:04.630> variant<00:03:05.140> in<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.830> version

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
dial office or variant in the a version

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.910 
dial office or variant in the a version
they're<00:03:07.300> kind<00:03:07.570> of<00:03:07.630> about<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.020> same<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.620> terms

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
they're kind of about the same in terms

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.730 
they're kind of about the same in terms
of<00:03:09.280> rarity<00:03:10.120> but<00:03:10.840> you'll<00:03:10.990> see<00:03:11.200> what's<00:03:11.380> unique

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.659 
very much at all considering originally
I<00:05:53.560> was<00:05:53.680> looking<00:05:53.949> at<00:05:54.070> things<00:05:54.190> like<00:05:54.340> shadow

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
I was looking at things like shadow

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.610 
I was looking at things like shadow
boxes<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.419> frames<00:05:55.750> which<00:05:56.050> would<00:05:56.289> have<00:05:56.409> cost

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
boxes and frames which would have cost

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.100 
boxes and frames which would have cost
anything<00:05:56.919> up<00:05:57.190> to<00:05:57.340> a<00:05:57.370> hundred<00:05:57.820> pounds<00:05:58.270> so<00:05:58.419> if

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
anything up to a hundred pounds so if

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.959 
anything up to a hundred pounds so if
you<00:05:59.229> are<00:05:59.409> looking<00:05:59.710> for<00:05:59.949> a<00:06:00.130> way<00:06:00.460> to<00:06:00.520> display

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
you are looking for a way to display

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.240 
you are looking for a way to display
your<00:06:01.240> LPS<00:06:01.690> then<00:06:02.169> I<00:06:02.320> definitely<00:06:02.800> recommend<00:06:03.159> you

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
look at these they also have a nice

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.890 
look at these they also have a nice
handy<00:06:05.800> hanger<00:06:06.250> on<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.430> top<00:06:06.820> so<00:06:07.389> you<00:06:07.449> can<00:06:07.570> put

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
handy hanger on the top so you can put

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.480 
handy hanger on the top so you can put
them<00:06:08.020> on<00:06:08.110> your<00:06:08.289> wall<00:06:08.500> and<00:06:08.530> hang<00:06:08.919> them<00:06:09.070> on<00:06:09.190> hook

and have them on display so I think
