okay<00:00:30.580> so<00:00:30.730> after<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.180> cab<00:00:31.860> mention<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:32.950> filter

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
okay so after the cab mention the filter

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.000 
okay so after the cab mention the filter
as<00:00:34.720> you<00:00:34.840> can<00:00:34.930> see<00:00:34.990> the<00:00:35.080> filter<00:00:35.290> is<00:00:35.470> set<00:00:35.590> to<00:00:35.770> null

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
as you can see the filter is set to null

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.650 
as you can see the filter is set to null
so<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:37.840> using<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.700> filter<00:00:40.030> itself<00:00:40.150> but<00:00:40.600> I

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
so not using it the filter itself but I

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.200 
so not using it the filter itself but I
am<00:00:40.840> using<00:00:41.110> this<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.800> level<00:00:42.160> got<00:00:42.550> five<00:00:42.790> DP<00:00:43.150> D

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
am using this the level got five DP D

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:58.209 
am using this the level got five DP D
decrease<00:00:43.570> when<00:00:43.750> I<00:00:43.809> have<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.170> sustain<00:00:44.530> run

go to the delay

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.009 
go to the delay

by the way I paint a tempo button now
111<00:01:25.150> bpm<00:01:25.540> so<00:01:25.870> at<00:01:25.990> 111<00:01:26.440> bpm<00:01:27.570> okay<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:30.040> delay<00:01:30.510> is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
111 bpm so at 111 bpm okay the delay is

I'm actually setting the tempo to a
dotted<00:01:44.500> eighth<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:44.920> 111<00:01:45.400> bpm<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:46.330> there's<00:01:46.990> the

dotted eighth at 111 bpm and there's the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.650

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
time the next page modulation always

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.590 
time the next page modulation always
important<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.430> use<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.580> triangle<00:01:54.910> because

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
important I use the triangle because

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.370 
important I use the triangle because
that's<00:01:55.840> what<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:57.000> STD<00:01:58.000> 3000<00:01:58.600> Korg<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:59.140> think

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
that's what the STD 3000 Korg I think

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.380 
that's what the STD 3000 Korg I think
uses<00:01:59.650> a<00:01:59.740> triangle<00:02:00.160> model<00:02:00.430> I<00:02:02.520> always<00:02:03.520> set<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
uses a triangle model I always set the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.870 
uses a triangle model I always set the
tempo<00:02:04.810> such<00:02:05.680> that<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.100> rate<00:02:06.340> comes<00:02:06.729> out

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
tempo such that the rate comes out

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.320 
tempo such that the rate comes out
between<00:02:07.240> four<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.780> half<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.140> five<00:02:08.320> Hertz

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
between four and a half and five Hertz

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.730 
between four and a half and five Hertz
roughly<00:02:10.330> that's<00:02:10.510> about<00:02:10.810> what<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.050> do<00:02:11.140> for<00:02:11.620> all

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
roughly that's about what I do for all

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:25.050 
roughly that's about what I do for all

in the mix here forty four and a half
level<00:02:31.930> actually<00:02:32.170> increase<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.709> level<00:02:32.980> just

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
level actually increase the level just

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.650 
level actually increase the level just
to<00:02:33.250> balance<00:02:33.459> out<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.880> volumes<00:02:34.239> when<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.450> turn

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
to balance out the volumes when I turn

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.290 
to balance out the volumes when I turn

the<00:02:37.480> accent<00:02:37.870> seems<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.260> bring<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.560> levels

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
the accent seems to bring the levels

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.509 
the accent seems to bring the levels
down<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.370> little<00:02:39.400> bit<00:02:41.040> that's<00:02:42.040> not<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> big

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
down just a little bit that's not a big

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.740 
down just a little bit that's not a big
deal

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.660 

and<00:02:49.290> then<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.530> got<00:02:49.650> RiRi<00:02:50.010> verbs<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.580> we'd

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
and then you got RiRi verbs and we'd

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.930 
and then you got RiRi verbs and we'd
have<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.880> go<00:02:51.060> through<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:52.340> for<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.610> shiver

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
have to go through that for the shiver

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.580 
have to go through that for the shiver
this<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> best<00:02:54.630> shimmer<00:02:54.900> chain<00:02:55.200> I've<00:02:55.410> ever

this is the best shimmer chain I've ever

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.250 
this is the best shimmer chain I've ever
used<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.370> tweaked<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.720> got<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.170> be

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.850 
ninety-six 175 304 25 I used to spend a
ton<00:03:53.569> of<00:03:53.629> time<00:03:53.750> with<00:03:54.200> trying<00:03:54.709> different

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
combinations of that of those delay

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.970 
combinations of that of those delay
times<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.519> get<00:03:59.049> smooth<00:04:00.049> out<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.440> shimmer<00:04:00.680> and

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
times to get smooth out the shimmer and

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.490 
times to get smooth out the shimmer and
to<00:04:01.099> get<00:04:01.280> rid<00:04:01.430> of<00:04:01.459> little<00:04:02.019> crackling<00:04:03.019> artifacts

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
to get rid of little crackling artifacts

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.640 
to get rid of little crackling artifacts
but<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:05.450> was<00:04:05.629> the<00:04:05.780> best<00:04:05.959> combination<00:04:06.290> I

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
but and that was the best combination I

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.650 
but and that was the best combination I
could<00:04:06.829> come<00:04:06.950> up<00:04:06.980> with<00:04:07.129> but<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.209> still<00:04:08.480> wasn't

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
could come up with but it still wasn't

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.539 
could come up with but it still wasn't
perfect<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.739> way<00:04:09.859> I<00:04:09.890> smoothed<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.459> out

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
perfect and the way I smoothed it out

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.130 
perfect and the way I smoothed it out
was<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:10.879> turn<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.120> reverb<00:04:11.329> up<00:04:11.690> I'll<00:04:11.870> get<00:04:12.019> to

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
was to turn the reverb up I'll get to

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.849 
was to turn the reverb up I'll get to
that<00:04:12.170> in<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.440> minute

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859

good<00:04:26.690> hire<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.290> Knicks<00:04:27.500> just<00:04:28.430> want<00:04:28.580> all<00:04:28.639> the

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
good hire the Knicks just want all the

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.409 
good hire the Knicks just want all the
shimmer<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.090> come<00:04:29.210> out<00:04:29.330> essentially<00:04:31.360> this<00:04:32.360> is

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
shimmer to come out essentially this is

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.150 
shimmer to come out essentially this is
just<00:04:32.780> down<00:04:33.110> minus<00:04:33.440> one<00:04:33.650> because<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:33.919> was<00:04:33.980> doing

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
just down minus one because I was doing

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.379 
just down minus one because I was doing
some<00:04:34.430> minor<00:04:34.729> volume<00:04:35.720> level<00:04:36.020> tweaking<00:04:38.290> okay

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
some minor volume level tweaking okay

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.610 
some minor volume level tweaking okay
filter<00:04:41.389> is<00:04:41.510> just<00:04:41.720> in<00:04:41.900> here<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.139> cut<00:04:42.350> off<00:04:42.440> the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
filter is just in here to cut off the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.260 
filter is just in here to cut off the
highs<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:43.160> can<00:04:43.310> see<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.520> got<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.729> frequency

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
highs you can see I got a frequency

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.760 
highs you can see I got a frequency
low-pass<00:04:44.600> cut<00:04:44.930> off<00:04:45.050> there<00:04:45.320> at<00:04:45.729> 2600<00:04:46.729> because

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
low-pass cut off there at 2600 because

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.990 
low-pass cut off there at 2600 because
shimmer<00:04:48.770> sometimes<00:04:49.220> can<00:04:49.460> be<00:04:49.520> a<00:04:49.550> little<00:04:49.669> harsh

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
shimmer sometimes can be a little harsh

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.379 
shimmer sometimes can be a little harsh
so<00:04:50.930> this<00:04:51.190> cuts<00:04:52.190> off<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.669> harshness<00:04:53.000> at<00:04:53.330> the

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
so this cuts off the harshness at the

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.159 
so this cuts off the harshness at the
top<00:04:53.600> end

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.149 

and<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.770> reverb<00:04:59.039> this<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.400> really<00:04:59.669> important

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
and the reverb this is really important

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.800 
and the reverb this is really important
the<00:05:02.159> reverb<00:05:02.460> type<00:05:02.939> and<00:05:03.150> everything<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.539> not<00:05:03.689> as

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
the reverb type and everything is not as

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.119 
the reverb type and everything is not as
important<00:05:04.289> I<00:05:04.409> don't<00:05:04.560> really<00:05:04.770> have<00:05:04.889> to<00:05:04.979> go

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
important I don't really have to go

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.369 
important I don't really have to go
through<00:05:05.370> this<00:05:05.490> quickly<00:05:05.819> I<00:05:06.120> just<00:05:06.689> went<00:05:07.199> by<00:05:07.319> the

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
through this quickly I just went by the

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.920 
through this quickly I just went by the
default<00:05:07.919> in<00:05:08.129> the<00:05:08.249> acts<00:05:08.400> but<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.389> mix<00:05:09.659> is

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
default in the acts but the mix is

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.920 
default in the acts but the mix is
notice<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.710> mix<00:05:10.949> I<00:05:11.069> got<00:05:11.099> 76%<00:05:11.909> turn<00:05:12.779> that

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
notice the mix I got 76% turn that

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.939 
notice the mix I got 76% turn that
Knicks<00:05:13.199> up<00:05:13.379> to<00:05:13.650> smooth<00:05:14.069> out<00:05:14.249> the<00:05:14.430> shimmer<00:05:15.949> so

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
Knicks up to smooth out the shimmer so

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.559 
Knicks up to smooth out the shimmer so
you<00:05:17.039> can<00:05:17.159> have<00:05:17.279> that<00:05:17.400> anywhere<00:05:17.699> from<00:05:17.849> 75<00:05:18.539> to

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
you can have that anywhere from 75 to

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.209 
you can have that anywhere from 75 to
100<00:05:19.289> it<00:05:19.860> won't<00:05:20.069> sound<00:05:20.249> too<00:05:20.490> much<00:05:20.639> different<00:05:22.219> so

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
100 it won't sound too much different so

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.360 
100 it won't sound too much different so
that<00:05:23.729> will<00:05:23.909> give<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.150> very<00:05:24.389> smooth<00:05:25.370> shimmer

that will give you very smooth shimmer

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.300 
that will give you very smooth shimmer
sound<00:05:26.699> and<00:05:27.229> that<00:05:28.229> is<00:05:28.409> the<00:05:28.560> preset<00:05:28.919> for<00:05:29.189> my

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
amp with the hot plate it's pretty much

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.629 
amp with the hot plate it's pretty much
the<00:05:38.699> same<00:05:38.879> thing<00:05:39.180> but<00:05:39.979> there's<00:05:40.979> no<00:05:41.099> amp<00:05:41.310> or<00:05:41.460> cab

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
the same thing but there's no amp or cab

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.179 
the same thing but there's no amp or cab
model<00:05:41.969> in<00:05:42.090> it<00:05:42.180> as<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.360> can<00:05:42.539> see<00:05:42.979> it's<00:05:43.979> just

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:44.189 
model in it as you can see it's just

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:48.800 
model in it as you can see it's just
drive<00:05:44.520> delay<00:05:46.219> the<00:05:47.219> volume<00:05:47.610> control<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.479> the

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
drive delay the volume control and the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.230 
drive delay the volume control and the
shimmer<00:05:49.050> and<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.319> reverb<00:05:49.759> that's<00:05:50.759> what<00:05:51.000> I<00:05:51.029> did

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
shimmer and the reverb that's what I did

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.209 
shimmer and the reverb that's what I did
for<00:05:51.270> part<00:05:51.689> to<00:05:52.759> know<00:05:53.759> ampere<00:05:54.120> cab<00:05:54.300> model<00:05:55.219> and

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
for part to know ampere cab model and

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:03.350 
for part to know ampere cab model and
that<00:05:56.249> is<00:05:56.669> um<00:06:00.650> those<00:06:01.650> are<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:01.830> settings<00:06:02.360> or

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
that is um those are the settings or
