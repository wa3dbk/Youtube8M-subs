00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
around to buying it for some reason

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.109 
around to buying it for some reason
probably<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.640> only<00:01:32.880> way<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.030> could

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
probably because the only way I could

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.719 
probably because the only way I could
buy<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.810> online<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.549> about

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
palette but like I said earlier they're

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.700 
palette but like I said earlier they're
only<00:05:06.150> it's<00:05:06.450> only<00:05:06.630> five<00:05:06.870> dollars<00:05:07.140> right<00:05:07.380> now

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
only it's only five dollars right now

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.830

from<00:05:08.160> Target<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.210> you<00:05:09.330> could<00:05:09.450> probably<00:05:09.600> get

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
from Target and you could probably get

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.410 
from Target and you could probably get
it<00:05:09.960> at<00:05:10.050> eyes<00:05:10.200> lips<00:05:10.440> face<00:05:10.560> com<00:05:11.070> I'm<00:05:11.310> guessing<00:05:11.700> so

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
it at eyes lips face com I'm guessing so

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.850 
it at eyes lips face com I'm guessing so
this<00:05:12.630> one<00:05:12.780> is<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.020> more<00:05:13.200> neutral<00:05:13.500> one<00:05:13.680> they

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.320 
this one is the more neutral one they
also<00:05:14.040> have<00:05:14.400> one<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.670> has<00:05:14.700> like<00:05:14.910> a<00:05:14.970> little<00:05:15.120> bit

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
also have one that has like a little bit

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.450 
also have one that has like a little bit
brighter<00:05:15.540> colors<00:05:15.990> in<00:05:16.140> it<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:16.500> wasn't<00:05:17.370> as

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
interested in getting that one because I

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.480
