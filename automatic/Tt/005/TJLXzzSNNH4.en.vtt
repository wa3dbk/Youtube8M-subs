 I love to surprise you, though 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:46.300

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:17.349
 When doing it thoroughly 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.349
 We will give you an overwhelming romanticism that you can not say anything 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.410
 I have read in a book before 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.540
 Because the moon is not anyone 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.890
 Datte it can to anyone of those 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.530
 Let's quote that 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.410

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.310
 You will laugh 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.840
 But you know 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.630
 Imagine 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.310
 Two hands holding hands and walking slowly in the cold air 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:59.060
 Furthermore, the house shines moon

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.150
 Beautifully shining your 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.409

 Let's kiss you where the cold moonlight shines 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.960
 On the forehead 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.650
 The eyelids 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.800
 On your cheek 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.020
 And the wrist 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.680
 Because your moon shines in the sky 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.190
 The world will be yours 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:41.750
 After thinking so much, I laughed a little like that 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.140
 Small in the mouth so you can not hear you next door 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.890
