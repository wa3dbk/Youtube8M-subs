00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
thought it was pretty simple so I wasn't

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.040

sure<00:00:17.550> if<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.760> should<00:00:17.789> do<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> tutorial<00:00:18.480> or<00:00:18.869> not

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
sure if I should do the tutorial or not

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.050

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
single day as you can probably guess

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.740

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
which three I use um retrospec bronze

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.860 
which three I use um retrospec bronze
and<00:00:37.200> flu<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> those<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> three<00:00:39.540> colors

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
and flu so those are the three colors

40 oops efore tea and so here is new

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.259 
40 oops efore tea and so here is new
compared<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.070> e<00:03:24.100> 35<00:03:24.610> which<00:03:24.850> is<00:03:25.000> what<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.180> use

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
compared to the e 35 which is what I use

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.590 
compared to the e 35 which is what I use
so<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.320> can<00:03:26.500> tell<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:27.040> e-40<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:27.940> lot<00:03:28.360> larger

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
so you can tell the e-40 is a lot larger

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.130 
so you can tell the e-40 is a lot larger
and<00:03:29.049> fluffier<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.400> find<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.360> the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
and fluffier so I just find that the the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.170 
and fluffier so I just find that the the
e<00:03:32.170> 35<00:03:32.620> works<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:33.010> lot<00:03:33.220> better<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.730> your<00:03:33.760> crease

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
e 35 works a lot better in your crease

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.330 
e 35 works a lot better in your crease
so<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.690> think<00:03:34.900> it's<00:03:35.140> only<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.890> little<00:03:36.010> bit<00:03:36.190> maybe

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
so I think it's only a little bit maybe

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.560 
so I think it's only a little bit maybe
a<00:03:36.459> little<00:03:36.549> bit<00:03:36.730> more<00:03:36.880> than<00:03:37.030> like<00:03:37.180> ten<00:03:37.450> to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
a little bit more than like ten to

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.729 
a little bit more than like ten to
twelve<00:03:37.810> dollars<00:03:38.140> or<00:03:38.290> something<00:03:38.560> like<00:03:38.650> that

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
twelve dollars or something like that

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.130 
twelve dollars or something like that
for<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.190> for<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:39.580> brush<00:03:39.850> Oh<00:03:40.090> still<00:03:40.959> only

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
using two colors just kind of liked a

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.030 
using two colors just kind of liked a
bit<00:03:43.060> like<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.450> work<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.200> into<00:03:44.320> my<00:03:44.440> crease<00:03:44.769> and

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.470 
I like to really build the color and
make<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.410> look<00:03:47.650> really<00:03:48.070> dark<00:03:48.549> because<00:03:49.060> i<00:03:49.090> blend

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
make it look really dark because i blend

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.670 
make it look really dark because i blend
it<00:03:49.570> out<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.989> when<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.170> blend<00:03:50.380> out<00:03:50.530> your

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.039 
it out and when you blend out your
shadow<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.700> really<00:03:52.060> soften<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.600> look<00:03:52.750> and

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
shadow you really soften the look and

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.350 
shadow you really soften the look and
could<00:03:53.440> lose<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.709> lot<00:03:53.980> of<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.220> intensity<00:03:54.489> so

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
could lose a lot of the intensity so

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.780 
could lose a lot of the intensity so
I'll<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:55.510> kind<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:55.900> do<00:03:56.110> like<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.350> little<00:03:56.500> B<00:03:56.830> you

your<00:05:10.450> inner<00:05:10.660> corner<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:12.730> i<00:05:13.240> like<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.600> use<00:05:13.630> a

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
your inner corner and i like to use a

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.930 
your inner corner and i like to use a
lot<00:05:13.990> of<00:05:14.020> this<00:05:14.290> because<00:05:15.220> i<00:05:15.340> blend<00:05:15.550> it<00:05:15.640> out<00:05:15.790> like

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
i said and just I think it really

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.730 
i said and just I think it really
brightens<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.840> eye<00:05:19.930> is<00:05:20.050> when<00:05:20.290> you<00:05:20.380> bring<00:05:20.620> it

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
brightens the eye is when you bring it

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.950 
brightens the eye is when you bring it
up<00:05:20.830> onto<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.340> lid<00:05:21.490> like<00:05:21.640> this<00:05:21.880> i<00:05:24.780> will<00:05:25.780> just

up onto the lid like this i will just
lightly<00:05:26.860> run<00:05:27.130> it<00:05:27.250> under<00:05:27.430> my<00:05:27.580> eye<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:29.080> i'll

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
lightly run it under my eye and i'll

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.760 
lightly run it under my eye and i'll
just<00:05:29.350> on<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.830> edges<00:05:30.010> of<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.610> crease<00:05:31.590> blend<00:05:32.590> it

just on the edges of the crease blend it
all<00:05:32.890> out<00:05:33.130> this<00:05:33.520> is<00:05:33.669> where<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:33.940> lose<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.210> lot<00:05:34.419> of

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
all out this is where you lose a lot of

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.420 
all out this is where you lose a lot of
the<00:05:34.660> intensity<00:05:35.020> but<00:05:35.470> it's<00:05:36.040> all<00:05:36.100> you<00:05:36.190> want<00:05:36.370> to

to take my finger underneath because

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.510 
to take my finger underneath because
some<00:05:46.600> of<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:46.780> highlight<00:05:47.530> will<00:05:47.650> settle<00:05:48.340> in

that<00:05:48.700> little<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:49.000> line<00:05:49.300> that<00:05:49.450> we<00:05:49.600> all<00:05:49.690> kind<00:05:49.870> of

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
that little a line that we all kind of

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.159
