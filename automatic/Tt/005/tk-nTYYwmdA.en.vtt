00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.639
 welcome to austria for this new 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.010
 grand prix on the calendar finally new 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.679
 have done the new with old 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.960
 because my dear geromois I was able to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.150
 get out my mac cann and white beard 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.550
 because hellweg the circuit of the bone 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.949
 cheating as it was called at the time 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.660
 it was a legendary circuit of 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.849
 world championships it's a toboggan 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.820
 a very fast circuit so there was 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.510
 this spielberg modernization what we 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.430
 called the one ring and ain string in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.190
 austria and so this is the route that has 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.410
 been modernized and taken over by 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.260
 red bull obviously one of the drink 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.940
 energizing all-powerful in f1 like 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.340
 everyone knows that now has its own 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 great price you ran there in nude 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.239
 in promotional formulas the the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.579
 plot itself inspires what 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.289
 so I ran there on the old 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.829
 traced so at the time when it was still 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.989
 a ring in a chronic formula at all 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.409
 start at the very beginning of the car for 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.970
 me the year 2003 it is a choice of circuits 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.510
 why because actually simple 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.100
 toboggan 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.570
 so I think it's a choice of 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.580
 circuits too because we can have 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.759
 the saint cirq overruns we saw 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.229
 nice mommy f1 fights at the time is going 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.610
 this first braking that will even very 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.080
 later taught me to this second braking 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.790
 mounted in this third braking 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.250
 descent we arrived each time 2 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.720
 passes 2 7th in second so some 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.799
 8th speed overtaking opportunities 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.840
 and so 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.100
 and so here I think I think 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.170
 that he has a nice race now 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.140
 indeed it has evolved a lot and the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.439
 circuit the surroundings we go from 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.630
 barcelona monaco montreal to go to 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.189
 austria in the hygiene campaign so 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.079
 it's very different from the bodies a very 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.810
 different 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.970
 not too many distractions here I think of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.320
 mayor albeit with red bull me I think 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.180
 that we can expect maybe 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.860
 precisely because it in front 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.050
 a big party is maybe a 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.340
 exercise of style compared to their 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.600
 their marketing 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.990
 we know that red bull at this approach 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.560
 very very innovative a few steps from the 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.900
 business and the the events is going to be a 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.380
 show so it's true that I appreciate 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.090
 a lot 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.660
 Austria for its side 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.980
 almost country 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.160
 it's very bucolic it's a beautiful 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.750
 region the Styrian hills then 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.750
 the hotel industry obviously it's not the top 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 level but hey it's nice it's the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.480
 spring 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.530
 and then here are the girls are pretty I 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.940
 think they will be they will 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.780
 many because red bull is going 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.350
 definitely put the dishes 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.090
 in the big ones 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.800
 I think that in any case it is necessary 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.330
 hope it's true that it takes 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.410
 they do things he needs them he 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.020
 very good in general 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.340
 so I think we're going to have a nice 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.920
 great price so even if it's in a 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.750
 other decor and especially I think that there 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.670
 the center of attention is going on this 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.709
 nanny at the circuit this new track 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.050
 engineers have little data on this 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.209
 circuit so on this route 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.540
 it'll be interesting to see what they 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.770
 will do 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.290
 so exactly when when 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.300
 was apprehending a new circuit 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.790
 how is it prepared upstream 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.260
 what does it give in simulation 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.950
 see in the simulator on my sheet 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.400
 simulator 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.590
 then the first phase and the analysis of the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.209
 circuit so they will model not 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.390
 circulates but in every least 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.890
 details to the nearest centimeter after they 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.459
 are going to put that in the simulator we're going 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.530
 start a simulation job from 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.930
 simulation that today is pushed 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.700
 really very far away so finally 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.630
 we arrive on this new circuit as 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.900
 that pilot but even as 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.769
 that engineer with a lot 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.090
 information always point 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.650
 of questioning even though none of the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 surface and so on 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.269
 how will react tires that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.310
 has not had any tests but hey I think 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.570
 pirelli to all the experience that there is 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.000
 from experience and they certainly 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.340
 had the bottom bottom done tests in all 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.350
 case appointment information circuit but 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.430
 so at a big job upstream of in 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.140
 the simulation that makes that ultimately 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.030
 it's more so much more so 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.790
 new and between the virtual and the real 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.930
 finally what a difference in gold skis 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.930
 the big red button that makes 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.470
 crib we press it and we are 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.470
 new 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.880
 on this circuit no it's the difference 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.650
 inevitably it is that it remains of the 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.060
 simulation as a pilot ago 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.780
 some things we can not 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.400
 to feel in a simulator 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.350
 on the other hand at the technical level 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.700
 level of work on self all that one 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.410
 can really push things very 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.030
 very far a simulator of formula 1 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.430
 today we have a site in the car 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.290
 we can if I make a setting on the 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.810
 brake distribution on the differential 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.400
 on the engine brake 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.290
 I can do it and I will feel the 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.000
 difference so it's really very 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.710
 sharp as if we were in the right 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.170
 turn us into a real 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.030
 cockpit of the car and we do not see 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.760
 the difference my hockey committee incident 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.340
 well ben red bull ring so in principle 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.100
 obviously the icing on the cake for 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.660
 the seo mater zych is that the red 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.240
 bulls come back to the fore 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.400
 very complicated start of the season for red 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.570
 bull and vettel 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.419
 ricciardo besides who the 1 who has it 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.980
 teased how you start you feel 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.640
 evolution in this team there in 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.620
 particular 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.169
 it'll be interesting to see how 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.290
 they will succeed evolved during the 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.750
 season even so interesting I think 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.520
 half measure in the sense that they have 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.100
 evolved enormously from last four 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.450
 seasons they have a power of de 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.919
 development that is huge 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.210
 so there is no reason they 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.650
 can not come back to the level 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.050
 Now that would be made a mercedes 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.570
 nice advantage for the moment 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.190
 red bull and his hunters wing between 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.710
 quotation marks the first hunter behind 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.210
 behind mercedes 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.770
 there is a fight in house too we have 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.840
 saw anyway that vettel a little trouble 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.950
 as in robert's time and he has a 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.490
 little trouble in screaming bone flesh 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.979
 which is directly there it is certain the 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.810
 reaction we have not used to 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.400
 know at home but the situation is 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.470
 very different for four years he has 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.140
 he really dominated formulating a 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.970
 pause this pole a car that was I 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.440
 still thinks quite superior to 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.229
 others and maintenance is no longer the case 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.650
 so that's another situation and it's 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.000
 interesting to see how he will react 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.680
 I think that in any case internally this 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.540
 interesting to see that he leaves the 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.310
 opportunities to richardot to express themselves 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.600
 and it's good for the stable to have two 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.090
 drivers who grows who pushes in front 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.320
 especially now they dominate - so 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.030
 for dialing one of the Builders 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.320
 it's important to have two pilots who 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.030
 they deliver 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.260
 point result so how do 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.310
 world champions will behave themselves 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.550
 in adversity 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.550
 answer this weekend to spielberg
