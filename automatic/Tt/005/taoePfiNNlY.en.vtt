 Salon on light build quality is not 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.330
 I will say that right very well 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.890
 firstly here it is firmly scary 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.610
 plastic and here it is generally later 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.610
 wooden everything crunches ie somehow 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.740
 cheap actually a car like that 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.070

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.070
 what is the back curtain shaking but 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.200
 we now become fasten me 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.209

 fracture lever mechanical mode and 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.060
 did sneakers in the floor 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.250

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.270
 on the stove 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.570

 menu engine controls on this 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.500
 the car is installed qr20 by itself 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.420
 the engine is reliable enough 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.220
 combined with some bad box 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.970
 box as I said option on 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.570
 very bad response to the gas pedal 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.990
 box over the car changed 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:20.110
 the problem is with hydra which is easy just 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:23.780
 eliminated by means of replacing the very 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:27.190
 power steering on the idea the machine should he 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.720
 somehow somehow not felt 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.910
 maybe because it's a big car 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.620
 for family 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:43.220

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.680
 a place that when you sit down on the opening here 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.830
 it's very little to go on, I 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.520
 got behind the driver's seat a couple of times 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:06.740
