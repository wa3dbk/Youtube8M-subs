00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.040
 for yuri side or calm be very 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.019
 welcome to the best of your video 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.580
 Money Speedometers Your Channel 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.669
 loucomotivos technical tips here at 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.650
 youtube the video and the extra for you 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:19.109
 Ah, I just received the team from 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:22.060
 doctor and this toy here 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.300
 Doctor, and we can do it. 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.099
 test with it's electromagnetic fields 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.550
 in the team 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.920
 in summary is the operation for example 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.250
 of injector nozzles of a coil of 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.800
 ignition is for example some relays 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.290
 is being activated or not to have 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:48.910
 some levezinho serve and a sound warning 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:52.600
 it has two stages that it can connect to 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.220
 drizzle that there has two stages for 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.990
 a signal more than one more frequency 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.970
 strong once a little lower let's go 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.730
 say so come here oh here then it is 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.030
 the following I will use my goal here to 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.410
 demonstrate to you if you can 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.550
 example with the directors are 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.390
 starting 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.390
 boot 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.930
 Then you can get there by the field. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.100
 electromagnetic nozzle 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100
 it is being used 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.160
 that colors 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:35.600
 surprised by the fact and also by the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.600
 Life, anyway, she's cheering for example. 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.460
 beauty 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.070
 she only really allowed what she 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.250
 will help greatly in the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.299
 diagnosis in power left unedited edition 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.299
 what to come here again 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.690
 this could test and a relay for 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.670
 example of the management system is a cast 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.250
 and main fuel pump is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.260
 he is being assessed not 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.850
 everything with this guarantee that she 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.440
 capture by the tip of the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.170
 magnetic field being generated 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.260
 by coil of faith so test and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.640
 we can show it 's working 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.100
 Let's see if we can simulate a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.620
 Quick little bug here you two will see 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.550
 if I can take it with one hand here 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.550
 this formed from the air filter 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.390
 but to leave 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.390
 beauty or simulate here 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.550
 Let's get it, for example, I'll call smart. 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.260
 have a lens will take for example here 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.760
 our reactor number 3 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.760
 there is're pressing 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.260
 suppose you have a problem in that 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.050
 sector the top told begins to fail 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.190
 We have been testing and will return 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.100
 worked on the first 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:08.640
 the second working the third not 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.500
 sure third party does not participate 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.780
 So we can tell if he's 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.240
 pulsating or not and if the fault is 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.550
 to some nozzle nozzle or even the 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.880
 own drink team could also 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.150
 get calm in a good way 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.150
 simple 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.590
 is fast 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.150
 what is missing then make this diagnosis 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.030
 fifa sees the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.159
 now yes then they will come here just for one 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:44.330
 world here for you 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:44.330
 martin doctor and obviously the ninja
