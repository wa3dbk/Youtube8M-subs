blue bruda mutter master hmm master so
the<00:00:12.809> reason<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.740> card<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.280> if<00:00:14.519> you

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the reason I like this card is if you

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.240 
the reason I like this card is if you
look<00:00:14.849> at<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.000> six<00:00:15.450> manner<00:00:15.690> okay<00:00:16.139> get<00:00:16.320> 77<00:00:17.039> it's

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
look at it six manner okay get 77 it's

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.450 
look at it six manner okay get 77 it's
decent<00:00:17.760> um<00:00:18.050> turn<00:00:19.050> seven<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:19.770> turn<00:00:20.189> whatever

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
decent um turn seven or turn whatever

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.759 
decent um turn seven or turn whatever
you<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:20.910> seven<00:00:21.240> manner<00:00:21.420> your<00:00:22.140> monster<00:00:22.650> it

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
you have seven manner your monster it

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.920 
you have seven manner your monster it
becomes<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.250> 10-10<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.269> nine<00:00:24.570> power

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
becomes a 10-10 and you get nine power

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.759 
becomes a 10-10 and you get nine power
of<00:00:25.170> tokens<00:00:26.090> 47<00:00:27.090> manner<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:28.140> essentially<00:00:28.619> you

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
of tokens 47 manner so essentially you

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.009 
of tokens 47 manner so essentially you
get<00:00:28.920> 12<00:00:29.310> power<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.939> Noah<00:00:30.119> seven<00:00:30.510> manner<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
get 12 power for Noah seven manner and

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.979 
get 12 power for Noah seven manner and
no<00:00:31.320> car<00:00:31.650> disadvantage<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:33.480> me<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.960> just

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
no car disadvantage that to me it just

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
no car disadvantage that to me it just
seems<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.559> something<00:00:34.829> green<00:00:35.219> really<00:00:35.640> won't

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
seems like something green really won't

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.990 
seems like something green really won't
want<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> special<00:00:36.930> man<00:00:37.440> acceleration<00:00:38.219> if

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
want to do a special man acceleration if

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.850 
want to do a special man acceleration if
you<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.390> obviously<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.680> very

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
you get this obviously it will be very

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530 
you get this obviously it will be very
difficult<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.430> play<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.730> card<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.090> standard

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
difficult to play this card in standard

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.630 
difficult to play this card in standard
I<00:00:42.750> mean<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.040> cards<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
I mean do you have a lot of cards that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.910 
I mean do you have a lot of cards that
can<00:00:45.000> produce<00:00:45.809> manner<00:00:46.230> very<00:00:46.559> quickly

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
can produce manner very quickly

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.680 
can produce manner very quickly
