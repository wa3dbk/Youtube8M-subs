 pv 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.429
 I have just been with everyone because they voted for me and decided for me since it was 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:26.279
 I showed what we are in that national and good very happy deserved opinion with 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.579
 God and 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.199
 with all pains that 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.330
 also in January the trust denied all this time 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.660
 if it had not been for them no one has received this 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.000
 you also want four club cd awards 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.290
 including the most valuable player 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.660
 how does this make you feel also your first year just 17 years 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.720
 but also excited mii 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.420
 for 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.710
 this branch 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.700
 méndez with more confidence next season that they bring new bring to the 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.470
 things without hope that in the next week the next Christmas campaign 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.340
 yes 9 as everyone knows 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.980
 this year efe 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.310
 a bad start season 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.940
 deaf to whom 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.900
 this data to the next season and 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.400
 very much room 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.500
 how you can define your first year as a professional was a difficult year 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.160
 for the club 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.960
 in particular you were very successful as stupidity characterizes its performance in 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.290
 this first year as a professional 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.870
 many years I think that they advance for this year 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.900
 this year and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.310
 I hope the next ship better and 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.610
 I think for the team it was a bad season that it was not and 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.860
 I do not know what happened with the ing team we always try to give the best we can 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.020
 we had always left everything on the court and things did not go well 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 As a stretch of the Canary Islands, more was noticed 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.620
 together to a person year we have of summer I can say that we are of 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.760
 Louvain 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.230
 he was the second player in club history to win this award the first 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.430
 it was pitiful amb and the youngest in the league to win the prize 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.589
 how you feel gives you the knowledge is what are they going 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:19.039
 Legarda was very happy because 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.949
 first of 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.659
 winning stephen at 17 in the history of the mls very happy and 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.499

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.059
 I wish you with everything as of d with the cession that 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.109
 they voted for him 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.630
 I do not have words for 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.989
 describe this 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.499
 time to go 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:42.849
 well this to go living with a great emotion enjoying with my family 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.869
 I just hope to see you again in a scanner 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:52.059
 share it with them 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.079
 when you started this year 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.449
 did you think he 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.039
 you could win this prize or when 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:02.489
 you realized that I had a possibility of sunrise t this 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.789
 this train 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:04.940
 since 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.889
 of her she did not know about this penny or what 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.059
 of the rookie of the year and 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.049
 I realized already when they were missing as 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.209
 five more games was when I realized he 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.509
 from Buenos Aires 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:23.929
 I'm always going to keep working I'm not doing and see what happened 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.529
 who will win the psoe 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.749
 thus 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:31.670
 Luis elegant and I hope 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.219
 let that train be 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:37.909
 finally I'm even more at apa vision and and what can I expect from 19 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.059
 for 2011 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.359
 the reelection that 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.729
 very funny everything has the hobby that I can not here and what come into scene 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.490
 the away matches 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.980
 not happy with that he decides if he has warned that they always do it supporting 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.019
 and that 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.169
 next year we will finish with xavi 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.619
