00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello everyone in this video I will tell you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.850
 as well as making super nutritious 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.099
 mask for very dry and brittle and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.240
 splitting hair the composition of this mask is included 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.809
 Firstly 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.540
 coconut oil i use massively nerve 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.850
 Nervous first cold pressed liquid 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.770
 cosmetic keratin which is convenient 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 add to masks and cosmetic 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.220
 hair products 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 sandalwood ylang-ylang essential oils and 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.849
 lavender oil is also in its version 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.619
 masks i used sea buckthorn extract 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.960
 the slope is not over go cant 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.700
 show for a long time I believed that 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.360
 coconut oil generally does not fit 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.550
 my hair 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.410
 I love him very much for the wonderful aroma 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.070
 but used only as a cream 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.649
 for body 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.899
 However, we will try to high-quality good 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.730
 I understood coconut oil before 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.219
 I came across this just wrong 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 and oil or I put too big 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.270
 quantity is possible both 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.039
 coconut oil is super nutritious 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.360
 means that moisturizes nourishes 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.250
 smooth our hair 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.719
 however in the case of coconut oil you need 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.370
 remember that this is despite the fact that he 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.500
 is penetrating oil that is 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 gets into the lips of our hair for that to him 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.340
 it takes time so put it on 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.500
 half an hour doesn't make any sense 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.409
 of making a mask try to keep 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.900
 her further further cosmetic keratin 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.150
 This is a very well-known tool that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.070
 Recently, many girls are very 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.900
 often used in recipes it can 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.850
 add as a home mask as 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.150
 ready mix but I as you know very much 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.670
 I love exactly the home remedy purchased 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.680
 I try not to change me add them 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.079
 nothing keratin makes hair more 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.759
 smooth smoothes scales nourishes and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.040
 moisturizes fights dryness 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.320
 also believed to strengthen the roots 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.850
 enhances blood flow to the scalp this 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.630
 perfect for dry and brittle 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.939
 hair 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.340
 as well as an aid for 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.500
 exposed hair restoration 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 coloring and perm and so on 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.880
 useful properties of his sea well and 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.829
 finally all the essential oils that you 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.200
 just showed you probably already too 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.649
 know perfectly fights dryness and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.560
 brittle hair moisturizes smooth 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.509
 gives them shine to their length to the waist 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.610
 I used one tablespoon 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.740
 coconut 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.410
 sea ​​buckthorn extract oil and keratin i 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.750
 added to the class and put on 3 drops 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.480
 essential oils nuland long sandalwood and 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.020
 lavender if your hair is much longer 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.820
 and thicker 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.680
 or you will apply the mixture throughout 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.660
 length including scalp 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.120
 number of ingredients can be a little bit 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.760
 increase with special severity 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.000
 soft components safely take 1 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.320
 tablespoon of coconut oil 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.550
 melt and add to the eye 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.490
 sea ​​buckthorn extract 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.290
 then put the cosmetic keratin it 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.459
 you can put up to one third of the total 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.310
 amount of mixture 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.209
 and also on 3 drops of essential oils 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.320
 ylang ylang lavender sandalwood 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.220
 mix the mask until smooth 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.110
 consistency we put the mixture in a very 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.390
 small amount of stroking 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.820
 movements just moisten your hand in 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.190
 mix and put it on your hair 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.500
 mask is moderate to make it easier to wash off 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.140
 special attention should be paid to the tips 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.360
 hair a little dwell on what 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.770
 can i replace components often 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.630
 criticized for the fact that I have difficult 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.910
 the composition of the mask to use expensive 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.320
 ingredients i understand it all i'm not very 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.190
 I like to talk about very simple 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.950
 masked type 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.230
 us 1st burdock oil or make 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.880
 mustard love recipe more complicated I 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.790
 I think that they will be too much 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.769
 interesting but if there is no arsenal in your arsenal 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.410
 so many connections can 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.269
 Everything can be changed, that is, for example, if 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.299
 you don't have coconut oil you can 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.370
 use shea butter and cocoa butter 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.730
 mango butter any other solid mass then 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.810
 there is a butter if you don't have one 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.910
 solid butter 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.709
 try using any liquid well 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.380
 at least olive or almond doom 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.989
 such a mass is found in all homes or 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.790
 at least the nearest store 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.920
 keratin keratin case is important 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.550
 it is he who answers us by himself 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.100
 konami 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.780
 oil masks and sockets advise 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.820
 it is not very expensive to buy 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.900
 as far as I remember about 300,400 rubles 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.690
 some cases on joint procurement 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.970
 it can be purchased even cheaper but 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.880
 finally i have used essential oils 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.770
 three at once 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.290
 I used three essential oils at once 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.940
 up to push through with perfect effect 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.040
 however you may well use 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.350
 just one of these essential oils 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.050
 not necessarily three at once and if you 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.930
 insert a choice which one to take here is superfluous 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.700
 advised ylang ylang this is my favorite i 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.690
 I love this oil very well. 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.660
 where 4 probably if I am not mistaken 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.730
 so here I am buying so big 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.010
 50 milliliters in my fine 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.050
 I use it not only for hair 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.000
 but for the skin in general, this one 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.150
 massive advised to purchase first 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.390
 queue is also very good lavender 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.340
 it is also an excellent dry oil but 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.080
 me with him just not so close 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.010
 relationship because lavender for me is not 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.230
 it smells very good 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.040
 however those are death to me she is very 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.169
 like the mixture it is in a mixture with whom 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.880
 it turns out great lavender 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.130
 a bow for whom cold there 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.350
 aroma and it a little extinguishes such 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.020
 sucking ylang ylang and together they 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.180
 beautiful are accepted and finally sandal 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.030
 this is my most expensive essential oil 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.590
 collection and that's it in principle 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.540
 can not use if you have 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.560
 for some reason there is no possibility 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.780
 purchase sanda 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.240
 I advise a better column if you have 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.760
 there is no sea buckthorn extract at hand or 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.570
 any other extract suitable 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.669
 dry hair 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.919
 You can replace it with about vitamins 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.940
 Arie and so my hair is pretty greasy 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.310
 roots therefore 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.950
 I wore a little mask only in length starting 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.510
 from about this place and then just 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.450
 leftovers that were on the ankles 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.920
 rubbed on top and a little bit on the bang 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.620
 if you have 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.540
 hair especially if dry scalp i 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.120
 I advise you to make a mask along the entire length 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.700
 however, it is important to remember 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.530
 girls masks should be a little mask 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.060
 you can even put on the night 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.320
 especially if you don’t 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.810
 apply and at the stern 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.790
 that is, only if you 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.060
 leave the mask for the night I advise not 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.690
 cover as usual and just reckless 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.570
 pillow 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.450
 position or go to bed because otherwise 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.310
 the package is very comfortable with you 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.180
 applied to understand and who is suitable 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.010
 mask and how often and apply here if u 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.470
 you have very dry brittle hair doing 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.170
 often you can even two or three times a week 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.700
 a period of intensive treatment after 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.070
 for example, two months will be possible 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.710
 reduce the amount to 1 2 1 week 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.570
 if you are oily or normal 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.580
 hair like me and no different 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.740
 strong dryness can then be done 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.200
 mask once a week just as 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.910
 maintenance therapy during the winter 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.190
 colds when hair so here more 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.960
 exposed and listening effects with 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.090
 one side of the cold on the other hand 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.030
 central heating me the most masochka 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.280
 really liked despite the fact that 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.200
 my tips are no different to this 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.620
 noticeable drying i call them normal 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.300
 quite healthy even on them was 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.210
 noticeable effect ie hair became 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.090
 much softer while i'm just gonna wash 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.380
 masked with shampoo and wore not 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.150
 cosmetic mask no balm no 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.940
 some kind of indelible remedy that is 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.800
 just washed off the mask and stayed as it is 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.200
 even in this situation they are beautiful 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.640
 combing myself very very soft i 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.220
 I think that on dry hair 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.530
 the effect will still be replaced so well here in 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.530
 In general, all that I wanted you about 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.690
 I told this mask I try 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.640
 I am sure that you will like the main thing on that 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.530
 should pay attention to quality 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.440
 use coconut oil 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:42.260
 keratin apply very very very sparingly 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.090
