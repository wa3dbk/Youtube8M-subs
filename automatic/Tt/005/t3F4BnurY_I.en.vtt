the other side easy to see but between

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.490 
the other side easy to see but between
that<00:02:22.430> city<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:25.850> city<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.450> where<00:02:27.050> the

that city and that city is where the
battle<00:02:27.770> took<00:02:27.920> place<00:02:27.980> which<00:02:28.970> puts<00:02:29.270> us<00:02:29.420> right

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
battle took place which puts us right

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.960 
battle took place which puts us right
here<00:02:29.959> in<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.140> valley<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.520> this<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.850> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
here in the valley and so this is the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.330 
here in the valley and so this is the
valley<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.900> Philistines<00:02:33.440> are<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.890> cilco

valley the Philistines are on the cilco

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.830 
valley the Philistines are on the cilco
side<00:02:34.640> which<00:02:34.940> would<00:02:35.060> be<00:02:35.209> those<00:02:35.330> hills<00:02:35.600> over

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
side which would be those hills over

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.560 
side which would be those hills over
there<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.790> Saul<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.090> his<00:02:38.209> army<00:02:38.480> were

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
there and Saul and his army were

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.540 
there and Saul and his army were
encamped<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.110> this<00:02:39.350> side<00:02:39.590> on<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.340> hill

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
encamped on this side on the hill

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.550 
encamped on this side on the hill
possibly<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.480> very<00:02:41.720> hill<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.260> we're<00:02:42.440> on

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
possibly on the very hill that we're on

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.400 
possibly on the very hill that we're on
here<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.670> maybe<00:02:44.090> on<00:02:44.330> these<00:02:44.540> slopes<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.200> where

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
here and maybe on these slopes is where

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.140 
here and maybe on these slopes is where
the<00:02:45.560> Israelite<00:02:46.040> army<00:02:46.070> waited<00:02:46.820> just<00:02:46.910> right

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
the Israelite army waited just right

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.550 
the Israelite army waited just right
around<00:02:47.360> here<00:02:47.570> but<00:02:47.780> we<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:47.959> imagine<00:02:48.170> down

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
around here but we can imagine down

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.460 
around here but we can imagine down
there<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.700> Goliath<00:02:50.120> coming<00:02:50.480> out<00:02:50.630> making<00:02:51.350> us

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
there and Goliath coming out making us

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.229 
there and Goliath coming out making us
challenge<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.850> if<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:53.690> look<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.650> distance

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
challenge and if we look in the distance

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.560 
challenge and if we look in the distance
we<00:02:56.239> can<00:02:56.420> maybe<00:02:56.690> see<00:02:57.080> on<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.680> highway<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.070> bridge

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
we can maybe see on the highway a bridge

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.310 
we can maybe see on the highway a bridge
down<00:02:59.570> there<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:02.540> can<00:03:02.690> see<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.080> that<00:03:03.260> is

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
down there you can see that that is

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.900 
down there you can see that that is
crossing<00:03:03.830> over<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.190> brook<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.730> runs

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
crossing over the brook that runs

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.850 
crossing over the brook that runs
through<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.209> valley<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:05.720> brook<00:03:06.530> if<00:03:06.770> you

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
through the valley and that brook if you

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.650 
through the valley and that brook if you
can<00:03:07.010> make<00:03:07.130> off<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.430> treeline<00:03:07.880> down<00:03:08.209> there<00:03:08.480> on

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
can make off the treeline down there on

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.300 
can make off the treeline down there on
the<00:03:08.930> edge<00:03:09.020> of<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.170> fields<00:03:09.500> that's<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.160> line

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
the edge of the fields that's the line

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.370 
the edge of the fields that's the line
of<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.489> brook<00:03:10.670> just<00:03:11.540> inside<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.140> tree<00:03:12.350> line

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
of the brook just inside the tree line

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.979 
of the brook just inside the tree line
and<00:03:12.770> so<00:03:13.459> David<00:03:13.820> being<00:03:14.030> on<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.360> side<00:03:14.600> would

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
and so David being on this side would

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.410 
and so David being on this side would
cross<00:03:15.650> down<00:03:16.130> there<00:03:16.400> we<00:03:16.549> go<00:03:16.790> down<00:03:16.940> there<00:03:17.090> across

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
cross down there we go down there across

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.170 
cross down there we go down there across
the<00:03:17.600> brook<00:03:17.810> get<00:03:18.260> five<00:03:18.470> smooth<00:03:18.799> stones<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.489> go

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
the brook get five smooth stones and go

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.759 
the brook get five smooth stones and go
out<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.480> wherever<00:03:20.690> Goliath<00:03:21.380> would<00:03:21.530> have<00:03:21.650> been

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
out to wherever Goliath would have been

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.110 
out to wherever Goliath would have been
it<00:03:21.890> could<00:03:22.070> have<00:03:22.160> been<00:03:22.220> over<00:03:22.459> there<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.940> could

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
it could have been over there it could

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.520 
it could have been over there it could
have<00:03:23.209> been<00:03:23.299> in<00:03:23.390> front<00:03:23.570> of<00:03:23.720> here<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.410> don't

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
have been in front of here and we don't

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.830 
have been in front of here and we don't
know<00:03:24.620> exactly<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:25.280> spot<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.790> course<00:03:26.030> but

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
know exactly the spot of course but

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.120 
know exactly the spot of course but
still<00:03:26.959> now<00:03:27.769> that's<00:03:28.040> pretty<00:03:28.459> good

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
still now that's pretty good

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.710 
still now that's pretty good
zero-zero<00:03:31.130> wing<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.580> of<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.030> location<00:03:32.540> and

zero-zero wing in of the location and
that's<00:03:33.500> what<00:03:33.769> all<00:03:33.890> happened<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.489> city<00:03:34.700> of

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
that's what all happened the city of

that's what all happened the city of
Kubek<00:03:35.150> Chiappa<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.810> on<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.620> border<00:03:36.980> here<00:03:37.190> the

Kubek Chiappa is on the border here the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.520 
Kubek Chiappa is on the border here the
ancient<00:03:37.670> border<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.209> it<00:03:39.019> appears<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.500> have

ancient border and it appears to have

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.039 
ancient border and it appears to have
been<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.769> military<00:03:40.040> fort<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.880> some<00:03:41.060> kind<00:03:41.329> not

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.789 
existed for two or three decades maybe
at<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.329> most<00:03:47.510> we<00:03:47.780> think<00:03:48.019> before<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.680> was

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
at the most we think before it was

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.330 
at the most we think before it was
destroyed<00:03:49.220> violently<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:51.680> best<00:03:51.890> guess<00:03:52.160> is

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
destroyed violently the best guess is

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.069 
destroyed violently the best guess is
probably<00:03:52.610> in<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.180> war<00:03:53.329> with<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.570> Philistines

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
probably in a war with the Philistines

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.170 
probably in a war with the Philistines
David<00:03:54.500> fought<00:03:54.739> -<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.610> we<00:03:55.700> know<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:55.910> in<00:03:56.120> the

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
David fought - that we know of in the

in<00:03:59.030> his<00:03:59.299> reign<00:03:59.510> it's<00:03:59.810> possible<00:04:00.380> that<00:04:00.730> one<00:04:01.730> of

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
in his reign it's possible that one of

in his reign it's possible that one of
those<00:04:02.090> wars<00:04:02.739> involved<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.890> Philistines

those wars involved the Philistines

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.759 
those wars involved the Philistines
coming<00:04:04.670> up<00:04:04.790> here<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.269> possibly<00:04:06.079> destroying

some<00:04:15.920> point<00:04:15.980> they<00:04:16.370> went<00:04:16.519> up<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.910> Isaiah<00:04:17.450> and

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
some point they went up to Isaiah and

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.080 
some point they went up to Isaiah and
built<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.109> city<00:04:18.350> there<00:04:18.590> which<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.940> little

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
built a city there which is a little

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.450 
built a city there which is a little
further<00:04:20.299> on<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.680> edge<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.010> border<00:04:22.310> and

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
further on the edge of the border and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.940 
further on the edge of the border and
with<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.510> with<00:04:23.930> one<00:04:24.110> right<00:04:24.289> there<00:04:24.530> why<00:04:24.800> do<00:04:24.860> you

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
with the with one right there why do you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
with the with one right there why do you
need<00:04:25.099> another<00:04:25.250> one<00:04:25.340> over

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
need another one over

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.350 
need another one over
and<00:04:26.060> so<00:04:26.830> there<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:27.860> go<00:04:28.370> they're<00:04:29.060> doing

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
and so there you go they're doing

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.320

excavations at Isaiah right now to learn
more<00:04:32.570> about<00:04:32.630> when<00:04:33.140> it<00:04:33.260> was<00:04:33.350> built<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.950> its

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
more about when it was built and its

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.130 
more about when it was built and its
history<00:04:34.700> so<00:04:34.970> maybe<00:04:35.240> in<00:04:35.450> a<00:04:35.510> few<00:04:35.720> years<00:04:35.750> we'll

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
history so maybe in a few years we'll

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.200 
history so maybe in a few years we'll
have<00:04:36.170> some<00:04:36.500> more<00:04:36.590> details<00:04:36.650> on<00:04:37.130> that<00:04:37.310> but<00:04:38.030> this

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
have some more details on that but this

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.470 
have some more details on that but this
is<00:04:38.510> why<00:04:39.320> this<00:04:40.040> is<00:04:40.220> some<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.550> reason<00:04:40.700> why

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
is why this is some of the reason why

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.430 
is why this is some of the reason why
