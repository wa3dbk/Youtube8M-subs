going to be using three coffee
appliances<00:00:32.130> today<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:33.030> are<00:00:33.149> using<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.660> grinder

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
appliances today we are using a grinder

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.069 
appliances today we are using a grinder
a<00:00:34.350> French<00:00:34.860> press<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.790> pot<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> reason

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
a French press and a pot and the reason

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.290 
a French press and a pot and the reason
we<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.350> mocha<00:00:37.739> pod<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> espresso

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
we have a mocha pod is for the espresso

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.180 
we have a mocha pod is for the espresso
and<00:00:39.480> not<00:00:39.840> everyone<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.320> afford<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.829> espresso

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and not everyone can afford the espresso

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.340 
and not everyone can afford the espresso
machine<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.270> 100<00:00:42.690> bucks<00:00:42.840> 200

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
machine which is like 100 bucks 200

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.740 
machine which is like 100 bucks 200
bucks<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> Moka<00:00:44.579> pot<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.149> essentially<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
bucks so the Moka pot is essentially a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.139 
bucks so the Moka pot is essentially a
way<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.410> an<00:00:46.559> espresso<00:00:46.800> that's<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
way to make an espresso that's not the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690 
way to make an espresso that's not the
real<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> suppose<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.829> coffee<00:00:50.100> fanatics

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
real way I suppose for coffee fanatics

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.770 
real way I suppose for coffee fanatics
but<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.390> something<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:51.719> very

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
but it's something that's very

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
but it's something that's very
comparable<00:00:52.260> mm-hmm<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:53.699> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
comparable mm-hmm and when you get this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.569 
comparable mm-hmm and when you get this
thing<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.170> Macy's<00:00:55.829> will<00:00:56.219> combine

your exotic coffee beans and put them
into<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:04.860> grinder<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> French<00:01:06.270> press

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
into your grinder but the French press

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
into your grinder but the French press
we're<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.020> need<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> coarser<00:01:07.650> grind<00:01:07.860> so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
we're going to need a coarser grind so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.289 
we're going to need a coarser grind so
that<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> particles<00:01:08.729> don't<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.060> pushed

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that the particles don't get pushed

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
that the particles don't get pushed
through<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.689> mesh<00:01:09.930> wiring<00:01:10.439> should<00:01:10.590> look

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
through the mesh wiring should look

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.670 
through the mesh wiring should look
something<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:12.080> then<00:01:13.080> bring<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.409> pot<00:01:13.650> of

to<00:01:22.950> make<00:01:23.250> sure<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.520> everything's<00:01:23.970> mixed

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to make sure that everything's mixed

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.910 
to make sure that everything's mixed
together<00:01:24.390> not<00:01:24.810> stuck<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> bottom<00:01:25.439> then

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
together not stuck to the bottom then

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.010 
together not stuck to the bottom then
add<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> remaining<00:01:26.820> water

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
add in the remaining water

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
add in the remaining water
put<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> top<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.979> French<00:01:29.189> press<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
put the top of the French press on and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.490 
put the top of the French press on and
move<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> plunger<00:01:30.299> right<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.899> top<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
move the plunger right to the top of the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.999 
move the plunger right to the top of the
water<00:01:31.740> line<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> before<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.049> plop<00:01:34.649> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
water line so before we get to plop the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.130 
water line so before we get to plop the
plunger<00:01:35.520> down<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> set<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> timer<00:01:36.869> for

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
plunger down you need to set a timer for

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
plunger down you need to set a timer for
three<00:01:37.290> minutes<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.369> water<00:01:38.580> can

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
three minutes so that the water can

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.200 
three minutes so that the water can
absorb<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.350> coffee<00:01:40.560> grinds<00:01:41.039> so<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.090> could

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
absorb all the coffee grinds so we could

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.080 
absorb all the coffee grinds so we could
get<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> strongest<00:01:42.899> possible<00:01:43.680> brew<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
get the strongest possible brew and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.590 
get the strongest possible brew and
lunge

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
lunge
