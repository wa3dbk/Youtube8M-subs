 Thank you today is subtitles This day has come next 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:11.310
 I bought a camera I was waiting for I came next time 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.310
 ni 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.310
 car 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.920
 Dsc it says wx 200 I've been working hard this is Sony small Ever 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.640
 Though 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.980
 It as just below have said from before I finally I camera buy 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 Though it is sloppy amateur 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:35.370
 We plan to be in the three-denominated this time I touch without you want fine to talk 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.710
 Kedomo I took videos entered before you buy for the first time Piraresu single-lens before this 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.790
 I think it is easy to understand person who had a look there in before the people of this time to see 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:49.250
 It's a three- story house, but it's open and shooting response 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.990
 I'm planning to buy things, but it's only in the private form, but 3 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.830
 I would like to introduce you to the real video 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.090
 I'm half- opened, but including those parts 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:03.680
 It So thank you has become so, as can be seen when you look at all walk 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.990
 I think I want to open again I Kedomo'm free 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.250
 I bought this time to say that the double zoom lens kit and standard lens and telephoto lens 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.280
 It is a set with 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.140
 However, now only standard lenses are included 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.979
 This is also is also tightly will explain in some of the three first videos I Is that so or you can see from his nice 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.730
 Isn't it 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.120
 Please close your eyes for a moment 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.970
 I Nde contents hardly touched but once I opened it 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.570
 I 'm not excited about it now 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.940
 Take a look at the other youtube But I this nex 5 r is what love 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.120
 I think whether stiffer quite familiar you are 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.110
 It was released in November 2012 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:46.690
 Also has come out then I to the nex 5 tt subsequent machine 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.960
 That nes 5 t will also be released in June 2013 already 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.020
 On types fall 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.320
 You're stuck pretty time I since the subsequent machine out 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.409
 I 'm sure I can't quit now, but I'm sure 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.040
 I also bought the mirrorless one eye I bought for the first time this time 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.300
 I also want to take a brief report 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.300
 Then I will open it 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.540
 Perhaps one cd for the set-up is in warranty 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:19.380
 I can download the app including this camera eye pay free 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.730
 For me who do not like drinking cameras, I'm also surprised 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.950
 Product registration recommendation manual 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.129
 When I open another lid 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.129
 I saw this time and it really came out 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.790
 It is a child from out all contents 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:44.239
 One is first strap charging you one cable for charging 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.469
 And there is a flash on the battery 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.790
 It is external, rather than the I-chip flash memory I nex 5 r 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:55.420
 I avoid this around for a while now 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.640
 I 'm not good at reaction, but now I'm happy I'm max 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.450
 This time it is catan color, but in fact it was not possible to select it in a timely manner . 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.150
 is 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.680
 I bought a white for what I bought 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.680
 I can wear it without saying 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.390
 Such a feeling goo 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.370
 N pants Once you know the idea 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.850
 It's pretty cool by having it this way, but I want to start it right away 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.050
 Also 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:30.510
 You're multiplying Bow pretty accessor building in as I mentioned in the previous video 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.290
 Among them, I remember eye wasabi power 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:39.750
 It is often said that it is in the first place, so it can be quite a charger 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:44.129
 I bought a battery before, so I'm charging from this morning I'm fully charged 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.370
 It's a place I want to use soon, but it's a bit funny about it 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.430
 I would like to try it there was a 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:55.590
 Yes, I bought much trouble camera body with it 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:59.190
 I would like to from the battery of the talk here has been shipped with the nex 5 r 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.840
 npf is a double 50 regular battery 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.390
 It is a wasabi car of the eye-catching product which I bought last time 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:12.280
 Wasabi par people-1300 ma I am writing 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:17.680
 But I know I'm writing Te 1080 ma g more of this genuine 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:23.560
 This is I is greater here towards Gane capacity if true it is that Tteyuu 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.100
 I saw it on the net, but it was better than genuine, but the wasabi par that should have a large capacity is actually 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.480
 I guess a little bit lighter 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.270
 Yes I would like to measure 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.270
 At first it is pure battery np fw 50 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.360
 There 58g Yes, let's measure wasabi power to the next 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.180
 I only have 41g 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:55.030
 Now it 's a 1080m page and 1300 mag 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:59.740
 I think you do it wasabi par capacity is greater on that lighter 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:02.610
 There is no such thing, but there is a bit of anxiety, but I'll start here immediately. 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.610
 I would like 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:14.160
 I think it looks like the appearance before that When this opened I already have a standard zoom lens attached 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.050
 The say cap to be given to this body and the rear cap of cat lens to say is 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.520
 Splash not included 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.450
 When I changed this lens, I said that I need to buy more cap 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.889
 It is 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:28.689
 Fenne body and the grip part is a little 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:31.950
 It feels like a cat 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:38.870
 It looks like this 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.870
 There has however to insert the I tripod hole and battery and sd card 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.940
 re 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:49.910
 Ah ah ah N 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:52.550
 I want to explain here and there while projecting like this, but I am a real camera amateur Nene 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.340
 I already have eyes on this dial 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:00.550
 I do not know at all 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.550
 Woman ぇ Please see the other person's video for more information 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:11.010
 Well, I think this is the other person's video, but I think I will see it many times 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:14.390
 The liquid crystal is I say or I bought this camera Why 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.390
 It's spinning around 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.240
 We're facing this side say I will go this one more time 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.350
 after 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.840
 Rotate 180 degrees 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:34.360
 It is the best camera for low-pitched self-portrait 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:34.360
 The vari-angle monitor it further with respect to in I nex 5 r and 5 t 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:43.380
 It becomes like this 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:46.810
 It's so easy to see from under it at the time to shoot from this high position 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.940
 Of course when you go low 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.030
 It becomes such an angle, too 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:57.190
 But in it has a liquid crystal mon As you can see now 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:58.510
 The finder is not attached, so it's a bit weak for light reflection when shooting outside 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.030
 it seems like 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.360
 I I'd want to put it quickly or power say 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:09.150
 I want to enter this LCD Protector 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.150
 There is only one LCD protective film in this 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:20.190
 ooooooooooooooooooooo oooo 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:23.340
 This little did deviates little sound I is not it mon to while still shooting 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:27.350
 But I do not care so much 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.350
 I want to put on the filter one after another 

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.520
 We make a clean 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.670
 Ne is hella cool Hmm 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.620
 In even with this lens protection filter 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.620
 Lens cap is closed again 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.210
 Hmm
