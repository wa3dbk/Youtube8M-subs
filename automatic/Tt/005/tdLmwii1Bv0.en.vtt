00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.680
 go 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.550
 because I would 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.970
 and over there 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:52.809
 being here rehearsing in the days 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:55.030
 holidays and working here 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.530
 rehearsing looking for new new voices 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.260
 girls who will be part of education 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.469
 red paint I present to you hebe solar eb 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.360
 and if she comes from bridge foot to me the 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.979
 early morning the day of olveiroa caramba if 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.289
 it's work when someone wants 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.670
 dabble in music in art in 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.299
 the song must be up early you have to 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.250
 sacrifice because there is not always 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.920
 young always beautiful girls in the 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:25.060
 grouping red paint 16 years then 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:27.759
 be worried that you want 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.030
 participate I think that cultivates music 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.460
 It is very good and apart from how it is a 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.039
 learning for them also because they do not 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.659
 he only dedicates himself to singing cute but 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.549
 that you have to travel in scenarios 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.800
 how to get that audience, not the 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.140
 public of difficult good of Peru 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.290
 I find that I know her about 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.320
 months she is studying already finishing 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.600
 his fifth year of high school I do not do for 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.070
 if anything what other groups do 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.530
 you experience the study in fact and there 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.980
 will participate actively within the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.380
 grouping red paint but I think the 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.170
 my obligation is to inculcate him first that 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.870
 finish your studies this year ends and 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.280
 already next year we will have it inside 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.420
 the row of red paint as one of the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.730
 main voices of this group 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.340
 but for now accompanies us some 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.440
 opportunities this full samba rendering 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.140
 every day has been was for 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.270
 Alejandra does not look at you, I tell you that 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.590
 last week on Friday we went out 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.840
 that cristian we have taken home 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.900
 after d 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.430
 you almost should not have been the same 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.780
 the drive by cusco 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.290
 and so many places that I do not even remember 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.450
 because we travel a lot but we do it 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.400
 with a lot of love because we know that this 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.040
 grouping transmits in each scenario 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.630
 transmits in each presentation the feeling 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.050
 of the Peruvian people what we are 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.050
 doing 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.300
 the oil determines what experience 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.550
 how many months are you in red paint 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.710
 ideal 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.250
 a few months ago is three months since 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.930
 I go to the group I always have 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.879
 liked red paint 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.650
 always listen to the songs and minors 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:16.180
 from here it is not a dream fulfilled 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.180
 I'm similar to April and the photo 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.700
 nor today's mehsud 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.830
 and in 615 the warrior princess 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.200
 very happy to receive so many values 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.090
 so many talents that are here in that 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.670
 homeland and happy because 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.940
 I said Alejandro we have to find more 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.440
 girls so they keep singing and continue 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.970
 charming the guys who like 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:53.760
 see them sing dance on stage not 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:56.970
 you are afraid because these people are not 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.590
 selfish you do not have to share and there's no 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.540
 well I feel very happy 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.180
 I feel comfortable with the others 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.269
 girls I feel happy with them we 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.400
 we feel in family they return alejandro 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:13.920
 DÃ­az are 30 years of this year of painting 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.920
 red how fast time goes by 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.030
 precisely one month of October November 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.889
 I think it was in the year 84 when it came out 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.300
 our first songs where are you 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.090
 and you will cry 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.759
 the label practically did not stop 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.819
 side because they want a woman to never 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:36.229
 they sing chicha that is something 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:38.870
 incredible but when one has an ideal 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.680
 it was madness on your part always 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.319
 those who always do things and it was a 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.060
 madness and as you say and look and 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.069
 we're going to turn 30 and I think it's 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.509
 one of the few groupings that its 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:55.550
 song is 30 years old and it's still 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.500
 with another group from around the world sings 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.810
 red paint music all groups well 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.889
 recently each purpose tier to the 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.889
 paperback friends 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.110
 if that 's what makes us happy because 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.210
 this issue dilemma for example that has 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.370
 engraving that is papelÃ³n already it is going to fulfill 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.530
 30 years are also already achieving 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.969
 quite right now we hope that many 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.360
 orchestras a lot of part of our group 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.879
 there is no retaliation is not 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.610
 that we have to take some actions 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.860
 legal against them while 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.400
 what the law stipulates red paint 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.419
 he will always give away his musical works 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.319
 orchestras groups that want 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.860
 use them for the benefit of the people 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:44.849
 public audience knows what the author is 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.219
 who is where these songs came from 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:51.939
 clear goes like this after so much west 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:54.599
 be inspired for people of some 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.599
 way we 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.230
 we bond with the public with women 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.170
 who have problems for example from 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.390
 betrayal with men who have discovered 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.100
 Well, some infidelity or a child 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.850
 also that suffers as is the case of 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.130
 appetite 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.180
 talking about weight so much to synthesize 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:17.110
 to finish to try singing and that 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.110
 spears and had classmates 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.190
 Y 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.180
