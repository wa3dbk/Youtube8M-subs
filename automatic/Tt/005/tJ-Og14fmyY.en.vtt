with<00:00:00.329> us<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.380> why<00:00:01.530> we<00:00:01.829> have

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.090 
with us this is why we have

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.630 
with us this is why we have
approximately<00:00:03.090> 22<00:00:03.810> different<00:00:04.200> body<00:00:04.410> types<00:00:04.770> on

approximately 22 different body types on
the<00:00:05.910> planet<00:00:06.330> now<00:00:07.200> what<00:00:07.350> I'm<00:00:07.410> talking<00:00:07.589> about

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
the planet now what I'm talking about

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
planet there are 22 this is where we

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.410 
planet there are 22 this is where we
have<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.750> many<00:00:18.840> different<00:00:18.960> races<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:20.420> have

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
have so many different races that have

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.220 
have so many different races that have
different<00:00:21.810> physical<00:00:22.109> features<00:00:23.600> now<00:00:24.600> because

different physical features now because

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.550 
different physical features now because
of<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.699> manipulation<00:00:26.699> what's<00:00:27.599> happened<00:00:28.080> is

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
of this manipulation what's happened is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.160 
of this manipulation what's happened is
that<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:29.250> as<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> planetary<00:00:30.240> race<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.810> become

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
that we as a planetary race have become

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.119 
that we as a planetary race have become
this<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.800> Heinz<00:00:32.189> 57<00:00:34.370> we<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.690> inside<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.899> us

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
this like Heinz 57 we have inside of us

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.250

now this is also the only planet in our

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.660 
now this is also the only planet in our
galaxy<00:01:21.390> where<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.130> many<00:01:23.310> different

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
galaxy where you have so many different

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.969 
galaxy where you have so many different
races<00:01:24.180> together<00:01:26.780> now<00:01:27.780> what's<00:01:27.990> happened<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
races together now what's happened and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
Andromeda are a human race but they have

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.600 
Andromeda are a human race but they have
been<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.070> pure<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> clean<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.680> their<00:01:37.829> DNA<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
been so pure so clean on their DNA and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
been so pure so clean on their DNA and
their<00:01:39.240> genetic<00:01:39.630> melting<00:01:40.049> with<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> same

use<00:02:25.739> our<00:02:26.190> physical<00:02:26.700> structures<00:02:27.150> because<00:02:27.900> of

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
use our physical structures because of

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.440 
use our physical structures because of
our<00:02:28.200> consciousness<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:29.430> vibrate<00:02:29.790> at<00:02:30.209> such<00:02:30.420> a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
our consciousness we vibrate at such a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.280 
our consciousness we vibrate at such a
low<00:02:30.720> level<00:02:31.220> they<00:02:32.220> can't<00:02:32.459> use<00:02:32.670> it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
low level they can't use it

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.420 
low level they can't use it
plus<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.680> can't<00:02:34.860> come<00:02:34.950> down<00:02:35.099> here<00:02:35.310> and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
plus they just can't come down here and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.250 
plus they just can't come down here and
steal<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> Grays<00:02:36.209> do<00:02:36.450> because<00:02:37.080> it's

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
steal it like the Grays do because it's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.089 
steal it like the Grays do because it's
a<00:02:37.319> violation<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.890> free<00:02:38.099> will<00:02:39.860> which<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
a violation of free will which is the

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.729 
a violation of free will which is the
number<00:02:41.370> one<00:02:41.519> law<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:42.090> not<00:02:42.299> violate<00:02:42.630> free<00:02:43.140> will

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
number one law do not violate free will

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.600 
number one law do not violate free will
number<00:02:44.610> two<00:02:44.819> do<00:02:45.660> not<00:02:45.870> interfere<00:02:46.290> or<00:02:47.040> intervene

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
number two do not interfere or intervene

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.250 
number two do not interfere or intervene
with<00:02:47.880> an<00:02:48.000> evolving<00:02:48.390> race<00:02:48.600> unless<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.110> are

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
with an evolving race unless you are

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.240 
with an evolving race unless you are
asked<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:50.420> course<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:52.080> been<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:52.950> it

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
asked of course we have been we have it

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.759 
asked of course we have been we have it
for<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.459> last<00:02:53.610> five<00:02:53.850> thousand<00:02:54.390> years<00:02:54.769> majorly

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
for the last five thousand years majorly

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.309 
for the last five thousand years majorly
manipulated<00:02:56.489> as<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> planetary<00:02:57.150> race<00:02:58.670> so<00:03:00.319> this

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
manipulated as a planetary race so this

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.620 
manipulated as a planetary race so this
is<00:03:01.590> why<00:03:01.910> there's<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.180> much<00:03:03.360> attention<00:03:03.540> here

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
is why there's so much attention here

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.320 
is why there's so much attention here
now<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.830> negatives<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:09.540> negative<00:03:10.190> forces

they have to do it in such a way that we

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.550 
they have to do it in such a way that we

think it's all right Ian because they
can't<00:03:46.769> violate<00:03:47.160> our<00:03:47.310> free<00:03:47.519> will<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:50.040> everybody

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
can't violate our free will so everybody

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.300 
can't violate our free will so everybody
followed<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:50.940> far<00:03:51.230> so<00:03:52.230> it's<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:53.040> hell<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.190> a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
followed that so far so it's a hell of a

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.720 
followed that so far so it's a hell of a
situation<00:03:53.910> it's<00:03:54.630> really<00:03:54.750> complicated<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:56.010> wish

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
situation it's really complicated I wish

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.819 
situation it's really complicated I wish
I<00:03:56.819> could<00:03:56.970> say<00:03:57.120> it's<00:03:57.600> black<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.019> white<00:03:58.079> and

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
I could say it's black and white and

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.440 
I could say it's black and white and
there<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.250> good<00:03:59.519> but<00:03:59.609> it<00:03:59.670> isn't<00:04:00.030> it's<00:04:00.329> a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
there it is good but it isn't it's a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.050 
there it is good but it isn't it's a
very<00:04:00.690> complicated<00:04:01.139> thing<00:04:01.579> now<00:04:02.579> because<00:04:02.910> of

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
very complicated thing now because of

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.809 
very complicated thing now because of
the<00:04:03.120> grey<00:04:03.389> intervention<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.260> because<00:04:05.069> our

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
the grey intervention and because our

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.210 
the grey intervention and because our
