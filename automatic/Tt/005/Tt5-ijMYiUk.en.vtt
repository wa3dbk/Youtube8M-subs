hasn't<00:00:58.920> got<00:00:59.190> much<00:00:59.370> runs<00:00:59.670> because<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.149> pace

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
hasn't got much runs because the pace

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.880 
hasn't got much runs because the pace
and<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> short<00:01:00.870> ball<00:01:01.079> has<00:01:01.289> has<00:01:01.500> caught<00:01:01.739> him

as<00:01:22.740> he<00:01:22.860> keeps<00:01:23.040> playing<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.580> day<00:01:23.700> cricket<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
as he keeps playing one day cricket I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910 
as he keeps playing one day cricket I
know<00:01:24.210> he's<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.900> best<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.380> fielders

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
know he's not the best of the fielders

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.010 
know he's not the best of the fielders
I<00:01:25.950> know<00:01:26.250> his<00:01:26.549> knee<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> best

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
I know his knee is not that not the best

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.899 
I know his knee is not that not the best
so<00:01:28.200> he's<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.619> quick<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.130> some<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so he's not as quick as some of the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.280 
so he's not as quick as some of the
other<00:01:30.060> field<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> think<00:01:31.170> he's<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
other field as up but I think he's a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380 
other field as up but I think he's a
much<00:01:31.530> much<00:01:31.829> better<00:01:32.100> batsman<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.180> need

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
