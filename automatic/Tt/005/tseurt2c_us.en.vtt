00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hey yes in this video I'm going to do a

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.910 
hey yes in this video I'm going to do a
quick<00:00:02.639> review<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.510> 3x3<00:00:03.929> camouflage<00:00:04.589> cube

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
quick review of the 3x3 camouflage cube

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.740 
quick review of the 3x3 camouflage cube
by<00:00:05.040> whit<00:00:05.250> Eden<00:00:05.490> it<00:00:06.240> kind<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.450> looks<00:00:06.629> like<00:00:06.660> a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
by whit Eden it kind of looks like a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.080 
by whit Eden it kind of looks like a
weird<00:00:07.370> 3x3<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.460> has<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.670> really<00:00:08.820> tiny

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
weird 3x3 it has a really tiny

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.180 
weird 3x3 it has a really tiny
centerpiece<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.990> these<00:00:10.139> long<00:00:10.410> skinny<00:00:10.920> edge

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
centerpiece and these long skinny edge

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.490 
centerpiece and these long skinny edge
pieces<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.940> then<00:00:12.509> these<00:00:12.630> big<00:00:12.809> corner<00:00:13.170> pieces

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
pieces and then these big corner pieces

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.950 
pieces and then these big corner pieces
but<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.190> doesn't<00:00:14.490> turn<00:00:14.610> like<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> 3x3<00:00:15.480> when<00:00:15.900> you

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
but it doesn't turn like a 3x3 when you

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.500 
but it doesn't turn like a 3x3 when you
turn<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.350> see<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.680> starts<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.010> shape-shift

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
turn it you see it starts to shape-shift

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.390 
turn it you see it starts to shape-shift
it<00:00:18.510> looks<00:00:18.750> kind<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> weird<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.710> basically<00:00:20.100> what

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
it looks kind of weird so basically what

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.390 
it looks kind of weird so basically what
this<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.750> 4x4<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.890> has<00:00:23.220> been

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
this is it's a 4x4 that has been

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.640 
this is it's a 4x4 that has been
bandaged<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.090> then<00:00:24.240> extended<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.260> look<00:00:25.470> like

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
bandaged and then extended to look like

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.859 
bandaged and then extended to look like
a<00:00:25.680> 3x3<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.150> makes<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> puzzle<00:00:27.630> really

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
a 3x3 so it makes the puzzle really

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.060 
a 3x3 so it makes the puzzle really
challenging<00:00:28.500> because<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.800> can't<00:00:28.980> really

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
challenging because you can't really

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.769 
challenging because you can't really
tell<00:00:29.189> what's<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:30.510> one's<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
tell what's what this one's a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.780 
tell what's what this one's a
centerpiece<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.859> then<00:00:32.040> these<00:00:32.160> edge<00:00:32.399> pieces

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
centerpiece but then these edge pieces

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.000 
centerpiece but then these edge pieces
have<00:00:33.000> center<00:00:33.360> pieces<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.020> edge<00:00:34.320> pieces<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
have center pieces and edge pieces of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.790 
have center pieces and edge pieces of
the<00:00:35.190> 4x4<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.180> combine<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.570> together<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the 4x4 just combine it together and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.850 
the 4x4 just combine it together and
then<00:00:38.040> certain<00:00:38.340> corner<00:00:38.640> pieces<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.860> center

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
then certain corner pieces have a center

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.260 
then certain corner pieces have a center
piece<00:00:41.010> even<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:41.730> some<00:00:41.879> edge<00:00:42.000> pieces

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
piece even and then some edge pieces

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
piece even and then some edge pieces
combined<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.930> them<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:43.800> hard

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
combined with them so it's really hard

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.889 
combined with them so it's really hard
to<00:00:44.160> tell<00:00:44.280> what's<00:00:44.489> what

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
to tell what's what

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.590 
to tell what's what
whit<00:00:45.899> eaten<00:00:46.110> also<00:00:46.559> has<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> few<00:00:47.039> other

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
whit eaten also has a few other

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
whit eaten also has a few other
camouflage<00:00:48.600> cubes<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.440> 2<00:00:49.500> by<00:00:49.800> 2<00:00:49.829> by<00:00:50.129> 3

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
camouflage cubes they have a 2 by 2 by 3

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.830 
camouflage cubes they have a 2 by 2 by 3
a<00:00:50.700> 2<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:51.480> 3<00:00:51.690> by<00:00:51.719> 4<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.410> 3<00:00:53.039> by<00:00:53.190> 3<00:00:53.219> by<00:00:53.550> 4<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.510> 3<00:00:54.690> by<00:00:54.809> 3

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
a 2 by 3 by 4 a 3 by 3 by 4 and a 3 by 3

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.010 
a 2 by 3 by 4 a 3 by 3 by 4 and a 3 by 3
by<00:00:55.110> 2<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.590> they<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.510> same<00:00:57.539> style

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
by 2 and they all are the same style

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.810 
by 2 and they all are the same style
puzzle<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.710> are<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> 4<00:00:59.160> by<00:00:59.309> 4<00:00:59.340> that's<00:00:59.670> been

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
puzzle there are a 4 by 4 that's been

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
puzzle there are a 4 by 4 that's been
bandaged<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> certain<00:01:00.809> way<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.170> then

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
bandaged in a certain way and then

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.910 
bandaged in a certain way and then
extended<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.789> look<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> other<00:01:03.239> puzzle

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
extended to look like the other puzzle

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.100 
extended to look like the other puzzle
so<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.760> start<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> scramble<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.689> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
so when you start to scramble it up it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.800 
so when you start to scramble it up it
gets<00:01:07.350> pretty<00:01:07.650> blocked<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.720> eventually<00:01:09.720> you

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
gets pretty blocked and eventually you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
gets pretty blocked and eventually you
can<00:01:09.930> only<00:01:10.049> make<00:01:10.260> two<00:01:10.500> by<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:10.710> turns<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
can only make two by two turns so you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
can only make two by two turns so you
can<00:01:12.330> make<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:13.049> turn<00:01:13.320> turn<00:01:13.710> apiece

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
can make this turn turn apiece

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.160 
can make this turn turn apiece
I'm<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> can't<00:01:15.600> make<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.930> turn

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
I'm in here and you can't make this turn

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.350 
I'm in here and you can't make this turn
here<00:01:16.409> because<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.549> blocked<00:01:17.880> even<00:01:18.150> though

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
here because it's blocked even though

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
here because it's blocked even though
you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.020> way<00:01:19.229> block<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.460> way

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you can make it this way block that way

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.630 
you can make it this way block that way
and<00:01:20.850> eventually<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.259> reduces<00:01:22.799> itself<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and eventually it reduces itself down to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.410 
and eventually it reduces itself down to
a<00:01:23.670> 2<00:01:23.939> by<00:01:24.360> 2<00:01:25.250> but<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:26.970> easy<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> solve

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
a 2 by 2 but it's really easy to solve

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
a 2 by 2 but it's really easy to solve
the<00:01:27.570> corner<00:01:27.869> pieces<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.740> very<00:01:29.070> very

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the corner pieces but it's very very

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399 
the corner pieces but it's very very
difficult<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.880> solve<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> inner<00:01:30.689> edge<00:01:31.079> pieces

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
difficult to solve the inner edge pieces

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.030 
difficult to solve the inner edge pieces
and<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.430> pair<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> edges<00:01:33.979> ok<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and a pair of all with the edges ok so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.370 
and a pair of all with the edges ok so
I'm<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> size<00:01:36.240> comparison<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.930> hear

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I'm going to do a size comparison I hear

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.679 
I'm going to do a size comparison I hear
this<00:01:37.530> next<00:01:37.710> time<00:01:37.950> normal<00:01:38.310> 3x3<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.570> can

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
this next time normal 3x3 and you can

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.480 
this next time normal 3x3 and you can
see<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> exact<00:01:40.500> same<00:01:40.710> size<00:01:40.920> it's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
see it's the exact same size it's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.649 
see it's the exact same size it's
smaller<00:01:41.729> than<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.060> expecting<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.540> I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
smaller than I was expecting and I

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.840 
smaller than I was expecting and I
thought<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.930> might<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.500> same<00:01:43.740> size<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
thought it might be the same size as the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.270 
thought it might be the same size as the
mix<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.180> plus<00:01:45.390> cube<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.189> just

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
mix up plus cube but it's not it's just

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.420 
mix up plus cube but it's not it's just
the<00:01:47.490> size<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.090> normal<00:01:48.270> 3x3<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.979> mechanism

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the size of a normal 3x3 the mechanism

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.429 
the size of a normal 3x3 the mechanism
that<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:50.700> used<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.720> same<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.320> they

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that they used is the same one that they

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.530 
that they used is the same one that they
use<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.920> their<00:01:53.040> mini<00:01:53.250> 4x4<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> 46

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
use for their mini 4x4 is the 46

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.600 
use for their mini 4x4 is the 46
millimeter<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> turning<00:01:56.250> quality

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
millimeter one so the turning quality

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.389 
millimeter one so the turning quality
it's<00:01:56.850> acceptable<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.380> does<00:01:58.560> catch<00:01:58.829> quite

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
it's acceptable but it does catch quite

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.030 
it's acceptable but it does catch quite
a<00:01:59.490> bit<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:01.200> has<00:02:01.350> something<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
a bit it has something to do with the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
a bit it has something to do with the
mechanism<00:02:02.520> luckily<00:02:02.790> sure<00:02:02.969> what<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.990> corner

touch<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:05.040> bit<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:07.020> will<00:02:07.140> cut<00:02:07.290> just

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
touch just a little bit it will cut just

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.880 
touch just a little bit it will cut just
to<00:02:07.710> about<00:02:07.950> from<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.729> line<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.209> line<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:10.739> not

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
to about from a line to a line but not

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.100 
to about from a line to a line but not
one<00:02:11.129> after<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:12.239> also<00:02:12.390> depends<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:12.930> what

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
one after that it also depends on what

dealing<00:02:14.099> with<00:02:14.689> soap<00:02:15.689> we<00:02:15.810> go<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.079> way<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
dealing with soap we go this way it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.399 
dealing with soap we go this way it
doesn't<00:02:17.340> corner<00:02:17.790> test<00:02:17.969> quite<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.390> well<00:02:18.629> it's

doesn't corner test quite as well it's

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.380 
doesn't corner test quite as well it's
definitely<00:02:19.769> not<00:02:19.890> speed<00:02:20.250> solving<00:02:20.579> puzzle<00:02:20.909> so

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
definitely not speed solving puzzle so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.990 
definitely not speed solving puzzle so
corner<00:02:21.719> cutting<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.019> not<00:02:22.109> that<00:02:22.290> big<00:02:22.469> of<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.620> deal

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
corner cutting is not that big of a deal

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.490 
corner cutting is not that big of a deal
but<00:02:24.000> if<00:02:24.180> you're<00:02:24.359> interested<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.810> does<00:02:24.989> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
but if you're interested it does a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.629 
but if you're interested it does a
little<00:02:26.340> bit<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.859> found<00:02:32.189> this<00:02:32.280> puzzle

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
little bit so I found this puzzle

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.789 
little bit so I found this puzzle
incredibly<00:02:33.239> difficult<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.780> solve<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.260> solved

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
incredibly difficult to solve I solved

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.199 
incredibly difficult to solve I solved
it<00:02:34.859> once<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> first<00:02:35.609> time<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.819> solved<00:02:36.150> it

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
it once and the first time I solved it

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.089 
it once and the first time I solved it
it<00:02:36.299> was<00:02:36.389> really<00:02:36.569> easy<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.170> didn't<00:02:37.709> have<00:02:37.829> any

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
it was really easy I didn't have any

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.520 
it was really easy I didn't have any
problems<00:02:38.579> with<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:38.909> middle<00:02:39.239> layer<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:40.409> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
problems with this middle layer but the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.440 
problems with this middle layer but the
second<00:02:40.889> time<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> solved<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.730> was<00:02:42.150> able<00:02:42.299> to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
second time I solved it I was able to

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.099 
second time I solved it I was able to
get<00:02:42.599> all<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.079> corners<00:02:43.469> two<00:02:44.010> by<00:02:44.129> two<00:02:44.189> part

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
get all of the corners two by two part

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.750 
get all of the corners two by two part
done<00:02:46.109> really<00:02:46.349> quickly<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.459> took<00:02:47.609> me

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
done really quickly and it took me

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.449 
done really quickly and it took me
forever<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.450> figure<00:02:48.930> out<00:02:49.139> how<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.379> change<00:02:50.310> on

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
forever to figure out how to change on

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.509 
forever to figure out how to change on
the<00:02:50.579> center<00:02:50.849> pieces<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.620> how<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.769> do<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.250> X

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
the center pieces and how to do that X

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.940 
the center pieces and how to do that X
bearing<00:02:53.939> because<00:02:54.840> when<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.319> spindle<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.799> up

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
bearing because when you spindle it up

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.009 
bearing because when you spindle it up
obviously<00:02:56.790> stuff<00:02:57.359> starts<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.689> get<00:02:57.810> blocked

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
obviously stuff starts to get blocked

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.069 
obviously stuff starts to get blocked
pieces<00:02:58.560> get<00:02:58.709> bandaged<00:02:59.069> together<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.840> it's

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
pieces get bandaged together and it's

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.589 
pieces get bandaged together and it's
really<00:03:01.230> hard<00:03:01.469> to<00:03:01.680> figure<00:03:01.859> out<00:03:01.950> what<00:03:02.189> what

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
really hard to figure out what what

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.610 
really hard to figure out what what
because<00:03:03.599> of<00:03:03.719> the<00:03:03.810> way<00:03:03.930> they<00:03:04.139> extend<00:03:04.469> is<00:03:04.530> a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
because of the way they extend is a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.530 
because of the way they extend is a
puzzle<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:07.280> they<00:03:08.280> also<00:03:08.459> left<00:03:08.909> these<00:03:09.180> edge

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
puzzle so they also left these edge

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.839 
puzzle so they also left these edge
pieces<00:03:09.930> uncapped<00:03:10.469> all<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.980> them<00:03:11.159> look<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
pieces uncapped all of them look the

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.670 
pieces uncapped all of them look the
same<00:03:12.000> they're<00:03:12.209> all<00:03:12.359> on<00:03:12.510> caps<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.169> they're

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
same they're all on caps and they're

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.170 
same they're all on caps and they're
uncapped<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.099> both<00:03:14.280> sides<00:03:14.609> so<00:03:14.819> there's<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.120> a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
uncapped on both sides so there's just a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.759 
uncapped on both sides so there's just a
thin<00:03:15.389> piece<00:03:15.569> of<00:03:15.599> plastic<00:03:15.750> in<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.290> middle<00:03:16.560> and

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
thin piece of plastic in the middle and

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.180 
thin piece of plastic in the middle and
then<00:03:17.549> there<00:03:17.699> uncapped<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.419> both<00:03:18.690> sides<00:03:19.190> so

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
then there uncapped on both sides so

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.649 
then there uncapped on both sides so
look<00:03:20.579> what<00:03:20.729> it<00:03:20.819> looked<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.030> little<00:03:21.120> bit<00:03:21.239> nicer

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
look what it looked a little bit nicer

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.020 
look what it looked a little bit nicer
if<00:03:21.900> they<00:03:22.829> had<00:03:23.040> capped<00:03:23.280> them<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.699> they<00:03:23.879> also

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
if they had capped them and they also

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.020 
if they had capped them and they also
have<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.359> witting<00:03:24.629> logo<00:03:24.989> inside<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:26.370> it

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
have the witting logo inside but it

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.670 
have the witting logo inside but it
definitely<00:03:27.209> takes<00:03:27.810> away<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.109> little<00:03:28.379> bit<00:03:28.470> from

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
definitely takes away a little bit from

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.170 
definitely takes away a little bit from
the<00:03:28.769> aesthetics<00:03:29.159> of<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> puzzle<00:03:29.639> but<00:03:30.090> it

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
the aesthetics of the puzzle but it

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.039 
the aesthetics of the puzzle but it
doesn't<00:03:30.359> really<00:03:30.449> affect<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.810> turning

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
doesn't really affect the turning

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.420 
doesn't really affect the turning
quality<00:03:31.379> so<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.650> not<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.949> big<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.189> a<00:03:32.250> deal

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
quality so it's not that big of a deal

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.270 
quality so it's not that big of a deal
okay<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.810> what's<00:03:34.349> the<00:03:34.500> bottom<00:03:34.829> line<00:03:34.859> I

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
okay so what's the bottom line I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.429 
okay so what's the bottom line I
probably<00:03:36.120> wouldn't<00:03:36.569> recommend<00:03:36.629> this<00:03:37.079> puzzle

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 
probably wouldn't recommend this puzzle

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.949 
probably wouldn't recommend this puzzle
to<00:03:38.069> most<00:03:38.220> people<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.790> didn't<00:03:39.720> really<00:03:39.900> enjoy

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
to most people I didn't really enjoy

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.379 
to most people I didn't really enjoy
solving<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.669> that<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:41.939> a<00:03:42.090> very

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
solving it and I think that it's a very

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.759 
solving it and I think that it's a very
hard<00:03:42.720> puzzle<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.379> solve

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
hard puzzle to solve

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.309 
hard puzzle to solve
so<00:03:44.669> just<00:03:44.939> for<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.060> matter<00:03:45.299> it's<00:03:45.810> not<00:03:46.019> much

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
so just for that matter it's not much

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.899 
so just for that matter it's not much
fun<00:03:46.560> but<00:03:47.069> if<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.310> are<00:03:47.430> looking<00:03:47.579> for<00:03:47.879> a

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
fun but if you are looking for a

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.270 
fun but if you are looking for a
challenging<00:03:48.359> solve<00:03:48.629> this<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.650> definitely<00:03:49.979> one

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
challenging solve this is definitely one

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.670 
challenging solve this is definitely one
of<00:03:50.310> them<00:03:50.549> think<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.359> most<00:03:51.509> interesting<00:03:52.049> part

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
of them think the most interesting part

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.960 
of them think the most interesting part
of<00:03:52.709> this<00:03:52.829> puzzle<00:03:53.159> is<00:03:53.250> when<00:03:53.400> someone<00:03:53.699> picks<00:03:53.849> it

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
of this puzzle is when someone picks it

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.509 
of this puzzle is when someone picks it
up<00:03:54.090> expecting<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.169> to<00:03:55.259> turn<00:03:55.409> like<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> 3x3<00:03:56.370> and

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
up expecting it to turn like a 3x3 and

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.490 
up expecting it to turn like a 3x3 and
it<00:03:56.939> does<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.209> weird<00:03:57.479> shape-shifting<00:03:58.259> thing

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it does this weird shape-shifting thing

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.469 
it does this weird shape-shifting thing
it's<00:03:59.340> kind<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.609> funny<00:03:59.819> just<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.209> see<00:04:00.389> the

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
it's kind of funny just to see the

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.869 
it's kind of funny just to see the
reaction<00:04:00.930> but<00:04:01.620> other<00:04:01.829> than<00:04:01.919> that<00:04:02.009> it's<00:04:02.699> not

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
reaction but other than that it's not

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.499 
reaction but other than that it's not
all<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.090> entertaining<00:04:03.479> um<00:04:04.430> but<00:04:05.430> if<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.359> guys
