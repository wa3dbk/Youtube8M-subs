00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.170
 stories start with everything we have a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.480

 depends on whom to pronounce 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.940

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.090
 which is already the second best criterion also 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.890
