00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
allowed the possibility of losing the

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.220 
allowed the possibility of losing the
audience<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.969> stop<00:00:58.270> him<00:00:58.480> from<00:00:58.570> going<00:00:58.930> into<00:00:59.079> a

audience to stop him from going into a

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.099 
audience to stop him from going into a
material<00:00:59.620> idea<00:01:00.100> he<00:01:00.879> was<00:01:01.030> funny<00:01:01.270> with<00:01:01.449> it<00:01:01.510> but

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
material idea he was funny with it but

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.350 
material idea he was funny with it but
he<00:01:02.260> never<00:01:02.500> seemed<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:02.920> worry<00:01:03.160> like<00:01:03.399> oh<00:01:03.609> this<00:01:04.149> is

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
he never seemed to worry like oh this is

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.670 
he never seemed to worry like oh this is
beyond<00:01:04.720> where<00:01:04.960> they're<00:01:05.110> gonna<00:01:05.199> want<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.590> go

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
beyond where they're gonna want to go

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.380 
beyond where they're gonna want to go
with<00:01:05.860> me<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.189> I<00:01:06.700> think<00:01:07.060> that's<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.330> thing

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
with me and I think that's the thing

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:36.510 
with me and I think that's the thing
about<00:01:07.540> Karl<00:01:07.930> that's<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.260> best<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:35.520> actually

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
about Karl that's the best I actually

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.100 
about Karl that's the best I actually
told<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.939> city<00:01:37.150> they<00:01:37.360> want<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.659> hang<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:37.990> as

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
told the city they want to hang it as

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.410 
told the city they want to hang it as
high<00:01:38.320> as<00:01:38.350> possible<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.880> otherwise<00:01:40.180> we're

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
high as possible because otherwise we're

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.789 
high as possible because otherwise we're
gonna<00:01:40.479> be<00:01:40.600> replacing<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.200> stamp<00:01:41.439> signing

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
gonna be replacing the stamp signing

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.830 
gonna be replacing the stamp signing
every<00:01:42.070> week<00:01:42.220> I<00:01:42.490> think<00:01:43.000> once<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:43.509> get<00:01:43.659> up<00:01:43.810> there

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
every week I think once you get up there

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.690 
every week I think once you get up there
and<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.110> see<00:01:44.290> where<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.530> sign<00:01:44.799> is<00:01:44.829> hanging

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
and you see where the sign is hanging

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.630 
and you see where the sign is hanging
you<00:01:45.909> see<00:01:46.509> directly<00:01:46.960> off<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.369> behind<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.549> in

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
you see directly off the behind it in

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.880 
you see directly off the behind it in
the<00:01:48.759> park<00:01:49.060> there's<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.840> nice<00:01:50.020> little<00:01:50.200> alcove

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
the park there's a nice little alcove

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.260 
the park there's a nice little alcove
built<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.520> which<00:01:51.729> I<00:01:51.850> think<00:01:52.060> would<00:01:52.119> be<00:01:52.240> a

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
built in which I think would be a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.050 
built in which I think would be a
perfect<00:01:52.720> place<00:01:52.930> for<00:01:52.960> some<00:01:53.290> fans<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.619> get<00:01:53.770> high

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
perfect place for some fans to get high

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.120 
perfect place for some fans to get high
