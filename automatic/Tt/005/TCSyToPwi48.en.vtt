00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.870
 the police 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.439
 is considered a friend and helper 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.079
 and it will 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.079
 Mostly already for the children 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.400
 made it clear 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.919
 as a police officer 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.919
 you have to go to different places 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.739
 and helping people 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.739
 or sometimes criminals 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.539
 The police have four different ones 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.910
 vehicles 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.740
 a normal car with a blue light is probably the best known 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.530
 Have cops 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.170
 for large missions 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 again quite different and special vehicles 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 they are partly buses 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.120
 Ruiz but also off-road vehicles if, for example, at a particular 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.450
 difficult field have an employment and concern the safety of people 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.760
 have to take care of 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 In some situations, but also more unusual vehicles 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.470
 Use like motorcycles 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.470
 helicopter 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.510
 or sometimes 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.369
 will not be vehicles in the strict sense 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.090
 Nevertheless, in one or the other use 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.090
 are very useful 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
 For example, motorcycles are so popular 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.040
 because they are very fast 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.350
 and if used in the hunt for traffic offenders sometimes a motorcyclist 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.780
 is there 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.780
 It is usually much easier 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.970
 go to pick 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.430
 and to talk about when you're traveling with a motorcycle yourself 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.219
 who likes to deal with the vehicles of the police 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.479
 while 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:27.259
 many different ways to find coloring pages for it 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.179
 Of course there are also in Minden book form in different 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.649
 shops 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.979
 but also information sheets of the police themselves 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:44.059
 even for free can get percent and often have many pictures specifically 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:45.169
 for children 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:46.390
 the one as 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.679
 May buy on templates 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:51.929
 and have with it 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:55.319
 one or the other police remained to shape for themselves
