00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
same simple perhaps at the end if we

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.209 
same simple perhaps at the end if we
have<00:00:49.870> time<00:00:50.050> we<00:00:50.230> can<00:00:50.260> maybe<00:00:50.469> play<00:00:50.769> a<00:00:50.800> brief<00:00:51.039> game

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
that opportunity so but i'll see how it

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.840 
that opportunity so but i'll see how it
simply<00:00:56.710> depends<00:00:56.949> on<00:00:57.069> the<00:00:57.159> end<00:00:57.280> Ananda<00:00:57.609> just
