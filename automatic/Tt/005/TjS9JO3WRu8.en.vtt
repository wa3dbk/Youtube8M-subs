using<00:03:22.670> is<00:03:23.000> called<00:03:23.090> rosy<00:03:23.870> nude<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:24.950> think

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
using is called rosy nude and I think

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.130 
using is called rosy nude and I think
it's<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.370> really<00:03:25.400> good<00:03:25.670> everyday<00:03:26.209> color<00:03:26.569> but

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
it's a really good everyday color but

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.470 
it's a really good everyday color but
it's<00:03:27.290> also<00:03:27.560> really<00:03:28.370> appropriate<00:03:28.790> for<00:03:29.030> spring

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480

and<00:03:29.510> summer<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.230> that's<00:03:30.470> why<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:30.680> chose<00:03:30.950> this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010
