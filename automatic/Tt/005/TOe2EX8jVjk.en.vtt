 Hello everyone, today I will show you how 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.870
 properly set up your morning and xbox 360 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.789
 for comfortable work for a start I 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.110
 I recommend you read the article 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.660
 network ports 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.250
 used in xbox live in which 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.470
 described in detail the ports which 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.960
 you need to open start setting 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.449
 router for this we enter in the address 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.710
 line of your browser address of the router 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:33.720
 I use tp-link 1043 nts router 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.300
 192 168 11 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.910
 go to the redirect tab further 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.200
 select virtual servers and click 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.870
 add new entry 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.120
 virtual server in port graph 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.540
 service we write the port that we need 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.140
 open in the column ip address write address 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.290
 your his 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.750
 xbox 360 you can assign to your 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.790
 x-box 360 has the same address as mine 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.220
 the main thing that everything was within 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.040
 peer network further select 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.689
 protocol which is carried out 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.900
 connection and then press 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.900
 save 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.960
 in the same way we add all other ports 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.090
 after all the action 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.250
 will need to save all the settings it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.110
 depends on the model of the router and execute 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.750
 reboot 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.620
 and now ixbox needs to be configured 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.930
 360 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.520
 for this, go to the settings tab 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.010
 and select the system then go to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.390

 I use 8888 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.180
 and as an alternative 88 66 after 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.370
