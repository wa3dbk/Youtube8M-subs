00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.280
 all these ex ideal alto and x.com 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.509
 today I am going to present you a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.350
 new tweak that is called custom ls 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.850
 as his name indicates 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.390
 thanks to this tube you will be able 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.619
 completely change your lockscreen 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.650
 so you can see and thanks to this 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.570
 tweak I could edit the text down 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.849
 which is written so of course there is 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.800
 a lot of two tweets that you 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.239
 allow to do that but whoever has 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.710
 even more functionality 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.590
 interesting that you will be able 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.750
 add a little text just below 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.000
 so I'm going to zoom in on it and you 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.789
 can you see that I actually have two 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
 lines of text instead of a 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.750
 this famous settings that I told you 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.820
 just before here so here you can 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 see you have two lines of text so 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.280
 me for example i scored goes on is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.710
 just below mark to be x.com 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.690
 so could create small texts 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.730
 nice thanks to this tweak 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 we will go directly to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 settings and you will be able to see 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.850
 that there is now a custom section 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.010
 ls whose custom settings ls you 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.939
 have a dozen settings enough 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.070
 interesting like for example removing 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.290
 access to the camera remove access to 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.590
 notifications center in all its 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.990
 settings will be available finally are 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.200
 available for the lockscreen 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 you can still remove access to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.820
 control center remove the word slide to 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.280
 unlock or slip to unlock 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.380
 a French kidnapped clock that gets 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.229
 found on the lockscreen is just in 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.270
 below you have here both settings 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.649
 which will especially interest us the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
 first the first option 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.939
 it's innate paul legal legal text so 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.070
 that's the little text I told you 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.259
 shown just before so whoever 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.420
 just below slip for 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.259
 unlock so there I would like 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.630
 mark itunes.com then setting the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.130
 there so this one is going well then you 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.770
 allow to modify the big texts 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.099
 so what actually replaces high school for 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.180
 unlock or slide to 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:18.180
 alas if I lock my ipod you 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.329
 go see how before I 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.659
 just there goes on is just below 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.190
 itunes.com so this tweak i find 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.959
 really very interesting you can 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.450
 really change everything in your 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.799
 lockscreen damage which he misses a 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.569
 little bit I think it is missing 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.370
 some options like for example 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.069
 change the color of texts or as 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.930
 that but it's already enough 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.620
 option he offers especially for a 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.810
 free trick 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.859
 so here I advise you this one 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.019
 which is on cydia 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.239
 it's already the end of this little video 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.010
 I hope you liked it and that 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.319
