00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
by hand I can compress it quite weighs

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.860 
by hand I can compress it quite weighs
about<00:02:35.540> half<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.170> length<00:02:36.350> of<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.590> tape<00:02:37.690> if<00:02:38.690> I

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
about half the length of that tape if I

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.490 
about half the length of that tape if I
do<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.380> lock<00:02:39.590> twist<00:02:40.370> at<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.760> quarter<00:02:41.090> turn

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
do the lock twist at that quarter turn

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.470 
do the lock twist at that quarter turn
now<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.530> can't<00:02:42.980> go<00:02:43.220> more<00:02:43.460> than<00:02:43.490> about<00:02:44.120> at<00:02:44.300> eighth

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
now I can't go more than about at eighth

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.970 
now I can't go more than about at eighth
of<00:02:44.690> an<00:02:44.810> inch<00:02:46.240> so<00:02:47.240> that's<00:02:47.420> how<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.810> adjust<00:02:48.020> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980
