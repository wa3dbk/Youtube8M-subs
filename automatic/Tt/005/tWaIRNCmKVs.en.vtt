00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.970
 the crisis in the senate 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.329
 the police action 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.210
 City 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.019
 is a choral board 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.890
 It's okay that she could not even collapse. 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.700
 It's okay if I get on the walk or know how to use it with shame 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.180
 television there 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.300
 the anatel also 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.910
 still hurts 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.880
 is that what in previous years 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.800
 after a steeple of the clove is of conservation and which make the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.060
 pope will pass even because who still uses 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.410
 animation if you want to create a life-changing 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.810
 characters 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.550
 mckay helmets 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.830
 it's called making an animation video 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.280
 You need to create a story. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.380
 telling what will happen 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.970
 after that you get this story that had rahel frey a dinosaur and me 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.190
 I'm going to make roads with catholic so you can not only do it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.190
 come around 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.360
 even so 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.210
 deals with life 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.520
 the maximum 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.350
 so I think that for you 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.659
 do animation you need to film current picture of your story all that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.560
 you do on the c and your characters from your centenary work 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:30.590
 the apartment opposite 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.350
 turn the camera on 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.300
 record a little bit 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.910
 put a little bit of character 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.970
 record a little bit more 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.770
 I move a little more character 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.179
 I was waiting for you, you have to do 24 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.479
 positions to make the second animation second marine be negotiated 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.460
 sign up to roll a lot of patience and make the kneading journey have led 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.130
 to do last 15 days in the action but it is necessary that we have here highlighted 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.470
 between molding it took about two hours to make the dolls 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.560
 and to film everything for an hour and a half 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.949
 Then the first 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.990
 Parallel to this 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.640
 best adapted with the ball that was transformed persie 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:20.039
 it is true that they could and should take this into account the prospects for the year 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.039
 past 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.759
 mr 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.429

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.429
 yellow 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.669

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.669
 ah 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:49.429
 on the side 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.269
 - not to say she's not immune 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.259
 it's very good 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.919
 andrÃ© besides what you guys like animation like this 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.249
 I made the city of curitiba and head 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:04.439
 is the business many people fed the controversy because it likes to hit too much 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.709
 more 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.299
 At the same time
