you a little bit more info on every bike
but<00:00:31.570> whose<00:00:31.720> ferd<00:00:31.960> finished<00:00:32.349> second<00:00:32.710> behind

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
but whose ferd finished second behind

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.369 
but whose ferd finished second behind
the<00:00:33.040> KTM<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:33.730> Kiefer<00:00:34.629> let's<00:00:34.839> talk<00:00:34.960> about<00:00:35.110> that

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
the KTM and Kiefer let's talk about that

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.650 
the KTM and Kiefer let's talk about that
so<00:00:35.440> these<00:00:36.400> bikes<00:00:36.670> are<00:00:36.910> for<00:00:36.970> all<00:00:37.329> intents<00:00:37.629> and

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
so these bikes are for all intents and

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.780 
so these bikes are for all intents and
purposes<00:00:37.780> pretty<00:00:38.559> much<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.980> same<00:00:39.190> who<00:00:39.519> spurns

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
purposes pretty much the same who spurns

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.540 
purposes pretty much the same who spurns
built<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.089> same<00:00:40.239> factory<00:00:40.659> as<00:00:40.750> KTMs<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:42.040> lot

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
built the same factory as KTMs and a lot

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.979 
built the same factory as KTMs and a lot
of<00:00:42.670> similarities<00:00:43.210> between<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.570> two<00:00:43.690> bikes

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
of similarities between the two bikes

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.479 
of similarities between the two bikes
but<00:00:44.199> boy<00:00:44.350> they<00:00:44.500> sure<00:00:44.530> feel<00:00:44.650> different<00:00:45.220> break

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
but boy they sure feel different break

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.710 
but boy they sure feel different break
down<00:00:45.730> what<00:00:46.269> do<00:00:46.329> you<00:00:46.390> think<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.659> the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
down what do you think of the

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.299 
down what do you think of the
differences<00:00:47.140> between<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.500> two<00:00:47.620> bikes<00:00:47.800> on<00:00:48.100> the

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
differences between the two bikes on the

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.569 
differences between the two bikes on the
track<00:00:49.020> basically<00:00:50.020> uh<00:00:50.050> I<00:00:50.620> was<00:00:51.219> surprised

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
track basically uh I was surprised

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.319 
track basically uh I was surprised
actually<00:00:51.879> how<00:00:52.180> different<00:00:53.079> they<00:00:53.170> were<00:00:53.230> for<00:00:54.070> me

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
actually how different they were for me

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.729 
actually how different they were for me
the<00:00:55.329> suspension<00:00:55.809> was<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.230> first<00:00:56.440> thing<00:00:56.649> I

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
the suspension was the first thing I

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.650 
the suspension was the first thing I
noticed<00:00:57.039> that<00:00:57.219> it<00:00:57.370> was<00:00:57.519> actually<00:00:57.879> way<00:00:58.629> more

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
noticed that it was actually way more

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.099 
noticed that it was actually way more
soft<00:00:59.289> than<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.710> KTM<00:01:00.100> for<00:01:00.340> me<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.870> seemed<00:01:02.079> like

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
soft than the KTM for me it seemed like

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.959 
soft than the KTM for me it seemed like
it<00:01:02.410> rode<00:01:02.679> too<00:01:03.160> low<00:01:03.280> on<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.489> stroke<00:01:03.730> in<00:01:03.879> the

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
it rode too low on the stroke in the

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.320 
it rode too low on the stroke in the
fork<00:01:04.710> which<00:01:05.710> had<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:05.920> tendency<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.700> make<00:01:07.060> the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
fork which had a tendency to make the

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.090 
fork which had a tendency to make the
back<00:01:07.750> in<00:01:07.960> ride<00:01:08.170> high<00:01:08.350> especially<00:01:08.890> when<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.009> came

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
back in ride high especially when I came

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.350 
back in ride high especially when I came
into<00:01:09.399> corners<00:01:09.759> because<00:01:09.910> there's<00:01:10.119> so<00:01:10.240> much

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
into corners because there's so much

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.870 
into corners because there's so much
dive<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.840> fork<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.399> also<00:01:12.399> to<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.700> motor

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
dive in the fork and also to the motor

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.120 
dive in the fork and also to the motor
was<00:01:13.090> in<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.539> felt<00:01:13.780> similar<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.560> KTM<00:01:14.950> but

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
was in the felt similar to the KTM but

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.529 
was in the felt similar to the KTM but
actually<00:01:15.460> I<00:01:15.520> felt<00:01:15.789> like<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.060> was<00:01:16.149> a<00:01:16.210> little<00:01:16.420> bit

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
actually I felt like it was a little bit

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.490 
actually I felt like it was a little bit
more<00:01:16.690> rich<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.479> me<00:01:19.600> I<00:01:19.630> just<00:01:19.960> preferred<00:01:20.320> the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
more rich and to me I just preferred the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.080 
more rich and to me I just preferred the
KTM<00:01:20.890> just<00:01:21.070> because<00:01:21.280> I<00:01:21.400> could<00:01:21.549> hop<00:01:21.700> on<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:22.060> and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
KTM just because I could hop on it and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.300 
KTM just because I could hop on it and
go<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.720> felt<00:01:23.079> comfortable<00:01:23.409> I<00:01:23.710> think<00:01:24.009> the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
go and felt comfortable I think the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.859 
go and felt comfortable I think the
suspension<00:01:24.820> kind<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.119> held<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.450> bike<00:01:25.630> back<00:01:25.810> a

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
suspension kind of held this bike back a

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.450 
suspension kind of held this bike back a
little<00:01:26.020> bit<00:01:26.200> right<00:01:26.860> now<00:01:27.070> some<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.310> those

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
little bit right now some of those

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.890 
little bit right now some of those
differences<00:01:27.850> in<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.299> suspension<00:01:28.810> is

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
differences in the suspension is

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.600 
differences in the suspension is
different<00:01:29.259> valving<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.799> shock<00:01:30.040> from<00:01:30.520> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
different valving in the shock from the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.460 
different valving in the shock from the
hootsburgh<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.210> KTM<00:01:31.600> also<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.350> whose

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
hootsburgh in the KTM also the whose

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.260 
hootsburgh in the KTM also the whose
bird<00:01:32.680> has<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.979> closed<00:01:33.220> cartridge<00:01:33.700> fork<00:01:34.030> and

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
bird has the closed cartridge fork and

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.630 
bird has the closed cartridge fork and
machine<00:01:35.049> clamps<00:01:35.470> instead<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.860> cast<00:01:36.040> clamps<00:01:36.460> so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
machine clamps instead of cast clamps so

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.639 
machine clamps instead of cast clamps so
minor<00:01:37.329> differences<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:38.140> know<00:01:38.170> booth<00:01:38.409> here<00:01:38.560> we

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
minor differences you know booth here we

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.230 
minor differences you know booth here we
also<00:01:38.770> saw<00:01:39.070> whose<00:01:39.490> brick<00:01:39.729> has<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:39.909> little<00:01:40.119> bit

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
also saw whose brick has a little bit

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.870 
also saw whose brick has a little bit
bigger<00:01:40.420> tank<00:01:40.750> but<00:01:41.470> as<00:01:42.070> far<00:01:42.250> as<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.430> engine<00:01:42.729> we

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
bigger tank but as far as the engine we

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.249 
bigger tank but as far as the engine we
felt<00:01:43.149> some<00:01:43.450> differences<00:01:43.899> with<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.110> who's

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
felt some differences with the who's

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.319 
felt some differences with the who's
Burton<00:01:44.590> motor<00:01:44.740> kind<00:01:45.579> of<00:01:45.670> had<00:01:45.790> more<00:01:46.000> finicky

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
Burton motor kind of had more finicky

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.840 
Burton motor kind of had more finicky
jetting<00:01:46.750> than<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.140> KTM<00:01:47.560> can<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.490> break<00:01:48.640> down

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
jetting than the KTM can you break down

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.060 
jetting than the KTM can you break down
just<00:01:49.210> what<00:01:49.509> we<00:01:49.600> felt<00:01:49.899> there<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.469> struggle<00:01:50.979> a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
just what we felt there we struggle a

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.740 
just what we felt there we struggle a
little<00:01:51.159> bit<00:01:51.310> part<00:01:51.670> way<00:01:51.759> into<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.149> shootout

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
little bit part way into the shootout

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.350 
little bit part way into the shootout

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
with mid it was a little burbly and

jetted<00:01:55.719> around<00:01:56.049> chasing<00:01:56.380> jetting<00:01:56.829> and<00:01:56.950> it

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
jetted around chasing jetting and it

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.980 
jetted around chasing jetting and it
never<00:01:57.130> kind<00:01:57.399> of<00:01:57.460> cleaned<00:01:57.670> up<00:01:57.880> we<00:01:58.479> ended<00:01:58.899> up

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
chasing the problem down to this one of

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.550 
chasing the problem down to this one of
the<00:02:00.430> crank<00:02:00.880> steel<00:02:01.090> got<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.840> little<00:02:02.110> air<00:02:02.200> leak<00:02:02.380> in

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
the crank steel got a little air leak in

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.200 
the crank steel got a little air leak in
it<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:02.920> we<00:02:03.130> just<00:02:03.159> pulled<00:02:03.520> off<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.939> know<00:02:04.060> the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
it so we just pulled off you know the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.270 
it so we just pulled off you know the
stator<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.200> stopped<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:05.560> replace<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:06.039> it's

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
stator and stopped to replace that it's

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.709 
stator and stopped to replace that it's
like<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.399> 20<00:02:06.759> minute<00:02:06.969> job<00:02:07.119> not<00:02:07.329> that<00:02:07.450> big<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.630> deal

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
like a 20 minute job not that big a deal

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.630 
like a 20 minute job not that big a deal
sometimes<00:02:08.380> happens<00:02:08.739> on<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.009> strokes<00:02:09.280> not<00:02:09.489> that

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
sometimes happens on to strokes not that

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.080 
sometimes happens on to strokes not that
big<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.820> deal

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
big a deal

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.940 
big a deal
you<00:02:10.810> know<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:10.929> wasn't<00:02:11.079> a<00:02:11.200> bad<00:02:11.350> air<00:02:11.530> leak<00:02:11.709> so<00:02:11.860> we

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
you know it wasn't a bad air leak so we

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.890 
you know it wasn't a bad air leak so we
didn't<00:02:12.190> suck<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.340> lot<00:02:12.519> of<00:02:12.609> air<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.120> overheat

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
didn't suck a lot of air in and overheat

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.870 
didn't suck a lot of air in and overheat
it<00:02:14.019> or<00:02:14.140> anything<00:02:14.350> but<00:02:14.470> once<00:02:14.739> we<00:02:14.890> put<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.220> new

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
it or anything but once we put that new

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.030 
it or anything but once we put that new
seal<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.660> was<00:02:16.750> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
seal in and it was a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.309 
seal in and it was a
type<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.670> approaches<00:02:18.269> like<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> KTM<00:02:18.959> jetting

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
type it approaches like the KTM jetting

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.380 
type it approaches like the KTM jetting
wasn't<00:02:19.620> saying<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:20.010> bikes<00:02:20.280> are<00:02:20.700> for<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.239> most

TCU's so that cleaned up the jetting

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
although it's different

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
who do you think that bike is for in the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
who do you think that bike is for in the
end<00:02:40.379> that's<00:02:40.560> kind<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.829> for<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> guy<00:02:41.159> who

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
end that's kind of for the guy who

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220 
end that's kind of for the guy who
doesn't<00:02:41.489> want<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.819> ride<00:02:41.970> an<00:02:42.090> orange<00:02:42.359> KTM<00:02:42.810> wants

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
doesn't want to ride an orange KTM wants

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.170 
doesn't want to ride an orange KTM wants
to<00:02:43.290> be<00:02:43.379> just<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.650> hair<00:02:43.799> different<00:02:44.280> maybe<00:02:44.549> you

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
to be just a hair different maybe you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.059 
to be just a hair different maybe you
know<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.359> has<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.720> cool<00:02:45.930> composite<00:02:46.590> subframe

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
know it has that cool composite subframe

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.119 
know it has that cool composite subframe
and<00:02:47.099> it<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.939> slightly<00:02:48.689> different<00:02:49.049> but<00:02:49.590> really

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
and it is slightly different but really

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.890 
and it is slightly different but really
in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> end<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.359> dude<00:02:51.510> who<00:02:51.599> wants<00:02:51.840> a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
in the end it's for the dude who wants a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.839 
in the end it's for the dude who wants a
yellow<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:52.290> blue<00:02:52.409> bike<00:02:52.620> not<00:02:52.889> be<00:02:53.400> orange<00:02:53.670> like

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849

his<00:02:53.970> friends<00:02:54.829> definitely<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.010> didn't<00:02:56.189> I

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
his friends definitely and I didn't I

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.830 
his friends definitely and I didn't I
think<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:56.970> comparing<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.389> KTM<00:02:57.720> with

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
think just comparing the KTM with

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.659 
think just comparing the KTM with
hootsburgh<00:02:58.079> back-to-back<00:02:58.709> I'd<00:02:58.950> I'd<00:02:59.370> still

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
hootsburgh back-to-back I'd I'd still

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:00.979 
hootsburgh back-to-back I'd I'd still
buy<00:02:59.790> who's<00:03:00.030> burg<00:03:00.239> any<00:03:00.419> day<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.689> week<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
buy who's burg any day of the week I

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.960 
buy who's burg any day of the week I
think<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.319> pretty<00:03:01.530> killer<00:03:01.680> bike<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.310> you

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
think it's a pretty killer bike and you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.920 
think it's a pretty killer bike and you

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
one in a heartbeat - I think they're

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.409 
one in a heartbeat - I think they're
good<00:03:43.829> bikes<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.879> know<00:03:44.940> compared<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.329> the

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
good bikes and you know compared to the

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.780 
good bikes and you know compared to the
KTM<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:45.959> maybe<00:03:46.139> not<00:03:46.379> quite<00:03:46.799> as<00:03:47.159> refined<00:03:47.459> a

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
KTM it's maybe not quite as refined a

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.309 
KTM it's maybe not quite as refined a
package<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.419> got<00:03:48.599> some<00:03:48.900> minor<00:03:49.049> differences

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
package it's got some minor differences

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.439
