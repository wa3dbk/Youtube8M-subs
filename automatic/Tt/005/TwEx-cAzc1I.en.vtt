 on youtube and are welcome also if 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.410
 we continue and today we are going to present to you the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.190
 guide to conjugate acts I hope that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.190
 enjoy the video 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.970
 his passive and one of the skills 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.300
 Features of atrox as a champion 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.610
 what allows him to resurrect and after 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.850
 have and after they have caused 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.920
 a fatal damage while more blood 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.920
 have more life will recover atrocious 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.969
 the ability of the q turns dark is a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.829
 jump with which you can leave a 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.320
 I easily squeeze or get into a 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.180
 combat but it has a weak point 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.079
 stability because not everything is color of 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.940
 rosa is violated and in cc for those who 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.710
 They do not know are the slowdown 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.710
 stones and others 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.049
 the skill in the w is a skill 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.820
 which focuses on two phases one that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.420
 he recovers his life but he does not have a 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 extra damage and the other that take away your life 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.610
 but if you have extra damage this is 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 performs this skill they meet their 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.689
 function to the third basic attack 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.630
 It should be noted that the w in the second 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.860
 Damage phase accumulates to blood for your 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.200
 bloody well 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.869
 it is a skill in right that is 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.390
 at level I left the early game that has 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.240
 a straight range but it is worth noting 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.460
 Extra note that the more 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.880
 they will receive more damage to be told that they are 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.009
 further away 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.189
 I will read is the strongest skill of 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.810
 atrox which scale with ap but what 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.850
 more important is that it gives you 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.310
 attack speed and increases the range 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.310
 of your basic attacks, it also makes you 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.619
 the biggest sword 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.080
 who attracts you best first 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.580
 we would start with a sword of during 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.250
 a life position and then 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.140
 we would come to fight the sword of the king 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.239
 twinned buying a water saber is 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.430
 cloudy following there we should 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.380
 arming some tanks there is this 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.010
 the preference if you want to arm t1 for 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.150
 once 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.410
 I for the preferential I see the ap and already 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.390
 which consists of an appearance 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.640
 spiritual but from you would see to Mars a 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.550
 Retweet in spiritual appearance 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.310
 Give a drawing that benefits your 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.760
 cures by 20% which benefits 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.120
 your passive and your wy the really good 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.860
 that gives you a slowdown but still 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.350
 we do not arrive at the time so no 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.870
 It serves good appearance is great 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.940
 what is most useful then we would say put 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.769
 some mercury boots which you 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.349
 magic resistance and it gives you a 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.720
 protection to the axes when we already have 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.000
 All these items are recommended to go through the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.690
 king with the spiritual appearance 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.610
 depending on which we do not fight seconds 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.590
 so if we surround ourselves with a run wheel 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.610
 should die for an appearance or if not 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.700
 We fight an appearance backwards 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.010
 and finally avoid should I die for the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.890
 damage theft of life yields a seminar 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.390
 and if the game follows you have finally 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.390
 to buy a last breath 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.180
 but when we are seeing this 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.129
 too much we have to upload first the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.590
 altercation with the double always leaving 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.150
 the fault at the end but obviously there 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.980
 have to climb the r every time 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.750
 available that is to say when reading and at the level 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.750
 11 and on the 16th 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.950
 with the songs that others should have 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.420
 care are worse passion and jacques and 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.700
 with the champions that should be a 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.209
 line 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.209
 within easy quotes it would be if they are going to give 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.410
 for those who have already high level already 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.169
 advisable has always been to have a 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.229
 expertise that's why I recommend them 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.360
 96 moons recommend Armor 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.820
 damage marks and 9 resistance glyphs 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.860
 magic in addition to the 15 essences that 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.520
 it can be attack or speed damage 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.979
 also but that was the choice of gao 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.860
 Well the masters can be two 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.930
 branches the offensive masters that 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.479
 I would having 21 points of 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.060
 damage and 9 points in the defense and 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.500
 defensive expertise that are 9 votes in the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.500
 damage and 21 in defense 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.569
 and finally comes in the tips 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.939
 always try to play aggressive with your 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.169
 passive active in the case of not having your 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.509
 passive active 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.759
 it will be better to play defensive remember 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.919
 always if they're going to kill you and you have 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.779
 your passive is about spam in skills 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.409
 so that the time to use your passive 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:10.209
 you recover a lot of initial life the styfe 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:12.819
 team fight for those who do not know are the 

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:16.589
 team fights with your cv well what 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.589
 dark and you are slaughter
