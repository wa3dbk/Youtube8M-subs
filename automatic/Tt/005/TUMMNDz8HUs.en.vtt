what's<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.830> lighting<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.370> difficult<00:01:16.850> but<00:01:16.970> you

what's the lighting is difficult but you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.380 
what's the lighting is difficult but you
can<00:01:18.580> see<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:19.840> what<00:01:20.840> is<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.850> what<00:01:22.850> is<00:01:22.910> that

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
can see that what is that what is that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.859 
can see that what is that what is that
like<00:01:23.720> she's<00:01:24.530> got<00:01:24.650> an<00:01:24.740> even<00:01:24.979> closer<00:01:25.340> view

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:44.350 

really<00:01:29.869> is<00:01:30.909> consistent<00:01:33.190> every<00:01:34.190> cell

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.060 

Mojo's<00:01:45.050> for<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
Mojo's for the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.880 
Mojo's for the
never<00:01:47.640> work<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.120> but<00:01:48.300> it's

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.469 

first<00:01:52.250> thing<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.579> sort<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:53.000> thought<00:01:53.299> was

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
first thing that sort of I thought was

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.240 
first thing that sort of I thought was
smell<00:01:53.840> could<00:01:54.110> be<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.320> ashes<00:01:54.740> maybe<00:01:55.009> there's

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
smell could be the ashes maybe there's

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.050 
smell could be the ashes maybe there's
some<00:01:55.460> ashes

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
some ashes

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.249 
some ashes
you<00:01:56.420> know<00:01:56.509> flew<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.350> but<00:01:58.540> this<00:01:59.540> is<00:01:59.600> everywhere

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
you know flew in but this is everywhere

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.350 
you know flew in but this is everywhere
I'm<00:02:00.470> talking<00:02:00.920> across<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.430> entire<00:02:01.729> time<00:02:02.030> and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
I'm talking across the entire time and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.020 
I'm talking across the entire time and
quite<00:02:03.049> consistently<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:04.039> know<00:02:04.159> it's<00:02:04.460> ashes

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
quite consistently you know it's ashes

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.219 
quite consistently you know it's ashes
would<00:02:05.210> not<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:08.030> I'm<00:02:08.300> thinking<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:08.899> must<00:02:09.019> be

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
would not so I'm thinking it must be

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.009 
would not so I'm thinking it must be
some<00:02:09.470> sort<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.800> fungus<00:02:10.369> or<00:02:10.819> even<00:02:11.810> though<00:02:11.900> the

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
some sort of fungus or even though the

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.949 
some sort of fungus or even though the
frame<00:02:12.349> seems<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.860> be<00:02:12.980> quite<00:02:13.250> healthy<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:14.060> I

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
frame seems to be quite healthy and I

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.449

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
look out for something or treat the bees

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.440 
look out for something or treat the bees
or<00:02:31.630> what<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.959> this

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.619 

the<00:02:37.960> height<00:02:38.170> was<00:02:38.410> really<00:02:38.710> too

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.550 

it's<00:02:42.170> warm<00:02:42.469> on<00:02:42.590> me<00:02:42.829> but<00:02:43.069> I<00:02:44.019> thought<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.079> better

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
it's warm on me but I thought I better

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.220 
it's warm on me but I thought I better
pull<00:02:45.799> this<00:02:45.889> out<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.540> check<00:02:47.540> with<00:02:47.719> someone

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
pull this out and check with someone

00:02:48.230 --> 00:03:04.570 
pull this out and check with someone
that<00:02:48.469> knows

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.550 

so<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:06.230> possible<00:03:06.860> they<00:03:07.010> could<00:03:07.250> be<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:08.560> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
so this possible they could be the the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.990 
so this possible they could be the the
ashes<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:10.640> i'ma<00:03:10.910> say<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:12.920> consistent

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.780 

let<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.120> cross<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.450> whole<00:03:18.790> frame<00:03:21.520> it's<00:03:22.520> not<00:03:22.700> on

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
let it cross the whole frame it's not on

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.550 
let it cross the whole frame it's not on
the<00:03:22.910> pollen<00:03:23.240> it's<00:03:23.510> not<00:03:23.720> anywhere<00:03:24.140> else<00:03:24.230> I'm
