you a review of the Rubik's lingyun

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.299 
you a review of the Rubik's lingyun
version<00:00:04.020> 2<00:00:04.200> so<00:00:04.620> let's<00:00:05.279> get<00:00:05.430> right<00:00:05.580> into<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.879> so

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
version 2 so let's get right into it so

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:15.410 
version 2 so let's get right into it so
pieces<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:11.750> almost<00:00:12.750> exactly<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.559> same<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:14.420> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
pieces is almost exactly the same to the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.810 
pieces is almost exactly the same to the
this<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.379> dayan<00:00:17.010> guhong<00:00:17.039> by<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> way<00:00:18.560> so

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
this is the dayan guhong by the way so

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.970 
this is the dayan guhong by the way so
it's<00:00:20.820> almost<00:00:21.270> exactly<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.199> same<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.800> just

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
it's almost exactly the same it just

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.700 
it's almost exactly the same it just
looks<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.430> bit<00:00:23.640> different<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
looks a little bit different because the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.210 
looks a little bit different because the
dayan<00:00:26.550> guhong<00:00:26.580> does<00:00:27.060> not<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> torpedoes

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
dayan guhong does not have the torpedoes

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.549 
dayan guhong does not have the torpedoes
but<00:00:31.369> yeah<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:32.669> look<00:00:33.020> almost<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.380> that's

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
but yeah they look almost like that's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
but yeah they look almost like that's
exactly<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> same<00:00:35.340> let's<00:00:36.090> go<00:00:36.300> over<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
exactly the same let's go over the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.260 
exactly the same let's go over the
corners<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.989> corners<00:00:40.379> also<00:00:40.530> look<00:00:41.270> exactly

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
corners the corners also look exactly

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:53.360 
corners the corners also look exactly
the<00:00:42.300> same<00:00:47.660> um<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:50.280> comparison<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.309> guy<00:00:53.309> on

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the same um so comparison to the guy on

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.080 
the same um so comparison to the guy on
goo<00:00:53.699> hyung<00:00:53.940> i<00:00:54.239> would<00:00:54.510> say<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.640> lubick

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
goo hyung i would say that a the lubick

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
goo hyung i would say that a the lubick
sling<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> definitely<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> lot<00:00:58.500> faster<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
sling you is definitely a lot faster and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.000 
sling you is definitely a lot faster and
the<00:00:59.719> corner<00:01:00.719> cutting<00:01:00.930> i<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> bit

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the corner cutting i think is a bit

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.570 
the corner cutting i think is a bit
better<00:01:02.160> than<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.090> loop<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:04.040> but<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> Gulag

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
better than the loop on but the Gulag

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.050 
better than the loop on but the Gulag
has<00:01:06.530> more<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.280> lot<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.430> smoother

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
has more it's more a lot more smoother

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
has more it's more a lot more smoother
and<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:09.900> control<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> i<00:01:13.530> would

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and has a lot more control so i would

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.700 
and has a lot more control so i would
say<00:01:13.890> i'm<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> rough<00:01:14.970> cuber<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.630> i<00:01:15.720> tend<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> favor

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
say i'm a rough cuber so i tend to favor

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.030 
say i'm a rough cuber so i tend to favor
the<00:01:17.100> goo<00:01:17.580> hyung<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.240> bit<00:01:18.330> more<00:01:18.570> than<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
the goo hyung a little bit more than the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.520 
the goo hyung a little bit more than the
immune<00:01:21.110> but<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.590> seems<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.100> lot<00:01:23.250> faster<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
immune but this seems a lot faster and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.960 
immune but this seems a lot faster and
right<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:25.650> i'm<00:01:25.799> working<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.280> getting<00:01:26.460> my<00:01:26.700> time

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
right now i'm working on getting my time

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.920 
right now i'm working on getting my time
down<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.290> i<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.710> use<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:29.970> than<00:01:30.000> this

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.960 

wait<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> before<00:01:35.310> i<00:01:35.369> bought<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.640> cube<00:01:35.880> i

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
wait so I before i bought this cube i

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.640 
wait so I before i bought this cube i
looked<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.479> forums<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.170> everyone<00:01:37.560> is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
looked up on forums and everyone is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.490 
looked up on forums and everyone is
saying<00:01:37.829> yeah<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.460> cube<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.320> really<00:01:40.320> heavy

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
saying yeah this cube is really heavy

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
saying yeah this cube is really heavy
compared<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.400> dive<00:01:41.579> daughter<00:01:41.939> down<00:01:42.210> cubes

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
compared to the dive daughter down cubes

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
compared to the dive daughter down cubes
because<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> torpedoes<00:01:44.340> inside<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
because of the torpedoes inside of it

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
because of the torpedoes inside of it
but<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.380> i<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.189> actually

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
but now that i got it it actually

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.630 
but now that i got it it actually
doesn't<00:01:48.479> feel<00:01:48.990> any<00:01:49.320> heavier<00:01:49.890> than<00:01:50.070> time<00:01:50.369> goo

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
doesn't feel any heavier than time goo

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.899 
doesn't feel any heavier than time goo
hyung<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.720> feels<00:01:52.619> exactly<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.280> same<00:01:53.579> i<00:01:53.610> don't

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
hyung it feels exactly the same i don't

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.620 
hyung it feels exactly the same i don't
know<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.689> were<00:01:54.750> talking<00:01:54.810> about

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
know what they were talking about

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.350 
know what they were talking about
smoothness<00:01:57.680> crispiness<00:01:58.680> um<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.700> Q<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
smoothness crispiness um this Q is

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.980 
smoothness crispiness um this Q is
definitely<00:02:00.780> more<00:02:01.820> crispy<00:02:02.820> than<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.840> can

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
definitely more crispy than this you can

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.990 
definitely more crispy than this you can
tell

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
tell

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.930 
tell
noise<00:02:06.520> from<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.580> torpedoes<00:02:08.390> inside<00:02:08.720> this

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
noise from the torpedoes inside this

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.970 
noise from the torpedoes inside this
cutting<00:02:10.940> ok<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:12.230> I'm<00:02:12.320> going<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.500> be<00:02:12.590> showing

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
cutting ok so I'm going to be showing

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.350 
cutting ok so I'm going to be showing
you<00:02:13.220> cutting<00:02:14.060> for<00:02:14.240> both<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.570> these<00:02:14.660> cubes<00:02:15.250> so

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
you cutting for both of these cubes so

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.670 
you cutting for both of these cubes so
let's<00:02:17.360> just<00:02:17.600> work<00:02:17.900> our<00:02:18.050> way<00:02:18.080> from<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.320> bottom

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
let's just work our way from the bottom

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.420 
let's just work our way from the bottom
and<00:02:18.830> go<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.130> top<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:20.230> put<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:24.610> hit<00:02:25.610> 45

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
and go to the top so put that hit 45

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.520 
and go to the top so put that hit 45
well<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.880> little<00:02:28.970> bit<00:02:29.420> over<00:02:29.690> 45<00:02:30.140> it'll

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
well this is a little bit over 45 it'll

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.530 
well this is a little bit over 45 it'll
still<00:02:30.830> cut<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.220> let's<00:02:32.030> try<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.240> little<00:02:32.390> bit

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
still cut that let's try a little bit

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.800 
still cut that let's try a little bit
off<00:02:32.740> yeah<00:02:33.740> if<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.730> push<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.240> will<00:02:35.330> cut<00:02:35.600> that

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
off yeah if you push it it will cut that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.500 
off yeah if you push it it will cut that
too<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.340> corner<00:02:37.670> cutting<00:02:37.850> on<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.150> cube

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
too so the corner cutting on this cube

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.770 
too so the corner cutting on this cube
is<00:02:38.920> really<00:02:39.920> good<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.450> can't<00:02:41.450> stress<00:02:41.750> that

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
is really good I can't stress that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:52.840 
is really good I can't stress that
enough<00:02:42.430> let's<00:02:43.430> see<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.850> GU<00:02:44.330> home<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.520> tends

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
enough let's see the GU home so it tends

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.560 
enough let's see the GU home so it tends
to<00:02:53.209> get<00:02:53.300> stuck<00:02:53.360> at<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.080> 45<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:59.000> cube<00:02:59.330> can

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
to get stuck at the 45 so this cube can

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.449 
to get stuck at the 45 so this cube can
obviously<00:03:00.230> cut<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> little<00:03:00.800> bit<00:03:00.950> more<00:03:01.160> than<00:03:01.340> the

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
obviously cut a little bit more than the

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.400 
obviously cut a little bit more than the
pill<00:03:01.820> home<00:03:02.770> so<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:05.480> linnean<00:03:05.870> will<00:03:06.020> cut<00:03:06.230> up

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
pill home so the linnean will cut up

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.199 
pill home so the linnean will cut up
maybe<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.770> little<00:03:06.830> bit<00:03:07.130> more<00:03:07.280> than<00:03:07.459> 45<00:03:07.850> degrees

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
maybe a little bit more than 45 degrees

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.030 
maybe a little bit more than 45 degrees
if<00:03:08.300> you<00:03:08.420> push<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.049> dayan<00:03:09.440> guhong<00:03:09.560> will

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
if you push it and the dayan guhong will

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.539 
if you push it and the dayan guhong will
cut<00:03:10.250> 45<00:03:10.790> degrees<00:03:11.180> if<00:03:11.209> you<00:03:11.450> push<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.950> pop<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.190> so

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
cut 45 degrees if you push it pop in so

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.070 
cut 45 degrees if you push it pop in so
when<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.700> first<00:03:13.880> got<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.239> fuel<00:03:14.540> I<00:03:14.690> got<00:03:14.840> out<00:03:15.049> of

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
when I first got this fuel I got out of

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.720 
when I first got this fuel I got out of
the<00:03:15.230> box<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.799> was<00:03:15.890> like<00:03:16.010> dude<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:16.549> is

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
the box and I was like dude this is

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.970 
the box and I was like dude this is
pretty<00:03:16.790> good<00:03:17.120> period<00:03:17.450> smooth<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.080> it's<00:03:18.200> soft

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
pretty good period smooth and it's soft

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.310 
pretty good period smooth and it's soft
smooth<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.340> crispy<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:19.760> it's<00:03:20.000> fast<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:21.170> I

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
smooth is crispy and it's fast and I

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.340 
smooth is crispy and it's fast and I
think<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.650> like<00:03:21.799> it<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:22.900> but<00:03:23.900> then<00:03:24.049> I<00:03:24.080> began

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
think I like it and but then I began

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.650 
think I like it and but then I began
solving<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.250> every<00:03:25.760> maybe<00:03:26.090> one<00:03:26.510> out<00:03:26.630> of

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
solving it and every maybe one out of

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.750 
solving it and every maybe one out of
five<00:03:26.840> solves<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.500> would<00:03:27.620> pop<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.190> pieces<00:03:28.519> go

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
five solves it would pop and pieces go

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.259 
five solves it would pop and pieces go
flying<00:03:29.060> everywhere<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:31.459> was<00:03:31.820> not<00:03:32.060> good

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
flying everywhere and that was not good

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.680 
flying everywhere and that was not good
so<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.930> took<00:03:33.049> off<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.590> center<00:03:33.860> caps<00:03:34.450> like<00:03:35.450> this

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
so I took off the center caps like this

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.140 
so I took off the center caps like this
you<00:03:36.049> can<00:03:36.200> just<00:03:36.380> pry<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:36.860> put<00:03:37.489> your<00:03:37.940> thumb

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
you can just pry and put your thumb

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.009 
you can just pry and put your thumb
there<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:38.480> take<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:38.810> out<00:03:38.989> I<00:03:40.690> had<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.810> readjust

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
there and take it out I had to readjust

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.710 
there and take it out I had to readjust
attention<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.860> right<00:03:43.820> now<00:03:43.970> it's<00:03:44.150> quite<00:03:44.390> tight

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
attention and right now it's quite tight

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.170 
attention and right now it's quite tight
but<00:03:45.290> i<00:03:45.500> don't<00:03:45.769> think<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.700> tightness<00:03:47.000> of

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
but i don't think the tightness of

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.890 
but i don't think the tightness of
booing<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.970> affected<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.090> performance<00:03:50.660> of

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
booing you affected the performance of

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.900 
booing you affected the performance of
when<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.680> was<00:03:51.799> loose<00:03:52.040> like<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.430> feels<00:03:52.610> exactly

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
when it was loose like it feels exactly

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.699 
when it was loose like it feels exactly
the<00:03:53.120> same<00:03:53.390> news<00:03:53.660> lewis<00:03:54.019> it<00:03:54.110> just<00:03:54.260> doesn't<00:03:54.560> pop
