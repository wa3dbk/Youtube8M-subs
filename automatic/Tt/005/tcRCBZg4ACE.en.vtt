00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.770 

difficulty<00:02:12.700> i'm<00:02:12.790> going<00:02:12.909> to<00:02:13.000> set<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.329> moderate

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
difficulty i'm going to set to moderate

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.860 
difficulty i'm going to set to moderate
I've<00:02:13.959> played<00:02:14.739> easy<00:02:15.069> and<00:02:15.310> easiest<00:02:15.579> a<00:02:15.909> lot<00:02:16.180> so

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
I've played easy and easiest a lot so

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.240 
I've played easy and easiest a lot so
I'm<00:02:16.959> seeing<00:02:17.260> how<00:02:17.379> much<00:02:17.530> different<00:02:17.709> moderate

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
I'm seeing how much different moderate

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.319 
I'm seeing how much different moderate
is<00:02:19.019> so<00:02:20.640> maybe<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.670> little<00:02:21.849> bit<00:02:22.030> more<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.269> a

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
is so maybe a little bit more of a

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:29.900 
is so maybe a little bit more of a
challenge<00:02:22.359> and<00:02:23.049> it's<00:02:23.590> let's<00:02:23.769> play

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:39.220 

let's<00:02:30.910> begin

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.260 

now<00:04:12.770> my<00:04:12.890> game<00:04:13.190> audio<00:04:13.550> is<00:04:13.580> awful<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.030> don't<00:04:14.210> know

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
now my game audio is awful I don't know

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.660 
now my game audio is awful I don't know
what<00:04:14.390> that<00:04:14.450> is<00:04:14.600> if<00:04:15.140> it's<00:04:15.320> something<00:04:15.650> there<00:04:16.640> I

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
what that is if it's something there I

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.370 
what that is if it's something there I
don't<00:04:17.030> know<00:04:17.120> if<00:04:17.239> it's<00:04:17.360> off<00:04:17.540> in<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.870> video<00:04:18.140> or

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
don't know if it's off in the video or

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.229 
don't know if it's off in the video or
if<00:04:18.470> it's<00:04:18.620> because<00:04:18.980> I'm<00:04:19.459> recording<00:04:19.790> while<00:04:20.120> I'm

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
if it's because I'm recording while I'm

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.820 
if it's because I'm recording while I'm
making<00:04:20.390> this<00:04:21.550> so<00:04:22.550> my<00:04:23.110> audio<00:04:24.110> might<00:04:24.290> be<00:04:24.440> off<00:04:24.530> but

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
making this so my audio might be off but

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.300 
making this so my audio might be off but
we<00:04:25.010> do<00:04:25.190> research<00:04:25.550> some<00:04:25.850> technologies<00:04:26.540> here

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
we do research some technologies here

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.470 
we do research some technologies here
which<00:04:28.310> I<00:04:28.430> won't<00:04:28.610> do<00:04:28.700> in<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:28.880> future<00:04:29.030> I'll<00:04:29.270> cut

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
which I won't do in the future I'll cut

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.570 
which I won't do in the future I'll cut
the<00:04:29.630> researching<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.200> technologies<00:04:31.130> library

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
the researching of technologies library

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.810 
the researching of technologies library
out<00:04:31.730> later<00:04:32.180> on<00:04:32.210> but<00:04:33.110> temple<00:04:33.650> which<00:04:33.860> gives<00:04:34.700> us

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
out later on but temple which gives us

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.950 
out later on but temple which gives us
wealth<00:04:36.820> we<00:04:37.820> can't<00:04:38.180> build<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.420> pharak<00:04:38.750> shadow

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
wealth we can't build a pharak shadow

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.130 
wealth we can't build a pharak shadow
fortune<00:04:39.440> so<00:04:39.740> we'll<00:04:40.490> go<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.670> tower<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.840> defend

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
fortune so we'll go to tower to defend

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.010 
fortune so we'll go to tower to defend
our<00:04:42.260> city<00:04:43.000> which<00:04:44.000> we<00:04:44.180> only<00:04:44.330> need<00:04:44.480> is<00:04:44.570> offended

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
our city which we only need is offended

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.160 
our city which we only need is offended
right<00:04:45.110> now<00:04:45.350> first<00:04:46.100> few<00:04:46.780> ages<00:04:47.780> are<00:04:47.960> just

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
right now first few ages are just

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.750 
right now first few ages are just
building<00:04:48.410> up<00:04:48.680> there's<00:04:48.980> really<00:04:49.190> no<00:04:49.370> attacks

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
building up there's really no attacks

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.439 
building up there's really no attacks
from<00:04:50.210> what<00:04:50.390> I've<00:04:50.510> seen

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.830 

so<00:04:54.289> we're<00:04:54.379> going<00:04:54.439> to<00:04:54.559> build<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.800> tower<00:04:55.069> there

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
so we're going to build a tower there

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:16.610 
so we're going to build a tower there
says<00:04:56.840> scout<00:04:57.169> out<00:04:57.349> to<00:04:57.529> explore<00:04:57.919> a<00:04:57.979> little<00:04:58.189> bit

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.870 

you

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.850 

create<00:05:23.880> a<00:05:23.910> couple<00:05:24.120> more<00:05:24.390> set<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.050> settings<00:05:25.380> to

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
create a couple more set of settings to

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:34.980 
create a couple more set of settings to
help<00:05:26.850> out<00:05:27.000> with<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.270> work

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.990 

blew<00:05:35.710> another<00:05:35.830> lumber<00:05:36.280> camp<00:05:36.520> so<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:36.850> can<00:05:36.940> get

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
blew another lumber camp so you can get

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.570 
blew another lumber camp so you can get
more<00:05:37.060> timber<00:05:37.450> output<00:05:38.070> because<00:05:39.070> the<00:05:39.250> first<00:05:39.490> one

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
more timber output because the first one

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:53.950 
more timber output because the first one
isn't<00:05:39.850> getting<00:05:40.270> that<00:05:40.510> punch

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.530 

we<00:05:54.960> can<00:05:55.110> build<00:05:55.260> morsi's<00:05:55.830> well<00:05:56.700> as<00:05:56.940> its<00:05:57.150> tone<00:05:57.390> us

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
we can build morsi's well as its tone us

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.260 
we can build morsi's well as its tone us
to<00:05:57.720> but<00:05:57.870> we<00:05:58.020> can't<00:05:58.230> so<00:05:59.780> still<00:06:00.780> can't<00:06:00.990> build<00:06:01.230> any

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
to but we can't so still can't build any

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.540 
to but we can't so still can't build any
military<00:06:03.270> buildings<00:06:06.860> can't<00:06:07.860> research<00:06:08.100> silver

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
military buildings can't research silver

military buildings can't research silver
civic<00:06:09.000> cedar<00:06:10.730> so<00:06:11.730> what<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:11.970> market<00:06:13.130> market<00:06:14.130> will

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
civic cedar so what a market market will

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.500 
civic cedar so what a market market will
give<00:06:14.430> us<00:06:14.580> some<00:06:14.910> I<00:06:15.860> think<00:06:16.860> it's<00:06:17.070> I<00:06:17.490> get<00:06:18.270> produced

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
give us some I think it's I get produced
