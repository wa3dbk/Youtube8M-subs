00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.640
 hello how about friends copulate I am your 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.519
 friend and good today I bring you another one 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.539
 is small because we can not call the 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:17.429
 tutorial or any recommendation for in 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.429
 this case the xbox 360 console 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.200
 and well now I'll show you 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.330
 this right now I just did nothing 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.760
 more was pure curiosity and good you 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.160
 Many already know maybe not many or 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.160
 many may have the curiosity or 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.860
 they want to try but they do not know if 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.130
 to work or not in this case because with 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:43.480
 he is a hard drive of computers to 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:46.809
 is 80 gigs and good as you can see 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.640
 I have connected to xbox 30 as you see here 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.080
 the xbox detects me more simply 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.080
 as a usb device 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.790
 however without expression there 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.680
 this as you see I detected up to 32 GB 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.670
 and as you see I will be able to use that disk 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.330
 hard as storage for the xbox of 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.390
 60 I do not need it since I have 250 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.360
 gb in the console 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.610
 but hey, it was just a 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.620
 in this 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.010
 something that I wanted to show you in case 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.860
 someone who sees the video because no no 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.520
 Do not know if I'm going to work or I do not know 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.540
 if it works with sata hard drives 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.270
 exact and of 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.370
 however you can try as you see in 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.270
 this case I am using a 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.270
 converter 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.439
 no this is normal do not turn on and that 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.189
 hard drive since that hard drive consumes 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.980
 12 volts 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.800
 3 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.640
 and he bielsa is therefore transporting 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.230
 only 5 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.820
 and good friends that has been all 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.250
 and then I hope and encourage you to use your 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.500
 hard drive as storage as you see 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.290
 here it is 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.460
 31 extra gigas 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.970
 for your xbox 360 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.970
 goodbye
