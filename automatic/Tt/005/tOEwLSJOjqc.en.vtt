00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 people at ahrensburg atx me here 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.270
 welcome to the fortieth episode of way 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.370
 in league one in fifa 10 ultimate team 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.630
 we are already quite close to each other 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.010
 Incidentally, in this episode can already 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.599
 climb and secure 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.400
 have this need with two victories then 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.890
 We total 19 points from the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
 needed 18 for the climb and we 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.609
 need 21 for the league title and up 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.740
 By the way, four games of time so that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.330
 whole is still feasible and after that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.609
 we are in league 1 but are already united 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.199
 almost finished with the series earlier 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.760
 as I would have thought even on everyone 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.590
 now our team is about transfers 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.059
 I'll take care of this consequence 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.840
 hit me some players for the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.430
 bundesliga 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.200
 and yes with the team if I am now too 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.700
 In the last episode, one has me 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 has pisczek pretty well worked out a 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.910
 a bit wobbly, maybe he plays 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.789
 now a little bit better who knows 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.809
 but we see whole now and that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.079
 our first opponent a 79 team 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.449
 pakistani not an ivory coast 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.820
 I have never seen him deep 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.949
 except for the goalkeeper and I am 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.559
 curious what momentum is doing here now 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.960
 please press it so go 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.960
 to swing the thing home safely 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.820
 that was shit and pretty close now 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:22.430
 long though he already stood in the offside 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:25.980
 offside and hepp and tor 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.230
 I just love these free kicks 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.430
 any one of them is always there to 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.630
 example, our head at best 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.400
 otherwise somehow goes forward 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.940
 not really much, usually not 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.970
 fast enough 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.380
 Somehow in this game nothing out of the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.380
 Midfield back and forth all the time 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:57.190
 yes, and to zero so if I have 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.620
 When it gets really frosty it will be deadly 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.440
 and maybe refill after that 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.270
 would like to play a bit more tired 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:12.710
 or others exchange the fitness 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:17.660
 stays up near the top so and so 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:21.080
 over and lewandowski beast cares 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.370
 traditionally three times lewandowski okay 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.530
 the thing continues a bit simply 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.950
 was just a flank in the room 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.560
 i think i'll be there half summer 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.900
 we should be allowed to change two 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.800
 who have not played in a long time and 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.570
 though draxler and volland repetition 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.780
 from the first gate maybe without reus 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:46.840
 but makes peace with checkbook or 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.840
 not lewandowski 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:56.769
 that was it, shoot it now 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.769
 the ad already there 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.310
 no player back there that was 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.500
 actually that was fair 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.830
 that was just the way it was pushed 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.720
 we do not have it after and now 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.950
 please, please, please, please, thank you 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.950
 to go on tour with crawls 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.019
 What was that again? 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.700
 the tipping offs were mysterious 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.840
 mysterious way always about everything 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.840
 yes supposedly not a foul 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.600
 well 3 1 still say brave 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.440
 no, nothing more open actually that 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.690
 I can not lose that thing anymore 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.570
 he did well 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.200
 gone over in the perfect moment and 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:57.840
 he needs thousands of repetitions to 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:05.370
 forlán an online i could have just aired 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:13.610
 I can look out for the goalkeeper now 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:16.769
 but yes probably 421 closes the matchup 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.209
 Mühlentor not at all if the pasta 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.830
 has made 4 1 won 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.930
 on to the next match that is not in 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.260
 too strong opponents of the team and that 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.240
 was actually quite match would 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.330
 say so it was really almost only in the 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.700
 middlefield here somehow so gebolze and 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.200
 more not so two more points for 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.560
 the safe climb and we have three 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.360
 play for time so we should 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.830
 but create directly with the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.470
 same position goes to the next 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:51.120
 let's see what we have now as a match 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.919
 opponents a 84er team also wants to 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.340
 quite strong out of here two team up 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.260
 these three in the form falcao and storm 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.120
 balotelli in the storm that's just fine 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.130
 Chiellini is that I think back there 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.190
 he is also damn strong I know 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:11.390
 not like a goal has determined from what 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:11.390
 it goes up 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:26.759
 fast track and match earlier and and 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.470
 hepp and two minutes 53 this time 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:32.130
 played and then there was the first goal 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.650
 just the right you sokratis with the 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.100
 right foot have your header 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.050
 made 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.979
 first fell 2 was refilling and then 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.550
 we can be a bit quieter again 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.169
 play 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.680
 oh yes, robin who can do that 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.860
 to run 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.710
 why hours off hard why stops clock 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.240
 were so strong a rehearsing what is that supposed to be 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.669
 So I do not know what the type of 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.750
 ball possession has but currently makes it 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:03.150
 No gates at them so halfway to one 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.610
 null the type I do not know the 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.840
 is probably on ball possession 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.490
 But what does not shoot goals is 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.110
 everything okay if I have time 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.710
 curious I guess has 80 percent 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.020
 in possession 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.550
 because it all the time just because every now and 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.550
 back and forth 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.710
 after 73 so I have now massive 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.300
 brought since the medium medium working 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.820
 Guess has not been high as well 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.690
 mandzukic if you moved I was the whole 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.580
 time behind 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.659
 I did not know how to do that 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.659
 could r died 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:39.169
 and yet we must make tor makes of 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.090
 samples with distance that 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.319
 most boring match gasquet I have got 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.469
 the whole thing just has to be careful that he 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.789
 not rudimentary and I dangerous close 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:49.009
 the MainTor header the whole page 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.719
 down land always play back and forth 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.509
 so slowly he comes in vision more often 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:55.099
 in the foreground, as slowly as he said it 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.389
 the building probably only in ours 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.289
 she stands here in the last minute 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.449
 still do with them 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.819
 have another gate then this is here 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.069
 not quite as tight as it is 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.389
 the video is a bit more exciting 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.550
 not a bit better what again not ban 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.080
 it is exciting for me but me 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.529
 We do not want good chances 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.770
 arise 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:14.770
 what was that 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.710
 collapse collapse at once 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:23.159
 The last minute you can not 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.159
 play football more 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.750
 so they were great then my game 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:32.830
 jerky unlearning the football 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.139
 This is awesome 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.729
 which I have to completely defensive already 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.800
 because he is only in the head around 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:40.990
 Danced to a defense was again 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.580
 on the median line but felt on the 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.810
 somehow they were 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.430
 full-backs have at the 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.300
 defenders advantage one lies on 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.479
 the right side 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.830
 that was an officially shitty one 

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:53.080
 match feels worse than one 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.449
 defeat such a point still for the 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.530
 rise and four for the league title that 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:58.750
 We'll do the whole thing in the next one 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.919
 follow and thank you for watching 

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.539
 if you like it, do not forget 

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.860
 that we have a thumbs up too 

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:04.539
 rate and then you see yourself 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.639
 hopefully with a few exciting ones in it 

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:09.840
 matches in the next episode because of this 

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:09.840
 it was kinda weird
