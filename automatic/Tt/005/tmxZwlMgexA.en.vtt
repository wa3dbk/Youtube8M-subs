00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
she did salsa I have ballroom training

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.430 
she did salsa I have ballroom training
but<00:01:42.130> I'm<00:01:42.459> not<00:01:42.759> trained<00:01:43.000> in<00:01:43.090> salsa<00:01:43.440> just

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
but I'm not trained in salsa just

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.139 
but I'm not trained in salsa just
because<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.799> focused<00:01:45.340> on<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.580> International

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
because I focused on the International

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.169 
because I focused on the International
styles<00:01:46.539> so<00:01:47.380> salsa<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.159> was<00:01:48.310> sort<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:48.880> in<00:01:49.030> my

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
styles so salsa it was sort of in my

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.770 
styles so salsa it was sort of in my
genre<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:50.619> really<00:01:51.039> but<00:01:51.220> sorta<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.390> felt<00:01:52.689> a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
genre not really but sorta so I felt a

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.469 
genre not really but sorta so I felt a
little<00:01:52.929> bit<00:01:53.110> more<00:01:53.289> comfortable<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:55.299> just

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
little bit more comfortable it just

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.609 
little bit more comfortable it just
takes<00:01:55.599> a<00:01:55.689> lot<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.840> practice<00:01:56.319> you<00:01:56.349> know<00:01:56.500> what<00:01:56.590> I

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
takes a lot of practice you know what I

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.830 
takes a lot of practice you know what I
mean<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:57.789> doesn't<00:01:58.119> matter<00:01:58.270> how<00:01:58.360> strong<00:01:58.689> you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
mean it doesn't matter how strong you

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.449 
mean it doesn't matter how strong you
are<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.020> really<00:01:59.530> doesn't<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.069> can<00:02:00.220> go<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.340> the

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
are it really doesn't you can go to the

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.399 
are it really doesn't you can go to the
gym<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.819> lift<00:02:00.970> two<00:02:01.450> thousand<00:02:01.899> pounds<00:02:02.229> it's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
gym and lift two thousand pounds it's

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.260 
gym and lift two thousand pounds it's
just<00:02:02.770> tricks<00:02:03.099> or<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.310> completely<00:02:03.909> different

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
just tricks or a completely different

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.669 
just tricks or a completely different
muscle<00:02:04.569> completely<00:02:05.049> different<00:02:05.349> technique

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
muscle completely different technique

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.529 
muscle completely different technique
and<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.310> think<00:02:06.729> everybody<00:02:07.030> should<00:02:07.090> learn<00:02:07.330> that

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
and I think everybody should learn that

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.570 
and I think everybody should learn that
before<00:02:07.810> attempting<00:02:08.229> tricks<00:02:08.530> because<00:02:08.920> that's

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
before attempting tricks because that's

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.449 
before attempting tricks because that's
all<00:02:09.729> accident<00:02:10.149> but<00:02:11.110> um<00:02:11.380> honestly<00:02:12.160> it's<00:02:12.400> just

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
all accident but um honestly it's just

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.740 
all accident but um honestly it's just
training<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:13.090> know<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.239> just<00:02:13.329> got<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.510> train

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
training you know you just got to train

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.060 
training you know you just got to train
with<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.989> right<00:02:14.109> person<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.739> usually

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
with the right person and usually

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.530 
with the right person and usually
sticking<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:15.549> one<00:02:15.790> person<00:02:15.970> kind<00:02:16.329> of<00:02:16.390> helps

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
sticking with one person kind of helps

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.160 
sticking with one person kind of helps
out<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> little<00:02:16.870> bit<00:02:17.160> yeah
