our

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.430 
our
right<00:01:26.920> back<00:01:27.070> down

right back down

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.070 
right back down
now<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.160> couple<00:01:29.310> things<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.610> go<00:01:29.820> wrong<00:01:30.080> people

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
now a couple things that go wrong people

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.320 
now a couple things that go wrong people
approach<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> bar<00:01:31.890> stand<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.060> too<00:01:33.150> wide

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
approach the bar stand a little too wide

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330 
approach the bar stand a little too wide
like<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.780> grab<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.500> wider<00:01:34.830> like<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
like this grab a little wider like this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.610 
like this grab a little wider like this
becomes<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.120> very<00:01:36.300> inefficient<00:01:36.510> function<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
becomes a very inefficient function a

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.140 
becomes a very inefficient function a
lot<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.190> times<00:01:38.370> they<00:01:38.460> tend<00:01:38.670> around<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> back

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
lot of times they tend around the back

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.099 
lot of times they tend around the back
so<00:01:39.900> again<00:01:39.930> remember<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.250> hips<00:01:41.550> in

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.620 

another<00:01:44.350> thing<00:01:44.619> that<00:01:44.649> tends<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.399> go<00:01:45.549> wrong<00:01:45.759> is

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
another thing that tends to go wrong is

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.870 
another thing that tends to go wrong is
people<00:01:46.960> start<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.229> pick<00:01:47.380> up<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.500> bar<00:01:47.770> we<00:01:48.640> start

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
people start to pick up the bar we start

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.840 
people start to pick up the bar we start
to<00:01:48.939> keep<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.149> bar<00:01:49.359> which<00:01:49.570> looks<00:01:49.840> like<00:01:49.899> this

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
to keep the bar which looks like this
