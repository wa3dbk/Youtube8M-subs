00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
because your watches is on your wrist

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.119 
because your watches is on your wrist
and<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:02.010> you're<00:01:02.160> wearing<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:03.470> like<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and if you're wearing it like this and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.570 
and if you're wearing it like this and
looking<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.640> yourself<00:01:06.979> it's<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.159> made<00:01:08.340> for

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
looking at yourself it's not made for

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
looking at yourself it's not made for
recording<00:01:09.090> yourself<00:01:09.150> anyway<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:09.990> upside

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
recording yourself anyway but I'm upside

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.420 
recording yourself anyway but I'm upside
down<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.070> turn<00:01:11.130> my<00:01:11.460> wrist<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.909> way<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
down so if I turn my wrist this way and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
down so if I turn my wrist this way and
tilt<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
tilt it just a little bit which is a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
tilt it just a little bit which is a
natural<00:01:16.470> position<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:16.860> your<00:01:17.130> arm<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.930> I'm

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
natural position for your arm then I'm

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.450 
natural position for your arm then I'm
hoping<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.650> comes<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:20.070> pretty<00:01:20.340> much

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
hoping that this comes out pretty much

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
hoping that this comes out pretty much
squared<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:22.200> tilted<00:01:22.680> oddly<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
squared off and not not tilted oddly the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.130 
squared off and not not tilted oddly the
sound<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.790> actually<00:01:27.090> pretty<00:01:27.270> good<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
sound is actually pretty good on the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.480 
sound is actually pretty good on the
test<00:01:28.590> videos<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.070> I've<00:01:29.159> made<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:32.369> know

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
test videos that I've made and you know

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.399 
test videos that I've made and you know
and<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.759> tells<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> time<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> watch<00:01:33.960> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and it tells the time it's a watch so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.429 
and it tells the time it's a watch so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the little excuse me the little dials

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.960 
the little excuse me the little dials
that<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.159> actually<00:01:38.369> move<00:01:38.640> those

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that you see don't actually move those
