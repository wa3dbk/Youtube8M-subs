170<00:01:27.689> packs<00:01:27.930> equals<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.070> amount<00:01:29.310> of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
170 packs equals out to this amount of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.679 
170 packs equals out to this amount of
fifa<00:01:29.610> points<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.030> summer<00:01:30.180> players<00:01:30.479> i<00:01:30.570> was
