00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.250
 Competition, conflict and war between bad and toothpaste 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.250
 It can be considered concrete evidence showing that he often woke up 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:26.070
 Go back to the Bronze Age between late just this conspicuous lack of theology or philosophy, 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 In other words, in the course of the war between villages and villages 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.840
 One excellent tribe of alienated superior bronzes 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.460
 Around 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.030
 13 1 Conquer or unify tribes 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.720
 With a more complex social organization 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.350
 Politics will emerge. 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.350
 The ruler who governs these political poles 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.840
 We call it a makeup. 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 If you speak the sentence in English, it's called Zhichi foot cancer. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.520
 As you know, when you open the decoration and die 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.470
 To prove one's authority 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.200
 I made things like dolmens or stone tombs 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.260
 And there with the body 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:20.950
 I also asked them to share some items, such as a non-dissimilar sword . 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:26.520
 And here's one step closer. 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 In general, from the 10th to the 6th century BC 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.450
 Unified 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:40.190
 A country called Gojoseon will appear 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:45.350
 Gojoseon is located in Liaoning Province in Liaoning Province in China today 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:50.000
 Appearance Non- breakwheel sword and dolmens 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:56.420
 And it is known to have caused agricultural culture. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.360
 I'm going to look at details about Gojoseon in detail next time. 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.570
 In this way, 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.290
 With the widespread use affective Bronze 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:11.700
 Increased agricultural production and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.060
 Seven departments or c and tribal 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.550
 Competition and Conflict War 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.230
 As it happens frequently 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:28.280
 It is the appearance of make-up and the plate through a number of make-up 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.280
 The first country of our country, Gojoseon, was featured. 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:58.630
 So far, I've been looking at the lives of people in the Bronze Age. 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.120
 The archaeologist area mentioned in front of the straight child 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:09.080
 Straight child is also in Siheung people 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:11.900
 The food that people can eat and survive is produced and then greatly diversified 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.920
 The partnership system and 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.040
 Agriculture using large scale facilities 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:26.220
 I highly emphasized this. 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:31.770
 And the current scholars have argued that these three factors 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.380
 I understand that you have played an important role. 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.880
 But in Northeast Asia 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:45.530
 Bronze tragedy was relatively late. 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:52.880
 And there was no farming using the atmospheric and related facilities. 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:04:01.060
 If you like a woman in North Korea and the Middle East these days is me standing in Northeast Asia 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:01.060
 In this area the centralized state of the Bronze Age did not appear 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:12.849
 That is why in Northeast Asia, Gordon Child's urban revolutions 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:18.489
 I do not see a typical typical appearance. 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:21.459
 It is not surprising, however, that any change in Northeast Asia during the Bronze Age 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.310
 It was not that there was no change. 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:29.470
 As mentioned earlier, 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:35.410
 After the Bronze Age bronze spread, agricultural production increased. 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:38.669
 And as war and conflict rivalry between tribal and poetic enemies become commonplace 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.669
 The country appeared 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.600
 Although in Northeast Asia 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:52.740
 Although the typical urban revolution did not appear, 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:58.590
 But during the Bronze Age, there was a great change in people's lives. 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:00.950
 And as the country emerged, the transition from prehistoric to historical 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.950
 Lost 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:12.550
 Although not a city revolution, historical progress equal to that 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:17.770
 I look thingy and Northeast rose shadow 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:21.670
 I looked at the life of prehistoric people today . 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:26.710
 You know how the Paleolithic people lived 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:32.680
 And how people love Neolithic and Bronze Age 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:36.520
 As people move from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic Bronze Age, 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:43.300
 If you remember 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:48.520
 What we have learned today is a good understanding of the history of the Three Kingdoms era. 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:52.420
 Next time I'll try to look at Gojoseon only. 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:56.730
 When and where Kojoson was founded 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.730
 I'll focus on it. 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.169
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.169
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.920
 222 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.920
 U 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.940
 U 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.440
 222 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.690
 U 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.160
 U 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.470
 U 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.460
 woo 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.460
 oie
