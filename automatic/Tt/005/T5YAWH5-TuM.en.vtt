00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 and make a parenthesis because it 's 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.520
 jessica rock on the green coast where it 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.130
 is giving the aeronaval exhibition 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.620
 forward jessica with this event 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840
 that the truth is waiting for all 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.110
 limeÃ±os forward 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.210
 well we are at the base the palms what 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.880
 that we are going to present here is one of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.340
 the planes that are going to show up in the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.890
 air fair in this parade to hero 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.689
 naval they have prepared for all the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 public so that they can see them up close 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.520
 reality what we have here is an airplane 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.129
 combat to 37b but so that we 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.680
 explain exactly how it's done 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.629
 and that it works as it works we're going to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.220
 talk to captain Juan Aquino how 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.340
 is very good morning comment for 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.700
 please this function 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.690
 specifically of all good this is a 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.150
 it was a factory in usa it's an aircraft 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.930
 of combat 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.930
 the purpose of the triplet is 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.220
 perform until it's air ground is a 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.660
 aircraft in which it has already been used 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.660
 in the conflicts of so much of 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:13.220
 it is a construction dare to all is 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.750
 metallic is not a truth more than anything 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.570
 provided for that is an attack 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:24.290
 light attack there is earth against 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:26.520
 portatropas or against any good 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.689
 now we count 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.729
 several models inside if we call 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.770
 our best-trained cameraman 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.259
 moment and I do not know please how is it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.119
 inside one of these aircraft we see it 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.490
 on the outside but never on the inside having it 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.229
 the privilege that those who estates without 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.990
 hairs on the tongue can see it from 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.180
 in explain please us common 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.460
 although as we see here 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.680
 and of course nothing is living so much in what 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.510
 it's in the motor controls the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.510
 flight controls and what is the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.390
 armament controls this shoot has 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.330
 the ability to carry both 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.950
 armament like bombs like rockets and 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.950
 as it has a subject now also 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.000
 at the time in which it is a measure 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.599
 we have the fastest of all tell me 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.590
 that can shoot from 2,500 to 3,500 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:32.280
 cartridges per minute in its variable of 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.910
 more than 3,500 to 5,000 cartridges 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.590
 now what are we going to see this parade 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.330
 aeronaval is going to be some kind of 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.940
 pirouettes that is what is going to be 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.800
 exactly so of course 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.960
 after we are going to make a 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.510
 passage of the three aircraft I'm going to 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.420
 detach 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.120
 alone in front of the rostrum where I'll go there 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.819
 perform an acrobatics that is about 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.040
 eight horizontal eight eights 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.540
 and after the horizontal eight I'm going 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.230
 to make a high-speed passage 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.790
 stuck to the grandstand where close up like that 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.519
 I'm going to perform quite a lot on the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.340
 tribune where when leaving the rostrum I go to 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.090
 perform a spoiler tone that is for a 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.500
 a 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:21.000
