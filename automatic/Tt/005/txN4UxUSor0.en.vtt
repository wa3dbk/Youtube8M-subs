00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
but for the most part it's cool I could

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.369 
but for the most part it's cool I could
definitely<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.270> myself<00:01:03.480> getting<00:01:04.019> less

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
definitely see myself getting less

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.969 
definitely see myself getting less
stress<00:01:04.920> look<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.869> like<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.080> mean<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> mean

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
stress look like like I mean now I mean

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.380 
stress look like like I mean now I mean
maybe<00:01:08.100> once<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.610> more<00:01:08.790> into<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.299> won't

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
maybe once I get more into it it won't

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.820 
maybe once I get more into it it won't
be<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.689> bad<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:12.229> it's<00:01:13.229> nerve-wracking

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
be as bad but it's nerve-wracking

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
be as bad but it's nerve-wracking
especially<00:01:13.920> when<00:01:14.310> they<00:01:14.430> cuz<00:01:14.970> they<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.090> like

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
especially when they cuz they have like

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.120 
especially when they cuz they have like
this<00:01:15.479> system<00:01:15.840> where<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.140> green<00:01:16.350> yellow<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
this system where it's green yellow and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.800 
this system where it's green yellow and
red<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.210> how<00:01:18.479> fast

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
red so they like you know how fast

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
red so they like you know how fast
you're<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.460> was<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> fast

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
you're going and it was the fast

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.609 
you're going and it was the fast
unfriendly<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.689> know<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.259> want

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
unfriendly you know so you don't want

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.940 
unfriendly you know so you don't want
red<00:01:22.860> except<00:01:23.540> you're<00:01:24.590> fast<00:01:25.590> you're<00:01:25.799> going

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
red except you're fast you're going

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
red except you're fast you're going
really<00:01:26.070> slow<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.810> there's<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> whole

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
really slow and then there's a whole

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.120 
really slow and then there's a whole
taking<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> survey<00:01:29.340> thing<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.420> like

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
taking the survey thing and like

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.830 
taking the survey thing and like
it's<00:01:31.670> not<00:01:32.140> good<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:33.320> guess<00:01:33.439> we<00:01:33.590> don't<00:01:33.890> have

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
it's not good I guess we don't have

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.640 
it's not good I guess we don't have
enough

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
enough

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.320 
enough
people<00:01:37.040> taking<00:01:37.280> this<00:01:37.520> early

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
people taking this early

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.140 
people taking this early
I<00:01:38.360> have<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.440> really<00:01:39.650> push<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.310> push<00:01:40.910> the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
I have to really push that and push the

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.700 
I have to really push that and push the
selling<00:01:41.540> of<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> tires<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.260> think<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.530> serve

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
selling of the tires I think the serve

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.520 
selling of the tires I think the serve
is<00:01:42.860> more<00:01:43.070> important<00:01:43.430> because<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:44.480> reflects<00:01:45.140> on

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
is more important because it reflects on

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.459 
is more important because it reflects on
us<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:46.360> guess

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.099 

it<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.100> only<00:01:53.340> four<00:01:53.969> hours<00:01:54.149> today<00:01:54.539> when<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.929> got

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109
