there's some other excellent videos out
on<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> market<00:03:09.150> for<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:10.020> making<00:03:10.350> molds<00:03:11.660> John

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
on the market for for making molds John

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.170 
on the market for for making molds John
Woodbridge<00:03:13.080> made<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.380> good<00:03:13.680> one

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
Woodbridge made a good one

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.420 
Woodbridge made a good one
recommend<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.770> they<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:17.040> see<00:03:17.280> I've

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
recommend that they you see I've

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.160 
recommend that they you see I've
reinforced<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.630> mold<00:03:18.870> with<00:03:19.080> burlap<00:03:20.870> or<00:03:21.870> hemp

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
reinforced this mold with burlap or hemp

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.210 
reinforced this mold with burlap or hemp
is<00:03:22.380> fine<00:03:22.680> as<00:03:22.890> well<00:03:24.530> later<00:03:25.530> on<00:03:25.770> in<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.010> process

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
is fine as well later on in the process

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.190 
is fine as well later on in the process
I'm<00:03:26.580> gonna<00:03:26.760> clamp<00:03:27.120> them<00:03:27.390> all<00:03:27.540> together<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.050> I

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
I'm gonna clamp them all together so I

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.530 
I'm gonna clamp them all together so I
put<00:03:28.620> little<00:03:28.970> medicine<00:03:29.970> jars<00:03:30.710> there<00:03:31.710> so<00:03:32.540> that

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
put little medicine jars there so that

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.700 
put little medicine jars there so that
made<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.900> very<00:03:34.080> easy<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.850> get<00:03:36.090> little

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
made it very easy to to get little

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.160 
made it very easy to to get little
handle<00:03:37.710> for<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> clamp

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
handle for the clamp

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.400 
handle for the clamp
I'm<00:03:40.170> almost<00:03:40.350> done<00:03:41.150> very<00:03:42.150> very<00:03:42.600> easy<00:03:42.810> isn't<00:03:43.320> it

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
I'm almost done very very easy isn't it

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.970 
I'm almost done very very easy isn't it
and<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:45.540> reason<00:03:46.020> why<00:03:46.140> I'm<00:03:46.230> doing<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.680> so

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
and the reason why I'm doing this so

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.460 
and the reason why I'm doing this so
briefly<00:03:47.490> is<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.420> main<00:03:48.630> purpose<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:49.320> this

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
briefly is that the main purpose of this

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
briefly is that the main purpose of this
video<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:51.540> show<00:03:51.570> how<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.470> make<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.950> silicon

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
video is to show how to make the silicon

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.240 
video is to show how to make the silicon
and<00:03:53.700> how<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.000> apply<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.630> silicon<00:03:55.380> not<00:03:56.010> the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
and how to apply the silicon not the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.160 
and how to apply the silicon not the
mold<00:03:56.520> but<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.820> have<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.270> pictures<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.900> thought

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
mold but I have the pictures I thought

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.460 
mold but I have the pictures I thought
I'll<00:03:58.470> show<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.459> little<00:03:59.730> bit<00:03:59.820> as<00:03:59.940> well<00:04:00.470> okay

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
I'll show you a little bit as well okay

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.199 
I'll show you a little bit as well okay
and<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:02.220> did<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:02.850> gelatin<00:04:03.570> press<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.950> mold

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
and I did a gelatin press in the mold

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.090 
and I did a gelatin press in the mold
and<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.630> heated<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.080> molds<00:04:07.530> filled<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.070> with

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
and just heated the molds filled it with

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.100 
and just heated the molds filled it with
gelatin<00:04:08.780> pressed<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.959> together<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:11.930> then<00:04:12.930> I

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
gelatin pressed it together and then I

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.640 
gelatin pressed it together and then I
could<00:04:13.350> get<00:04:13.650> out<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:14.120> sample<00:04:15.120> appliance<00:04:15.810> which<00:04:16.470> I

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
could get out a sample appliance which I

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.610 
could get out a sample appliance which I
could<00:04:16.890> put<00:04:17.160> on<00:04:17.459> my<00:04:17.760> plaster<00:04:18.450> head<00:04:18.660> so<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.410> can

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
could put on my plaster head so I can

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.650 
could put on my plaster head so I can
see<00:04:19.799> where<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.070> should<00:04:20.400> drill<00:04:20.820> my<00:04:20.970> ventilation

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
see where I should drill my ventilation

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.990 
see where I should drill my ventilation
holes<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:23.960> then<00:04:24.960> also<00:04:25.320> at<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.310> thickest<00:04:26.729> part

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
holes and then also at the thickest part

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.969 
holes and then also at the thickest part
of<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:29.150> sculpture<00:04:30.150> I'm<00:04:30.570> doing<00:04:31.229> an<00:04:31.350> injection

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
of the sculpture I'm doing an injection

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:41.490 
of the sculpture I'm doing an injection
hole<00:04:32.220> which<00:04:33.150> is<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.510> bit<00:04:33.930> bigger

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.460 

all<00:04:42.500> nasty<00:04:43.450> another<00:04:44.450> mold<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:44.960> was<00:04:45.140> already

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
all nasty another mold that was already

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.910 
all nasty another mold that was already
done<00:04:49.450> this<00:04:50.450> is<00:04:50.720> gonna<00:04:51.290> be<00:04:51.470> covered<00:04:51.800> in<00:04:51.860> more

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
done this is gonna be covered in more

00:04:51.920 --> 00:05:00.390 
done this is gonna be covered in more
detail<00:04:52.130> in<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:53.090> next<00:04:53.870> video<00:04:54.320> he<00:04:54.770> can<00:04:55.670> see<00:04:56.440> so

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:08.640 

this<00:05:01.400> is<00:05:01.460> me<00:05:02.150> doing<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.780> actual<00:05:03.520> silicon

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.030 

but<00:05:09.250> as<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:10.090> said<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.960> was<00:05:11.110> gonna<00:05:11.260> be<00:05:11.350> very<00:05:11.650> brief

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
but as I said it was gonna be very brief

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.870 
but as I said it was gonna be very brief
and<00:05:12.780> I<00:05:13.780> think<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.470> can<00:05:14.620> learn<00:05:14.770> more<00:05:15.040> if<00:05:15.220> if<00:05:15.430> you

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
and I think you can learn more if if you

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.480 
and I think you can learn more if if you
just<00:05:16.120> look<00:05:16.510> at<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.750> pitches<00:05:19.979> step<00:05:20.979> by<00:05:21.160> step

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
just look at the pitches step by step

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:32.930 
just look at the pitches step by step
from<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.360> DVD

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.000 

you
