00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.719
 ah 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:16.170
 hi guys thank you for giving me the video 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:20.160
 As the title of the video says, I'm going 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.710
 to teach the motogp with android 4.4 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.810
 points 2 take off which has already released 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.179
 third finally we have this system 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.860
 operative from the last thing that about 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.199
 what google now and if it well 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.710
 updated to criticize he lost creating and 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.370
 lost some functions for example 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.100
 here we are seeing 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:51.430
 what is android kitkat 4.4 points 2 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.120
 and it gives us the android versions all 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 the android versions 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.540
 a reminder nothing else google's 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.979
 that already have some updates 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.600
 previous now in the function one of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.630
 the primordial functions that he lost 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.369
 this system when updating or 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.440
 who lost motorcycle that was the use of the cable 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:26.010
 or example of devices through 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.250
 a microusb port now to solve 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.250
 this problem 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.530
 and that's why I'm sharing it because 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.910
 there are not many videos that explain us 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.870
 how to use this small cable tg 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.180
 in which good one loads something series 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.930
 we go for the time in transportation one 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.750
 you have to be looking serious 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.980
 entertaining yourself let's go now they're two 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.310
 applications which we have to 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.680
 install for us to work is the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.150
 boat that again the first one is called 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.150
 usb this plugin 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.530
 and the other one is total ' commander very well 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.100
 once we have installed these 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.030
 two do not need more than connect the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.750
 usb will leave us a message of total 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.820
 command from usb sorry where you 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.290
 let's put to use 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.960
 default 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.080
 the application for this device and 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.660
 let's open once we open it 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.560
 is going to give the message for us to use 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.020
 the total commander once we are 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.590
 there is already going to give us the option of being able 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.890
 enter our device or 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:51.770
 pendrive in which for example 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:55.230
 I have here a series in which 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.780
 reproduce it from the video directly on 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.780
 close-up on the same type 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.510
 there he is reproducing directly from 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.360
 the Web 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.900
 very well 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.230
 now this means that I retire 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.230
 give him a cd 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.190
 to stop the video in any 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.930
 moment 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.659
 because it is not already 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.659
 speaking directly from the usb memory 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:36.829
 because surely the internal memory 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:40.810
 of the phone is a very curious fact if 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:45.980
 In case I do not have it, I do not have it in my 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.579
 device does what it does is this 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.579
 application is to temporarily pass it to 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:58.359
 the memory but if I get out of the 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.359
 program we can not keep seeing that 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:06.409
 is a curious fact that you notice because if 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.150
 I disconnect in a wrong way and 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.660
 then she can continue to see us 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.500
 my videos 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.000
 in the batch that but good is important 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.130
 highlight what nothing happens is 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.380
 disconnect you can keep playing 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.720
 I have not noticed how much time is what 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.910
 buffet charge 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.810
 that would be the trick as such and for 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.670
 use this this function of the 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.790
 t cable that I will leave in the 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.070
 description of the two applications that 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.980
 they will need to be able to use 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.100
 again its cable because they 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.870
 thank you for watching this video put there 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.960
 down and share and see you 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.960
 bye
