a<00:00:15.210> year<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.020> had<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.379> talk<00:00:16.590> about<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.220> it

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
a year and I had to talk about it and it

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.689 
a year and I had to talk about it and it
is<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.359> new<00:00:18.930> bra<00:00:19.320> now<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> got<00:00:20.070> mine<00:00:20.279> about<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
is the new bra now I got mine about a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.790 
is the new bra now I got mine about a
year<00:00:21.180> ago<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.630> maybe<00:00:21.840> even<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.320> little<00:00:22.350> longer

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
year ago or maybe even a little longer

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.730 
year ago or maybe even a little longer
off<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.640> Amazon<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.869> was<00:00:25.050> around<00:00:25.260> twenty

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
off of Amazon and it was around twenty

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.370 
off of Amazon and it was around twenty
to<00:00:25.769> thirty<00:00:26.160> dollars<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.939> now<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.810> Amazon<00:00:27.990> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to thirty dollars and now on Amazon I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.470 
to thirty dollars and now on Amazon I
guess<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.710> ranges<00:00:29.099> based<00:00:29.369> upon<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.910> size<00:00:30.150> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
guess it ranges based upon the size and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
guess it ranges based upon the size and
the<00:00:30.630> color<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.230> ranges<00:00:31.380> from<00:00:31.560> nineteen<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the color but it ranges from nineteen to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.220 
the color but it ranges from nineteen to
thirty<00:00:32.460> six<00:00:32.880> dollars<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.840> course<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
thirty six dollars and of course you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.330 
thirty six dollars and of course you
could<00:00:34.380> also<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> off<00:00:34.980> their<00:00:35.160> website

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
could also get it off their website

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.709 
could also get it off their website
which<00:00:35.730> i<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> little<00:00:36.360> bit<00:00:36.480> more

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
which i think is a little bit more

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.750 
which i think is a little bit more
pricey<00:00:36.930> actually<00:00:37.530> Amazon's<00:00:38.309> always<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> way
