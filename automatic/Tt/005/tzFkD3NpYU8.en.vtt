top-flight campus about you right now
and<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:29.150> spot<00:00:29.359> was<00:00:29.480> actually<00:00:29.779> in<00:00:29.839> the<00:00:29.869> other

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
and the spot was actually in the other

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.390 
and the spot was actually in the other
one<00:00:30.199> but<00:00:30.380> i<00:00:30.560> just<00:00:30.800> want<00:00:30.919> to<00:00:30.980> show<00:00:31.159> that<00:00:31.189> over

one but i just want to show that over

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.520 
one but i just want to show that over
way<00:00:31.579> to<00:00:31.640> get<00:00:31.909> there<00:00:32.150> i'll<00:00:32.989> be<00:00:33.050> showing<00:00:33.289> the

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
way to get there i'll be showing the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.930 
way to get there i'll be showing the
other<00:00:33.649> way<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.860> get<00:00:34.129> there<00:00:34.340> as<00:00:34.489> you<00:00:34.670> can<00:00:34.820> see<00:00:34.910> on

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
other way to get there as you can see on

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.709 
other way to get there as you can see on
the<00:00:35.120> left<00:00:35.620> I<00:00:36.620> guess<00:00:37.250> I'll<00:00:37.399> do<00:00:37.520> it<00:00:37.640> but<00:00:38.480> the

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
the left I guess I'll do it but the

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.150 
the left I guess I'll do it but the
reason<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:39.020> is<00:00:39.079> such<00:00:39.289> a<00:00:39.320> handy<00:00:39.590> camping<00:00:39.920> spot

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
reason this is such a handy camping spot

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.819 
reason this is such a handy camping spot
is<00:00:40.399> because<00:00:40.760> say<00:00:41.629> you<00:00:41.690> have<00:00:41.809> a<00:00:41.840> sniper<00:00:42.109> there's

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
is because say you have a sniper there's

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.380 
is because say you have a sniper there's
one<00:00:42.920> spot<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.430> can<00:00:43.489> shoot<00:00:43.730> at<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.149> there's

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
one spot you can shoot at and there's

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.660 
one spot you can shoot at and there's
one<00:00:44.480> spot<00:00:44.809> you<00:00:44.930> can<00:00:44.989> shoot<00:00:45.199> out<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:45.590> there's<00:00:46.550> a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
one spot you can shoot out and there's a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.360 
one spot you can shoot out and there's a
spot<00:00:47.000> you<00:00:47.090> can<00:00:47.149> shoot<00:00:47.390> out<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.109> it<00:00:49.070> will<00:00:49.219> be

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
spot you can shoot out so it will be

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.220 
spot you can shoot out so it will be
pretty<00:00:49.640> hard<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:49.969> kill<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:50.840> seems<00:00:51.050> like<00:00:51.199> a

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
pretty hard to kill you it seems like a

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.869 
pretty hard to kill you it seems like a
really<00:00:51.440> weird<00:00:51.710> spot<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:52.429> it'll<00:00:52.579> actually<00:00:52.699> be

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
really weird spot but it'll actually be

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.849 
really weird spot but it'll actually be
hard<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.300> kill<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:54.079> this<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.649> place

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
hard to kill you and this is the place

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.619 
hard to kill you and this is the place
where<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.309> a-bomb<00:00:55.820> would<00:00:56.059> be<00:00:56.179> one<00:00:56.390> playing

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
where the a-bomb would be one playing

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.209 
where the a-bomb would be one playing
Search<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.019> Destroy<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:57.739> very<00:00:57.890> good<00:00:58.160> for

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
Search and Destroy so it's very good for

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.599 
Search and Destroy so it's very good for
a<00:00:59.140> domination<00:01:00.140> because<00:01:00.589> where<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:01.250> was<00:01:01.429> just

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
a domination because where I was just

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.910 
a domination because where I was just
aiming<00:01:01.879> is<00:01:02.120> where<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.420> sea<00:01:02.600> flag<00:01:02.870> spawn<00:01:03.679> is

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
aiming is where the sea flag spawn is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.370 
aiming is where the sea flag spawn is
and<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:04.940> is<00:01:05.120> for<00:01:05.330> search<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.630> destroy<00:01:05.840> so

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
and that is for search and destroy so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.100 
and that is for search and destroy so
you<00:01:06.470> can<00:01:06.710> just<00:01:06.740> cap<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.100> out<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.610> wait<00:01:08.330> right

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
you can just cap it out and wait right

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.830 
you can just cap it out and wait right
here<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:10.400> place<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.180> already<00:01:11.270> diffuse<00:01:11.720> I

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
here the place is already diffuse I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.640 
here the place is already diffuse I
don't<00:01:11.990> know<00:01:12.050> I<00:01:12.080> don't<00:01:12.170> play<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.380> lot<00:01:12.470> of

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
don't know I don't play a lot of

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.620 
don't know I don't play a lot of
searches<00:01:12.950> for<00:01:13.130> anyway<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.090> next<00:01:14.120> one<00:01:14.390> is<00:01:14.450> on<00:01:14.570> a

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
searches for anyway the next one is on a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.840 
searches for anyway the next one is on a
hard<00:01:14.900> hat<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:16.010> pretty<00:01:16.250> obvious<00:01:16.670> one

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
hard hat and it's a pretty obvious one

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.070 
hard hat and it's a pretty obvious one
someone<00:01:17.210> showed<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.600> me<00:01:17.690> through<00:01:18.050> a

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
someone showed it to me through a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.180 
someone showed it to me through a
message<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:18.590> thought<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:18.800> might<00:01:18.860> as<00:01:19.130> well

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
message and I thought I might as well

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.640 
message and I thought I might as well
use<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:20.600> was<00:01:20.690> a<00:01:20.750> pretty<00:01:20.960> handy<00:01:21.290> camping

spot<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.010> first<00:01:22.190> I<00:01:22.340> thought<00:01:22.490> no<00:01:22.670> I<00:01:22.700> shouldn't

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.520 
spot and first I thought no I shouldn't
use<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.390> it's<00:01:23.630> very<00:01:23.810> easy<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.140> get<00:01:24.260> killed

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
use this it's very easy to get killed

but you actually have quite a lot of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.930 
but you actually have quite a lot of
cover<00:01:26.330> in<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:27.130> I<00:01:28.130> don't<00:01:28.580> know<00:01:28.640> let's<00:01:28.760> call<00:01:28.910> a

do it and if you can't make that jump
from<00:01:47.630> over<00:01:47.870> there<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.380> don't<00:01:48.860> know<00:01:48.920> if<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:49.220> need

a pistol or anything or extreme

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.410 
a pistol or anything or extreme
conditions<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:51.710> used<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.310> can<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:52.490> jump

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
conditions I used it you can just jump

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.080 
conditions I used it you can just jump
down<00:01:53.510> here<00:01:53.900> i<00:01:54.050> was<00:01:54.980> using<00:01:55.160> dead<00:01:55.430> silence<00:01:55.820> pro

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
down here i was using dead silence pro

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.210 
down here i was using dead silence pro
though<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:57.290> probably<00:01:57.320> take<00:01:57.890> some<00:01:58.040> damage

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
though so you probably take some damage

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.470 
though so you probably take some damage
I<00:01:58.430> didn't<00:01:58.640> actually<00:01:58.700> think<00:01:59.000> of<00:01:59.150> that

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
I didn't actually think of that

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.810 
I didn't actually think of that
but<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:01.050> still<00:02:01.830> think<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.220> honey<00:02:02.370> spot<00:02:02.640> even

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
but I still think it's a honey spot even

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.100 
but I still think it's a honey spot even
from<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.480> shoot<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> way

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
from here you can shoot all the way

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.450 
from here you can shoot all the way
through<00:02:04.320> there<00:02:04.500> maybe<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.070> an<00:02:05.130> s<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.430> V

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
through there maybe not with an s and V

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.000 
through there maybe not with an s and V
now<00:02:06.330> this<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.750> probably<00:02:06.930> my<00:02:07.140> favorite<00:02:07.170> camping

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
now this is probably my favorite camping

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.240 
now this is probably my favorite camping
spot<00:02:08.480> from<00:02:09.480> all<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.869> these<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.680> just<00:02:11.070> so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
spot from all of these it's just so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.500 
spot from all of these it's just so
smart<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:13.800> jump<00:02:14.100> over<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:14.820> on<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.330> can

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
smart and you jump over here on the can

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.390 
smart and you jump over here on the can
and<00:02:15.690> from<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.440> already<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.010> got<00:02:17.040> quite<00:02:17.370> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
and from here already you got quite a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.620 
and from here already you got quite a
nice<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:17.700> cover<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.300> shoot<00:02:18.420> Oh

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
nice little cover you can shoot Oh

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.630 
nice little cover you can shoot Oh
almost<00:02:19.320> everywhere<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.310> jump<00:02:20.490> over

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
almost everywhere and then you jump over

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.690 
almost everywhere and then you jump over
here<00:02:20.940> now<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.960> jump<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.500> actually<00:02:22.980> pretty

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
here now the jump is actually pretty

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.220 
here now the jump is actually pretty
hard<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.180> might<00:02:24.330> actually<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.690> an<00:02:24.810> in-depth

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
hard and I might actually do an in-depth

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.320 
hard and I might actually do an in-depth
video<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.770> how<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> do<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> jump<00:02:26.610> because<00:02:27.300> I

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
video just how to do the jump because I

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.570 
video just how to do the jump because I
don't<00:02:27.600> have<00:02:27.720> enough<00:02:27.900> time<00:02:28.080> right<00:02:28.140> now<00:02:28.580> next

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
don't have enough time right now next

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.000 
don't have enough time right now next
one<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.820> on<00:02:29.880> mission<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.530> pretty<00:02:31.800> nice

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
one is on mission and it's a pretty nice

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.340 
one is on mission and it's a pretty nice
spawn<00:02:32.760> camp<00:02:33.060> position<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.750> think<00:02:34.020> because<00:02:34.110> that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
spawn camp position I think because that

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.410 
spawn camp position I think because that
is<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> spawn<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> flag

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
is a spawn and I think it's the a flag

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.120 
is a spawn and I think it's the a flag
or<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> C<00:02:36.930> flag<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.470> don't<00:02:37.710> know<00:02:37.770> which<00:02:37.920> one<00:02:38.040> it

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
or the C flag I don't know which one it

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.280 
or the C flag I don't know which one it
is<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.120> jump<00:02:39.390> down<00:02:39.420> onto<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:39.930> main

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
is and you just jump down onto this main

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.740 
is and you just jump down onto this main
tube<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.580> lie<00:02:41.760> down<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.540> pull<00:02:42.720> out

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
tube and you lie down and you pull out

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.850 
tube and you lie down and you pull out
your<00:02:42.960> m4a1<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.370> start<00:02:44.670> shooting<00:02:45.060> at<00:02:45.150> them

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
your m4a1 and you start shooting at them

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.320 
your m4a1 and you start shooting at them
okay<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.400> kill<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> people<00:02:48.090> from<00:02:48.210> the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
to secure that flag at least that's

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.120 
to secure that flag at least that's
usually<00:02:55.110> my<00:02:55.260> games<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.800> don't<00:02:55.950> know<00:02:56.010> about
