00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.050
 how 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.840
 I have been proposed to spend a day with the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.160
 guys from the snowball foundation and 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.160
 the truth is that I really want 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.339
 It has been found that are some cracks me to 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.050
 the controls of their bikes adapted and 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.180
 that when I train with them they will be 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.890
 more motivated than ever 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.290
 and this is precisely what has me 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.200
 restless because I have climbed a motorbike 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.150
 Well there is no problem but on bicycle and 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.270
 if it 's uphill, they'll have to 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.270
 to motivate 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.479
 to see what happens for sure that at least 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.479
 we had a good time 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.050
 they have told us that you are an artist 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.920
 bible you have to prove it 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.920
 we already know this 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.800
 how 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.930
 and this is being more fun than 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.940
 what I imagined 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.730
 working in a team with the bikes has 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.200
 your technique and you have to work hard 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.960
 but it's worth living every pedalada 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.580
 with them see the enthusiasm that it puts and 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.890
 how they want to improve themselves after each 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.890
 curve exactly the same as I do 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.240
 I have to thank me 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.500
 He proposed to live this experience but 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.150
 I also have to tell him that he 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.840
 wrong when he told me that I took them 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.840
 to motivate them 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.590
 rather it has been the other way around they have 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.590
 motivated to me 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.769
 they have helped me to see the things of 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.080
 another way to see that if one were to 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.330
 proposes there are no barriers 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.330
 Now I have clear who helps whom 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.150
 when you see this instinct of self-improvement 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.489
 of sacrifice never to be taken for 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.400
 expired because it is very easy to throw the 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.750
 towel this I think is a thing that 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.810
 you have to value a lot that costs 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.560
 get it and once got the bs 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.560
 and you get excited about everything 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.000
 those of snowball have surprised me 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.799
 the work especially of equipment that 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.370
 do this in any sport is the 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.370
 most important factor 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.190
 plus
