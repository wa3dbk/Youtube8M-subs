00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
into a field skill you've got to be

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
into a field skill you've got to be
practicing<00:01:23.070> these<00:01:23.189> things<00:01:23.250> together<00:01:24.090> in

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
practicing these things together in

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.320 
practicing these things together in
unison<00:01:24.689> otherwise<00:01:25.610> skills<00:01:26.610> isolation

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
unison otherwise skills isolation

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.510 
unison otherwise skills isolation
doesn't<00:01:27.720> always<00:01:27.840> translate<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:29.009> good

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
doesn't always translate to good

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
doesn't always translate to good
training<00:01:29.909> together<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:31.320> we're<00:01:31.470> having

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
you know these memory games are

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.449 
you know these memory games are
important<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.500> you're<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.160> waiting

minutes while you're stalking and doing
other<00:02:17.280> things<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.880> completely<00:02:18.390> different

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
other things it's a completely different

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.479 
other things it's a completely different
skill<00:02:19.110> set<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.890> practice<00:02:20.280> them

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
skill set you have to practice them

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.309 
skill set you have to practice them
together<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.450> right<00:02:21.810> now<00:02:21.959> we're<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.260> to

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
together so right now we're going to

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.199 
together so right now we're going to
take<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> guys<00:02:22.830> out<00:02:23.130> put<00:02:23.790> them<00:02:23.849> through<00:02:23.910> their

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
take the guys out put them through their

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.000 
take the guys out put them through their
paces<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.900> see<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.260> they<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:25.709> all<00:02:25.860> these

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
paces and see if they can get all these

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.430 
paces and see if they can get all these
items<00:02:26.220> correctly<00:02:26.970> from<00:02:27.239> beginning<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.989> all

well<00:04:05.620> y'all<00:04:05.860> can<00:04:06.010> see<00:04:06.310> this<00:04:06.519> in<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.780> camera

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
well y'all can see this in the camera

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.600 
well y'all can see this in the camera
but<00:04:08.440> this<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.709> where<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.920> team<00:04:09.220> came<00:04:09.579> through

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.589 
but this is where a team came through
and<00:04:10.209> lo<00:04:11.170> crawled<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:12.299> basically<00:04:13.299> it's<00:04:13.450> like

and lo crawled and basically it's like

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.170 
and lo crawled and basically it's like
an<00:04:13.780> elephant<00:04:14.170> trail<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:15.220> in<00:04:15.370> areas<00:04:15.730> like<00:04:15.940> this

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
an elephant trail so in areas like this

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.879 
an elephant trail so in areas like this
where<00:04:16.449> low<00:04:16.660> crawling<00:04:17.109> isn't<00:04:17.380> absolutely
