 atmosphere a friendly atmosphere and a 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.789
 little competition of course but especially 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.190
 the pleasure of finding oneself 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.980
 we explain the rules I will write 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.050
 and I will give you the knives 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 so first explanations of his 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.260
 knives there are not two sleeves in 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.510
 leather that has no such things that's 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.859
 pure metal then there are several 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.180
 kinds of throwing costs at least young 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.969
 is a kind they have entirely 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.330
 metal but you can add some 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.080
 rum a leather wooden handle in each 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.820
 every dancer can have his knives 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.060
 with his knife mark and so 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.189
 after 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.100
 simply there are just some 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.170
 dimensions to respect the weight the weight 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.420
 for knives not to go to choi 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.659
 he minimum 520 and first knives his 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.280
 26 cm minimum and 6 cm wide 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.950
 al alam then you go if he wanted 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.990
 play at look 2 does a demonstration 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060
 explaining how are we 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.820
 hold how is it launched 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.079
 okay then there the same way he 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.329
 is not there is no definite rule 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.950
 simply you hold your knife and 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.140
 following the way it will happen on 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.880
 the target will know if it's the right one 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.579
 distance or not the right way to the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.899
 hold or not because you can him 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.060
 launch the way you prefer 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.979
 simply if el allam arrives at the top 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.689
 is that the expensive nail will not have its 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.479
 turned as he makes a rotation on 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.100
 himself and sylla for a fare at the bottom 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.710
 is that too will turn and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.299
 according to that we will change 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.640
 we will change the way we hold the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.650
 knife his distance to Cairo in 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.619
 respecting the 3000 the three meters 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.700
 minimum so the c3 m so it's not a 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.500
 question of force his disagreement 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.340
 no it's not a question of force to 3 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.959
 meters it's really only from the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.959
 technique we look at you then 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.210
 in a competition you do not shoot 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.450
 that only one knife per target 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.920
 a knife by targeted in sets of three 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.030
 knives the qualities required for this 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.610
 sport concentration perseverance 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.360
 and quiet and slowly and 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.340
 training a lot 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.020
 what are you training what per week at 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.160
 minimum the deep between two and three 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.510
 hours each time given three hours 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.860
 we go to the ax it's also the other 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.500
 discipline I let you go the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:03:03.500

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.000
 in a championship that would be what 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.590
 three out of three baths closest to the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.120
 center possible last year that 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.860
 matched my champion title 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.599
 from France to age the more we are in the center 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.980
 of the target it's like darts 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.630
 it's like darts like shooting 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.500
 at the bow more often near the center 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.709
