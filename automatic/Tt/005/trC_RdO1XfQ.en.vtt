00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
in the collection twice the first time

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.120

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to create the silhouette that we

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
to create the silhouette that we
envisioned<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:24.090> stuffing<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:25.640> often<00:01:26.640> made

and streamers and confetti and balloons

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.130 
and streamers and confetti and balloons

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
and then we shared in a second time on

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.719 
and then we shared in a second time on
the<00:01:34.170> catwalk<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> stuffing<00:01:35.280> taken

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the catwalk with all the stuffing taken

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.380 
the catwalk with all the stuffing taken
out<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:36.390> caused<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.079> volumes<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:39.090> drape

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
out which caused the volumes to to drape

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.190 
out which caused the volumes to to drape
in<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.869> loose<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.740> relaxed<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.310> new<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:42.200> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
in a loose and relaxed a new way and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
in a loose and relaxed a new way and
then<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> way<00:01:43.619> we<00:01:43.649> showed<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.630> maybe<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
then that way we showed that maybe the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.630 
then that way we showed that maybe the
whole<00:01:45.990> whole<00:01:46.619> notion<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.610> 1999<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
whole whole notion of this 1999 and you

millennium thing was just one big flop

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.580 
millennium thing was just one big flop
and<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.150> didn't<00:01:52.479> mean<00:01:52.630> anything<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.350> just

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
and it didn't mean anything that is just

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.060 
and it didn't mean anything that is just
a<00:01:53.860> number<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:56.380> called<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.920> end<00:01:57.070> anti-climax
