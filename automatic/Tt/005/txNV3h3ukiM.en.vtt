00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.710
 2014 spring again once again 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.690
 held a stock stocking Dnieper in stocks 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.420
 several hunters took part 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.690
 underwater we were the main initiators 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.900
 cubic spearfishing Smaghi and shop 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.810
 extreme money raised 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.449
 buy half a million stuff 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.300
 larvae carp larva was 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.960
 two weeks of age the size of somewhere 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:40.260
 23 centimeters early put arrived 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:45.379
 I had to go after her Kharkov in fish 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.530
 hoze packed it in plastic bags 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:53.210
 blew out oxygen quickly back in the area 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.579
 Dnepropetrovsk city released and in 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.190
 Dnieper river 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:03.989
 more precisely in one of its bays 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.220
 all the larva live it can be seen normally 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.220
 moved the road 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.470
 when releasing we observe certain 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.570
 standard tired haul procedure 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:26.560
 the larva should be in the bag 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:29.530
 some time specifically it is 20-30 in not 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.570
 leaving the bag in that water in that environment in 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.009
 which she plans to release in order 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.500
 so that the temperature rises first 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.310
 the next step is to add a little bit 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.950
 water from the reservoir into the bag itself with the larva 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.360
 so that u equals a little 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:53.369
 chemical composition in this form even minutes 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.170
 five ten wait well and after that smoothly 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.759
 slowly slowly begin to produce 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.640
 her 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.759
 percent survival rate of such a larva 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.369
 small 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:12.640
 and specifically somewhere 20-30 as promised 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:15.730
 ichthyologists well given that price it 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.910
 the amount of principle is more profitable 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.489
 what, for example, buy ready-made 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.359
 the bot is a lot of controversy and debate on this 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.549
 bill but if as is for that amount 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:30.610
 which gathered considered it necessary 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:34.710
 more efficient and more 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.070
 buy such bred larvae 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:42.890
 but the main purpose of this event 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:46.740
 I do not take the footage and 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:53.030
 posted on my channel this of course 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:58.520
 did find still wearing dark people who 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:02.840
 will look will appreciate their capabilities and 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.840
 will do exactly as we did 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.520
 there is absolutely no difficulty in this process 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.530
 nothing 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.190
 a little bit to be given to this matter of time 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.230
 and 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.230
 because desire
