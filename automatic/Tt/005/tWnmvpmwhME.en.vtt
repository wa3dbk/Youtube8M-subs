00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.400 
of the package here's Steve the
minecraft<00:01:16.290> character<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.930> looks<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.260> he

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
minecraft character and it looks like he

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.610 
minecraft character and it looks like he
has<00:01:19.560> kind<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.280> looks<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.000> an<00:01:21.150> axe<00:01:21.360> I'm<00:01:22.320> not

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
has kind of a looks like an axe I'm not

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.660 
has kind of a looks like an axe I'm not
sure<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.920> never<00:01:23.220> played<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.640> game<00:01:23.910> before<00:01:24.090> so

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
sure I never played this game before so

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.080 
sure I never played this game before so
that's<00:01:26.670> what<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:26.880> guessing<00:01:28.700> that's<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:29.970> his

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that's what I'm guessing that's what his

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
that's what I'm guessing that's what his
head<00:01:30.270> looks<00:01:30.480> like<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.080> rotates<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
head looks like and it rotates all the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.540 
head looks like and it rotates all the
way<00:01:32.820> around<00:01:33.440> like<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.510> his<00:01:36.510> arms<00:01:37.550> turn

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
way around like that and his arms turn

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.210 
way around like that and his arms turn
all<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> way<00:01:39.000> around<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> arm<00:01:40.920> turns

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
all the way around is on the arm turns

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.410 
all the way around is on the arm turns
all<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.550> way<00:01:41.670> around<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> bends<00:01:44.420> forward

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
all the way around and it bends forward

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.980 
all the way around and it bends forward
and<00:01:45.780> back<00:01:45.960> forward<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:47.130> back<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:49.040> there

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
and back forward and back and there

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.240 
and back forward and back and there
that's<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.350> looks<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.950> back

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that's what it looks like on the back

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.670 
that's what it looks like on the back
and<00:01:54.620> it's<00:01:55.620> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.010> tricky<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.520> stand<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
and it's kind of tricky to stand and

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.330 
and it's kind of tricky to stand and
also<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.040> waist<00:01:59.250> turns

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.190 

there's<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.640> right<00:02:06.940> there<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.510> it's<00:02:07.960> of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
there's that right there and it's of

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.730 
there's that right there and it's of
course<00:02:08.500> his<00:02:08.860> weapon<00:02:09.310> does<00:02:12.930> fit<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.140> both<00:02:14.380> hands

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
course his weapon does fit in both hands

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:25.980 
course his weapon does fit in both hands
I<00:02:14.980> think<00:02:16.380> yup<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.710> does<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:23.290> has<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.440> little<00:02:24.990> know

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
I think yup it does it has a little know

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.260 
I think yup it does it has a little know
if<00:02:26.050> that's<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.320> mouth<00:02:26.560> or<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> goatee<00:02:27.750> but

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
if that's a mouth or a goatee but

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.330 
if that's a mouth or a goatee but
there's<00:02:31.270> that<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:32.380> then<00:02:33.010> there's<00:02:33.250> this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
there's that and then there's this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.690 
there's that and then there's this
little<00:02:33.520> break<00:02:34.590> not<00:02:35.590> sure<00:02:35.920> if<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:38.700> block

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
little break not sure if this block

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.530 
little break not sure if this block
break<00:02:40.150> if<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:41.370> comes<00:02:42.370> apart<00:02:42.610> or<00:02:43.030> not<00:02:43.180> but<00:02:43.510> I

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
break if it comes apart or not but I

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.230 
break if it comes apart or not but I
think<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.320> just<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:46.380> regular<00:02:47.380> block

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
think that it's just a regular block

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.000 
think that it's just a regular block
that<00:02:49.240> has<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.690> printing<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.680> would<00:02:50.800> see

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
that has the printing that you would see

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.390 
that has the printing that you would see
on<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.310> video<00:02:51.400> game<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:52.030> Minecraft<00:02:53.400> and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
on the video game of Minecraft and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.949 
on the video game of Minecraft and
that's<00:02:54.880> pretty<00:02:55.270> much<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:57.400> costs<00:02:57.850> me<00:02:58.000> 897

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
that's pretty much it it costs me 897

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.060 
that's pretty much it it costs me 897
and<00:02:59.500> i<00:02:59.709> found<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.010> up<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.540> local<00:03:01.540> walmart<00:03:02.070> it
