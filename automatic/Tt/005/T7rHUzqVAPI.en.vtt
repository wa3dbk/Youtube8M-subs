very<00:02:27.620> soft<00:02:28.040> elegant<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.910> had<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> little

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
very soft elegant and it had a little

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
touch of touch of sherry wood but then

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.600 
touch of touch of sherry wood but then
that<00:02:32.450> whisper<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.930> Pete<00:02:33.200> towards<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.950> end<00:02:34.190> and

that whisper of Pete towards the end and
that's<00:02:34.970> what<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.180> replicated<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:37.070> about

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
that's what I replicated and just about

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.520 
that's what I replicated and just about
a<00:02:37.400> few<00:02:37.670> weeks<00:02:37.910> ago<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.810> put<00:02:38.990> it<00:02:39.110> onto<00:02:39.290> the

came<00:03:21.710> in<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.280> bottle<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:22.790> you're<00:03:22.970> fully<00:03:23.240> aware

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
came in the bottle so you're fully aware

came in the bottle so you're fully aware
the<00:03:24.140> bottle<00:03:24.560> was<00:03:24.710> completely<00:03:25.250> wrapped<00:03:25.550> in

the Antarctic Heritage Trust made it

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.650 
the Antarctic Heritage Trust made it
quite<00:03:30.980> clear<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.880> were<00:03:32.030> not<00:03:32.360> allowed<00:03:32.630> to

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
quite clear you were not allowed to

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.620 
quite clear you were not allowed to
damage<00:03:33.350> any<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.130> articles<00:03:34.550> so<00:03:34.880> we<00:03:35.330> had<00:03:35.510> to

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
damage any of the articles so we had to

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.020 
damage any of the articles so we had to
use<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> syringe<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:37.340> went<00:03:37.550> through<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
use a syringe that went through the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.930 
use a syringe that went through the
paper<00:03:38.480> through<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.440> actual<00:03:39.830> seal<00:03:40.370> down<00:03:40.730> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
paper through the actual seal down the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.330 
paper through the actual seal down the
side<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.510> cork<00:03:41.810> into<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.770> whiskey<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.250> we

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
side of the cork into the whiskey and we

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.760 
side of the cork into the whiskey and we
extracted<00:03:44.030> out<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.750> was<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.020> only<00:03:45.380> way<00:03:45.500> we

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
extracted out that was the only way we

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.160 
extracted out that was the only way we
could<00:03:45.980> retrieve<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:47.000> whiskey<00:03:47.360> without<00:03:47.660> you

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
could retrieve the whiskey without you

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.440 
could retrieve the whiskey without you
know<00:03:48.260> making<00:03:48.500> any<00:03:48.860> damage<00:03:49.340> whatsoever<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:50.330> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
know making any damage whatsoever to the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.600 
know making any damage whatsoever to the
packaging<00:03:51.020> and<00:03:51.230> that's<00:03:51.620> why<00:03:51.770> we<00:03:51.890> had<00:03:52.490> to

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
packaging and that's why we had to

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.330 
packaging and that's why we had to
extract<00:03:53.080> three<00:03:54.080> bottles<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.709> urinalysis

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
extract three bottles and urinalysis

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.940 
extract three bottles and urinalysis
