person<00:01:56.369> united<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.840> two<00:01:57.990> birds<00:01:58.229> sometimes

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
person united one or two birds sometimes

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.959 
person united one or two birds sometimes
you<00:01:58.860> need<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.549> if<00:01:59.759> threat

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you need a little bit more if threat

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.149 
you need a little bit more if threat
like<00:02:00.149> really<00:02:00.509> long<00:02:00.689> range<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> problem

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
like really long range but a problem

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.730 
like really long range but a problem
that<00:02:02.310> tubers<00:02:02.820> should<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.329> good<00:02:03.570> enough<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.560> in

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
that tubers should be good enough but in

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.859 
that tubers should be good enough but in
those<00:02:04.920> situations<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.729> personally<00:02:06.180> don't<00:02:06.570> get

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
those situations I personally don't get

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.139 
those situations I personally don't get
a<00:02:06.899> lot<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.140> headshots<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.250> getting<00:02:08.580> those<00:02:08.759> 10

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
a lot of headshots so getting those 10

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.790 
a lot of headshots so getting those 10
head<00:02:09.390> shots<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.869> order<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> likely<00:02:10.410> quick-draw

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
head shots in order to likely quick-draw

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.160 
head shots in order to likely quick-draw
handle<00:02:11.129> later<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.670> night<00:02:11.870> was<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> bit<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
handle later on that night was a bit of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.610 
handle later on that night was a bit of
a<00:02:13.230> pain

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
a pain

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.039 
a pain
but<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.340> definitely<00:02:14.730> worked<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.599> my<00:02:15.720> favor

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
but it definitely worked in my favor

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.920 
but it definitely worked in my favor
this<00:02:16.830> gun<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.340> think<00:02:17.670> works<00:02:17.849> best<00:02:18.030> at<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.659> mid

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
this gun I think works best at like mid

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.170 
this gun I think works best at like mid
range<00:02:19.140> at<00:02:19.470> long<00:02:20.069> range<00:02:20.340> will<00:02:20.549> struggle<00:02:20.790> little

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
range at long range will struggle little

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.729 
range at long range will struggle little
bits<00:02:21.299> is<00:02:21.510> because<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> connection<00:02:22.349> at<00:02:22.709> the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
bits is because the connection at the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.949 
bits is because the connection at the
moment<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> little<00:02:23.879> bit<00:02:24.000> icky<00:02:24.330> it's

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
moment is a little bit icky it's

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.690 
moment is a little bit icky it's
actually<00:02:25.319> really<00:02:25.500> bad<00:02:25.860> if<00:02:26.129> employed<00:02:26.459> on<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
actually really bad if employed on the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.880 
actually really bad if employed on the
zoo<00:02:26.849> yeah<00:02:27.060> but<00:02:27.870> hopefully<00:02:28.290> they'll<00:02:28.409> fix<00:02:28.650> that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
zoo yeah but hopefully they'll fix that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.710 
zoo yeah but hopefully they'll fix that
in<00:02:29.040> next<00:02:29.310> few<00:02:29.430> days<00:02:29.580> I'm<00:02:29.819> really<00:02:30.030> hoping<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:30.450> a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
in next few days I'm really hoping for a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.140 
in next few days I'm really hoping for a
hotfix<00:02:31.230> sometime<00:02:31.680> soon<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.790> apart<00:02:32.940> from<00:02:33.030> that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
hotfix sometime soon but apart from that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.089 
hotfix sometime soon but apart from that
this<00:02:33.510> gun<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.780> definitely<00:02:34.440> one<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.739> should

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
this gun is definitely one you should

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.339 
this gun is definitely one you should
try<00:02:35.310> out<00:02:35.340> now<00:02:36.269> within<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.599> gameplay<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.319> I

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
try out now within this gameplay like I

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.869 
try out now within this gameplay like I
said<00:02:37.560> before<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.829> was<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.250> red<00:02:38.400> dots<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
said before I was just the red dots the

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.000 
said before I was just the red dots the
foregrip<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.690> laser<00:02:39.900> sights<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.829> red

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
foregrip and the laser sights the red

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.009 
foregrip and the laser sights the red
thought<00:02:41.220> makes<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.790> lot<00:02:42.000> easier<00:02:42.239> for<00:02:42.659> you<00:02:42.989> to

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
thought makes it a lot easier for you to

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.099 
thought makes it a lot easier for you to
stay<00:02:43.349> on<00:02:43.470> target<00:02:43.739> admits<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.400> long<00:02:44.579> range<00:02:44.790> at

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
stay on target admits a long range at

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.440 
stay on target admits a long range at
close<00:02:46.109> range<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:47.010> are<00:02:47.370> definitely<00:02:47.730> at<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.329> bit

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
close range you are definitely at a bit

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.690 
close range you are definitely at a bit
of<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.569> disadvantage<00:02:49.220> especially<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.549> do

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
of a disadvantage especially if you do

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.580 
of a disadvantage especially if you do
not<00:02:50.849> yet<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.629> quick-draw<00:02:52.019> handle<00:02:52.410> and

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
not yet have the quick-draw handle and

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.589 
not yet have the quick-draw handle and
the<00:02:53.220> adjustable<00:02:53.700> stock<00:02:53.940> once<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.420> those

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
the adjustable stock once you have those

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.509 
the adjustable stock once you have those
two<00:02:54.840> attachments<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.950> should<00:02:56.129> be<00:02:56.220> good<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.400> go

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
two attachments you should be good to go

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.089 
two attachments you should be good to go
even<00:02:57.060> at<00:02:57.150> close<00:02:57.269> range<00:02:57.599> of<00:02:57.720> course<00:02:57.930> because<00:02:58.799> in

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
even at close range of course because in

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.559 
even at close range of course because in
that<00:02:59.190> case<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.489> can<00:02:59.609> just<00:02:59.790> stray<00:03:00.090> from<00:03:00.150> left

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
that case you can just stray from left

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.899 
that case you can just stray from left
to<00:03:00.629> right<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.140> even<00:03:01.950> someone<00:03:02.459> who's<00:03:02.609> using<00:03:02.790> a

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
to right and even someone who's using a

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.789 
to right and even someone who's using a
bell<00:03:03.120> should<00:03:03.480> then<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:04.109> pretty<00:03:04.470> hard<00:03:04.739> time

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
bell should then have a pretty hard time

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.580 
bell should then have a pretty hard time
of<00:03:05.220> making<00:03:06.030> sure<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.569> he<00:03:06.690> stays<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:06.959> target

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
of making sure that he stays on target

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.680 
of making sure that he stays on target
so<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.829> should<00:03:08.010> be<00:03:08.040> good<00:03:08.159> in<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.519> case<00:03:08.790> then

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
so you should be good in that case then

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.300 
so you should be good in that case then
of<00:03:09.900> course<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.260> foregrip<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.829> i<00:03:10.859> said<00:03:11.129> not

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
of course the foregrip like i said not

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.369 
of course the foregrip like i said not
really<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.760> necessary<00:03:12.239> but<00:03:12.959> i<00:03:13.019> didn't<00:03:13.290> really

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
really to necessary but i didn't really

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.380 
really to necessary but i didn't really
have<00:03:13.590> any<00:03:13.829> other<00:03:13.920> attachments<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:14.700> then<00:03:15.359> I

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
have any other attachments and then I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.210 
have any other attachments and then I
was<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.870> latest<00:03:16.140> sites<00:03:16.409> just<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.159> it

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
was in the latest sites just so that it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.620 
was in the latest sites just so that it
would<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> little<00:03:17.669> bit<00:03:17.790> easier<00:03:18.180> for<00:03:18.329> me<00:03:18.450> to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
would be a little bit easier for me to

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.620 
would be a little bit easier for me to
get<00:03:19.139> those<00:03:19.349> hip<00:03:19.590> fire<00:03:19.799> kills<00:03:20.099> because<00:03:20.880> as<00:03:21.419> you

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
get those hip fire kills because as you

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.210 
get those hip fire kills because as you
all<00:03:21.750> know<00:03:21.780> or<00:03:22.230> as<00:03:22.349> most<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.919> should<00:03:23.099> know

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
all know or as most of you should know

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.030 
all know or as most of you should know
by<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:24.209> need<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.690> believe<00:03:24.959> 25<00:03:25.560> hip<00:03:25.859> fire

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
by now you need I believe 25 hip fire

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.190 
by now you need I believe 25 hip fire
kills<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.609> order<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.090> unlock<00:03:27.419> the<00:03:27.660> adjustable

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
kills in order to unlock the adjustable

kills in order to unlock the adjustable
stock<00:03:28.579> which<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.819> personally<00:03:30.090> think<00:03:30.419> is<00:03:30.660> a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
stock which I personally think is a

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.970 
stock which I personally think is a
little<00:03:31.109> ways<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.440> don't<00:03:31.590> really<00:03:31.680> see<00:03:31.769> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
little ways I don't really see the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.559 
little ways I don't really see the
connection<00:03:32.459> between<00:03:32.489> an<00:03:32.849> adjustable<00:03:33.359> stock

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
connection between an adjustable stock

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.690 
connection between an adjustable stock
so<00:03:33.780> aiming<00:03:34.079> down<00:03:34.230> sights<00:03:34.310> with<00:03:35.310> an<00:03:35.430> assault

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
so aiming down sights with an assault

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.729 
so aiming down sights with an assault
rifle<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.389> getting<00:03:36.840> hip<00:03:36.959> fire<00:03:37.169> kills<00:03:37.500> but

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
rifle and getting hip fire kills but

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.250 
rifle and getting hip fire kills but
that's<00:03:37.889> besides<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.430> point<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.870> that

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
that's besides the point I think that

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.080 
that's besides the point I think that
this<00:03:40.500> gun<00:03:40.829> becomes<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.280> lot<00:03:41.459> better<00:03:41.700> once<00:03:41.910> you

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
this gun becomes a lot better once you

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.270 
this gun becomes a lot better once you
also<00:03:42.449> attach<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.900> adjustable<00:03:43.349> stock<00:03:43.560> so

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
also attach the adjustable stock so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.220 
also attach the adjustable stock so
definitely<00:03:44.940> make<00:03:45.389> sure<00:03:45.540> we<00:03:45.629> lock<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.840> one

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
definitely make sure we lock that one

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.589 
definitely make sure we lock that one
now<00:03:46.859> at<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.250> moment<00:03:47.579> I<00:03:47.669> still<00:03:48.000> need<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.359> use<00:03:48.569> a

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
toughness make sure that you don't

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.990 
toughness make sure that you don't
flinch<00:04:40.560> as<00:04:40.710> much<00:04:40.860> when<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.370> opponent<00:04:41.520> hit<00:04:41.820> you

now<00:04:42.540> in<00:04:42.780> this<00:04:42.990> game<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.470> want<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.740> say<00:04:43.860> the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
now in this game I want to say the

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.400 
now in this game I want to say the
toughness<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.580> definitely<00:04:45.210> not<00:04:45.390> a<00:04:45.450> perv<00:04:45.720> that

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
toughness is definitely not a perv that

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.280 
toughness is definitely not a perv that
is<00:04:46.650> necessary<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.490> don't<00:04:48.000> think<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.330> anyway<00:04:48.510> but

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
is necessary I don't think so anyway but

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.720 
is necessary I don't think so anyway but
in<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.590> case<00:04:49.800> because<00:04:50.130> using<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.490> burst

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
in this case because using a burst

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.630 
in this case because using a burst
weapon<00:04:51.150> accuracy<00:04:51.570> is<00:04:51.810> key<00:04:52.140> so<00:04:52.400> toughness<00:04:53.400> will

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
weapon accuracy is key so toughness will

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.880 
weapon accuracy is key so toughness will
help<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.000> out<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.180> lot<00:04:54.330> Plus<00:04:55.230> this<00:04:55.260> gun<00:04:55.650> works

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
help you out a lot Plus this gun works

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.100 
help you out a lot Plus this gun works
best<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.310> like<00:04:56.430> mid<00:04:56.640> to<00:04:56.790> long<00:04:56.940> range<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.480> in

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
best is like mid to long range and in

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.810 
best is like mid to long range and in
those<00:04:58.230> situations<00:04:58.860> staying<00:04:59.130> on<00:04:59.250> target<00:04:59.490> is

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
those situations staying on target is

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.270 
those situations staying on target is
like<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.120> said<00:05:00.390> key<00:05:00.600> so<00:05:01.200> toughness<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.890> a<00:05:01.950> bit<00:05:02.190> of

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
like I said key so toughness is a bit of

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.550 
like I said key so toughness is a bit of
a<00:05:02.340> must<00:05:02.610> we<00:05:02.850> use<00:05:03.060> this<00:05:03.210> weapon<00:05:03.450> but<00:05:04.260> if<00:05:04.470> you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
a must we use this weapon but if you

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.810 
a must we use this weapon but if you
want<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.770> rush<00:05:04.890> around<00:05:04.920> flicking<00:05:05.400> assault

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
want to rush around flicking assault

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.660 
want to rush around flicking assault
rifle<00:05:06.300> or<00:05:06.480> an<00:05:06.600> SMG<00:05:06.900> or<00:05:07.560> anything<00:05:08.310> along<00:05:08.400> those

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
rifle or an SMG or anything along those

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.910 
rifle or an SMG or anything along those
lines<00:05:08.970> you<00:05:09.150> really<00:05:09.390> don't<00:05:09.630> need<00:05:09.780> toughness<00:05:10.260> in

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
lines you really don't need toughness in

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.010 
lines you really don't need toughness in
any<00:05:11.340> way<00:05:11.460> shape<00:05:11.670> or<00:05:11.790> form<00:05:11.850> and<00:05:12.210> then<00:05:12.840> finally

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
any way shape or form and then finally

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.170 
any way shape or form and then finally
we<00:05:13.350> also<00:05:13.500> have<00:05:13.770> scavenger<00:05:14.310> because<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:14.790> tend<00:05:15.030> to

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
we also have scavenger because I tend to

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.390 
we also have scavenger because I tend to
run<00:05:15.360> out<00:05:15.480> of<00:05:15.510> ammo<00:05:15.750> quite<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.080> bit<00:05:16.290> but<00:05:17.070> you<00:05:17.250> can

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
run out of ammo quite a bit but you can

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.590 
run out of ammo quite a bit but you can
also<00:05:17.520> solve<00:05:17.760> this<00:05:17.910> one<00:05:18.120> for<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.450> plastic

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
also solve this one for the plastic

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.110 
also solve this one for the plastic
presser<00:05:19.200> /<00:05:19.500> that<00:05:20.130> one's<00:05:20.310> also<00:05:20.580> pretty<00:05:20.910> good

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
presser / that one's also pretty good

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.510 
presser / that one's also pretty good
and<00:05:21.360> then<00:05:22.200> for<00:05:22.590> my<00:05:22.650> score<00:05:22.950> streaks<00:05:23.250> I<00:05:23.370> will

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
and then for my score streaks I will

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.700 
and then for my score streaks I will
using<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.910> UAV<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.780> system<00:05:25.170> hag<00:05:25.350> and<00:05:25.560> the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
using the UAV the system hag and the

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.680 
using the UAV the system hag and the
bombing<00:05:26.100> run<00:05:26.280> now<00:05:26.820> this<00:05:26.970> is<00:05:27.030> slowly<00:05:27.420> becoming

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
bombing run now this is slowly becoming

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.540 
bombing run now this is slowly becoming
my<00:05:28.080> favorite<00:05:28.470> scorestreak<00:05:28.890> set<00:05:29.100> up<00:05:29.220> in<00:05:29.400> the

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
my favorite scorestreak set up in the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.390 
my favorite scorestreak set up in the
game<00:05:29.730> I<00:05:30.000> only<00:05:30.600> recently<00:05:30.930> started<00:05:31.320> using<00:05:31.710> the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
game I only recently started using the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.280 
game I only recently started using the
bombing<00:05:32.790> run<00:05:32.940> after<00:05:33.300> few<00:05:33.510> people<00:05:33.750> recommended

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
bombing run after few people recommended

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.620

good it's actually really good like on
average<00:05:38.310> i<00:05:38.460> get<00:05:38.670> to<00:05:38.880> 24<00:05:39.210> kills<00:05:39.450> with<00:05:39.660> this<00:05:39.840> one

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
average i get to 24 kills with this one

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.170 
average i get to 24 kills with this one
on<00:05:40.230> certain<00:05:41.040> maps<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.430> doesn't<00:05:41.730> work<00:05:41.820> well<00:05:42.060> at

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
on certain maps it doesn't work well at

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.610 
on certain maps it doesn't work well at
all<00:05:42.300> like<00:05:42.510> I'm<00:05:42.630> right<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:43.080> doesn't<00:05:43.230> work<00:05:43.410> too

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
all like I'm right it doesn't work too

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.190 
all like I'm right it doesn't work too
well<00:05:43.650> on<00:05:44.420> ascent<00:05:45.420> it<00:05:45.600> doesn't<00:05:45.870> work<00:05:45.960> too<00:05:46.170> well

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
well on ascent it doesn't work too well

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.890 
well on ascent it doesn't work too well
but<00:05:46.650> on<00:05:46.950> those<00:05:47.100> open<00:05:47.430> maps<00:05:47.640> of<00:05:47.850> green<00:05:48.120> bats<00:05:48.360> you

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
but on those open maps of green bats you

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.150 
but on those open maps of green bats you
should<00:05:49.080> be<00:05:49.170> able<00:05:49.230> to<00:05:49.380> get<00:05:49.560> quite<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.770> few<00:05:49.830> kills

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
should be able to get quite a few kills

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.430 
should be able to get quite a few kills
with<00:05:50.370> this<00:05:50.550> one<00:05:50.730> so<00:05:51.330> definitely<00:05:51.600> give<00:05:52.260> that

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
with this one so definitely give that

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.960 
with this one so definitely give that
one<00:05:52.560> a<00:05:52.590> go<00:05:52.740> and<00:05:52.890> then<00:05:53.040> once<00:05:53.220> you<00:05:53.310> get<00:05:53.490> the<00:05:53.610> UAV

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
one a go and then once you get the UAV

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.670 
one a go and then once you get the UAV
you<00:05:54.600> should<00:05:54.780> easily<00:05:54.960> be<00:05:55.200> able<00:05:55.320> to<00:05:55.500> get<00:05:55.590> the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
you should easily be able to get the

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.350 
you should easily be able to get the
system<00:05:55.890> hack<00:05:56.190> there's<00:05:56.400> two<00:05:56.580> more<00:05:56.760> kills<00:05:57.030> and

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
system hack there's two more kills and

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.270 
system hack there's two more kills and
then<00:05:57.930> just<00:05:58.110> one<00:05:58.350> more<00:05:58.500> kill<00:05:58.770> in<00:05:58.920> order<00:05:58.980> to<00:05:59.160> get

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
then just one more kill in order to get

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.400 
then just one more kill in order to get
the<00:05:59.370> bombing<00:05:59.790> run<00:05:59.970> you<00:06:00.660> should<00:06:00.840> be<00:06:00.960> good<00:06:01.080> give

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
the bombing run you should be good give

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.500 
the bombing run you should be good give
this<00:06:01.560> setup<00:06:01.770> ago<00:06:01.980> but<00:06:02.430> also<00:06:02.610> definitely<00:06:02.970> stay

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
this setup ago but also definitely stay

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.600 
this setup ago but also definitely stay
on<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.660> lookout<00:06:03.750> for<00:06:04.230> a<00:06:04.770> best<00:06:05.190> class<00:06:05.430> setup

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
on the lookout for a best class setup

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.000 
on the lookout for a best class setup

comments what you think of it I
personally<00:06:13.350> really<00:06:13.590> like<00:06:13.770> it<00:06:14.100> not<00:06:14.310> a<00:06:14.370> lot<00:06:14.490> of

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
personally really like it not a lot of

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.790 
personally really like it not a lot of
people<00:06:14.610> are<00:06:14.850> using<00:06:15.030> it<00:06:15.210> at<00:06:15.390> the<00:06:15.420> moment<00:06:15.540> and<00:06:16.230> I

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
people are using it at the moment and I

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.380 
people are using it at the moment and I
think<00:06:16.860> it's<00:06:17.220> really<00:06:17.280> good<00:06:17.610> so<00:06:17.850> I<00:06:17.880> thought<00:06:18.210> that

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
think it's really good so I thought that

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.750 
think it's really good so I thought that
I<00:06:18.450> would<00:06:18.600> make<00:06:18.720> a<00:06:18.780> video<00:06:19.050> about<00:06:19.260> it<00:06:19.590> but<00:06:20.370> anyway

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
I would make a video about it but anyway

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.160 
I would make a video about it but anyway
