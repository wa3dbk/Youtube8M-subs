Vegemite suit if you negotiate
when<00:01:06.280> he<00:01:06.370> takes<00:01:06.610> these<00:01:06.880> late<00:01:07.300> ask<00:01:07.600> yourself

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
when he takes these late ask yourself

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.740 
when he takes these late ask yourself
which<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:08.850> Chris<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:10.120> think<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.630> most

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
which is Chris I think the most

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.450 
which is Chris I think the most
important<00:01:11.290> is<00:01:12.690> mommy<00:01:13.690> aside<00:01:14.170> which<00:01:15.100> tastes

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
important is mommy aside which tastes

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.210 
important is mommy aside which tastes
better<00:01:15.730> than<00:01:15.970> pay<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.300> a<00:01:16.510> or<00:01:16.900> b

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.179 

and<00:01:21.220> then<00:01:21.540> figure<00:01:22.540> out<00:01:22.689> which<00:01:22.990> has<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.950> mommy

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
and then figure out which has the mommy

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.160 
and then figure out which has the mommy
inning<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.909> hopefully<00:01:28.119> this<00:01:28.630> means<00:01:28.869> the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
inning so hopefully this means the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.440 
inning so hopefully this means the
business<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.920> demonstration<00:01:30.670> is<00:01:30.759> also<00:01:31.119> water

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
business of demonstration is also water

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.160 
business of demonstration is also water
resour<00:01:32.079> gosh

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170

can cook because we didn't like to study

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.200 
can cook because we didn't like to study
this<00:01:58.899> go<00:01:59.110> now<00:01:59.830> because<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.340> states<00:02:00.820> like<00:02:00.970> the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
this go now because of states like the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.960 
this go now because of states like the
modern<00:02:01.539> which<00:02:01.659> is<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.080> hard<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.159> describe<00:02:03.610> just
