00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:29.309 
and this Dively has to melt completely
now<00:05:27.309> this<00:05:27.610> set<00:05:27.819> up<00:05:27.939> is<00:05:28.119> bubbling<00:05:28.599> and<00:05:28.809> it's

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
now this set up is bubbling and it's

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:34.199 
now this set up is bubbling and it's
ready<00:05:29.830> to<00:05:30.490> check<00:05:30.729> this<00:05:32.369> when<00:05:33.369> you<00:05:33.520> add<00:05:33.729> a<00:05:33.759> drop

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:34.209 
ready to check this when you add a drop

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:38.100 
ready to check this when you add a drop
of<00:05:34.680> syrup<00:05:35.680> into<00:05:36.129> the<00:05:36.369> water<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:37.149> should<00:05:37.659> not

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
of syrup into the water it should not

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.109 
of syrup into the water it should not
dissolve<00:05:38.619> in<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:38.889> water<00:05:39.009> so<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.639> is<00:05:39.969> the

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:40.119 
dissolve in the water so that is the

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:44.070 
dissolve in the water so that is the
consistency<00:05:40.779> we<00:05:41.139> should<00:05:41.349> look<00:05:41.499> for<00:05:43.080> another

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
consistency we should look for another

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.959 
consistency we should look for another
way<00:05:44.409> you<00:05:44.469> can<00:05:44.800> check<00:05:45.069> this<00:05:45.399> syrup<00:05:45.789> is

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:45.969 
way you can check this syrup is

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.049 
way you can check this syrup is
touchless<00:05:46.959> it<00:05:47.229> up<00:05:47.349> with<00:05:47.559> your<00:05:47.800> finger<00:05:48.159> and<00:05:48.339> you

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:49.059 
touchless it up with your finger and you

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.739 
touchless it up with your finger and you
have<00:05:49.270> to<00:05:49.389> get<00:05:49.569> this<00:05:49.779> thread<00:05:50.349> consistency<00:05:51.749> and

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:52.749 
have to get this thread consistency and

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:56.820 
have to get this thread consistency and
I<00:05:53.259> am<00:05:53.319> going<00:05:53.559> to<00:05:53.680> add<00:05:53.889> this<00:05:54.219> set<00:05:54.430> up<00:05:55.649> to<00:05:56.649> this

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
I am going to add this set up to this

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.600 
I am going to add this set up to this
mix<00:05:57.870> it<00:05:58.870> will<00:05:59.080> be<00:05:59.199> too<00:05:59.409> hot<00:05:59.680> so<00:06:00.039> mix<00:06:00.279> it<00:06:00.430> with

can make around 12 to 14 letters with

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.119 
can make around 12 to 14 letters with
the<00:06:36.009> measurement<00:06:36.490> I<00:06:36.580> have<00:06:36.729> given<00:06:37.229> so<00:06:38.229> hope<00:06:38.919> you
