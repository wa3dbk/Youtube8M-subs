 Professional fight 400 pounds lie 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.949
 This film offers in addition to the theoretical representation of a printer 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.380
 Profile the government is shown as such a profile 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.029
 the end of the production chain is in most cases a product 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.990
 Brucker can be roughly divided into four individual categories that tops 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.480
 Rucker per 4 presses and digital presses 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.040
 for different printing conditions there are different profiling 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.320
 Targets available I have the cie here once I hear form Aust 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.340
 Farfan makes out the leader of the month as MS Days for an issue 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.440
 machine 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 There are a variety of Brammer Wx Weidmann Marko Profiler Pesic «but 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.210
 or Print 14 Print Open and so on with me, for example, such forms 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.210
 can measure out and write accordingly the FCC profiles 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.350
 However, there are also many days now, for example, rich Rucker and 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.530
 partial note Anna profiles as for the Pantone witcher com printing process in 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.479
 Textile and advertising technology area is the ride metric definition of the pressure was 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.870
 but essential for profiling, however, there are some rules one can 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.490
 make patterns before we issue a t-shirt on a printer make sure 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.220
 itself that the printer constant pressure at 10 Reb to control the printing 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.160
 You must use this first time in your siren 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.030
 Next, it might be interesting to know if I am 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.060
 just started my first test attempts and a corresponding one 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.360
 CCC profile written off 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.370
 "What matters then or what values ​​or entries would then have to 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.700
 In any case, a good issue profile will be available 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.360
 which is very important that the WT PT Bunk is the white point 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.630
 That's the point that usually points the paper later by accordingly 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.040
 output profile simulated 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.290
 since there is no entry in the sense of absolutely driving metric 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.090
 Rendering intendants fourth this entry also taken at the moment 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.960
 I work that means I work with relative colorimetry with the addition of 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.140
 Treaty PCT therefore the white point 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.410
 the probe dams table GMTN ESV light this check indicates whether one 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.050
 device-independent color can be reproduced or how far away it is 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.050
 soon the ingot value is in a color space 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.859
 The profitable has different kind of equal-weight Ex and they are just there 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.400
 spoiled at half for the different Rendering Intense 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:31.829
 to determine that Andy knows Carlos Pace is converted to l'art so that 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.999
 Buffer Connections per is and the PT 0 ORTEC until just the other conversion 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:41.039
 namely from the PCs color space so the Franco Falcon Action Space in the 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.279
 Rule Artist back in a whitaler's fun 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.120
 in an issue what would it be so from CMYK to La Punt of Love again 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.939
 back to SIA Malki 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.659
 These are the entries or some entries that you surely have 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.119
 What else is there for possibility namely the 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.449
 Quality characteristics of an output profile 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.969
 All entries of an ICE profit must be in the program via the cadre 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.949
 For example, be visible a good issue where many always have more than 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:12.249
 loyal 50 kilos ready mostly 500 brother Maher that's all under 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.349
 350 kilowatts is definitely wrong 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.879
 It should be different tables for the edges butt too deep 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.549
 relatively warm fresh as already mentioned mostly information is mine 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.219
 According to not and there maybe a small hint of the corresponding 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.859
 Stallone is stated to have been declared in most gardens in Texas 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.939
 should normally be less than 1
