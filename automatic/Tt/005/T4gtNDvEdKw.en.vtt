00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
a 1926 Scott says on the plate 26 but

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.049 
a 1926 Scott says on the plate 26 but
even<00:00:06.960> 30<00:00:07.200> years<00:00:07.350> later<00:00:07.500> in<00:00:07.859> 1956<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.880> thing

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
even 30 years later in 1956 this thing

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.669 
even 30 years later in 1956 this thing
would<00:00:09.179> have<00:00:09.269> been<00:00:09.360> technologically<00:00:10.110> advanced

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
would have been technologically advanced

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.100 
would have been technologically advanced
it's<00:00:11.580> extremely<00:00:12.059> unique<00:00:12.269> for<00:00:12.509> two<00:00:12.630> reasons

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
it's extremely unique for two reasons

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.550 
it's extremely unique for two reasons
one<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:14.099> old<00:00:14.280> history<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.940> two<00:00:15.719> its<00:00:16.109> modern

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
one it's old history and two its modern

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.269 
one it's old history and two its modern
history<00:00:17.060> both<00:00:18.060> are<00:00:18.600> super<00:00:18.990> cool<00:00:19.320> let's<00:00:20.039> take<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
history both are super cool let's take a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.790 
history both are super cool let's take a
look<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.570> Scott<00:00:21.810> motorcycle<00:00:22.470> company

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
look at the Scott motorcycle company

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.140 
look at the Scott motorcycle company
started<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.910> 1908<00:00:24.660> there<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
started in 1908 there are a lot of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.279 
started in 1908 there are a lot of
motorcycle<00:00:27.150> manufacturers<00:00:27.570> at<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.019> time

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
motorcycle manufacturers at that time

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.439 
motorcycle manufacturers at that time
but<00:00:28.470> Scott<00:00:29.310> went<00:00:29.490> his<00:00:29.609> own<00:00:29.730> way

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
but Scott went his own way

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.979 
but Scott went his own way
it's<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.579> two-stroke<00:00:32.579> engine<00:00:33.059> many<00:00:33.750> people

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
it's a two-stroke engine many people

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.870 
it's a two-stroke engine many people
think<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:35.070> they're<00:00:35.430> simpler<00:00:35.790> in

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
think that because they're simpler in

four-strokes but in fact that's not the
