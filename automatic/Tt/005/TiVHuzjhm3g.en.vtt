00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.760
 january on mallorca and the sun 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.989
 it is really hot but one more 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.000
 little bit hoarse is my companion 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.519
 what I had here today from the house 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.160
 track thus one in America designed 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.769
 special feature that actually 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.530
 either domain speaks domain i have 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.839
 already heard or even domini 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.140
 Most importantly, this is a high end 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.949
 high modulus carbon frame from the six 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.810
 siri from track like carbon will suit everyone 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.960
 who knows this American brand 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.240
 Of course, what do you say stable yes 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.119
 Of course easy so of course so without 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.350
 my pedals just 68 kilo but and 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.220
 Now we come to what they are 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.460
 absolute novelty is speed also iso 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.030
 speed if you speak German that 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.100
 The upper tube and the seat tube are not 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.700
 more connected with each other are yes 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.619
 already connected but just movable 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.060
 that's an enormous amount 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.450
 comfort is the same time 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.210
 So demonstrate a bit 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.520
 the seat tube starts almost over here 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.170
 the bottle holder itself to the front 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.659
 move when you're on the saddle 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.159
 and of course that is for the 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.539
 roads on Mallorca are actually good 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.130
 not so important for the 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.990
 Classic for the professionals or for 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.130
 the people at the level of lowe's 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.259
 sometimes go on bad roads 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.450
 I like this bike a huge comfort 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.969
 win equipped here in this 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.280
 fall with the shimano dura it with the 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.149
 completely new variant, however, not the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.670
 electric and with house mark bonn 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.560
 carrier the eu has three carbon wheels 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.990
 are installed 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.210
 beautiful white aerodynamic spoke on 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.220
 the dt swiss also has one there 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.780
 made design-technical thoughts 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.730
 also from the home bonn carrier to all 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.170
 stem of the easy one is easy to clamp 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.500
 and a great carbon handlebar the well in 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.580
 the hand is another detail what 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.530
 his only on the second view 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.700
 the shape of the fork is striking 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.040
 really so forward a bit more 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.540
 yes, from the center of the bike away 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.040
 but then seems to run through the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.080
 selection in again a bit closer 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.480
 So comes the geometry of the council is 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.970
 gigantically good just when you 're faster 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.980
 also wants to enjoy downhill runs and 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.800
 represents stock stiffness so who is 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.130
 this grandiose bottom camp times 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.380
 looked at what with the seat tube what 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.900
 top down top quero choice is the 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.730
 asymmetric shape also under the tube 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.940
 nothing is lost at all 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.610
 another gimmick detect ready that is 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.220
 cadence and speed directly 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.100
 in the context of the acceptance integrated for 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.490
 a culprit plus devices also compatible 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.270
 So there you are actually on the stand 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.490
 the technology at the top and now times 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.950
 look how the top tube that 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.570
 separated that aspire here in this 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.810
 so passes 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.220
 Now the seat tube moves you can see 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.950
 Errors even at the front of the projector 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.570
 springs and I can tell you if you are 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.570
 because it says that 76
