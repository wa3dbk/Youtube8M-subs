00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
makeup that you're wearing and it's

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.700 
makeup that you're wearing and it's
supposed<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.300> protect<00:00:33.630> your<00:00:33.780> skin<00:00:33.960> from<00:00:34.020> UVA

premise of this is that it's going to
keep<00:00:40.590> your<00:00:40.920> skin<00:00:41.579> under<00:00:41.850> control<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.450> cover

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
up the redness it does have a green tint

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.020 
up the redness it does have a green tint

reason<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.060> keep<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.360> back<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
reason I keep going back to this is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.899 
reason I keep going back to this is
because<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> does<00:01:50.009> keep<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.369> skin<00:01:50.640> under

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
because it does keep my skin under

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
because it does keep my skin under
control<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.450> lot<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.689> times<00:01:51.869> during<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.259> day<00:01:52.470> if

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
control a lot of times during the day if

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.700 
control a lot of times during the day if
I<00:01:52.770> don't<00:01:53.009> wear<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.869> will<00:01:54.869> encounter<00:01:55.290> some

I don't wear this I will encounter some

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.380 
I don't wear this I will encounter some
sort<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.100> what<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:56.880> call<00:01:57.060> environmental

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
sort of what they call environmental

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.270 
sort of what they call environmental
aggressors<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.469> will<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.159> much

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
aggressors like it will just be so much

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.709 
aggressors like it will just be so much
hotter<00:01:59.490> outside<00:01:59.670> than<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.090> inside<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.540> do

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
foundations oxidized and it would be

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.639 
foundations oxidized and it would be
ridiculous<00:02:06.479> my<00:02:06.899> neck<00:02:07.049> will<00:02:07.200> be<00:02:07.290> perfectly

complaint<00:02:46.630> about<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.680> my<00:02:47.709> only<00:02:48.010> one

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
complaint about this that is my only one

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.360 
complaint about this that is my only one
actually<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.739> more<00:02:50.739> than<00:02:50.860> one<00:02:51.010> fluid<00:02:51.250> ounce

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
actually it is more than one fluid ounce

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.090 
actually it is more than one fluid ounce
let<00:02:51.640> me<00:02:51.730> check<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:51.940> see<00:02:52.150> how<00:02:52.209> much<00:02:52.330> is<00:02:52.480> exactly

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
let me check to see how much is exactly

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.589 
let me check to see how much is exactly
its<00:02:54.360> 1.35<00:02:55.360> fluid<00:02:55.810> ounces<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.470> it's<00:02:57.390> $18.50<00:02:58.390> so

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
its 1.35 fluid ounces and it's $18.50 so

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.420 
its 1.35 fluid ounces and it's $18.50 so
this<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.959> pretty<00:02:59.290> cost-effective<00:03:00.160> primer

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
this is a pretty cost-effective primer

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.820 
this is a pretty cost-effective primer
as<00:03:00.670> most<00:03:01.110> primers<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.319> get<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.680> like

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
as most primers that you get it like

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.940 
as most primers that you get it like
Sephora<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.430> all<00:03:03.880> stores<00:03:04.870> like<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.500> like

Sephora and all stores like that like

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.350 
Sephora and all stores like that like
Nordstrom<00:03:06.900> picks<00:03:07.900> on<00:03:08.080> my<00:03:08.200> eyebrows<00:03:08.940> they<00:03:09.940> are

Nordstrom picks on my eyebrows they are

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.800 
Nordstrom picks on my eyebrows they are
one<00:03:10.690> fluid<00:03:10.959> ounce<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:11.319> this<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.680> more<00:03:12.810> product

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810
