the<00:00:00.810> cerebral<00:00:01.230> cortex<00:00:01.260> of<00:00:02.360> humans<00:00:04.400> carnivores

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
the cerebral cortex of humans carnivores

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.129 
the cerebral cortex of humans carnivores
most<00:00:06.839> primates<00:00:07.350> in<00:00:07.620> general<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.280> have<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.139> series

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
most primates in general I have a series

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.910 
most primates in general I have a series
of<00:00:10.370> fissures<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:12.000> know<00:00:12.090> crevice<00:00:12.900> ism<00:00:13.230> those

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
of fissures you know crevice ism those

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.330 
of fissures you know crevice ism those
are<00:00:14.130> called<00:00:14.370> salsa<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:16.710> major<00:00:16.949> ones<00:00:17.160> I

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
are called salsa so two major ones I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
are called salsa so two major ones I
want<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> think<00:00:17.820> about<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.109> right

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
want you to think about this one right

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.529 
want you to think about this one right
here<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:21.920> this<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.100> right<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:27.119> this

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
here and this one right here so this

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.190 
here and this one right here so this
first<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.220> called<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.060> central<00:00:30.449> sulcus

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.479 

and<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.380> divides<00:00:35.510> not<00:00:36.510> only<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.649> gyre<00:00:38.010> II<00:00:38.040> so

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and it divides not only the gyre II so

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.190 
and it divides not only the gyre II so
these<00:00:38.610> large<00:00:39.329> hunks<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.020> meat<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.290> are<00:00:40.680> here

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
these large hunks of meat that are here

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.819 
these large hunks of meat that are here
gyrus<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> called<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> post<00:00:45.829> central

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
gyrus so this is called the post central

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.760 
gyrus so this is called the post central
gyrus<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.760> called<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> pre<00:00:48.770> central

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
gyrus and this is called the pre central

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.889 
gyrus and this is called the pre central
gyrus<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.789> not<00:00:51.000> only<00:00:51.120> does<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> central

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
gyrus so not only does the central

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.529 
gyrus so not only does the central
sulcus<00:00:52.140> divide<00:00:52.739> gyri<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:53.969> salts<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.480> do

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
sulcus divide gyri like all salts I do

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.160 
sulcus divide gyri like all salts I do
the<00:00:55.320> central<00:00:55.710> sulcus<00:00:55.949> also<00:00:56.550> separates<00:00:57.170> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the central sulcus also separates the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.260 
the central sulcus also separates the
frontal<00:00:58.620> lobe<00:00:58.800> which<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> this<00:01:00.030> stuff

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
frontal lobe which is all of this stuff

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.350 
frontal lobe which is all of this stuff
from<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> parietal<00:01:03.660> lobe<00:01:07.790> all<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.180> we

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
from the parietal lobe all right so we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.890 
from the parietal lobe all right so we
have<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:10.260> separation<00:01:10.939> into<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.570> central

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
have this separation into the central

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.010 
have this separation into the central
sulcus<00:01:13.250> dividing<00:01:14.250> two<00:01:14.520> major<00:01:15.119> hunks<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
sulcus dividing two major hunks of the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.070 
sulcus dividing two major hunks of the
cerebral<00:01:16.409> cortex<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.950> major<00:01:17.159> Gyrene<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.080> in

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
cerebral cortex two major Gyrene and in

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.520 
cerebral cortex two major Gyrene and in
addition<00:01:19.799> two<00:01:20.130> major<00:01:20.430> lobes<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> brain<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
addition two major lobes of the brain of

this<00:01:24.900> guy<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.490> second<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:27.210> called

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
this guy right here second one is called

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.050 
this guy right here second one is called
the<00:01:27.600> lateral<00:01:28.070> sulcus<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> lateral

the lateral sulcus of the lateral

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.330 
the lateral sulcus of the lateral
fissure<00:01:30.270> generally<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.590> tend<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
fissure generally we tend to use the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.749 
fissure generally we tend to use the
word<00:01:32.369> fissure<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> particularly<00:01:34.020> deep

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
word fissure for it particularly deep

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.819 
word fissure for it particularly deep
sulcus<00:01:37.759> lateral<00:01:38.759> fissure<00:01:39.119> separates<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
sulcus lateral fissure separates out the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.219 
sulcus lateral fissure separates out the
frontal<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.729> parietal<00:01:41.820> lobes<00:01:42.420> together<00:01:42.869> from

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
frontal and parietal lobes together from

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
frontal and parietal lobes together from
what's<00:01:43.470> underneath<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.070> which<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.369> temporal

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
what's underneath it which is temporal

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210 
what's underneath it which is temporal
lobe<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> temporal<00:01:46.409> lobe<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.070> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
lobe so the temporal lobe is all of this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
lobe so the temporal lobe is all of this
region<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.299> mind<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.960> these

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
region here now mind you all of these

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.770 
region here now mind you all of these
lobes<00:01:49.380> are<00:01:49.590> being<00:01:49.799> named<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:51.000> bones<00:01:51.270> that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
lobes are being named for the bones that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.380 
lobes are being named for the bones that
over<00:01:52.110> lie<00:01:52.320> them<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> frontal<00:01:54.149> bone

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
over lie them so we have a frontal bone

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.179 
over lie them so we have a frontal bone
and<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> primal<00:01:55.170> bone<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> temporal<00:01:55.860> bone<00:01:56.040> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and a primal bone a temporal bone and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.859 
and a primal bone a temporal bone and
that's<00:01:56.640> where<00:01:56.850> we're<00:01:56.969> gonna<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.360> able<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.570> find

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
that's where we're gonna be able to find

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.510 
that's where we're gonna be able to find
these<00:01:58.049> guys<00:01:58.290> right<00:01:58.799> or<00:01:58.979> didn't<00:01:59.250> eat<00:01:59.340> those

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
these guys right or didn't eat those

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.770 
these guys right or didn't eat those
bones<00:02:00.530> finally<00:02:01.530> there<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.430> sulcus<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:03.240> this

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
bones finally there is a sulcus now this

you have to turn the brain over and look

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.660 
you have to turn the brain over and look
at<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.269> but<00:02:25.989> that<00:02:26.379> makes<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.920> occipital<00:02:27.280> of

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
within each of these up there I should I

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.210 
within each of these up there I should I
should<00:02:43.180> add<00:02:43.329> if<00:02:43.870> we<00:02:44.170> were<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.379> reach<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.890> and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
should add if we were to reach in and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.390 
should add if we were to reach in and
and<00:02:45.370> pull<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.930> lateral<00:02:47.349> sulcus<00:02:47.560> open<00:02:48.250> we

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
and pull the lateral sulcus open we

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.420 
and pull the lateral sulcus open we
would<00:02:48.549> find<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.410> fifth<00:02:50.410> lobe<00:02:50.859> in<00:02:51.099> here<00:02:51.280> it's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
would find a fifth lobe in here it's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.199 
would find a fifth lobe in here it's
called<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.790> insula<00:02:52.650> insula<00:02:53.650> means<00:02:54.209> island

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
called the insula insula means island

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.110 
called the insula insula means island
and<00:02:55.450> it's<00:02:56.170> actually<00:02:56.709> buried<00:02:57.280> inside<00:02:57.579> this

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
and it's actually buried inside this

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.080 
and it's actually buried inside this
lateral<00:02:58.569> fissure<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.579> we'll<00:03:00.579> talk<00:03:00.760> about<00:03:00.819> that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
lateral fissure so we'll talk about that

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.210 
lateral fissure so we'll talk about that
later<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.560> should<00:03:02.739> bear<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.040> mind

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
later on but you should bear in mind

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.740 
later on but you should bear in mind
that<00:03:03.370> there's<00:03:03.549> going<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.790> be<00:03:03.879> a<00:03:03.940> fifth<00:03:04.269> region

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
that there's going to be a fifth region

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.930 
that there's going to be a fifth region
we<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.079> deal<00:03:05.260> with<00:03:05.519> okay<00:03:06.519> so<00:03:06.670> we<00:03:06.819> have

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
we have to deal with okay so we have

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.699 
we have to deal with okay so we have
these<00:03:07.060> five<00:03:07.420> lobes<00:03:07.720> frontal<00:03:08.260> parietal

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
called association areas and the model

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.060 
called association areas and the model
for<00:04:32.080> these<00:04:32.200> areas<00:04:32.710> is<00:04:33.310> they<00:04:34.229> get<00:04:35.229> their<00:04:35.530> inputs

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
for these areas is they get their inputs

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.219 
for these areas is they get their inputs
from<00:04:36.250> primary<00:04:36.909> areas<00:04:37.330> are<00:04:37.539> from<00:04:37.719> earlier

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
from primary areas are from earlier

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.339 
from primary areas are from earlier
sensory<00:04:39.159> areas<00:04:39.550> or<00:04:40.060> from<00:04:40.419> other<00:04:40.599> motor<00:04:40.900> areas

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
sensory areas or from other motor areas

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.620 
sensory areas or from other motor areas
so<00:04:41.620> let's<00:04:41.800> take<00:04:42.039> a<00:04:42.340> state<00:04:42.760> auditory<00:04:43.240> system

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
so let's take a state auditory system

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.800 
so let's take a state auditory system
for<00:04:43.840> an<00:04:43.930> example<00:04:44.700> primary<00:04:45.700> auditory<00:04:46.479> area

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
for an example primary auditory area

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.200 
for an example primary auditory area
here<00:04:47.200> it's<00:04:48.159> an<00:04:48.280> input<00:04:48.610> from<00:04:48.789> the<00:04:48.880> medial

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
here it's an input from the medial

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.320 
here it's an input from the medial
geniculate<00:04:49.240> nucleus<00:04:50.219> so<00:04:51.219> we<00:04:51.370> can<00:04:51.490> have<00:04:51.700> mg<00:04:52.150> and

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
geniculate nucleus so we can have mg and

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.969 
geniculate nucleus so we can have mg and
mg<00:04:53.169> n<00:04:53.380> inputs<00:04:54.130> coming<00:04:54.430> into<00:04:54.700> there<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:56.680> then

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
mg n inputs coming into there it then

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.330 
mg n inputs coming into there it then
speaks<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.760> or<00:04:58.090> sends<00:04:58.330> axons<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:59.340> surrounding

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
speaks to or sends axons to surrounding

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.450 
speaks to or sends axons to surrounding
areas<00:05:00.820> of<00:05:01.180> auditory<00:05:02.080> cortex<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:03.159> those

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
areas of auditory cortex so those

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.730 
areas of auditory cortex so those
surrounding<00:05:04.180> areas<00:05:04.539> of<00:05:04.570> auditory<00:05:05.139> cortex<00:05:05.530> are

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
surrounding areas of auditory cortex are

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.219 
surrounding areas of auditory cortex are
called<00:05:06.039> Association<00:05:06.849> areas<00:05:07.180> because<00:05:08.050> they

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
called Association areas because they

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.379 
called Association areas because they
get<00:05:08.409> their<00:05:08.530> auditory<00:05:09.010> response<00:05:09.430> or<00:05:10.000> so<00:05:10.210> this

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
get their auditory response or so this

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.920 
get their auditory response or so this
model<00:05:10.690> goes<00:05:11.080> from<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.039> primary<00:05:12.930> auditory

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
model goes from the primary auditory

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.990 
model goes from the primary auditory
area<00:05:14.529> and<00:05:14.710> then<00:05:15.159> these<00:05:15.279> guys<00:05:15.520> are<00:05:15.729> going<00:05:15.849> to

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
area and then these guys are going to

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.589 
area and then these guys are going to
talk<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.389> even<00:05:16.630> farther<00:05:17.580> removed<00:05:18.580> areas<00:05:19.419> of

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
talk to even farther removed areas of

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.930 
talk to even farther removed areas of
cortex<00:05:20.020> most<00:05:20.740> of<00:05:20.919> human<00:05:21.159> cortex<00:05:21.400> by<00:05:21.760> this

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
cortex most of human cortex by this

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.390 
cortex most of human cortex by this
definition<00:05:22.389> is<00:05:22.630> Association<00:05:23.349> rather<00:05:24.130> than

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
definition is Association rather than

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.100 
definition is Association rather than

deriving its major drive from the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.469 
deriving its major drive from the
thalamus<00:05:26.650> these<00:05:27.159> areas<00:05:27.580> of<00:05:27.729> cortex<00:05:28.090> are<00:05:28.270> said

areas<00:05:31.000> of<00:05:31.210> cerebral<00:05:31.450> cortex<00:05:31.740> so<00:05:32.740> that's<00:05:32.860> what

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
areas of cerebral cortex so that's what

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.019 
areas of cerebral cortex so that's what
we<00:05:33.070> have<00:05:33.690> division<00:05:34.690> first<00:05:35.380> into<00:05:35.740> lobes<00:05:36.029> lobes

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
we have division first into lobes lobes

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.649 
we have division first into lobes lobes
and<00:05:37.680> division<00:05:38.680> into<00:05:38.919> Jerry<00:05:39.250> and<00:05:39.639> then<00:05:40.270> within
