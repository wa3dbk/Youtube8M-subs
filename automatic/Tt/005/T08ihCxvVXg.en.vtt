00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.429
 [Music] 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.400
 what happens when you buy 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.400
 important the first year super 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.110
 from that first year I already have a 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.260
 problem to know and it is which then that the 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.970
 matter is not going to practically have to have 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.460
 the laptop connected to the current 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.810
 exactly with the use of batteries 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.119
 some way depending on the type of 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.980
 batteries can suffer wear and 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.350
 suffer a thing called memory of 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.629
 load yes we usually walk 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.460
 loading and unloading the laptop that 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.470
 be at home he plugged it in even if he's 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.180
 half the battery will cost 75 percent 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.250
 so as not to have to be lifting 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.379
 woman loads action and family facts with 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.120
 the battery set aside that can be 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.350
 want to generate electricity 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.110
 Electrostatic of a different equipment 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.580
 the plate when they are going to plug the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.920
 portable or the current is to use it 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.690
 If the battery is charged, take out the one 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.070
 nothing happens you can take out with the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.260
 current because it spoils the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.170
 battery and you can work even the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.580
 own computer good use of the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.650
 battery at the end some batteries 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.730
 some types of battery as per 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.970
 example 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.500
 and that they have charge memory it 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.900
 they agree that when they arrive at 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.330
 60% all load and a 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.430
 moment they do not fall well is the 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.450
 process that is one of the curves if a 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.950
 of the things that happens the one that fears 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.390
 it can happen then that the own 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.070
 wear also losing that strength 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.840
 well, there is a way to power 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.420
 recover them is not even one hundred percent 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.380
 probability in some probability of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.350
 be able to recover that battery 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.869
 and you know what it is to freeze 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.939
 the only time that when you do not buy and 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.820
 becomes the hypermarket of Laos as the 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.680
 drums 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.409
 of those that work best in this case 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.880
 are those of di that if those of lithium do not 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.229
 they work also is let 's say the process 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.340
 that we are going to explain but of some 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.509
 way they will always recover something 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.610
 so before spending money 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.380
 buy a battery I would recommend 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.579
 that you then somehow 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.179
 they will try to do what we are going to do 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.989
 propose before that explain to them that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.870
 it also depends what lasts a 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.090
 battery the amount of charge that 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.620
 accumulate remember that this is a 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.819
 battery this rechargeable this what it does 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.590
 is to catch the plug current 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.900
 save it here and load it later 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.269
 little by little in my camera 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.160
 digital for example it is worth that the 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.019
 the laptops is bigger good well 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.540
 there is a label on all batteries 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.150
 that put the three milliamps 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.130
 milliamp the amount of charge that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.440
 can hold a battery the more 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.360
 high the number the longer it will last 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.430
 the recommendation when you go to buy 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.630
 the battery for example the one that I have in 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.050
 the hand I have at hand a 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.870
 drums 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.430
 and average normally for cameras 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.940
 digital and blesses 1500 so great 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.100
 those are indicate 1500 milliamperes is 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.410
 say is a battery that puts them so 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.070
 great because the normal are between 700 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.260
 900 1200 costs to put thousand 500 because it is 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.010
 big that has been the biggest burden 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.720
 if it were 700 they could not be tiny 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.190
 then eyes check that too if 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.440
 they last little will make them very 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.470
 few videos but in any case if 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.750
 your batteries are already aged no longer 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.910
 work well do the following 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.490
 they have to catch the battery wrap it 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.750
 in a plastic bag what explains 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.710
 Of course I'll explain it again with 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.870
 that happened in a plastic bag 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.690
 put it in the freezer leave them two or 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.370
 three days later two or three days take out 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.470
 it is good to let it set at a temperature 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.180
 environment if it's worth being the morning 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.680
 in clear here I expected more than 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.570
 thaw for two or three hours and 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.880
 look to see if you have bathroom and other 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.050
 once good is important this what 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.940
 said the battery has to have a 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.940
 little load now I will explain moss and 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.040
 once the battery is dry it 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.260
 place in the team you have to make a 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.550
 full load is fully loaded and it 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.300
 back to download with the team 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:02.240
 understood is whole of something 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.330
 well let's explain it 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.330
 ah 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.880
 ah 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:33.990
 [Music] 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:05:08.350
 and well then to see is not always going to 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.340
 work this in many cases yes like this 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.340
 that if you are recovered
