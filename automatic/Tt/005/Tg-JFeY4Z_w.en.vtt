00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.460
 before in sitges hello hello how about you guys 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.730
 he told them he grew oliver hd and then here 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.800
 in this new video I come to explain 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.430
 how to remove junk files from your pc 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.470
 yes, well, let's start, they're going to start 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.599
 yes 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.009
 and they go to the team but here they will give 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.980
 right click and they will give you in 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.029
 properties then they go to protection 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.009
 of the system 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.050
 this is for the people who are 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.399
 fill the hard drive alone and that you 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.660
 they do not discharge anything and the 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.879
 hard drive and they give you configure here you 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.890
 are going to appear a lot of gigas those 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.070
 they are pure windows updates and 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.500
 Well, those updates are recycled 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.690
 there yes then that's why it causes 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.610
 the hard drive fills up just this what 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.909
 only thing they are going to do is eliminate and 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.350
 lift in continue to close and accept and 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:02.140
 to accept 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.979
 we can close this now they are going 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.740
 they are already going to the keyboard 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.680
 the key that remains next to control and 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.140
 to the one that has like him like the drawing 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.119
 to windows and they're going to press and go and 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.310
 they will give you r going to run out 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.590
 or seek to execute the start as you 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.020
 seem easier yes 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.659
 here they are going to write you look at it as in 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.020
 I already have it there, and here it goes 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.329
 appear a lot of junk files 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.179
 that those are from programs or things that 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.000
 you eliminate and then those programs 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.500
 come and recycle here if I do not 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.140
 seems anything because I already just 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.490
 eliminate right now but that's why 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.350
 what I'm explaining is going to 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.840
 appear a lot of files but 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.479
 trash that's going to eliminate it there are some 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.490
 that can not be eliminated because they are 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.049
 are from the one of the antivirus and 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.000
 look how this is the only thing that you 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.110
 they are going to do is give him to omit and already 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.110
 we are going again 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.060
 to execute 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.430
 and here we are going to put in but with the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.670
 signs of 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.240
 with the signs of percent yes and they give you 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.400
 to accept 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.260
 it's going to work out like this look here me 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.880
 I think I already have one because this is the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.220
 from here you can not eliminate this if 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.180
 this one nothing because this one I think in front 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.340
 of the antivirus and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.489
 then we will eliminate it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.990
 and this side they twisted me this is not 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.020
 can because this as an antivirus 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.060
 now we are going to start 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.140
 team 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.810
 local disk windows and we go to the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.280
 folder that is called prefect is this 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.430
 You can also look for him there but I 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.450
 I did not know how it was written and well 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.280
 prefect and here will also leave 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.750
 a lot of crap that's going to 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.200
 eliminate because that is useless 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.420
 that is pure space occupied in our 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.760
 local disk yes and well that's garbage 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.580
 trash they're going to eliminate city I do not have 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.550
 nothing because I already eliminate it 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.790
