that you might be interested in

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.630 
that you might be interested in
first<00:00:15.530> is<00:00:15.769> mechanical<00:00:16.430> and<00:00:16.550> chemical

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
first is mechanical and chemical

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.220 
first is mechanical and chemical
adhesion<00:00:17.060> and<00:00:17.390> then<00:00:17.840> we're<00:00:17.930> gonna<00:00:18.050> take<00:00:18.170> a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
adhesion and then we're gonna take a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.150

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
space vehicles so they get the coatings

to<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.290> coating<00:04:26.680> it's<00:04:27.010> much<00:04:27.250> sharper<00:04:27.550> only<00:04:27.910> on

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
to the coating it's much sharper only on

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.050 
to the coating it's much sharper only on
the<00:04:28.510> glaze<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.680> epoxy<00:04:30.190> polyester

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
the glaze so the epoxy polyester

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.940 
the glaze so the epoxy polyester
probably<00:04:31.690> excuse<00:04:31.900> me<00:04:32.020> polyurethane<00:04:32.560> coatings

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
probably excuse me polyurethane coatings

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.220 
probably excuse me polyurethane coatings
just<00:04:33.700> don't<00:04:33.910> quite<00:04:34.180> have<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.390> same<00:04:34.510> effect<00:04:35.080> as

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
just don't quite have the same effect as

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.860 
just don't quite have the same effect as
the<00:04:35.260> polyester<00:04:35.710> nose

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.730 

all<00:04:39.870> right<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.139> that's<00:04:40.259> the<00:04:40.380> big<00:04:40.590> difference

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
all right so that's the big difference

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.040 
all right so that's the big difference
in<00:04:41.069> the<00:04:41.190> quality<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:41.789> coatings<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.930> get

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
in the quality of the coatings you get

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.140 
in the quality of the coatings you get
at<00:04:43.139> just<00:04:43.289> a<00:04:43.380> much<00:04:43.560> much<00:04:44.100> nicer<00:04:44.160> look<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:44.940> we

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
at just a much much nicer look and we

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.760 
at just a much much nicer look and we
get<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.300> much<00:04:45.479> improved<00:04:45.630> adhesion<00:04:46.350> so

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
get a much improved adhesion so

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.559 
get a much improved adhesion so
aesthetically<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.550> performance<00:04:48.000> wise<00:04:48.180> it's

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
aesthetically and performance wise it's

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.760 
aesthetically and performance wise it's
just<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.930> superior<00:04:49.410> product<00:04:51.410> now<00:04:52.410> take<00:04:52.680> another

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
just a superior product now take another

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.890 
just a superior product now take another
look<00:04:53.069> at<00:04:53.220> why<00:04:53.340> I<00:04:53.370> don't<00:04:53.699> like<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.090> epoxy

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
look at why I don't like the epoxy

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.439 
look at why I don't like the epoxy
polyurethanes<00:04:55.740> here<00:04:56.039> we<00:04:56.160> have<00:04:56.310> our<00:04:56.520> polyester

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
polyurethanes here we have our polyester

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.200 
polyurethanes here we have our polyester
product<00:04:58.009> and<00:04:59.009> I'm<00:04:59.370> going<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.520> add<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.880> primer

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
product and I'm going to add the primer

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.279 
product and I'm going to add the primer
that's<00:05:01.110> been<00:05:01.259> activated<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.729> topcoat<00:05:03.289> to

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
that's been activated to the topcoat to

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.379 
that's been activated to the topcoat to
show<00:05:04.470> its<00:05:04.680> compatibility<00:05:07.789> this<00:05:08.789> is<00:05:09.000> an<00:05:09.120> epoxy

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
show its compatibility this is an epoxy

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.050 
show its compatibility this is an epoxy
primer<00:05:09.919> activated<00:05:10.919> with<00:05:11.699> the<00:05:11.789> polyurethane

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
primer activated with the polyurethane

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.730 
primer activated with the polyurethane
topcoat<00:05:13.070> activated<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:18.840> what<00:05:19.169> happens<00:05:19.530> is

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
topcoat activated and what happens is

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.490 
topcoat activated and what happens is
they're<00:05:20.160> not<00:05:20.340> compatible<00:05:20.699> with<00:05:21.169> each<00:05:22.169> other

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
they're not compatible with each other

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.409 
they're not compatible with each other
and<00:05:22.979> it's<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:23.580> reason<00:05:23.610> why<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:23.940> don't<00:05:24.120> like<00:05:24.270> to

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
and it's one reason why I don't like to

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.650 
and it's one reason why I don't like to
use<00:05:24.630> them<00:05:25.070> for<00:05:26.070> our<00:05:26.130> coatings<00:05:26.639> as<00:05:26.880> the

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
use them for our coatings as the

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.409 
use them for our coatings as the
chemistry<00:05:28.909> turns<00:05:29.909> into<00:05:30.090> jello<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.090> just

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
chemistry turns into jello and I just

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:34.850 
chemistry turns into jello and I just
feel<00:05:33.539> like<00:05:33.690> it's<00:05:33.870> much<00:05:34.050> better<00:05:34.259> solution<00:05:34.830> to

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
feel like it's much better solution to

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.770 
feel like it's much better solution to
stay<00:05:35.159> within<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.690> same<00:05:36.870> family<00:05:36.930> of<00:05:37.440> coatings

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
stay within the same family of coatings

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.040 
stay within the same family of coatings
as<00:05:39.780> you<00:05:39.960> can<00:05:40.080> see<00:05:40.199> this<00:05:40.319> is<00:05:40.500> still<00:05:41.210> in<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.780> liquid

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
as you can see this is still in a liquid

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.850 
as you can see this is still in a liquid
state<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:44.970> we<00:05:45.659> achieve<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:45.990> by<00:05:46.409> using<00:05:46.770> the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
state and we achieve that by using the

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.580 
state and we achieve that by using the
same<00:05:47.070> catalyst<00:05:47.699> in<00:05:47.940> all<00:05:48.539> the<00:05:48.810> products<00:05:49.229> this

exactly what it is they're getting okay

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.189 
exactly what it is they're getting okay
I<00:06:29.699> think<00:06:29.849> we've<00:06:30.120> about<00:06:30.210> got<00:06:30.360> it<00:06:30.599> we've<00:06:30.960> covered

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
I think we've about got it we've covered

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:33.350 
I think we've about got it we've covered
the<00:06:31.830> performance<00:06:32.310> issues<00:06:32.639> we've<00:06:32.849> covered
