tip<00:01:08.640> boom<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.369> probably<00:01:11.549> see

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
tip boom but like you can probably see

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
tip boom but like you can probably see
it's<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.720> any<00:01:12.960> more<00:01:13.140> suitable<00:01:13.530> no<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> can't

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it's like any more suitable no I can't

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.210 
it's like any more suitable no I can't
okay<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.369> yeah<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:16.409> boy<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:17.040> could

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
okay but yeah I think boy we could

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.499 
okay but yeah I think boy we could
easily<00:01:17.400> probably<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:17.909> freeze<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
easily probably would freeze up of

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.660 
easily probably would freeze up of
course<00:01:18.810> riza<00:01:19.140> her<00:01:19.470> tummy<00:01:19.740> Broly<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> baby

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
course riza her tummy Broly was a baby

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.120 
course riza her tummy Broly was a baby
so<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.750> time<00:01:21.810> he<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.439> wouldn't<00:01:22.920> do

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
so at that time he really wouldn't do

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
so at that time he really wouldn't do
anything<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> time<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.119> technically<00:01:24.600> he

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
anything at that time so technically he

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.080 
anything at that time so technically he
probably<00:01:24.960> could<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.500> even<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> baby<00:01:26.310> boy

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
probably could be even as a baby boy

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.030 
probably could be even as a baby boy
didn't<00:01:27.960> understand<00:01:28.380> nothing<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.950> was

one<00:03:33.640> time<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:34.730> think<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.180> knew<00:03:35.299> for<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.569> fact<00:03:35.599> to

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
one time I think I knew for a fact to

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.789 
one time I think I knew for a fact to
you<00:03:36.109> you<00:03:36.560> wouldn't<00:03:36.799> have<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.010> try<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:38.799> think

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
you you wouldn't have to try I think

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.050 
you you wouldn't have to try I think
broadly<00:03:40.099> and<00:03:40.219> his<00:03:40.340> base<00:03:40.579> won't<00:03:40.879> could

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
broadly and his base won't could

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.080 
broadly and his base won't could
probably<00:03:41.269> be<00:03:41.480> freezer<00:03:42.249> if<00:03:43.249> I'm<00:03:43.400> being<00:03:43.639> like

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
probably be freezer if I'm being like

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.050 
probably be freezer if I'm being like
realistic<00:03:44.959> here<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.409> mean<00:03:46.370> cuz<00:03:46.549> he<00:03:46.670> keeps
