that weren't so
there<00:01:32.470> were<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:32.950> important<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:34.600> year<00:01:34.840> I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
can I can say I really exploded

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.720 
can I can say I really exploded

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
especially in the last part of the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.880 
especially in the last part of the
