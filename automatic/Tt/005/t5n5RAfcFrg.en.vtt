00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
a print so it does consider lots about

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.020 
a print so it does consider lots about
this<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> environments<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.370> carbo

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
this and the environments and the carbo

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.870 
this and the environments and the carbo
print

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
print

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.750 
print
so<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.150> gives<00:02:13.330> good<00:02:13.480> information<00:02:14.110> on<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.410> top

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so it gives good information on the top

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.550 
so it gives good information on the top
so<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.880> does<00:02:16.060> say<00:02:16.270> here<00:02:16.540> outstanding<00:02:17.320> odor

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
so it does say here outstanding odor

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.890 
so it does say here outstanding odor
control<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.150> would<00:02:19.270> actually<00:02:19.420> have<00:02:19.630> to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
control and I would actually have to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.140 
control and I would actually have to
agree<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.770> odor<00:02:20.950> control<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.610> actually<00:02:21.970> very

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
agree the odor control is actually very

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.540 
agree the odor control is actually very
good<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.840> can't<00:02:23.140> smell<00:02:23.500> very<00:02:23.860> much<00:02:24.160> within<00:02:24.490> a

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
good you can't smell very much within a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.640 
good you can't smell very much within a
few<00:02:24.760> days<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.660> that's<00:02:25.840> something<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.410> want

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
few days and that's something you want

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.830 
few days and that's something you want
to<00:02:26.830> really<00:02:27.040> for<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.550> litter<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.150> most<00:02:28.510> people

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
to really for a litter and most people

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.780 
to really for a litter and most people
look<00:02:29.020> for<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:29.980> would<00:02:30.250> save<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.640> odor

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
look for so I would save the odor

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.790 
look for so I would save the odor
control<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.720> actually<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> really<00:02:32.440> good

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
control it is actually a really good

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.590 
control it is actually a really good
with<00:02:33.640> odor<00:02:33.910> control<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.910> does<00:02:37.090> say<00:02:37.330> on<00:02:37.360> the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
with odor control it does say on the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.930 
with odor control it does say on the
side<00:02:37.870> what<00:02:38.230> animals<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.070> is<00:02:39.130> suitable<00:02:39.430> for

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
side what animals this is suitable for

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.960 
side what animals this is suitable for
so<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.930> says<00:02:41.140> rodents<00:02:41.770> mammals<00:02:42.370> birds<00:02:42.670> and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
so it says rodents mammals birds and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.770 
so it says rodents mammals birds and
reptiles<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:46.090> now<00:02:46.210> I'm<00:02:46.270> going<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.450> go<00:02:46.540> through

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
reptiles so now I'm going to go through

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.600 
reptiles so now I'm going to go through
this<00:02:46.930> list<00:02:47.170> at<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> bottom<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.220> tell<00:02:48.460> you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
this list at the bottom and tell you

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.670 
this list at the bottom and tell you
whether<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.880> does<00:02:49.060> this<00:02:49.330> or<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.170> doesn't

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
whether it does this or it doesn't

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.460 
whether it does this or it doesn't
chemical<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.550> additive-free<00:02:52.020> does<00:02:53.020> state<00:02:53.290> up

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
chemical and additive-free does state up

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.950 
chemical and additive-free does state up
here<00:02:53.740> on<00:02:53.890> top<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.460> is<00:02:54.880> chemical<00:02:55.390> free<00:02:55.420> process

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
here on top it is chemical free process

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.100 
here on top it is chemical free process
and<00:02:56.560> there<00:02:57.040> are<00:02:57.130> no<00:02:57.220> other<00:02:57.430> tips<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.690> by<00:02:58.930> its

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
and there are no other tips so by its

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.890 
and there are no other tips so by its
meaning<00:02:59.680> chemical<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.640> additive<00:03:01.060> free<00:03:01.300> this

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
meaning chemical and additive free this

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.590 
meaning chemical and additive free this
is<00:03:01.960> actually<00:03:02.470> true<00:03:02.740> and<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.730> chemical<00:03:04.420> and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
is actually true and it is chemical and

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.710 
is actually true and it is chemical and
additive<00:03:05.020> free<00:03:05.380> unique<00:03:06.220> formulation<00:03:06.940> yes<00:03:07.540> I

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
additive free unique formulation yes I

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.420 
additive free unique formulation yes I
definitely<00:03:08.290> agree<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.680> unique<00:03:09.010> formulation

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
definitely agree to unique formulation

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.560 
definitely agree to unique formulation
because<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.970> has<00:03:10.090> been<00:03:10.330> put<00:03:10.540> through

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
because it has been put through

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.550 
because it has been put through
overnight<00:03:11.110> process<00:03:12.750> perfectly<00:03:13.750> safe<00:03:13.990> process

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
overnight process perfectly safe process

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.160 
overnight process perfectly safe process
and<00:03:15.280> it's<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.490> very<00:03:15.520> unique<00:03:16.000> formulation<00:03:16.810> a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
and it's a very unique formulation a

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.610 
and it's a very unique formulation a
from<00:03:17.500> recycled<00:03:17.890> paper<00:03:18.400> yes<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.270> is<00:03:19.620> recycled

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
from recycled paper yes this is recycled

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.310 
from recycled paper yes this is recycled
paper<00:03:21.190> pellets<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:22.330> does<00:03:22.570> state<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:22.900> on<00:03:23.230> the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
paper pellets it does state that on the

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.320 
paper pellets it does state that on the
packet<00:03:23.740> and<00:03:24.010> even<00:03:24.550> gives<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.850> good<00:03:24.970> image

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
packet and even gives you a good image

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.120 
packet and even gives you a good image
of<00:03:25.510> what<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.780> looks<00:03:26.020> like<00:03:26.320> so<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.010> can

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
of what it looks like so you can

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.980 
of what it looks like so you can
actually<00:03:27.250> see<00:03:27.790> for<00:03:27.970> yourself<00:03:28.360> before<00:03:28.750> buying

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
actually see for yourself before buying

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.860 
actually see for yourself before buying
the<00:03:29.170> product<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:30.640> they<00:03:30.910> are<00:03:31.120> great<00:03:31.540> for

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
the product that they are great for

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.690 
the product that they are great for
planets<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.590> they<00:03:32.830> are<00:03:32.950> recycled<00:03:33.310> paper

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
planets and they are recycled paper

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.390 
planets and they are recycled paper
they're<00:03:34.300> actually<00:03:34.630> dust<00:03:34.930> free<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:36.100> bedding

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
they're actually dust free this bedding

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.350 
they're actually dust free this bedding
a<00:03:36.550> litter<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:37.060> great<00:03:37.510> for<00:03:38.020> a<00:03:38.050> dust<00:03:38.380> free<00:03:38.770> type

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
a litter is great for a dust free type

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.540 
a litter is great for a dust free type
the<00:03:40.360> bedding<00:03:40.900> itself<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.620> litter<00:03:41.770> itself<00:03:42.310> is

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
the bedding itself the litter itself is

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.730 
the bedding itself the litter itself is
very<00:03:42.790> dust<00:03:43.060> free<00:03:43.390> when<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:43.840> open<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> bag<00:03:44.380> up<00:03:44.620> I

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
very dust free when I open the bag up I

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.100 
very dust free when I open the bag up I
don't<00:03:44.860> find<00:03:45.250> any<00:03:45.490> clouds<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:45.940> dust<00:03:46.120> coming<00:03:46.840> in

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
don't find any clouds of dust coming in

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.170 
don't find any clouds of dust coming in
my<00:03:47.200> face<00:03:47.500> like<00:03:47.530> some<00:03:48.130> other<00:03:48.280> product<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.880> use

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
my face like some other product to use

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.290 
my face like some other product to use
so<00:03:49.960> virtually<00:03:50.740> dust<00:03:50.980> free<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.640> would<00:03:51.880> say<00:03:52.240> is

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
so virtually dust free I would say is

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.020 
so virtually dust free I would say is
correct<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:52.960> I<00:03:53.020> would<00:03:53.140> agree<00:03:53.380> with<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:54.760> very

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
correct and I would agree with it's very

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.520 
correct and I would agree with it's very
good<00:03:55.180> for<00:03:55.240> rats<00:03:55.510> obviously<00:03:56.020> because<00:03:56.350> they<00:03:56.470> do

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
good for rats obviously because they do

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.950 
good for rats obviously because they do
have<00:03:56.920> sensitive<00:03:57.400> respiratory<00:03:58.270> systems<00:03:58.690> and

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
have sensitive respiratory systems and

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.530 
have sensitive respiratory systems and
this<00:03:59.170> definitely<00:03:59.800> going<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.190> use<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:01.180> is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
this definitely going to use that it is

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.170 
this definitely going to use that it is
virtually<00:04:01.960> dust<00:04:02.200> free<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.520> is<00:04:03.730> therefore

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
virtually dust free and it is therefore

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.880 
virtually dust free and it is therefore
I<00:04:04.480> would<00:04:04.690> highly<00:04:04.960> recommend<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.590> product

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
I would highly recommend this product

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.830 
I would highly recommend this product
for<00:04:06.640> rats<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:08.100> highly<00:04:09.100> absorbent<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.940> would

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
for rats and highly absorbent I would

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.630 
for rats and highly absorbent I would
say<00:04:11.020> it's<00:04:11.170> very<00:04:11.230> highly<00:04:11.620> absorbent<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.400> does

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
say it's very highly absorbent it does

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.850 
say it's very highly absorbent it does
absorb<00:04:12.880> very<00:04:13.330> well<00:04:13.660> I<00:04:13.930> don't<00:04:14.410> usually<00:04:14.470> have

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
absorb very well I don't usually have

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.010 
absorb very well I don't usually have
any<00:04:15.070> problems<00:04:15.490> with<00:04:15.640> finding<00:04:15.910> we<00:04:16.299> at<00:04:16.930> the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
any problems with finding we at the

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.900 
any problems with finding we at the
bottom<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.770> litter<00:04:18.040> tray<00:04:18.400> because<00:04:18.760> they

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
bottom of the litter tray because they

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.420 
bottom of the litter tray because they
use<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.299> very<00:04:19.450> well<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.380> pellets<00:04:20.830> soak<00:04:21.190> up

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
use it very well the pellets soak up

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.790 
use it very well the pellets soak up
through<00:04:21.870> ensuring<00:04:22.870> it's<00:04:23.140> all<00:04:23.440> in<00:04:23.590> with<00:04:23.710> the

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
through ensuring it's all in with the

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.129 
through ensuring it's all in with the
pellets<00:04:24.130> so<00:04:24.490> there's<00:04:24.940> no<00:04:25.120> problem<00:04:25.570> with

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
pellets so there's no problem with

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.260 
pellets so there's no problem with
the<00:04:26.199> absorbency<00:04:26.889> I<00:04:26.919> definitely<00:04:27.639> think<00:04:27.819> it's

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
the absorbency I definitely think it's

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.179 
the absorbency I definitely think it's
brilliant<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:29.199> here's<00:04:29.379> just<00:04:29.469> a<00:04:29.800> good<00:04:30.099> example

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:30.189 
brilliant so here's just a good example

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.999 
brilliant so here's just a good example
of<00:04:30.849> what<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.270> pellets<00:04:31.629> look<00:04:31.840> like<00:04:32.110> they<00:04:32.860> are

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
of what the pellets look like they are

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.580 
of what the pellets look like they are
just<00:04:33.039> long<00:04:33.729> ish<00:04:33.999> small<00:04:34.479> pellets<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.259> they're

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
just long ish small pellets and they're

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.550 
just long ish small pellets and they're
gray<00:04:35.889> colored<00:04:36.729> so<00:04:37.389> they<00:04:37.539> are<00:04:37.689> recycled<00:04:38.080> paper

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
gray colored so they are recycled paper

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.589 
gray colored so they are recycled paper
pallets<00:04:38.949> and<00:04:39.430> that's<00:04:40.120> what<00:04:40.300> they<00:04:40.389> look<00:04:40.569> like

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
pallets and that's what they look like

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.170 
pallets and that's what they look like
they're<00:04:41.139> quite<00:04:41.349> a<00:04:41.379> small<00:04:41.710> size<00:04:41.979> but<00:04:42.819> they<00:04:42.969> do

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
they're quite a small size but they do

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.050 
they're quite a small size but they do
the<00:04:43.300> job<00:04:43.330> well<00:04:43.779> so<00:04:44.050> as<00:04:44.830> for<00:04:45.219> cons<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.849> actually

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
the job well so as for cons I actually

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.719 
the job well so as for cons I actually
really<00:04:46.539> only<00:04:46.659> have<00:04:46.900> one<00:04:46.930> con<00:04:47.650> about<00:04:48.430> this

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
really only have one con about this

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.550 
really only have one con about this
bedding<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.389> litter<00:04:49.569> product<00:04:49.990> I<00:04:50.229> honestly

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
bedding and litter product I honestly

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.230 
bedding and litter product I honestly
don't<00:04:50.710> have<00:04:50.830> any<00:04:51.129> of<00:04:51.249> the<00:04:51.340> cons<00:04:51.580> I<00:04:51.789> can't<00:04:51.999> think

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
don't have any of the cons I can't think

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.330 
don't have any of the cons I can't think
of<00:04:52.360> any<00:04:52.509> others<00:04:52.840> or<00:04:53.529> any<00:04:53.710> other<00:04:53.860> problems<00:04:54.189> I'm

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
of any others or any other problems I'm

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.339 
of any others or any other problems I'm
having<00:04:54.370> with<00:04:54.729> this<00:04:54.879> and<00:04:55.449> there's<00:04:56.139> only<00:04:56.229> one

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
having with this and there's only one

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.379 
having with this and there's only one
thing<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.860> would<00:04:57.009> say<00:04:57.279> that<00:04:57.520> they<00:04:58.029> could<00:04:58.060> do

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
thing I would say that they could do

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.469 
thing I would say that they could do
with<00:04:58.509> improving<00:04:58.930> on<00:04:59.169> its<00:04:59.469> the<00:04:59.740> price<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:01.300> do

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
with improving on its the price so I do

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.300 
with improving on its the price so I do
you<00:05:01.599> think<00:05:01.810> they're<00:05:02.139> bedding<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:02.740> litter<00:05:02.949> can

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
you think they're bedding and litter can

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.159 
you think they're bedding and litter can
be<00:05:03.430> a<00:05:03.460> little<00:05:03.610> bit<00:05:03.759> too<00:05:03.969> pricey<00:05:04.539> for<00:05:04.569> what<00:05:04.990> you

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
be a little bit too pricey for what you

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.490 
be a little bit too pricey for what you
get<00:05:05.469> so<00:05:06.460> for<00:05:06.909> the<00:05:07.029> 10<00:05:07.360> liter<00:05:07.629> bag<00:05:07.840> it's<00:05:08.199> six

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
get so for the 10 liter bag it's six

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.339 
get so for the 10 liter bag it's six
pound<00:05:08.800> 50<00:05:09.279> and<00:05:09.669> if<00:05:09.879> you<00:05:10.000> get<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.389> 30<00:05:10.779> liter<00:05:11.080> bag

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
pound 50 and if you get the 30 liter bag

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.459 
pound 50 and if you get the 30 liter bag
it<00:05:11.650> costs<00:05:12.069> 18<00:05:12.639> pounds<00:05:13.240> so<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:13.960> do<00:05:14.050> think<00:05:14.379> the

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.469 
it costs 18 pounds so I do think the

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.159 
it costs 18 pounds so I do think the
prices<00:05:14.979> could<00:05:15.279> do<00:05:15.580> with<00:05:15.930> lowering<00:05:16.930> down

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
prices could do with lowering down

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.170 
prices could do with lowering down
because<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:18.069> think<00:05:18.639> it's<00:05:18.729> a<00:05:18.819> bit<00:05:18.969> too<00:05:19.000> expensive

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
because I think it's a bit too expensive

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.769 
because I think it's a bit too expensive
for<00:05:20.020> bedding<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.860> liquor<00:05:21.039> in<00:05:21.310> my<00:05:21.430> opinion<00:05:21.909> so

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:22.779 
for bedding and liquor in my opinion so

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.570 
for bedding and liquor in my opinion so
that's<00:05:23.199> something<00:05:23.439> they<00:05:23.800> could<00:05:23.979> improve<00:05:24.249> on

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
that's something they could improve on

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.339 
that's something they could improve on
now<00:05:24.969> for<00:05:25.029> my<00:05:25.330> overall<00:05:25.689> review<00:05:27.569> overall<00:05:28.569> I'm<00:05:28.870> up

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
now for my overall review overall I'm up

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.360 
now for my overall review overall I'm up
back-to-nature<00:05:30.060> burning<00:05:31.060> in<00:05:31.180> litter<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.979> 9<00:05:32.979> out

back-to-nature burning in litter a 9 out

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.379 
back-to-nature burning in litter a 9 out
of<00:05:33.400> 10<00:05:34.150> just<00:05:35.189> because<00:05:36.189> it<00:05:36.490> does<00:05:36.759> do<00:05:37.000> exactly

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
of 10 just because it does do exactly

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.540 
of 10 just because it does do exactly
what<00:05:37.539> it<00:05:37.599> says<00:05:37.870> in<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.050> packet<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:39.009> the<00:05:39.250> only

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
what it says in the packet and the only

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.029 
what it says in the packet and the only
con<00:05:39.789> I<00:05:39.819> would<00:05:40.029> say<00:05:40.270> is<00:05:40.539> the<00:05:41.199> price<00:05:41.469> they<00:05:41.830> could

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
con I would say is the price they could

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.040 
con I would say is the price they could
do<00:05:42.310> with<00:05:42.490> lowering<00:05:42.699> the<00:05:42.879> price<00:05:43.149> everything

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
do with lowering the price everything

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.899 
do with lowering the price everything
else<00:05:44.199> is<00:05:44.349> perfectly<00:05:44.770> fine<00:05:45.069> and<00:05:45.639> I<00:05:45.759> would

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909
