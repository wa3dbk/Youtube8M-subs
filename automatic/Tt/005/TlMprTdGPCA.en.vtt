have<00:02:42.040> our<00:02:42.190> scenes<00:02:42.550> which<00:02:42.730> ones<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.030> got

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.540 

maybe<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.990> could<00:02:48.260> convince<00:02:48.470> adam<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.250> come<00:02:49.400> up

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
maybe I could convince adam to come up

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.900 
maybe I could convince adam to come up
with<00:02:49.580> his<00:02:50.380> he<00:02:51.380> hasn't<00:02:51.710> been<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:51.920> was<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.160> truck

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.069 

you<00:03:07.610> know<00:03:07.670> what<00:03:07.879> that's<00:03:08.269> what<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.540> should<00:03:08.569> do<00:03:08.870> I

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
you know what that's what I should do I

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.330 
you know what that's what I should do I
have<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> servo<00:03:10.430> in<00:03:10.579> my<00:03:10.730> pocket<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.980> original

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
have a servo in my pocket I the original

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.860 
have a servo in my pocket I the original
one<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.489> was<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:13.879> my<00:03:14.120> truck<00:03:14.420> like<00:03:14.599> I<00:03:14.719> bought

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
one that was on my truck like I bought

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.349 
one that was on my truck like I bought
my<00:03:15.049> truck<00:03:15.290> used<00:03:15.760> but<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.849> original<00:03:17.209> one<00:03:17.329> that

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
my truck used but the original one that

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.849 
my truck used but the original one that
was<00:03:17.599> on<00:03:17.629> it<00:03:17.930> will<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.290> one<00:03:18.409> it<00:03:18.500> came<00:03:18.530> with

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
was on it will the one it came with

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.429 
was on it will the one it came with
anyway<00:03:19.269> wasn't<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.329> right<00:03:20.480> servo<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.079> spline

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
anyway wasn't the right servo the spline

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.819 
anyway wasn't the right servo the spline
count<00:03:21.739> was<00:03:21.890> all<00:03:22.010> wrong<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.819> was<00:03:23.829> off-roading

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
count was all wrong so I was off-roading

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.250 
count was all wrong so I was off-roading
it<00:03:25.250> there<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.640> spring<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.269> stripped<00:03:26.959> up<00:03:27.079> the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
it there the spring I stripped up the

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.460 
it there the spring I stripped up the
servo<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.659> she<00:03:29.659> hasn't<00:03:29.810> really<00:03:29.989> turned<00:03:30.319> that

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
servo and she hasn't really turned that

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.030 
servo and she hasn't really turned that
well<00:03:30.709> but<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:30.980> picked<00:03:31.220> up<00:03:31.340> another<00:03:31.640> servo<00:03:32.150> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
well but I picked up another servo and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.099 
well but I picked up another servo and
another<00:03:34.040> horde<00:03:34.430> servo<00:03:35.269> horn<00:03:35.540> whatever<00:03:36.019> they

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
another horde servo horn whatever they

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.890 
another horde servo horn whatever they
call<00:03:36.319> them<00:03:36.530> I'm<00:03:37.340> not<00:03:37.519> up<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:37.849> all<00:03:37.969> the<00:03:38.120> RC<00:03:38.510> lingo

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
call them I'm not up on all the RC lingo

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.009 
call them I'm not up on all the RC lingo
but<00:03:39.139> I<00:03:39.379> know<00:03:39.500> what<00:03:39.739> I'm<00:03:39.829> talking<00:03:40.189> about<00:03:40.250> ok

but I know what I'm talking about ok

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.569 
but I know what I'm talking about ok
anyway<00:03:42.019> yeah<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.439> all<00:03:42.560> stripped<00:03:43.099> so<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.340> bought

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
anyway yeah it all stripped so I bought

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.920 
anyway yeah it all stripped so I bought
another<00:03:43.849> one<00:03:43.939> and<00:03:46.450> gonna<00:03:47.450> give<00:03:47.629> that<00:03:47.659> a<00:03:47.810> whirl

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
another one and gonna give that a whirl

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.839 
another one and gonna give that a whirl
see<00:03:48.409> how<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.709> one<00:03:48.859> works<00:03:51.010> like<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> like<00:03:52.489> steer

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
see how that one works like a like steer

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.550 
see how that one works like a like steer
again<00:03:53.120> steering<00:03:53.810> is<00:03:53.900> actually<00:03:54.230> pretty<00:03:54.349> cool

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
again steering is actually pretty cool

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.030 
again steering is actually pretty cool
to<00:03:54.709> do

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.209

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.310 
hammered maybe for the five days out
here<00:04:18.980> man<00:04:21.190> good<00:04:22.190> old<00:04:22.400> days<00:04:22.700> good<00:04:23.450> old<00:04:23.660> days

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
here man good old days good old days

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.500 
here man good old days good old days
but<00:04:26.320> what<00:04:26.500> they<00:04:26.680> did<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.150> McConnell<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.270> crow

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
but what they did is McConnell a crow

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.570 
but what they did is McConnell a crow
there<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:28.990> is<00:04:29.910> so<00:04:30.910> here<00:04:32.190> McConnell<00:04:33.190> Lake<00:04:33.310> Road

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
there it is so here McConnell Lake Road

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.800 
there it is so here McConnell Lake Road
out<00:04:33.880> there

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.830 

that's<00:04:37.440> where<00:04:37.770> we<00:04:37.919> used<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.070> go<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.630> guess

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
that's where we used to go and I guess

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.730 
that's where we used to go and I guess
the<00:04:41.240> province<00:04:42.240> got<00:04:42.450> holds<00:04:42.900> this<00:04:42.990> one<00:04:43.260> big<00:04:43.500> area

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
the province got holds this one big area

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.379 
the province got holds this one big area
or<00:04:44.100> people<00:04:44.400> in<00:04:44.460> camping<00:04:45.060> for<00:04:45.270> years<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:46.280> they

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
or people in camping for years and they

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.500 
or people in camping for years and they
somewhat<00:04:48.389> privatized<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.880> so<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:50.940> gotta<00:04:51.210> pay

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
somewhat privatized it so you gotta pay

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.790 
somewhat privatized it so you gotta pay
the<00:04:51.540> camp<00:04:51.900> they're<00:04:52.139> like<00:04:52.350> I<00:04:52.440> guess<00:04:52.620> it's

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
the camp they're like I guess it's

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.850 
the camp they're like I guess it's
government-owned<00:04:53.639> still<00:04:54.030> but<00:04:54.860> whatever

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
government-owned still but whatever

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.890 
government-owned still but whatever
