00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.310
 hi friends youtubers welcome in 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.710
 this new video tutorial for mac 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.599
 today I will talk about three programs that 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.219
 they are absolutely useful for everyone 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.620
 mac users so i'd say let's go 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.170
 immediately the first taken but that I would like 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.140
 to show is clean my mac mac is a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.150
 very useful program as you see in 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.529
 these months I have already recovered over 9 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.859
 gig of space 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.640
 a program that analyzes each 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.480
 centimeter of your mac 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.850
 from the interface absolutely 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.370
 elementary as you see just click 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.489
 on the scan button he will look for at 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.160
 all those leftovers the ones he gives up and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.200
 of browsers so surfing will be a lot 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.200
 faster as if he had bought the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.160
 computer from day one or all 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.489
 those programs uninstalled badly and 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.960
 this he will eliminate everything recovering 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.940
 lots of space and i really am 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.199
 was surprised by how it can be 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.940
 useful this program as 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.940
 will improve the performance of your mac 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.740
 so absolutely a must to have it 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.060
 also found in the rio place you do n't 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.810
 linko because this program is a 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.960
 payment 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.479
 however in short we say that in the streets 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.740
 sleepers can be held in other ways 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.400
 here I refer you to my first video on 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.229
 my first video where I talk about computers 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.680
 which could be useful in this 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.150
 meaning the second program says that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.460
 I would like to show you and email 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.159
 this is a free program that i will leave 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.170
 the link in the description and is very useful 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.780
 because of your custom backgrounds 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.360
 now I'll show you an example ad 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.189
 example we take a background one 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.649
 good resolution 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.159
 here I have loaded the load 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.380
 composition passing from composition 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.880
 preview we can always see the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.759
 result we are getting now 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.310
 we can drag I recommend you 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:11.140
 for example rendered images 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:14.319
 this by penny kaley cook in the binh 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.480
 Venturi as you can see 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:23.410
 customize our background 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.140
 if I make a render of the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.349
 our eclectus immediately our dog does not go 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.349
 well 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:38.010
 don't wait for tender 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.990
 here you are to find 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.360
 rendered images already rendered 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.760
 you can render you otherwise 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:57.200
 you can search on google for the subject 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:58.280
 you are interested is with the name next to it 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.069
 render on google 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.780
 you will find all the results you want 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.410
 in conclusion 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.400
 and here we can make it bigger 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.910
 smaller according to ours 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.910
 preferences 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.100
 and here we come back to this preview 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.880
 point just drag our own out 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.880
 image 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:31.180
 and here is a background now of course 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.500
 this has not done very well 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.220
 we never begin to give life to how it is 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.200
 can use this program 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.760
 clearly it is more convenient to use as 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.000
 base image is a very large image 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.859
 with a very high resolution on this 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.480
 here is not even the maximum for 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.799
 get backgrounds here as you see 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:59.829
 I did my background for example 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:03.920
 made myself with spartacus characters 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:06.670
 we pass another program the last for 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.620
 this episode I have to talk about alfred 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.299
 alfred and as you see once 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.239
 installed we will find it in others this 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.729
 bar here I open it and it is a program 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.130
 really useful 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.610
 takes up the functionality of sport 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.320
 light that is integrated into our mac but 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.750
 he does it absolutely absolutely 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.190
 complete and much more powerful allows us 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.770
 even to do research 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.870
 directly on the internet 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.300
 all extremely customizable 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.090
 as you can see here by clicking here you can 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.430
 access the options we can set 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.819
 all our preferences 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.960
 this is also a free program vi 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:49.400
 I recommend the veil advice 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.800
 absolutely because the improvement in 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.710
 As the speed and productivity and 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.300
 productivity of your mac it 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.080
 will definitely be affected 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.379
 positive 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.199
 For example, I look for chris 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.810
 I can look for cristiano ronaldo 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.669
 directly on google or wikipedia 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.130
 so from amazon he would obviously not 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.380
 I can buy cristiano ronaldo 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.860
 otherwise you can look for yours 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:22.650
 program you see the speed with which 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:24.840
 this program works is absolute 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.750
 fantastic many times with spotlight gods 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.800
 problems absolutely not 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.389
 customizable does not find all that 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.560
 that we try not to do research 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.180
 Internet 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.830
 in short, I highly recommend it also 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.259
 because I repeat it is free 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.720
 I will leave you the link in description of 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.419
 this program is of miguel in the 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.850
 description of this video here for 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.110
 the other, I refer you to repeat my 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.460
 first video 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.590
 otherwise you can certainly 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.590
 buying it is absolutely worth it 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.300
 climate my boys is fundamental 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.860
 because it recovers so much space e 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.610
 accelerates unbelievable manner 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.740
 performance of your mac 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.840
 ok for this I give you everything 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.520
 thank you remember to register 18 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.110
 the video was useful to leave perhaps 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.580
 I like a comment tell me what 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.580
 think of the pressure
