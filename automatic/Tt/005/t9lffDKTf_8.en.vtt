00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
protection issues you saw some of those

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.560 
protection issues you saw some of those
same<00:01:19.830> sorts<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.460> rap<00:01:20.759> pressures<00:01:21.330> where<00:01:21.479> they

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
same sorts of rap pressures where they

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
same sorts of rap pressures where they
brought<00:01:21.750> two<00:01:21.990> guys<00:01:22.200> through<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.830> same<00:01:23.159> gap

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
brought two guys through the same gap

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.920 
brought two guys through the same gap
and<00:01:23.700> those<00:01:23.820> were<00:01:24.000> getting<00:01:24.240> home<00:01:24.450> again<00:01:24.720> that's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
and those were getting home again that's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
and those were getting home again that's
something<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.650> Seattle<00:01:26.100> probably<00:01:26.460> saw<00:01:26.640> from

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
something but Seattle probably saw from

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.609 
something but Seattle probably saw from
the<00:01:26.850> Tampa<00:01:27.090> Bay<00:01:27.240> tape<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.840> figured<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the Tampa Bay tape and figured that the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.140 
the Tampa Bay tape and figured that the
Vikings<00:01:28.950> protection<00:01:29.520> unit<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:30.090> have

Vikings protection unit would have

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.520 
Vikings protection unit would have
issues<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:31.140> were<00:01:31.200> plenty<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
issues with that there were plenty of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.780 
issues with that there were plenty of
times<00:01:31.740> where<00:01:31.860> Christian<00:01:32.130> Ponder's<00:01:32.430> had<00:01:32.579> so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
times where Christian Ponder's had so

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.819 
times where Christian Ponder's had so
much<00:01:32.909> emphasis<00:01:33.450> placed<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.320> gotta<00:01:34.530> step

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
