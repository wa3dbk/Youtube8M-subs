yeah<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.489> its<00:02:14.580> original<00:02:14.970> design<00:02:15.090> actually

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
yeah so and its original design actually

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.540 
yeah so and its original design actually
had<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> dark<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.650> light<00:02:16.800> sight<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.489> we

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
had a dark and light sight to it so we

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.979 
had a dark and light sight to it so we
had<00:02:17.670> like<00:02:17.820> two<00:02:18.090> sides<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.630> it

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
had like two sides to it

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.810 
had like two sides to it
but<00:02:19.470> they<00:02:19.650> later<00:02:19.830> changed<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.310> design<00:02:20.610> because

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
but they later changed a design because

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.330 
but they later changed a design because
maybe<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.150> looked<00:02:21.300> kind<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.540> creepy<00:02:23.840> yeah

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
maybe it looked kind of creepy yeah

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.150

you're<00:03:15.450> expecting<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:16.620> paradoxical<00:03:17.190> effect

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
you're expecting the paradoxical effect

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.550 
you're expecting the paradoxical effect
works<00:03:17.820> as<00:03:18.000> such<00:03:18.209> instead<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.140> giving<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.530> a

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
works as such instead of giving you a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.350 
works as such instead of giving you a
boost<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.400> chance<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.850> getting<00:03:20.910> critical

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
hit and actually reduces it by 1/4 so

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.550 
hit and actually reduces it by 1/4 so
yeah<00:03:24.720> you're<00:03:24.989> kind<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.230> screwing<00:03:25.440> yourself

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
yeah you're kind of screwing yourself
