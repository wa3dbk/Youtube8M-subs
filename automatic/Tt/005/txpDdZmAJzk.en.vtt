00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.500
 this video is to give you an idea of ​​what 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.269
 easy that is to prepare the burka from scratch 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.690
 if they order our game for sergio 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.030
 because it is zero through the google.com 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.080
 that are going to receive the heat from the strainers 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.840
 so that they go with different measures 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.750
 so they go on the wave they leave 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.750
 reducing their Bulgarians or birds 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.340
 and changed the size of the drain 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.739
 here are also the instructions the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.230
 spatula that will come with that go 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.900
 cleaning their Bulgarians the güineros and 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.830
 its two containers with its two sides 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.600
 then as fast as our 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.570
 Bulgarians what they have to do is 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.060
 open them with scissors and empty the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 in their containers and there are also the 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.130
 instructions in the case they have 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.580
 some doubt here arrive April with 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.800
 The scissors is as fast as I received it 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.740
 from a pie 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.920
 so you can take all the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.140
 and thawed the time in transit 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.740
 who were then and nothing more for 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.740
 show them 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.820
 and these Bulgarians the little birds what 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.650
 to say what they call us they are going to put us in 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.650
 one of the containers that they chase 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.049
 up to about a sacred 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.250
 before Bulgarians who will receive and 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.730
 they reproduce very fast so right now 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.340
 they are going to see 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.780
 one week two weeks but now 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.910
 cold weather they have to leave in a 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.600
 place of limbo quito near stove 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.610
 villa in hot weather, wherever 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.380
 so here they are and they are going to put 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.409
 milk 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.460
 until he covered it only that he used a 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.460
 very good milk that is 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.250
 without any chemical and that also to the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.950
 Vulcans love it and they will cover it 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.840
 well because then the mosquitoes on 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.720
 everything in hot weather like 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.489
 eat it not enter then you can not 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.280
 they have to close hermetically but 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.620
 nothing else like that and they're going to go on a trip 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.120
 some with a week then they can 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.310
 be to hermetically and all the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.959
 refrigerator and that to dario normal gurb 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.590
 then a day later what are they going to 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.530
 have to do something like that in your 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.810
 refrigerator in your 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.510
 result of after this step to this 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.830
 step 24 hours later and what are we going to 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.500
 to do is to stir the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.240
 take off a little bit they already have their 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.100
 strain list 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.590
 Y 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.470
 filter the yogurt that was made as you see 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.780
 I have more because I already were 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.050
 playing after a couple of 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.880
 weeks as I tell you in a place that 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.970
 I have them near a light that they are in 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.910
 the kitchen so that 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.940
 keep the temperate climate the time of 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.700
 cold then here the yogurt is already 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.630
 filtering and with this they are going to prepare their 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.520
 masks its light is a new one says my 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.960
 granny has gotten used to eating with 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.960
 fruits only and honey 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.990
 up with spinach 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.200
 then be sure now the one that remains 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.940
 we are going to put it again in a 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:59.820
 container 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:01.800
 clean let's empty and again you 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.660
 let's put milk to these same 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.330
 bulgarians 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:12.290
 and the next morning they will have 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.290
 again your yogurt 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.410
 very healthy and I hope that what 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.120
 keep them and reproduce so that 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:27.030
