will see that it's got its eight virtual
functions<00:02:04.920> available<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.990> allows<00:02:07.110> us<00:02:07.439> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
functions available so this allows us a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.260

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
lot of flexibility with a very simple

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.270 
lot of flexibility with a very simple

the<00:02:11.940> flexibility<00:02:12.569> comes<00:02:12.930> not<00:02:13.170> judge

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the flexibility comes not judge

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.110 
the flexibility comes not judge
from<00:02:13.770> being<00:02:13.980> able<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.550> dynamically

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
from being able to do this dynamically

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.060 
from being able to do this dynamically
but<00:02:15.810> by<00:02:15.960> being<00:02:16.170> able<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.620> change<00:02:16.860> the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
but by being able to change the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.880 
but by being able to change the
bandwidth<00:02:17.520> for<00:02:17.730> each<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.150> those<00:02:18.890> network

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
bandwidth for each of those network

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.980 
bandwidth for each of those network
functions<00:02:20.520> on<00:02:20.700> there<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.120> you're<00:02:21.240> not<00:02:21.390> limited

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
functions on there so you're not limited

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.870 
functions on there so you're not limited
to<00:02:22.350> multiples<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.950> one<00:02:23.130> gig<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.580> can<00:02:23.790> be

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
to multiples of one gig it can be

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.120 
to multiples of one gig it can be
multiples<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.480> 100<00:02:24.660> megabit<00:02:25.200> per<00:02:25.230> second<00:02:25.710> up

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
multiples of 100 megabit per second up

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.120 
multiples of 100 megabit per second up
to<00:02:26.310> your<00:02:26.430> total<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:27.030> ten<00:02:27.750> gig<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.950> this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
to your total of ten gig and so this

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.040 
to your total of ten gig and so this
gives<00:02:29.310> us<00:02:29.490> great<00:02:29.700> flexibility<00:02:30.390> particularly

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
gives us great flexibility particularly

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.280 
gives us great flexibility particularly
when<00:02:31.230> moving<00:02:31.730> virtual<00:02:32.730> clients<00:02:33.450> around<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:34.140> we

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
when moving virtual clients around if we

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.770 
when moving virtual clients around if we
want<00:02:34.470> more<00:02:34.770> or<00:02:34.980> less<00:02:35.160> network<00:02:36.030> performance<00:02:36.240> on

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
want more or less network performance on

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.250 
want more or less network performance on
a<00:02:36.810> particular<00:02:37.280> channel<00:02:38.280> port<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:40.020> taking

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
a particular channel port so it's taking

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.710 
a particular channel port so it's taking
the<00:02:40.650> basics<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.250> virtualizing<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.240> card<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
the basics of virtualizing the card and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.360 
the basics of virtualizing the card and
expanding<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.380> into<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.740> eight<00:02:43.890> function

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
expanding it into the eight function

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.640 
expanding it into the eight function
that<00:02:44.490> gives<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.180> Flex<00:02:45.510> fabric<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.080> flicks<00:02:46.350> 10

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650

previous<00:03:58.019> versions<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.739> we<00:03:58.890> had<00:03:59.070> and<00:03:59.610> this

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
previous versions that we had and this

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.580 
previous versions that we had and this
is<00:03:59.910> really<00:04:00.090> by<00:04:00.269> redefining<00:04:00.630> what<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.140> PCI<00:04:01.500> bus

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
is really by redefining what the PCI bus

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.430 
is really by redefining what the PCI bus
does<00:04:02.329> now<00:04:03.329> in<00:04:03.450> order<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.750> do<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.170> we<00:04:04.230> need

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
does now in order to do this we need

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.380 
does now in order to do this we need
specific<00:04:05.100> hardware<00:04:05.610> so<00:04:05.880> if<00:04:05.970> we<00:04:06.060> look<00:04:06.090> at<00:04:06.299> the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
specific hardware so if we look at the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.750 
specific hardware so if we look at the
new<00:04:06.510> generations<00:04:07.079> of<00:04:07.200> HP<00:04:07.530> servers<00:04:08.010> they<00:04:08.579> have

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
new generations of HP servers they have

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.970 
new generations of HP servers they have
the<00:04:08.880> ability<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.329> be<00:04:09.600> able<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.810> support<00:04:09.959> SR<00:04:10.470> iov

in conjunction with the Emulex flex
fabric<00:04:13.530> cards<00:04:14.329> so<00:04:15.329> now<00:04:16.079> we<00:04:16.140> have<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.530> ability

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
fabric cards so now we have the ability

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.500

can set that up and the cards that we're
providing<00:04:46.830> today<00:04:47.370> via<00:04:47.610> HP<00:04:48.090> had<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.480> ability

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
providing today via HP had the ability

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
to do that today to be able to do sr iov

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.750 
to do that today to be able to do sr iov
so<00:04:52.020> it's<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.200> very<00:04:52.230> flexible<00:04:52.650> technology<00:04:53.520> and

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
so it's a very flexible technology and

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.430 
so it's a very flexible technology and
an<00:04:53.850> industry<00:04:54.210> standard<00:04:54.270> which<00:04:54.840> means<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.260> now

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
an industry standard which means it now

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.310 
an industry standard which means it now
goes<00:04:55.740> outside<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:57.450> closed<00:04:57.690> environment
