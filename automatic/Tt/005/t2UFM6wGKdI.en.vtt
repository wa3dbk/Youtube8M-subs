thought<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.860> say<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:58.550> do<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> point<00:02:59.030> system<00:02:59.270> so

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
thought I say we do a point system so

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.460 
thought I say we do a point system so
it's<00:03:00.290> not<00:03:00.560> simply<00:03:01.120> who<00:03:02.120> wins<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.660> most<00:03:02.690> gets

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
it's not simply who wins the most gets

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.920 
it's not simply who wins the most gets
the<00:03:03.590> most<00:03:03.709> matches<00:03:03.980> right<00:03:04.370> we<00:03:04.820> assign<00:03:05.209> points

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
the most matches right we assign points

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.510 
the most matches right we assign points
to<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.230> matches<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.860> more<00:03:07.040> important

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
to the matches the more important

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.729 
to the matches the more important
matches<00:03:07.700> get<00:03:08.030> more<00:03:08.209> points<00:03:08.480> therefore<00:03:09.410> I

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
matches get more points therefore I

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.640 
matches get more points therefore I
could<00:03:10.670> get<00:03:10.850> more<00:03:11.030> matches<00:03:11.540> wrong<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.350> still

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
could get more matches wrong and still

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.140 
could get more matches wrong and still
win<00:03:12.950> because<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.370> get<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.550> most<00:03:13.700> important

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
win because I get the most important

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.900 
win because I get the most important
matches<00:03:14.270> right<00:03:15.400> think<00:03:16.400> about<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:16.640> just

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910
