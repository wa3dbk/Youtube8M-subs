00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.119
There's nothing better than the real thing. I will be in Dubai next week for two weeks

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.749

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.799
Basics and also some tips and tricks that will make you go boom

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.349

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.140
Sign up Gonna get taught by myself, and we'll have a go on lots of interesting kit

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.549
You can ask me questions and instead of watching a video and wondering what you're doing

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.799
I'll tell you there and then okay so check out the dubai deejay academy and

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.219
go and get involved right now, so

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.770
How can we learn how to beat match?

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.420
first of all as well

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.090
Without any headphones, okay?

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.099
So no need for headphones

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.839
Right what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn the camera and have a look at piece of kit

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.570
we have in front of us the pioneer DDJ Sx2

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.470
Just Gonna move the screen so I can see what I'm doing

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.010
Qe tuned were using by the way is by a very good friend of mine, Mr.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.919
Kenny Hectic even though I've never met him that sounds a bit bizarre, but

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.909
He lets me use his tracks. So have a listen to this

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.330
Mangy Llama it's the Penny Remix

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.969
Nope, no headphones. We're using the same track

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.159
what we're listening for is we're listening for a sound known as

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.279
Phasing this is when you almost start to get a really high

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.199
Kind of pitch in the track first of all press play if you have any noises in the background. That's my little boy

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.740
so I'm gonna press to

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.949
Make sure the track is cued up

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.259
The phasing sounded to start straightaway the phasing sound appeared

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.710
Sound would appeared as soon

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.270
so this

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.780
will try to listen for it's almost when

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.400
the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.690
The track seems to sort of be very hollow and disappear

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.559
I said of the way of describing is like a hollow sound and what you will find with that hollow sound is you'll get

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.369
The train crash sound where the boots go go don't go don't go don't go don't but slightly get closer together go dig

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.479
until eventually

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.669
They're so close together that

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:11.288
They join because they're joined together or like a mat and then you'll hear almost like a hill as though

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.709
The phasing is going up a hill and down a hill now ideally you want to try and keep it in that

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:25.809
Phasing sound now this is where very slight movements are perfect don't have to move the jog wheel a lot tiny amounts

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.019
But also you've got to remember if you have to keep on moving the jog wheel to keep that phasing sound in

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.869
That means you have to move the pitch accordingly

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.989
to which way you're moving the jog wa so

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.889
so for example if you're having to always move the jog wheel o'clock

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.239
You'll need to move the pitch slightly towards you because moving the jog wheel Clockwise

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:52.118
Indicates that you have to speed that track up if on the other hand you have to move the jog wheel

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:59.979
Anti-clockwise, then of course that indicates you need to slow the track down which means you have to move the pitch away from you to

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:05.049
The - position but tiny amounts hope that's been a help and by the way. I will see you in Dubai

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.319
Don't forget go and check out the dubai dGA academy sign up and you can be taught by moi alright

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:15.549
Practice and enjoy and see you where it's hot in Dubai. Thank you
