00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:59.450 

okay

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.710 

there's<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.520> good<00:01:00.670> idea<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.120> stability<00:01:01.570> their

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
there's a good idea the stability their

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.719 
there's a good idea the stability their
craft<00:01:02.610> when<00:01:03.610> driven<00:01:04.479> carefully<00:01:06.930> okay<00:01:08.729> let's

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
craft when driven carefully okay let's

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.060 
craft when driven carefully okay let's
look<00:01:09.820> at<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.030> sonar<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.710> something<00:01:15.040> that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
look at the sonar this is something that

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.050 
look at the sonar this is something that
is<00:01:15.960> sounds<00:01:16.960> crazy<00:01:17.170> on<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.409> small<00:01:17.650> boat<00:01:18.060> it's

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
is sounds crazy on a small boat it's

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.600 
is sounds crazy on a small boat it's
actually<00:01:19.300> incredibly<00:01:19.810> useful<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:21.369> you<00:01:21.460> want

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
actually incredibly useful when you want

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.200 
actually incredibly useful when you want
to<00:01:21.640> explore<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.150> shallows

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.899 

there<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.840> fish<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.260> lake

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.490 

I'm<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.719> to<00:01:33.780> come<00:01:33.960> into<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> shadow

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
I'm just going to come into the shadow

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.880 
I'm just going to come into the shadow
of<00:01:34.680> section<00:01:35.039> of<00:01:35.130> water<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:42.350> okay<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.380> they

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
of section of water here okay so they

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.039 
of section of water here okay so they
common<00:01:44.789> map<00:01:45.750> 750s<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.740> auto-ranging

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
common map 750s is auto-ranging

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.120 
common map 750s is auto-ranging
text<00:01:49.049> we're<00:01:49.200> getting<00:01:49.439> into<00:01:49.619> shallower<00:01:49.920> water

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
text we're getting into shallower water

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.590 
text we're getting into shallower water
so<00:01:53.130> photo<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.179> water<00:01:54.390> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
so photo just that the water is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.819 
so photo just that the water is
difficult<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:54.990> see<00:01:55.200> because<00:01:55.319> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> color<00:01:55.740> of

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
difficult to see because of the color of

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.919 
difficult to see because of the color of
the<00:01:55.920> water<00:01:56.069> Malaika<00:01:56.569> that's<00:01:57.569> what<00:01:57.720> I've<00:01:57.840> got

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
the water Malaika that's what I've got

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:07.190 
the water Malaika that's what I've got
believe<00:01:58.200> me

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.100 

so<00:02:07.770> turn<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> engine<00:02:08.250> right<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:08.520> into<00:02:08.910> pot<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
so turn the engine right up into pot and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:19.670 
so turn the engine right up into pot and
we'll<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.860> wait<00:02:11.009> till<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.370> touches

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.690 

okay<00:02:20.519> that's<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.209> touched<00:02:22.400> deploy<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.519> kill

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
okay that's just touched deploy the kill

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.869 
okay that's just touched deploy the kill

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
cord the Sonos point yummy Wellington's

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.830

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
stuff you can see how shallow the boat

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.660 
stuff you can see how shallow the boat
comes<00:03:08.690> into<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.960> water

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670
