00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.760
 make the city of the last need for speed 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.680
 most wanted and big enough 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.180
 entertain players for a long time 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.890
 time 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.540
 yet the criterion boys must 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.300
 having thought that it could still be done 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.430
 something like that happened different 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.869
 years ago with barnhart paradise have 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.170
 decided to expand the game map 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.240
 proposing the expansion to pay us 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.050
 we are not very favorable to politics 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.059
 of the dlc 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.400
 when talking about secret characters or 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.230
 extra costumes but when it comes to 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.690
 components that really add up then 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.739
 the game they are developed for is everything 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 another pair of sleeves 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.020
 fortunately this is our case 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.500
 a mega update of about 2 GB 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.050
 is made available to players 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.329
 for free by adding between 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.129
 the other several billboards for jumps e 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.559
 a new modification for all cars 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.420
 already present in the game by offering to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.390
 consequently also a new challenge for 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.070
 automobile this update complements 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.680
 already inside the new section 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.560
 of map but to access it will be 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.690
 necessary to pay 1200 microsoft points 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.670
 or 15 euros on psn made the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.060
 transaction you can finally drive 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.709
 to the ius international airport 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.660
 large part of the scenario that adds a 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.880
 little more madness than the game itself 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.700
 at first glance the map does not 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.619
 it seems so vast but you need to know 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.720
 that the airport offers the possibility of 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.910
 drive anywhere inside from 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.190
 the runways passing 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.009
 for a terminal under construction fi 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.899
 corridors dedicated to run boarding 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.700
 therefore it becomes extremely fun 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.369
 both to better test their own 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.860
 car thanks to huge straights for both 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.869
 have fun jumping like never before 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.060
 the scenery is indeed littered with 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.830
 ramps and billboards that will allow you 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.030
 to reach areas and heights 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.030
 absolutely crazy 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.910
 however, the terminal velocity pac is not alone 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.160
 a great and beautiful map in which 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.590
 have fun but is also composed of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 four new normal cars like ford 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.830
 fiesta st audi rs3 bmw 1m and alfa romeo 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.420
 myth 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.240
 however, one is added to these 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.090
 remarkable supercar or porsche 918 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.610
 spyder to face and win in a 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.050
 most wanted event 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.870
 furthermore there are not even two different ones 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.230
 challenge mode that is break through and take 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.180
 and drift attack the first will ask you to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.100
 break down a minimum fee of 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.010
 signs to reach a score 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.510
 default while the second will require 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.850
 to face a specific path 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.030
 performing drifting along the areas 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.980
 marked with colored ones 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.720
 challenges will not be available only for 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.220
 the five cars the 9 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.840
 but they will also be added to 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.880
 all the cars already in the game 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.640
 thus offering a number of challenges 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.670
 rather high in cuts then writes yes 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.080
 alongside other modifications for the car 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.810
 including skid tires and the 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.780
 new nitro jump which is excellent 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.790
 while coming off a ramp the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.610
 term of the city pack and also sold 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.850
 bundled with two other dlc named 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.770
 movie legend edit for speed heroes 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.430
 these two packages from the course of 800 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.440
 microsoft points of 10 euros each 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.790
 include only five cars without 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.700
 add nothing really 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.590
 significant gaming experience la 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.020
 their strength consists in being able to 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.239
 boast remarkable cars like aston 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.470
 martin db5 rather than the bmw m3 gtr 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.010
 protagonist of the original most wanted 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.750
 dated 2005 purchased individually 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.180
 these packages are not at all 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.220
 profitable while bundled with the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.590
 city â€‹â€‹pack terminals come 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.520
 practically halved and in that case there 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.520
 you can do a little thought 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.640
 the terminal velocity pack is definitely 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.620
 dlc with bows guarantees real 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.870
 expansion not only of the map but also 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.180
 of the game itself by offering a place where 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.160
 have fun and challenge friends but also 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.660
 new challenges changes for cars already 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.730
 present in the original game 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.560
 the price is perhaps not among the most 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.880
 competitive but after having tried it 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.500
 online and offline 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.209
 we can say we are not in any 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.560
 so repent 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.660
 expansion is therefore strongly 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.340
 recommended if you are still there 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.600
 having fun the original one a for tool 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.910
 speed most wanted 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.590
 if you really want to do too much you can 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.290
 also consider the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.400
 bundle with the other two dlc but know 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.410
 that the latter 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.430
 taken individually they do not have much 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.340
 reason to exist 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.560
 the terminal velocity pack is substance 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.990
 while movie legend training for speed 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.990
 heroes are just a decent outline
