00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.270
 secondary channel that is this one that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.750
 dragon ball to the anime secondary channel 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.980
 the truth and I had this for lawsuits and 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.180
 I decided to play it and I say good I'm going to do 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 a video of this one because I think 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.160
 funny and good let's play against 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.300
 buggy because he was the first enemy with 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.100
 the one that a lot of light and if I achieve it 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.160
 wrong and in the boat because no 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.079
 the little boat and good wampis to me 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.320
 it seems unanimous of well sincerely 10 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.300
 of 1710 pussy honestly because it's a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.890
 very good animal my point of view and I 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.060
 I stayed when they grew up or when 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.100
 spent the years that were gone 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.810
 before nothing and I stayed in this game not 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.290
 I am good and they are not specialized 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.290
 with pisco 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.439
 tranquility 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.869
 here is stronger seems a 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.490
 superspecial success he gave me a 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 beating not for example right now I 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.399
 it is a beating to lower spirits without getting 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.399
 a few fruits 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.159
 taken does not raise or attentive 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.130
 and I was still trying to follow fruit guys 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.500
 before continuing to fight to make him a 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.090
 super special attack to the definitive 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.950
 lutfi until the one you choose 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.500
 crocodiles if I'm not wrong but 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.729
 I need to get like a few 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.140
 down that I've fallen a few 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.300
 objects down here has stayed 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.340
 blocked during objects and a fruit 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.490
 like the ones I have now and I think I was born 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.090
 well like this and this is nothing more than the carrying 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.090
 chill chill 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.550
 nothing happens 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:18.760
 unfortunate that sincerely is that what 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.590
 they try practice activity in 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.360
 activity in practice and I liked it 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.190
 honestly it 's special I was even 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.830
 cured and I'm not exaggerating that some 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.450
 naruto specials new from the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.450
 half revolution like this I get 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.370
 true 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:45.470
 and the water is over with you 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.160
 very if I tell you true and calm 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.160
 here what not 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.950
 Attentive this special with light 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.560
 what can be done when I was a 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.870
 beating that has much less life than him 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.730
 then yes by angel this special 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.440
 If you do not have this, you are gaining in life 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.000
 you can not do this special and good 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.770
 Well, here you have to think first 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.290
 it was not going to make winter a beating 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.940
 but he did comment on a beating without 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.310
 that the good truth has come out 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.640
 quite in the second third battle 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.080
 what I try 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.569
 and I had recorded many years ago 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.400
 dani in his time and I do not understand how I 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.810
 I did not play it before the truth I think that 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.670
 because at that time I was not a fan of 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.910
 one pitt but we are fit for my 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.910
 part 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.840
 unfortunate 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.330
 I make myself 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.770
 the most difficult thing about this man 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:17.490
 I like this hatred is stronger 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.720
 I'm leaving 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.630
 if we give it whole 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.630
 stronger 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.690
 I'm going to put 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.690
 head 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.960
 to the limit with this they give me to 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.610
 March I was going to say to have more 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.509
 power and can make him a defensive 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.509
 funny is funny 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:19.200
 I shit take action as one 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:22.540
 and so not another cat and I live 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.820
 equal limit then guys if you want that 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.720
 upload more videos of this game because I 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.330
 there is a funny and funny 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.130
 honestly at least I plan on going 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.310
 to eat that is eating a computer or 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.350
 a quick video so to see these 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.610
 videos 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.560
 and if you want more anime videos in the 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.060
 secondary channel, but the 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.110
 comments and if you want more videos of 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.880
 this one pita in form in the 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.080
 comments that I find very funny 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.100
 it could also unblock the whole world 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.620
 which I want to use is this one 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.030
 this guy gave me this trouble 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.320
 I liked it a lot in this game I remember 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.630
 I anime gives a beating with this 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.950
 miserable character and nothing and do not see 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.290
 next video and I hope you like it 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.450
 this video that a little different than what 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.010
 you are only normally but not from 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.020
 anime of a lifetime but let's see if 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.150
 you like guys in plan it seems 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.889
 quite al al smash bros or also more 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.190
 or less style and anything not die 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.540
 next video and nothing encouraged me even 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.610
 I raise the secondary channel monitor that 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.440
 who knows in a number feels half alive 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.340
 with pee man that seems to me not only 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.340
 improvement or joke
