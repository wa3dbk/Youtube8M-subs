00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
blades which I kind of like it helps

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.490

distinguish<00:00:26.279> them<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:27.510> then<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> decepticon

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
distinguish them and then the decepticon

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.929 
distinguish them and then the decepticon
logo<00:00:28.619> here<00:00:28.830> has<00:00:28.980> some<00:00:29.160> silver<00:00:29.460> paint<00:00:29.490> behind

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
it and as purple as opposed to just the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.630 
it and as purple as opposed to just the
the<00:00:34.110> goldish<00:00:34.500> color<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.670> original

the goldish color one on the original

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.069 
the goldish color one on the original
and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> think<00:00:38.730> think<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.450> red<00:00:39.660> might<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and I think think this red might be a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.119 
and I think think this red might be a
little<00:00:40.230> lighter<00:00:40.440> oh<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:40.980> some

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
little lighter oh and there is some

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.010 
little lighter oh and there is some
shiny<00:00:41.399> metallic<00:00:41.700> paint<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.870> on

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
shiny metallic paint that they are on

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.650 
shiny metallic paint that they are on
the<00:00:43.140> wheel<00:00:43.910> but<00:00:44.910> over<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.239> those<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.629> only

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the wheel but over all those the only

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.440 
the wheel but over all those the only
differences<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.559> black<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.190> he's<00:00:47.610> much<00:00:47.879> more

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
differences on black out he's much more

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.740 
differences on black out he's much more
similar<00:00:49.399> physically<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> aunt<00:00:51.239> color<00:00:51.539> wise

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
similar physically and aunt color wise

bits they're up in the legs and then

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.880 
bits they're up in the legs and then
when<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.810> push<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.830> to

when you push this in it's going to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.190 
when you push this in it's going to
cause<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.549> propellers<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.299> pop<00:01:24.930> down<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.520> don't

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
cause the propellers to pop down I don't

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.300 
cause the propellers to pop down I don't
show<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.470> pop<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.860> waste<00:01:29.130> piece

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
show you when you pop this waste piece

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.569 
show you when you pop this waste piece
in<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:30.600> propeller<00:01:30.960> pops<00:01:31.229> back<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
in the propeller pops back like that and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.969 
in the propeller pops back like that and
then<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.710> fold<00:01:34.710> these<00:01:34.920> down<00:01:36.860> out<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
then you can just fold these down out of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.210 
then you can just fold these down out of
the<00:01:38.040> way<00:01:38.189> however<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.729> prefer<00:01:39.979> well<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.009> wish

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the way however you prefer well I wish

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.319 
the way however you prefer well I wish
these<00:01:41.369> could<00:01:41.700> come<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.210> bit

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
these could come down a little bit

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.080 
these could come down a little bit
further<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.350> how<00:01:44.090> logistical

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
further but I can see how logistical

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.330 
further but I can see how logistical
it's<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.570> possible<00:01:46.939> stand<00:01:47.939> them<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:49.340> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it's just not possible stand them up and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.560 
it's just not possible stand them up and
kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> give<00:01:50.700> them<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.850> Garak<00:01:51.149> would<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
kind of give them a Garak would if you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.530 
kind of give them a Garak would if you
like<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.560> bringing<00:01:52.799> his<00:01:52.950> arms<00:01:53.189> down<00:01:53.540> which

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
like but bringing his arms down which

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.850 
like but bringing his arms down which
we're<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:55.170> ahead<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.500> 20<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
we're going to go ahead and a 20 and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.450 
we're going to go ahead and a 20 and
pull<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> arms<00:01:56.990> down<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
pull the arms down and out like this and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.039 
pull the arms down and out like this and
this<00:01:59.579> lets<00:01:59.820> them<00:02:00.000> get<00:02:00.600> some<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> range<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
this lets them get some a range of

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.990 
this lets them get some a range of
