table I do all the welding in the back

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.020 
table I do all the welding in the back
so<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> can't<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.280> turn

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
so you can't really see it but I turn

the<00:01:21.150> heat<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.330> pretty<00:01:21.450> good<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> lay<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> pretty

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the heat up pretty good and lay a pretty

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.850 
the heat up pretty good and lay a pretty
nice<00:01:22.590> flat<00:01:22.890> bead<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:25.140> can't<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.560> see

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
nice flat bead so you can't really see

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.910 
nice flat bead so you can't really see
and<00:01:26.700> then<00:01:27.119> put<00:01:28.020> these<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> side<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:30.920> just

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and then put these on the side and just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.880 
and then put these on the side and just
you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.750> try<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> orient<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> sits

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you know try to orient it so that sits

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.590 
you know try to orient it so that sits
flat<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> table<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:38.299> like<00:01:39.299> six

flat on the table so it's got like six

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.210 
flat on the table so it's got like six
points<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.110> contact<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:40.920> hard<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.130> make

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
points of contact so it's hard to make

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.069 
points of contact so it's hard to make
them<00:01:41.400> square<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.329> know<00:01:42.840> they're<00:01:42.990> not
