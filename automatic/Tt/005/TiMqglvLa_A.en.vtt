this is supposed to be some sort of note
about<00:02:13.739> wasting

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
about wasting

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.190 
about wasting

not but regardless it is a pretty fun
ability<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:19.980> not<00:02:20.130> very<00:02:20.280> practical<00:02:20.430> for

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
ability but it's not very practical for

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.940 
ability but it's not very practical for
battling<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:22.020> really<00:02:22.349> only<00:02:22.500> good<00:02:22.770> for

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
battling it's really only good for

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.350 
battling it's really only good for
getting<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.220> one<00:02:23.400> crystal<00:02:23.760> shard<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.239> while

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
getting this one crystal shard and while

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.380 
getting this one crystal shard and while
it<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.630> creative<00:02:25.560> idea<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:26.220> again<00:02:27.209> not

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
it is a creative idea it's again not

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.360 
it is a creative idea it's again not
very<00:02:27.420> practical<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.170> battling<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.069> go<00:02:29.220> ahead

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
very practical for battling but go ahead

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.740

mini-boss the same enemy that's been
appearing<00:03:33.690> all<00:03:33.840> throughout<00:03:34.019> this<00:03:34.140> level<00:03:34.410> if<00:03:34.500> I

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
appearing all throughout this level if I

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.199 
appearing all throughout this level if I
just<00:03:34.739> stand<00:03:35.010> here<00:03:35.100> you'll<00:03:35.730> keep<00:03:35.880> getting<00:03:36.120> in

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
just stand here you'll keep getting in

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.970 
just stand here you'll keep getting in
my<00:03:36.239> electrical<00:03:36.840> severe<00:03:37.170> feel<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:37.799> can

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
my electrical severe feel and I can

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.590 
my electrical severe feel and I can
shock<00:03:38.310> him<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.670> electrocute<00:03:39.150> him<00:03:39.239> sorry

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
shock him and electrocute him sorry

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.910 
shock him and electrocute him sorry
there's<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:40.019> difference<00:03:40.290> between<00:03:40.380> shocking

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
there's a difference between shocking

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.680 
there's a difference between shocking
and<00:03:41.040> electrocuting<00:03:41.609> shocking<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:42.420> when<00:03:42.569> you

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
and electrocuting shocking is when you

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.590 
and electrocuting shocking is when you
go<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.989> oh<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.530> shock<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.480> electrocuting<00:03:45.480> is

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
go like oh I shock you electrocuting is

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.940 
go like oh I shock you electrocuting is
when<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.840> actually<00:03:45.959> kill<00:03:46.440> somebody<00:03:46.799> through

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
when you actually kill somebody through

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.490 
when you actually kill somebody through
the<00:03:46.980> uses<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.430> electricity<00:03:48.139> okay<00:03:49.139> so<00:03:49.200> there<00:03:49.440> is

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
the uses of electricity okay so there is

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.990 
the uses of electricity okay so there is
some<00:03:49.739> food<00:03:49.920> in<00:03:50.040> here<00:03:50.220> be<00:03:50.370> sure<00:03:50.609> that<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.850> don't

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
some food in here be sure that you don't

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.640 
some food in here be sure that you don't
hang<00:03:51.150> on<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.389> these<00:03:51.480> ropes<00:03:51.930> for<00:03:52.290> too<00:03:52.410> long

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
hang on to these ropes for too long

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.930 
hang on to these ropes for too long
they're<00:03:52.980> not<00:03:53.069> even<00:03:53.340> ropes<00:03:53.549> they<00:03:53.670> don't<00:03:53.790> really

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
they're not even ropes they don't really

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.370 
they're not even ropes they don't really
know<00:03:54.060> what<00:03:54.239> these<00:03:54.420> are<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:54.720> regardless<00:03:55.109> don't

know what these are but regardless don't
hang<00:03:55.500> on<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.650> them<00:03:55.829> for<00:03:55.980> too<00:03:56.069> long<00:03:56.220> or<00:03:56.430> those

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
hang on to them for too long or those

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.430 
hang on to them for too long or those
enemies<00:03:56.970> will<00:03:57.150> spawn<00:03:57.389> on<00:03:57.540> them<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.900> hurt<00:03:58.139> you
