that big squeeze

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
that big squeeze
they're<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> good<00:00:50.400> verb<00:00:50.610> -<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:51.330> have<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> little

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
they're a good verb - they have a little

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
they're a good verb - they have a little
bit<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> fluid<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.590> lungs<00:00:52.760> they<00:00:53.760> have

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
bit of the fluid in the lungs they have

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.930 
bit of the fluid in the lungs they have
to<00:00:53.970> breathe<00:00:54.150> a<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.420> faster<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.940> oftentimes

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to breathe a little faster so oftentimes

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.910 
to breathe a little faster so oftentimes
that's<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.870> call<00:00:58.050> transient<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.860> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
that's just what we call transient so it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160 
that's just what we call transient so it
doesn't<00:00:59.220> last<00:00:59.370> long<00:00:59.550> just<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.840> did<00:01:00.989> for

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
doesn't last long just like it did for

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.910 
doesn't last long just like it did for
Maxine<00:01:02.420> yes<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.020> it<00:01:04.080> sounds<00:01:04.410> like<00:01:04.530> he's<00:01:04.710> been

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
Maxine yes and it sounds like he's been

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.260 
Maxine yes and it sounds like he's been
doing<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.190> much<00:01:05.339> better<00:01:05.369> job<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
doing a much better job going to the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:18.170 
doing a much better job going to the
breast<00:01:06.450> -<00:01:08.960> how's<00:01:09.960> he<00:01:10.110> keep<00:01:16.520> good<00:01:17.520> good

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
breast - how's he keep good good

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.469 
breast - how's he keep good good
so<00:01:19.310> obviously<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> breast<00:01:20.759> feeding<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.240> new

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
so obviously the breast feeding is new

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.139 
so obviously the breast feeding is new
freedom<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.890> important<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.550> get<00:01:23.670> Maxine

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
freedom so it's important to get Maxine

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.380 
freedom so it's important to get Maxine
to<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.420> breast<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:25.259> every<00:01:25.500> 2<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.770> 3<00:01:26.130> hours<00:01:26.160> so<00:01:27.119> 8

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to the breast at every 2 to 3 hours so 8

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.749 
to the breast at every 2 to 3 hours so 8
to<00:01:27.539> 12<00:01:27.810> feedings<00:01:28.229> each<00:01:28.410> day<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.610> he's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
to 12 feedings each day now that he's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.330 
to 12 feedings each day now that he's
more<00:01:30.000> alert<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> should<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.720> easier<00:01:31.140> today<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
more alert it should be easier today the
