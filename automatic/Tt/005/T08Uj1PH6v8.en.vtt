pretty much instantaneously and use it
just<00:05:22.289> like<00:05:22.530> that<00:05:25.849> so<00:05:26.849> what<00:05:27.000> do<00:05:27.060> I<00:05:27.150> think<00:05:27.180> of

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
just like that so what do I think of

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.200 
just like that so what do I think of
this<00:05:27.660> I<00:05:27.930> really<00:05:28.740> like<00:05:28.949> it<00:05:29.190> in<00:05:29.280> fact<00:05:29.789> this<00:05:30.060> is

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
this I really like it in fact this is

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.610 
this I really like it in fact this is
what<00:05:30.330> I'm<00:05:30.419> gonna<00:05:30.539> use<00:05:30.630> from<00:05:30.990> now<00:05:31.139> on<00:05:31.319> to<00:05:31.470> rip

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
what I'm gonna use from now on to rip

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.029 
what I'm gonna use from now on to rip
all<00:05:31.770> on<00:05:31.919> my<00:05:32.039> vinyl<00:05:32.389> now<00:05:33.389> it<00:05:33.840> rips<00:05:34.110> at<00:05:34.289> 128<00:05:34.860> but<00:05:34.979> I

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
all on my vinyl now it rips at 128 but I

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.860 
all on my vinyl now it rips at 128 but I
think<00:05:35.280> that's<00:05:35.430> probably<00:05:35.880> just<00:05:36.120> fine<00:05:36.539> for

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
think that's probably just fine for

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.719 
think that's probably just fine for
these<00:05:36.990> vinyl<00:05:37.199> rips<00:05:37.500> they<00:05:37.770> sounded<00:05:38.159> great<00:05:38.400> when

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
these vinyl rips they sounded great when

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.390 
these vinyl rips they sounded great when
I<00:05:38.759> played<00:05:39.030> it<00:05:39.150> back<00:05:39.500> now<00:05:40.500> can<00:05:40.830> you<00:05:40.919> mix<00:05:41.069> with<00:05:41.220> it

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.920 
I played it back now can you mix with it
yeah<00:05:41.909> you<00:05:41.970> could<00:05:42.240> mix<00:05:42.389> so<00:05:42.509> that<00:05:42.539> you<00:05:42.690> can<00:05:42.840> buy<00:05:42.900> a

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
yeah you could mix so that you can buy a

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.809 
yeah you could mix so that you can buy a
pair<00:05:43.169> of<00:05:43.199> a<00:05:43.380> mix<00:05:43.650> if<00:05:43.800> you<00:05:43.860> wanted<00:05:44.159> to<00:05:44.340> but

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:44.819 
pair of a mix if you wanted to but

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:46.010 
pair of a mix if you wanted to but
