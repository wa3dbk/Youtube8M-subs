cheri<00:01:00.750> between<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.410> flight<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:03.150> me

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.440 

hi<00:01:06.390> everyone<00:01:06.690> I<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.790> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
hi everyone I think I just want to do a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.950 
hi everyone I think I just want to do a
quick<00:01:09.660> film<00:01:10.020> about<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:11.030> main<00:01:12.030> question<00:01:12.300> every

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
quick film about the main question every

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.340 
quick film about the main question every
single<00:01:13.260> person<00:01:13.620> asks<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> life<00:01:14.370> and<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.350> is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
single person asks in life and that is

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.330 
single person asks in life and that is
what<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.370> meaning<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.790> life<00:01:18.140> why<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.620> we

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
what is the meaning of life why are we

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.800 
what is the meaning of life why are we
alive<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:22.400> I've<00:01:23.400> been<00:01:24.119> thinking<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.630> lot<00:01:24.660> about

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
alive and I've been thinking a lot about

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.520 
alive and I've been thinking a lot about
fractal<00:01:25.500> reality<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:27.300> whole<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:28.140> above

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
fractal reality and the whole as above

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.950 
fractal reality and the whole as above
so<00:01:28.560> below<00:01:29.450> ideas<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.680> infinite

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
so below ideas that the infinite

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.630 
so below ideas that the infinite
complexity<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:35.780> intensifying<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.990> complexity

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
complexity is intensifying in complexity

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
complexity is intensifying in complexity
infinitely<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:41.360> think<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.440> we

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
infinitely and I think that because we

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.120 
infinitely and I think that because we
are<00:01:43.710> conscious<00:01:44.360> we<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.690> consciously<00:01:46.619> think

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
are conscious we can consciously think

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.520 
are conscious we can consciously think
of<00:01:47.310> anything<00:01:47.729> infinitely<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.350> take

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
of anything infinitely we can take

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.830 
of anything infinitely we can take
things<00:01:49.800> deeper<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.460> deeper<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:51.090> our<00:01:51.300> minds<00:01:51.600> I

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
things deeper and deeper in our minds I

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.310 
things deeper and deeper in our minds I
and<00:01:52.140> our<00:01:52.229> third<00:01:52.530> eye<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:54.899> deep<00:01:55.110> as

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
and our third eye we can go as deep as

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.620 
and our third eye we can go as deep as
we<00:01:55.350> want<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> any<00:01:56.280> subject<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:57.090> our<00:01:57.210> minds

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
we want in to any subject in our minds

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.469 
we want in to any subject in our minds
but<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.649> don't<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.340> why<00:02:00.000> we're<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:00.660> I<00:02:02.479> think

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
but we don't know why we're here I think

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.699 
but we don't know why we're here I think
the<00:02:04.170> ultimate<00:02:04.709> why<00:02:05.179> above<00:02:06.319> consciousness<00:02:07.319> is

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
the ultimate why above consciousness is

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.910 
the ultimate why above consciousness is
the<00:02:08.580> meaning<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.000> life<00:02:09.649> because<00:02:10.649> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the meaning of life because that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.500 
the meaning of life because that
question<00:02:11.580> why<00:02:11.940> why<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.569> here<00:02:12.990> is

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
question why why are we here is

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.900 
question why why are we here is
impossible<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:16.709> answer<00:02:16.890> because<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.670> cannot

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
impossible to answer because it cannot

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.520 
impossible to answer because it cannot
be<00:02:18.090> put<00:02:18.270> into<00:02:18.980> words<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.470> ultimate

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
be put into words it's the ultimate

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.770 
be put into words it's the ultimate
divinity<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.580> universe<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.540> why<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
divinity of the universe the why and

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.750 
divinity of the universe the why and
that's<00:02:25.140> why<00:02:25.440> we<00:02:25.470> manifested<00:02:26.400> that's<00:02:26.580> why

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
that's why we manifested that's why

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.240 
that's why we manifested that's why
we're<00:02:26.940> conscious<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.440> experience<00:02:28.890> that

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
we're conscious is to experience that

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.309 
we're conscious is to experience that
wine<00:02:29.840> through<00:02:30.840> every<00:02:32.930> emotion<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.080> have

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
wine through every emotion we have

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.050 
wine through every emotion we have
because<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.130> emotional<00:02:35.340> world<00:02:35.790> which

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
because it's the emotional world which

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.550 
because it's the emotional world which
is<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.360> real<00:02:36.540> world<00:02:36.720> everything<00:02:37.200> else<00:02:37.380> is

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
is the real world everything else is

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.300 
is the real world everything else is
just<00:02:37.590> mathematics<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> feeling

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
just mathematics and it's the feeling

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.550 
just mathematics and it's the feeling
which<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.520> why<00:02:42.390> we're<00:02:42.599> here<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:43.020> need<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.319> feel

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
which is why we're here we need to feel

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.449 
which is why we're here we need to feel
everything<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.840> deeply<00:02:45.840> as<00:02:45.959> possible<00:02:46.459> because

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
everything as deeply as possible because

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.199 
everything as deeply as possible because
only<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:48.170> emotion<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.349> we<00:02:49.440> ever<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.740> close

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
only in emotion that we ever get close

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.949 
only in emotion that we ever get close
to<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.330> impossible<00:02:51.569> why<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.150> for<00:02:54.330> every<00:02:54.540> love

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
to the impossible why so for every love
