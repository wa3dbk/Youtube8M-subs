well is uh that's a little sketchy so i
had<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:38.790> get<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.030> fast

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
had to think of a way to get this fast

locked<00:01:23.700> tight<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.330> basically<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.750> I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810

locked tight on it but basically what I
did<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.560> wasn't<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.040> hole<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.549> before<00:01:26.820> I

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
did is there wasn't a hole here before I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730 
did is there wasn't a hole here before I
poked<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.390> hole<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.049> hole<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.470> meant

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
poked a hole there so this hole is meant

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.480 
poked a hole there so this hole is meant
to<00:01:28.920> fit<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.790> bolt<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.220> simply

just<00:01:59.610> saying<00:02:00.240> there's<00:02:00.750> probably<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.409> really

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
just saying there's probably a really

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.480 
just saying there's probably a really
good<00:02:02.130> chance<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:03.180> you've<00:02:03.360> got<00:02:04.219> say<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> piece

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
good chance that you've got say a piece

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.820 
good chance that you've got say a piece
of<00:02:05.520> hardware<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:07.129> a<00:02:08.129> bearing<00:02:08.539> right<00:02:09.709> now<00:02:10.709> this

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
of hardware and a bearing right now this

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.800 
of hardware and a bearing right now this
isn't<00:02:10.979> gonna<00:02:11.160> work<00:02:11.250> exactly<00:02:11.700> right<00:02:11.940> with

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
isn't gonna work exactly right with

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.020 
isn't gonna work exactly right with
these<00:02:12.959> pants<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:13.650> because<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.580> hole<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.760> too

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
these pants but because the hole is too

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.790 
these pants but because the hole is too
big<00:02:15.239> when<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.080> cut<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.349> hole<00:02:16.470> you're<00:02:16.680> gonna

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
big when you cut the hole you're gonna

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.680 
big when you cut the hole you're gonna
have<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.010> careful<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.550> believe<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.510> have

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
have to be careful I believe if you have

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.910 
have to be careful I believe if you have
like<00:02:23.780> if<00:02:24.780> you've<00:02:24.989> got<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.470> style<00:02:25.739> of

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
like if you've got like this style of

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.460 
like if you've got like this style of
button<00:02:26.390> where<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.660> riveted<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.260> and

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
button where it's like riveted in and

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.369 
button where it's like riveted in and
that<00:02:29.250> breaks<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> hardware<00:02:31.200> works

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
that breaks that the hardware works

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.020 
that breaks that the hardware works
because<00:02:31.739> I'm<00:02:31.830> pretty<00:02:32.069> sure<00:02:32.220> that's<00:02:32.459> similar

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
because I'm pretty sure that's similar

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.030 
because I'm pretty sure that's similar
to<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.269> was<00:02:33.420> wearing<00:02:33.650> first<00:02:34.650> time<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.920> had

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
to what I was wearing first time I had

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.619 
to what I was wearing first time I had
to<00:02:35.069> do<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:35.670> basically<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.330> goes<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
to do this but basically it goes the

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.240 
to do this but basically it goes the
same<00:02:36.690> way<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.500> go<00:02:37.620> through<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.890> hole<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.069> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
same way you go through the hole in the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.630 
same way you go through the hole in the
back<00:02:38.430> with<00:02:38.670> your<00:02:38.790> hardware<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.830> then<00:02:40.830> through

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
back with your hardware and then through

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.300 
back with your hardware and then through
the<00:02:41.700> button<00:02:42.030> loop<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.860> then<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.010> use<00:02:44.190> your

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
the button loop and then you use your

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.119 
the button loop and then you use your
bearing<00:02:44.610> as<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> washer<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.769> then<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.920> tighten

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
bearing as a washer and then you tighten

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:56.390 
bearing as a washer and then you tighten
down<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:49.590> nut<00:02:49.830> on<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.220> end<00:02:50.810> now<00:02:55.400> using

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
down the the nut on the end now using

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.699 
down the the nut on the end now using
the<00:02:56.489> original<00:02:56.730> stuff<00:02:57.239> here<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.750> had<00:02:57.959> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
the original stuff here that I had the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.220 
the original stuff here that I had the
the<00:02:59.159> nut<00:02:59.610> button<00:03:00.060> or<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:02.550> nut<00:03:02.879> bolt<00:03:03.870> and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
the nut button or it's the nut bolt and

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.250 
the nut button or it's the nut bolt and
washer<00:03:05.209> if<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.390> had<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.569> nut<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.110> some

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
washer if you had a nut with some

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.750 
washer if you had a nut with some
Loctite<00:03:07.709> on<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.129> lock<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.670> down

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
Loctite on it you can lock it down

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.420 
Loctite on it you can lock it down
really<00:03:08.970> hard<00:03:09.090> two<00:03:09.870> washers<00:03:10.349> really<00:03:11.010> sandwich

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
really hard two washers really sandwich

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.300 
really hard two washers really sandwich
it<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.700> they're<00:03:11.819> good<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.930> really<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:14.010> this

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
it and they're good but really this this

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.780 
it and they're good but really this this
is<00:03:14.430> all<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.700> need<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> hardware<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
is all you need is the hardware and the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.440 
is all you need is the hardware and the
bearing<00:03:17.790> that's<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.480> um<00:03:19.819> you<00:03:20.819> do<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.330> be

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
bearing that's it um you do have to be

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.970 
bearing that's it um you do have to be
really<00:03:21.720> careful<00:03:21.870> about<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.500> size<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.920> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
really careful about the size of the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.110 
really careful about the size of the
hole<00:03:23.129> because<00:03:23.400> when<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.550> look<00:03:23.700> at<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.849> head

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
hole because when you look at the head

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.570 
hole because when you look at the head
of<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.599> hardware<00:03:25.019> if<00:03:25.349> you<00:03:25.769> poke<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.010> too<00:03:26.310> big

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
of that hardware if you poke it too big

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.949 
of that hardware if you poke it too big
that's<00:03:27.030> gonna<00:03:27.120> slide<00:03:27.450> right<00:03:27.480> through<00:03:27.659> there

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
that's gonna slide right through there

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.470 
that's gonna slide right through there
especially<00:03:28.560> because<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.040> tapered<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:30.299> see

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
especially because it's tapered you see

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.960 
especially because it's tapered you see
how<00:03:30.599> it<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:31.440> got<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.709> weird<00:03:31.970> slanted

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
how it it's got this weird slanted

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.729 
how it it's got this weird slanted
shoulder<00:03:33.299> there<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.080> digs<00:03:34.440> into<00:03:34.590> the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
shoulder there so that digs into the

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.460 
shoulder there so that digs into the
wood<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.890> little<00:03:35.010> bit<00:03:35.780> you'll<00:03:36.780> notice<00:03:37.080> this

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
wood a little bit you'll notice this

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.170 
wood a little bit you'll notice this
this<00:03:38.069> doesn't<00:03:38.280> have<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.700> because<00:03:39.030> it's

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
this doesn't have that because it's

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.640 
this doesn't have that because it's
supposed<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.480> sit<00:03:39.659> flush<00:03:39.930> against<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.470> piece<00:03:40.620> of

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
supposed to sit flush against a piece of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.740 
supposed to sit flush against a piece of
metal<00:03:40.980> or<00:03:41.220> or<00:03:41.670> wood<00:03:42.180> or<00:03:42.209> whatever<00:03:44.599> keep<00:03:45.599> that

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
metal or or wood or whatever keep that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.420 
metal or or wood or whatever keep that
in<00:03:45.840> mind<00:03:46.019> when<00:03:46.319> you're<00:03:46.440> cutting<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.950> hole<00:03:47.159> it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
in mind when you're cutting the hole it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.390 
in mind when you're cutting the hole it
might<00:03:47.970> not<00:03:48.090> work<00:03:48.150> but<00:03:48.599> uh<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.890> worked<00:03:50.099> for<00:03:50.250> me

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
might not work but uh it worked for me

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.280 
might not work but uh it worked for me
when<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.730> needed<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.420> hopefully<00:03:51.629> it'll<00:03:52.170> work

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
when I needed it so hopefully it'll work

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.580 
when I needed it so hopefully it'll work
for<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.830> when<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.489> need<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.790> as<00:03:53.939> well<00:03:54.439> I'm<00:03:55.439> not

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
for you when you need it as well I'm not

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.149 
for you when you need it as well I'm not
promising<00:03:55.769> anything<00:03:56.099> but<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:57.390> know<00:03:57.950> I'm<00:03:58.950> the

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
promising anything but you know I'm the

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.229 
promising anything but you know I'm the
really<00:03:59.340> cool<00:03:59.459> thing<00:03:59.700> about<00:03:59.790> using<00:04:00.030> the

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
really cool thing about using the

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.460 
really cool thing about using the
hardware<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:02.790> always<00:04:03.030> going<00:04:03.330> to<00:04:03.390> be<00:04:03.480> fine

this<00:04:20.669> nut

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
this nut

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.900 
this nut
can<00:04:21.479> come<00:04:21.690> loose<00:04:21.840> just<00:04:22.259> randomly<00:04:22.680> just<00:04:23.129> with

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
can come loose just randomly just with

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.580 
can come loose just randomly just with
every<00:04:24.180> day<00:04:24.330> wearing<00:04:24.750> it<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.169> can<00:04:25.289> come<00:04:25.440> loose

every day wearing it it can come loose

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.559 
every day wearing it it can come loose
there's<00:04:26.430> no<00:04:26.610> way<00:04:26.789> that<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.030> can<00:04:27.090> tighten<00:04:27.479> it

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:27.569 
there's no way that I can tighten it

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:28.850 
there's no way that I can tighten it
down<00:04:27.599> enough<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.229> not<00:04:28.410> going<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.710> come

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
down enough that is not going to come

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.499 
down enough that is not going to come
loose<00:04:29.039> because<00:04:29.789> it<00:04:29.970> doesn't<00:04:30.150> have<00:04:30.180> any<00:04:30.360> lock

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509
