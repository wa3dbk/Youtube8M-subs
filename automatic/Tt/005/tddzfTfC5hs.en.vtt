00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.240

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.590
 I realized I had to have done in eight matches 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.780
 2h10 here, meanwhile, regardless of the base 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.280
 according to leaders 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.920

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.470

 gave a lot 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.620

 in the future volleyball tournament of our last band show 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.560
 these tires are hard times 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.130

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.310
