three helixes I felt I bumped this back
up<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.649> three<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.159> helix<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:47.850> um<00:01:48.090> being

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
up to three because helix now um being

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.929 
up to three because helix now um being
that<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> scale<00:01:49.799> nine<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.310> much<00:01:50.759> more

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
pretty powerful card even against like

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.580 
pretty powerful card even against like
um<00:02:26.910> Nick<00:02:27.360> Ross<00:02:27.569> where<00:02:28.080> they<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.410> to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
um Nick Ross where they have to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.530 
um Nick Ross where they have to
basically<00:02:28.830> try<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.430> waste<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.120> lot<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.330> their

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
basically try to waste a lot of their

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.780 
basically try to waste a lot of their
resources<00:02:30.900> trying<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.950> get<00:02:32.250> over<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.610> car

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
resources trying to get over this car

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.280 
resources trying to get over this car
like<00:02:32.970> basically<00:02:33.390> they're<00:02:33.690> only<00:02:33.840> out<00:02:33.959> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
like basically they're only out is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.190 
like basically they're only out is
probably<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> Trish<00:02:35.250> Allah<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
probably like a Trish Allah and a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.290 
probably like a Trish Allah and a
decisive<00:02:37.470> armor<00:02:37.860> or<00:02:38.010> valkars<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> decisive

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
decisive armor or valkars and a decisive

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.780 
decisive armor or valkars and a decisive
armor<00:02:39.750> other<00:02:40.200> than<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.470> tower<00:02:40.890> puts<00:02:41.310> applies

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
armor other than that tower puts applies

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.790 
armor other than that tower puts applies
a<00:02:42.000> lot<00:02:42.209> more<00:02:42.390> pressure<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.020> opponent<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
a lot more pressure to the opponent so

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.530 
a lot more pressure to the opponent so
yeah<00:02:43.980> that's<00:02:44.430> why<00:02:44.580> i<00:02:44.640> put<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.880> one<00:02:45.000> towers<00:02:45.330> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
yeah that's why i put the one towers and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.780 
yeah that's why i put the one towers and
lastly<00:02:46.500> from<00:02:46.709> our<00:02:46.800> monsters<00:02:47.130> i<00:02:47.250> play<00:02:47.430> one

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
lastly from our monsters i play one

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.820 
lastly from our monsters i play one
perform<00:02:48.239> powell<00:02:48.420> trample<00:02:48.810> x<00:02:48.900> now<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.380> think

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
perform powell trample x now you think

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.920 
perform powell trample x now you think
that<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.310> might<00:02:50.640> be<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> weird<00:02:50.850> card<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:51.900> i

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
that this might be a weird card but i

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.900 
that this might be a weird card but i
actually<00:02:52.260> surprisingly<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.370> there<00:02:53.820> was

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
actually surprisingly like it there was

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.090 
actually surprisingly like it there was
so<00:02:54.120> much<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.720> there<00:02:54.840> was<00:02:55.019> always<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.800> couple<00:02:56.040> of

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
so much so there was always a couple of

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.380 
so much so there was always a couple of
times<00:02:56.250> where<00:02:56.489> i<00:02:56.550> was<00:02:56.700> able<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.209> actually

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
times where i was able to actually

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.140 
times where i was able to actually
resolve<00:02:58.190> these<00:02:59.190> two<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.760> pendulum<00:03:00.090> zone

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
resolve these two in the pendulum zone

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.690 
resolve these two in the pendulum zone
so<00:03:00.480> i<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.750> use<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.080> Scout<00:03:01.290> twice<00:03:01.560> because<00:03:02.280> now

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
so i can use the Scout twice because now

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.460 
so i can use the Scout twice because now
