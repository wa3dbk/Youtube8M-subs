version so you'll actually be able to
aim<00:01:19.590> down<00:01:19.799> sight<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.310> it'll<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.460> maybe<00:01:20.939> even

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
aim down sight so it'll have maybe even

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.820 
aim down sight so it'll have maybe even
different<00:01:21.570> stats<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:22.049> maybe<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> same<00:01:22.470> stats

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
different stats or maybe the same stats

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.410 
different stats or maybe the same stats
but<00:01:23.250> it'll<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.580> completely<00:01:23.759> interesting

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
but it'll be completely interesting

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.399 
but it'll be completely interesting
because<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.840> there's<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.049> lot<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
because I know that there's a lot of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.950 
because I know that there's a lot of
people<00:01:25.740> who<00:01:26.280> don't<00:01:26.580> use<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> sack<00:01:27.270> 3<00:01:27.570> because

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
people who don't use the sack 3 because

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
people who don't use the sack 3 because
it's<00:01:28.200> an<00:01:28.320> akimbo<00:01:28.560> weapon<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.369> feel

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's an akimbo weapon they just feel

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.740 
it's an akimbo weapon they just feel
like<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.180> good<00:01:30.360> weapon<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.720> use

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
like it's not a good weapon to use

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.539 
like it's not a good weapon to use
because<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.140> can't<00:01:31.409> aim<00:01:31.560> down<00:01:31.740> sights<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
because you can't aim down sights it's a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.560 
because you can't aim down sights it's a
really<00:01:32.729> good<00:01:32.790> weapon<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.270> you're<00:01:33.390> playing

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
really good weapon if you're playing

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.880 
really good weapon if you're playing
hard<00:01:33.750> pointer<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.229> you're<00:01:34.320> playing<00:01:34.500> maps<00:01:34.740> that

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
hard pointer if you're playing maps that

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
hard pointer if you're playing maps that
are<00:01:34.950> very<00:01:35.159> small<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.670> most<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> time

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
are very small but most of the time

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.940 
are very small but most of the time
you're<00:01:36.689> not<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.500> using<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you're not really going to be using it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
you're not really going to be using it
and<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.340> think<00:01:38.400> Michael<00:01:38.939> condry<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and I think Michael condry and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
and I think Michael condry and
sledgehammer<00:01:40.020> games<00:01:40.110> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.650> sees<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
sledgehammer games kind of sees this and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
sledgehammer games kind of sees this and
they<00:01:41.490> want<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> make<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.270> you're<00:01:42.479> able<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
they want to make it so you're able to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.100 
they want to make it so you're able to
use<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.259> SMG<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.240> one-gun<00:01:45.240> option<00:01:45.869> which<00:01:45.990> i

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
use this SMG as a one-gun option which i

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.840 
use this SMG as a one-gun option which i
think<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.350> absolutely<00:01:46.590> insane<00:01:47.189> now<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.759> next

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
think is absolutely insane now the next

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.010 
think is absolutely insane now the next
thing<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> lot<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> people<00:01:48.750> are

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
thing is that a lot of people are

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.050 
thing is that a lot of people are
talking<00:01:49.049> about<00:01:49.439> again<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.009> secret<00:01:50.549> new

dlc<00:02:03.329> 2<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.689> people<00:02:03.869> were<00:02:03.960> thinking<00:02:04.110> maybe<00:02:04.469> it's

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
dlc 2 so people were thinking maybe it's

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.469

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
not the DLC weapon so it could still be

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.669 
not the DLC weapon so it could still be
something<00:02:09.330> else<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.050> lot<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.379> people<00:02:10.470> are
