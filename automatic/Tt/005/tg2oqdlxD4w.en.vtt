risky<00:00:32.460> bond<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.480> jigsaw<00:00:34.140> runescape

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.979 
risky bond of the jigsaw runescape
website<00:00:34.890> by<00:00:35.340> paying<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.030> believe<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:36.719> bond

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
website by paying it I believe one bond

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.420 
website by paying it I believe one bond
is<00:00:37.260> five<00:00:37.559> dollars<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> 4.2<00:00:39.300> euros<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.430> so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
is five dollars and 4.2 euros and so

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.250 
is five dollars and 4.2 euros and so
that<00:00:41.640> basically<00:00:41.879> means<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:43.020> buy

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.649 
mil for one bond I can I then I can get
like<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.619> run<00:01:46.770> coins<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.340> membership

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
like the run coins or do you membership

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.420 
like the run coins or do you membership
so<00:01:48.659> that's<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.350> least<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:49.860> good<00:01:50.040> method

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
so that's at least a pretty good method

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.569 
so that's at least a pretty good method
I've<00:01:50.610> also<00:01:50.850> seen<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.210> forums<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:52.579> somebody

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
I've also seen on forums like somebody

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.370 
I've also seen on forums like somebody
gave<00:01:53.790> his<00:01:53.970> friend<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.299> bond<00:01:54.570> who<00:01:54.960> couldn't<00:01:55.320> get

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
gave his friend a bond who couldn't get

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.870 
gave his friend a bond who couldn't get
membership<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.130> country<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
membership in this country because it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.219 
membership in this country because it
was<00:01:56.969> blocked<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.390> something<00:01:57.750> or<00:01:57.869> their<00:01:58.020> work

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
was blocked or something or their work

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.490 
was blocked or something or their work
so<00:01:58.860> at<00:01:59.100> least<00:01:59.219> that's<00:02:00.060> also<00:02:00.450> cool<00:02:00.600> thing<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.049> on

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
so at least that's also cool thing or on

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.190 
so at least that's also cool thing or on
the<00:02:01.590> teamspeak<00:02:01.829> server<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:03.780> managed

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the teamspeak server I have we managed

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.550 
the teamspeak server I have we managed
to<00:02:05.060> pitch<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.270> some<00:02:06.450> money<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.960> somebody<00:02:07.350> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
to pitch in some money for somebody and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.760

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
get him a Rufus ticket with 35 bonds so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.440 
get him a Rufus ticket with 35 bonds so
it<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:10.920> really<00:02:11.069> happy<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.640> now<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.270> go

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it was really happy and now we can go

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.880 
it was really happy and now we can go
now<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:12.989> go<00:02:13.379> to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
now we all go to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.910 
now we all go to
good<00:02:14.220> investigator<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.240> also<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.660> good

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
good investigator so that's also a good

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.220 
good investigator so that's also a good
thing<00:02:16.920> about<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.280> bonds<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.270> doesn't<00:02:19.140> mean

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
thing about the bonds that doesn't mean

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.160 
thing about the bonds that doesn't mean
that<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:20.069> do<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:21.030> slight<00:02:21.270> advantage<00:02:21.420> with

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that you do have a slight advantage with

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.840 
that you do have a slight advantage with
real<00:02:22.380> life<00:02:22.500> money<00:02:22.740> but<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.490> still<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
real life money but you still have to

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.430 
real life money but you still have to
think<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.569> actually<00:02:24.720> have<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.410> use

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
think that you actually have to use

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.080 
think that you actually have to use
those<00:02:25.890> resources<00:02:25.980> let's<00:02:26.700> see<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.970> buy

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
those resources let's see if you buy

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.809 
those resources let's see if you buy
dragon<00:02:27.330> bones<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:28.500> train<00:02:28.860> your<00:02:28.950> skill<00:02:29.250> or<00:02:29.550> if

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
dragon bones to train your skill or if

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.420 
dragon bones to train your skill or if
you<00:02:29.910> buy<00:02:30.060> armor<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.959> are<00:02:31.350> not<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.800> best<00:02:31.920> pvm

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
you buy armor you are not the best pvm

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.660 
you buy armor you are not the best pvm
and<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.840> armor<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
and then you just have the armor and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.890 
and then you just have the armor and
hopefully<00:02:35.670> they<00:02:35.940> gonna<00:02:36.180> do<00:02:36.390> something<00:02:36.780> but

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
hopefully they gonna do something but

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.710 
hopefully they gonna do something but
almost<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.440> make<00:02:37.680> untradable<00:02:38.550> strong<00:02:39.209> dandy

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
almost to make untradable strong dandy

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.199 
almost to make untradable strong dandy
tradable<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.680> should<00:02:40.920> be<00:02:40.950> may<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:41.940> good

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
tradable so this should be may be good

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.050 
tradable so this should be may be good
in<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.390> future<00:02:42.690> then<00:02:42.870> anyway<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:43.860> that's<00:02:44.700> what

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
in the future then anyway so that's what

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.040 
in the future then anyway so that's what
a<00:02:45.090> bomb<00:02:45.360> does<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.940> move<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.239> try<00:02:48.840> and

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
a bomb does this is a move to try and

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.560 
a bomb does this is a move to try and
reduce<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.770> gold<00:02:50.430> farmers<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:50.970> good<00:02:51.209> for<00:02:51.390> must

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
reduce the gold farmers as good for must

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.509 
reduce the gold farmers as good for must
bring<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:52.050> lot<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.590> money<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.100> game<00:02:53.280> and

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
bring a lot of money in the game and

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.870 
bring a lot of money in the game and
causes<00:02:54.200> inflation<00:02:55.459> surprises<00:02:56.459> going<00:02:56.700> down

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
causes inflation surprises going down

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.490 
causes inflation surprises going down
because<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.239> too<00:02:57.510> many<00:02:57.630> gold<00:02:57.989> entering<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
because of too many gold entering the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.160 
because of too many gold entering the
game<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.310> could<00:02:59.970> prevent<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.810> gold

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
game and so this could prevent the gold

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.590 
game and so this could prevent the gold
farmers<00:03:01.560> from<00:03:01.769> getting<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:02.700> message<00:03:02.850> golden

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
farmers from getting that message golden

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.860 
farmers from getting that message golden
game<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.080> also<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:05.430> bonds<00:03:06.090> if<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.540> trade

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
game and also the bonds if you trade

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.050 
game and also the bonds if you trade
them<00:03:07.050> first<00:03:07.350> or<00:03:07.680> buy<00:03:08.280> them<00:03:08.430> from<00:03:08.519> GE<00:03:08.730> they

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
them first or buy them from GE they

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.240 
them first or buy them from GE they
become<00:03:09.330> incredible<00:03:10.230> state<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.680> if<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.130> want

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
become incredible state and if you want

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.880 
become incredible state and if you want
to<00:03:11.310> trade<00:03:11.670> them<00:03:11.820> again<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:13.140> pay<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
to trade them again you have to pay the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.120 
to trade them again you have to pay the
ten<00:03:14.280> percent<00:03:14.610> fee<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.390> G<00:03:15.570> price<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.530> 1.2

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
ten percent fee of the G price so 1.2

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.470 
ten percent fee of the G price so 1.2
mil<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.489> mando<00:03:17.760> believe<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.150> that's<00:03:18.360> a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
mil of the mando believe so that's a

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.300 
mil of the mando believe so that's a
money<00:03:18.959> sink<00:03:19.230> as<00:03:19.440> well<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.890> small<00:03:20.010> one

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
money sink as well it's a small one

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.610 
money sink as well it's a small one
thing<00:03:20.579> but<00:03:20.910> it's<00:03:21.090> one<00:03:21.329> sink<00:03:21.630> as<00:03:21.780> well<00:03:21.989> so

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
thing but it's one sink as well so

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.039 
thing but it's one sink as well so
that's<00:03:22.829> a<00:03:22.890> good<00:03:23.040> thing<00:03:23.299> now<00:03:24.299> then<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.989> believe

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
that's a good thing now then I believe

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.850 
that's a good thing now then I believe

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
good and it does seem to work for now

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.530

obviously it will not radek ate all the
gold<00:03:48.720> forms<00:03:49.019> as<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.440> prices<00:03:49.860> are<00:03:50.010> way<00:03:50.190> cheaper

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640

on the goo websites but obviously it's
