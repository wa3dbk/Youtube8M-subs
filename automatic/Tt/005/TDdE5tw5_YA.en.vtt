00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
frozenness you know we are we do do a

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.319 
frozenness you know we are we do do a
different<00:01:24.520> kind<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.729> thing<00:01:24.939> than<00:01:25.119> we've<00:01:25.210> ever

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
different kind of thing than we've ever

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.090 
different kind of thing than we've ever
done<00:01:25.630> before<00:01:25.780> which<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.469> idea<00:01:26.500> fear

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100

versus<00:01:27.490> love<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.030> I<00:01:28.630> think<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.170> journey<00:01:29.500> is

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649

versus love and I think the journey is
epic<00:01:30.130> there's<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.939> lot<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.420> comedy<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.200> lot

of<00:01:32.439> emotion<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.520> lot<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.119> heart<00:01:34.390> which<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.320> think

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
of emotion a lot of heart which I think

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.410
