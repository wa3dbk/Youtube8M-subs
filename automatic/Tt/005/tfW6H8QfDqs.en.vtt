if<00:00:01.949> you're<00:00:02.340> asked<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.850> find<00:00:03.000> an<00:00:03.360> unknown

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
if you're asked to find an unknown

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.030 
if you're asked to find an unknown
within<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.560> shape<00:00:04.940> then<00:00:06.350> the<00:00:07.350> method<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> set

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
within a shape then the method is a set

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.070 
within a shape then the method is a set
up<00:00:08.160> an<00:00:08.250> equation<00:00:08.610> now<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.599> know<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:09.990> they've

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
up an equation now we know that they've

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.799 
up an equation now we know that they've
got<00:00:10.200> four<00:00:10.590> sides<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.280> hence<00:00:11.490> four<00:00:11.849> angles<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
got four sides and hence four angles and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.570 
got four sides and hence four angles and
all<00:00:13.139> four<00:00:13.769> angles<00:00:13.980> must<00:00:14.490> add<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.299> make<00:00:15.480> 360<00:00:16.580> so

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
all four angles must add to make 360 so

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.410 
all four angles must add to make 360 so
X<00:00:18.359> plus<00:00:18.990> 16<00:00:19.470> plus<00:00:21.020> consummating<00:00:22.100> plus<00:00:23.100> 1/3<00:00:24.029> 4

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
X plus 16 plus consummating plus 1/3 4

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:37.310 
X plus 16 plus consummating plus 1/3 4
plus<00:00:25.289> X<00:00:25.849> must<00:00:26.849> equal<00:00:27.140> 360<00:00:30.590> so<00:00:31.880> 100<00:00:32.880> 200<00:00:34.070> 240<00:00:36.320> 250

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
plus X must equal 360 so 100 200 240 250

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.400 
plus X must equal 360 so 100 200 240 250
to<00:00:37.710> 260<00:00:38.550> 2<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:39.930> 6<00:00:40.290> 8<00:00:41.120> X<00:00:42.120> plus<00:00:42.809> X<00:00:43.050> plus<00:00:43.760> 2<00:00:44.760> 6<00:00:45.450> 8<00:00:45.750> must

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to 260 2 to 6 8 X plus X plus 2 6 8 must

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.040 
to 260 2 to 6 8 X plus X plus 2 6 8 must
equal<00:00:46.770> 360

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
equal 360

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
equal 360
we've<00:00:49.050> made<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> left-hand<00:00:49.860> side<00:00:50.100> simpler<00:00:50.910> we

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
we've made the left-hand side simpler we

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:02.770 
we've made the left-hand side simpler we
now<00:00:52.050> take<00:00:52.350> away<00:00:52.530> 2<00:00:53.010> 6<00:00:53.309> 8<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> 2<00:00:54.840> X<00:00:55.230> will<00:00:56.070> equal<00:01:01.640> 92

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
now take away 2 6 8 so 2 X will equal 92

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.310 
now take away 2 6 8 so 2 X will equal 92
then<00:01:03.780> divide<00:01:04.080> by<00:01:04.260> 8<00:01:04.409> by<00:01:04.619> 2<00:01:04.760> X<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:06.270> equal<00:01:06.420> 90<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
then divide by 8 by 2 X will equal 90 to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.899 
then divide by 8 by 2 X will equal 90 to
number<00:01:08.040> 2<00:01:08.250> which<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.939> 46<00:01:09.659> degrees<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> that's

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
number 2 which is 46 degrees so that's

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.920 
number 2 which is 46 degrees so that's
part<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:14.189> question<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.640> asks<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.330> BC

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
part a the question then asks is BC

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.520 
part a the question then asks is BC
parallel<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> ad<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.320> two<00:01:19.320> lines

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
parallel to ad so are these two lines

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.609 
parallel to ad so are these two lines
here<00:01:19.740> parallel<00:01:21.080> now<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.229> I'll<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.500> I'll

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
here parallel now what I'll do is I'll

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.390 
here parallel now what I'll do is I'll
work<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.280> angle<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.770> if<00:01:25.770> X<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
work out what this angle here is if X is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.990 
work out what this angle here is if X is
46<00:01:27.030> then<00:01:27.689> 46<00:01:28.500> plus<00:01:28.799> 16<00:01:29.250> must<00:01:29.939> equal<00:01:30.710> 60<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:35.000> know

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
46 then 46 plus 16 must equal 60 to know

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.840 
46 then 46 plus 16 must equal 60 to know
that<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.689> two<00:01:37.439> lines<00:01:37.470> are<00:01:37.860> parallel<00:01:38.009> then

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that if two lines are parallel then

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.990 
that if two lines are parallel then
leaves<00:01:39.210> two<00:01:39.630> angles<00:01:39.960> say<00:01:40.140> will<00:01:40.290> add<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
leaves two angles say will add to a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.819 
leaves two angles say will add to a
native<00:01:42.920> let's<00:01:43.920> check<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.600> 118<00:01:45.600> degrees<00:01:45.829> plus

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
native let's check that 118 degrees plus

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.109 
native let's check that 118 degrees plus
60<00:01:47.340> degrees<00:01:47.990> does<00:01:48.990> indeed<00:01:49.200> equal<00:01:50.570> 180<00:01:51.590> degrees

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
60 degrees does indeed equal 180 degrees

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.850 
60 degrees does indeed equal 180 degrees
so<00:01:54.119> therefore<00:01:54.509> angle<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.820> B<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.799> want<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
so therefore angle a and B I want to

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.830 
so therefore angle a and B I want to
called<00:01:59.390> supplementary

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:14.360 

therefore<00:02:06.500> BC<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.420> AD<00:02:10.790> parallel<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.250> this

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
therefore BC and AD parallel and this

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.250 
therefore BC and AD parallel and this
holds<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.540> look<00:02:15.660> at<00:02:15.780> those<00:02:16.200> two

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
holds as well if you look at those two

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.040 
holds as well if you look at those two
angles<00:02:16.890> 1<00:02:17.519> 3<00:02:17.790> 4<00:02:18.060> +<00:02:18.750> 46<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.709> also<00:02:20.190> 180<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.450> C<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.720> D

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
angles 1 3 4 + 46 is also 180 so C and D

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.280 
angles 1 3 4 + 46 is also 180 so C and D
are<00:02:22.080> also<00:02:22.410> supplementary<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.150> gave<00:02:24.300> BC<00:02:25.050> and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
are also supplementary so we gave BC and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.920 
are also supplementary so we gave BC and
AD
