00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Let's show some of the relationship of 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.259
 child with water even early they 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.809
 prove that it is possible to overcome fear and 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.809
 learn to swim in a different way 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.680
 Nicolas has barely completed three years and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.580
 Leaps into the water without fear makes it a two 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.210
 three as often as necessary with full 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.620
 Intimacy with water is afraid of jumping 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.879
 It was already on the beach. 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.670
 and nothing is better when you go to the beach 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.100
 encouragement came from the mother and 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.949
 also nothing much time since the five 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.440
 I practice swimming and swimming. 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.930
 pregnancy I did not let not give up 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.300
 keep swimming I already had in mind 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.640
 When Nicolas is born, I will bring 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.680
 and I'll bring it because I joined the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.760
 child is very important right 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.940
 the fact that in health is a sport out 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.610
 that security, too, when it fell 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.009
 on a lake in a pool right? 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.009
 He could already turn right. 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.390
 he came with annie mail there in the beginning he 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.360
 had some fear, right? 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.759
 but the adaptation was quick and they note 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.759
 he has adapted and he adores revenge 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.819
 while electric in the pool of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.100
 adults the book is to stand well on the side in 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.439
 children's pool the two take classes 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.179
 same time so it becomes easier to act 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.890
 is to give that spy on lucas and 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.409
 accompanies the development of the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.349
 of the child in the water and it is with 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.170
 in a fun way that they 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:05.899
 learn to swim during classes 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:11.840
 teachers use various toys in 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:14.180
 minutes everything turns a party is a 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.629
 situation as a motor for the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.269
 learning how to swim with this 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.470
 requires a lot of fun that through 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.650
 jokes 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.120
 they will know this different way 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.760
 and meeting you, right? 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.190
 the aquatic environment many here had 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.610
 Fear of water even entering the pool 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.879
 is part of the process because this 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.060
 friendship with the water that favors you 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:45.390
 the conquest of security then fear is 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.409
 because I still do not know this environment 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.239
 So when he meets, he already knows the 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:54.120
 possibilities of movement of the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:58.140
 safe teacher confidence 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.019
 This friendship begins in this 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.420
 they gain security and fear is 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.420
 out there are some mothers stand on the side of 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.120
 outside the audience of this spectacle 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.980
 water either by necessity or by 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.980
 encouragement to sport 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.890
 The important thing is to learn to swim and this 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.200
 You can start early going can bring 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.390
 your child after four months of 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.390
 age as soon as the pediatrician 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.720
 to practice the frequency of the drink is the 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.140
 from four months the child well 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.930
 accompanied by the parents he will know the 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.130
 find out if this environment is safe 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.230
 Of your parents 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.720
 as it grows from two 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.450
 about two years ago they already 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.390
 join forces with friends 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.420
 and with the guidance of a teacher 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.180
 and there goes in that process is not learning 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.120
 swimming is divided into levels and the 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.300
 children are achieving these levels 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.900
 as this maturation takes place 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.900
 development. 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.140
 swimming is a very important sport 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.660
 not only those children who suffer 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.300
 with rhinitis with allergic bronchitis is 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.860
 very good to do swimming yesterday commented 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.230
 what iran wants to teixeira on 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.750
 obesity then physical activity 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.790
 swimming is an excellent physical activity 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.160
 for the child without counting that the child 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.600
 learn to deal with water is not afraid 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.640
 You can rest easy when you 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.350
 Is your house in the pool or are you going? 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.150
 in the house of a friend who has a pool 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.450
 So I think swimming is a sport. 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.500
 that every child has to do and does 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.500
 Very well, okay?
