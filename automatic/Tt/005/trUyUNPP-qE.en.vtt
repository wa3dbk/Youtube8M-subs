when<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> joint<00:00:26.789> mmm<00:00:27.359> think<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.230> were<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
when a joint mmm think there were in a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.830 
when a joint mmm think there were in a
pretty<00:00:28.769> bad<00:00:29.010> position<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.510> wants<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
pretty bad position and I just wants to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.470 
pretty bad position and I just wants to
make<00:00:30.869> sure<00:00:31.019> they<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.439> not<00:00:31.650> also<00:00:31.859> indicated

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
make sure they are not also indicated

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.920 
make sure they are not also indicated
but<00:00:33.480> slowly<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.190> maybe<00:00:35.399> even

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
but slowly I think we can maybe even

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.440 
but slowly I think we can maybe even

that Leo not coming out as a very first

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.510 
that Leo not coming out as a very first
band<00:00:45.690> from<00:00:45.930> gambit<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> did<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.100> expect<00:00:47.340> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
band from gambit and did you expect it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.940 
band from gambit and did you expect it
and<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.750> pretty<00:00:48.989> funny<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.559> I'm

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and that was pretty funny but I'm

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.000 
and that was pretty funny but I'm
usually<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.730> really<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:51.980> like<00:00:52.980> I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
usually not really on up there like I

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.060 
usually not really on up there like I
used<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.520> play<00:00:53.690> until<00:00:54.690> Q<00:00:54.989> different<00:00:55.770> champs

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
used to play until Q different champs

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.000 
used to play until Q different champs
that's<00:00:56.489> Leona<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.350> pretty<00:00:58.559> surprised

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that's Leona so I was pretty surprised

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.639 
that's Leona so I was pretty surprised
since<00:00:59.910> my<00:01:00.239> first<00:01:00.629> performance<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:01.230> okay<00:01:01.620> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
since my first performance was okay I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.549 
since my first performance was okay I
guess<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:02.699> focused<00:01:03.120> me<00:01:03.239> yeah<00:01:03.629> pretty<00:01:03.989> good<00:01:04.140> I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
guess they focused me yeah pretty good I

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.080 
guess they focused me yeah pretty good I
would<00:01:04.769> say<00:01:04.979> no<00:01:05.220> matter<00:01:05.430> how<00:01:05.700> much<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> your

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
would say no matter how much of your

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.260 
would say no matter how much of your
team<00:01:06.360> comp<00:01:06.630> was<00:01:06.780> inspired<00:01:07.170> by<00:01:07.320> 5.5<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.640> think

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
team comp was inspired by 5.5 I think

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.580 
team comp was inspired by 5.5 I think
the<00:01:09.360> only<00:01:09.390> portion<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.170> really

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the only portion that was really

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
the only portion that was really
inspired<00:01:10.950> by<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.820> OL<00:01:11.939> effect<00:01:12.240> I

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
inspired by was just the OL effect I

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
inspired by was just the OL effect I
think<00:01:12.780> he<00:01:13.439> really<00:01:13.650> shines<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
think he really shines with the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.039 
think he really shines with the
cinderhulk<00:01:14.549> item<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.150> other<00:01:15.689> than<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
cinderhulk item and other than that I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.289 
cinderhulk item and other than that I
just<00:01:16.200> think<00:01:16.650> coal<00:01:17.490> mine<00:01:17.670> general<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.090> really

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
just think coal mine general was really

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
just think coal mine general was really
really<00:01:18.450> strong<00:01:18.750> when<00:01:18.960> Leona's<00:01:19.710> band<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.159> we

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
really strong when Leona's band and we

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.380 
really strong when Leona's band and we
know<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.670> gambia<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.060> gonna<00:01:21.180> pick

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
know that the gambia is not gonna pick

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
know that the gambia is not gonna pick
any<00:01:21.570> yeah<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> mean<00:01:22.740> nami<00:01:23.250> coming

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.469 
him even though it did go well for you
but<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.680> would<00:01:40.890> say<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.310> Campos<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.210> felt

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
but like I would say that Campos I felt

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.330 
but like I would say that Campos I felt
in<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.960> teamfight<00:01:43.200> straight<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.130> should

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
in a teamfight straight on they should

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.780 
in a teamfight straight on they should
win<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.320> our<00:01:46.439> lanes<00:01:46.680> were<00:01:46.950> stronger

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
win but I think our lanes were stronger

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.340 
win but I think our lanes were stronger
plot<00:01:48.030> primarily<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.869> would<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.229> set

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
plot primarily and that would just set

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
plot primarily and that would just set
up<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.070> drakes<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> drakes

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
up for the drakes and I think the drakes

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
up for the drakes and I think the drakes
was<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:51.930> got<00:01:52.320> us<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.560> game<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> end<00:01:53.040> yeah

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
was what got us the game in the end yeah

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.450 
was what got us the game in the end yeah

and you guys also were ahead earlier in

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219 
and you guys also were ahead earlier in
the<00:01:56.579> game<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.180> should<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.659> i<00:01:57.689> should<00:01:58.020> say

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
really strange build pats coming out

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.649 
really strange build pats coming out
especially<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> side<00:02:01.920> from<00:02:02.130> diamond<00:02:02.659> sign

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
especially on the side from diamond sign

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.420 
especially on the side from diamond sign
and<00:02:03.810> what<00:02:03.930> did<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.079> make<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.770> hecarim

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
and what did you make of the hecarim

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.789 
and what did you make of the hecarim
into<00:02:05.729> stalkers<00:02:06.210> than<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
into stalkers than not going for the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.990 
into stalkers than not going for the
cinderhulk<00:02:08.190> enchantment<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.879> for

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
cinderhulk enchantment going for

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
cinderhulk enchantment going for
Triforce<00:02:09.479> first<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.080> was<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.440> really

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
Triforce first and it was just really

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.190 
Triforce first and it was just really
odd<00:02:10.920> yeah<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:12.209> no<00:02:12.360> idea<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:12.750> diamond<00:02:13.050> was

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
odd yeah I have no idea what diamond was

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.550 
odd yeah I have no idea what diamond was
thinking

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
thinking

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.290 
thinking
like<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.980> thought<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.550> first<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.060> he<00:02:15.180> was

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
like I thought that first that he was

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.150 
like I thought that first that he was
going<00:02:15.510> for<00:02:15.750> some<00:02:15.930> genius<00:02:16.319> tactic<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.860> okay

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
going for some genius tactic like okay

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.070 
going for some genius tactic like okay
is<00:02:17.310> gonna<00:02:17.430> go<00:02:17.640> try<00:02:17.940> force<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:18.630> he's

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
is gonna go try force and then he's

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.780 
is gonna go try force and then he's
gonna<00:02:19.260> get<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:19.830> dahuk<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.220> bit<00:02:20.340> later<00:02:20.550> when

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
gonna get this in dahuk a bit later when

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.580 
gonna get this in dahuk a bit later when
he<00:02:20.819> already<00:02:21.090> gets<00:02:21.510> like<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.959> benefit<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.349> the
