technology we've got what Scott Sony's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.819 
technology we've got what Scott Sony's
live<00:00:58.050> color<00:00:58.590> LED<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.460> gives<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.090> much<00:01:00.449> more

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
live color LED so gives you much more

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.619

green colors so whatever content you
watching<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> phone<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.229> will<00:01:07.590> look

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
watching on the phone it will look

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
watching on the phone it will look
absolutely<00:01:08.010> fantastic<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.869> may<00:01:09.990> also<00:01:10.170> notice

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
absolutely fantastic you may also notice

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
absolutely fantastic you may also notice
the<00:01:10.770> screen<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.220> slightly<00:01:11.430> larger<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.270> time

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the screen is slightly larger this time

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.600 
the screen is slightly larger this time
so<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> 5.2<00:01:13.530> inch<00:01:13.680> screen<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.189> opposed<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so it's a 5.2 inch screen as opposed to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.050 
so it's a 5.2 inch screen as opposed to
5<00:01:14.820> inches<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:16.380> its<00:01:16.590> users<00:01:17.009> IPS<00:01:17.520> pixel

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
5 inches and its users IPS pixel

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.640 
5 inches and its users IPS pixel
arrangement<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> viewing<00:01:19.140> angles<00:01:19.530> are

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
arrangement so the viewing angles are

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.560 
arrangement so the viewing angles are
absolutely<00:01:20.100> fantastic<00:01:20.130> from<00:01:21.060> any<00:01:21.270> site<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to the camera modes took a 4k recording

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.020 
to the camera modes took a 4k recording
but<00:02:00.750> he<00:02:00.840> also<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.229> time<00:02:01.500> shift<00:02:01.770> video<00:02:02.070> so

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
but he also got time shift video so

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.450 
but he also got time shift video so
another<00:02:03.509> great<00:02:03.740> capability<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> extra

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
another great capability that the extra

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.280 
another great capability that the extra
ram<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.909> power<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> phone<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
ram and power as to the phone is the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.770 
ram and power as to the phone is the
fact<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:07.890> record<00:02:08.250> videos<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.819> 120

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
fact that it can record videos at 120

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.900 
fact that it can record videos at 120

what<00:02:16.290> what<00:02:16.500> enables<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.850> can

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
what what enables you to do is you can

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.330 
what what enables you to do is you can
edit<00:02:18.180> these<00:02:18.450> videos<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.560> both<00:02:19.800> trim<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
edit these videos you can both trim the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.160 
edit these videos you can both trim the
video<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.820> also<00:02:20.940> reduce<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.690> speed<00:02:21.960> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
video and also reduce the speed and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.630 
video and also reduce the speed and
exactly<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.800> point<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> video<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.490> you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
exactly the point of the video that you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.150 
exactly the point of the video that you
like<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:23.940> do<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.780> let's<00:02:25.020> for<00:02:25.230> example<00:02:25.260> say<00:02:25.890> I'm

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
like to do so let's for example say I'm

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.930 
like to do so let's for example say I'm
going<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.020> action<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.710> super<00:02:29.700> slow

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
going to see this action in super slow

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.820 
going to see this action in super slow
motion<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> choose<00:02:31.170> which<00:02:31.440> part<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
motion so I choose which part of the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.650 
motion so I choose which part of the
video<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.070> want<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.460> slowed<00:02:32.700> down<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:33.180> can

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
video I want to be slowed down I can

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.720 
video I want to be slowed down I can
then<00:02:33.810> choose<00:02:34.050> how<00:02:34.650> much<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.100> want<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.340> slow<00:02:35.580> it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
then choose how much I want to slow it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.790 
then choose how much I want to slow it
down<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.270> can<00:02:36.360> go<00:02:36.540> even<00:02:36.660> down<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.960> 18<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
down so I can go even down to 18 of the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.370 
down so I can go even down to 18 of the
speed<00:02:38.100> when<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> apply<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.570> simple<00:02:40.110> i<00:02:40.170> play

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
speed when I apply that simple i play

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.550 
speed when I apply that simple i play
the<00:02:40.440> video<00:02:41.210> you<00:02:42.210> can<00:02:42.420> get<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> beautiful

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
thing that's built into the camera which

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.530 
thing that's built into the camera which
is<00:02:55.500> worth<00:02:55.680> mentioning<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.310> would<00:02:56.490> say<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.880> that

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
is worth mentioning I would say is that
