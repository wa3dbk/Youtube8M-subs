I<00:02:08.739> think<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.310> computers<00:02:09.759> are<00:02:09.939> mucking<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.420> up

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
I think the computers are mucking it up

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.300 
I think the computers are mucking it up
Plus<00:02:10.989> every<00:02:11.349> time<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:11.620> grab<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.010> seatbelt

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
Plus every time we grab the seatbelt

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.509 
Plus every time we grab the seatbelt
actually<00:02:13.590> restricts<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:14.950> it's<00:02:15.099> actually

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
actually restricts you so it's actually

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.400 
actually restricts you so it's actually
not<00:02:15.939> very<00:02:16.000> comfy<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:18.129> cars
