forefinger right here back and forth so

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.850 
forefinger right here back and forth so
does<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:39.190> lot<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.260> variety<00:02:41.260> can<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.590> these

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
does a lot of variety can have these

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.410 
does a lot of variety can have these
chords<00:02:42.250> if<00:02:42.400> you're<00:02:42.549> a<00:02:42.579> more<00:02:42.790> advanced<00:02:43.090> player

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
chords if you're a more advanced player

00:02:43.420 --> 00:03:02.190 
chords if you're a more advanced player
so<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.410> basic<00:02:45.040> regular<00:02:46.030> pattern<00:02:46.420> is<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:01.200> then

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
so the basic regular pattern is and then

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:33.420 
so the basic regular pattern is and then
the<00:03:02.790> more<00:03:03.790> moving<00:03:04.120> pattern<00:03:04.569> is

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.670 

so<00:03:34.430> now<00:03:34.610> move<00:03:34.880> over<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.480> bridge<00:03:35.720> which<00:03:36.650> is

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
so now move over to the bridge which is

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.290 
so now move over to the bridge which is
a<00:03:36.830> little<00:03:37.099> bit<00:03:37.190> more<00:03:37.370> work<00:03:37.580> but<00:03:37.819> it's<00:03:37.970> not<00:03:38.120> too

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
a little bit more work but it's not too

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.320 
a little bit more work but it's not too
hard<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.019> that's<00:03:39.200> coming<00:03:39.440> up<00:03:39.590> next<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.880> I'll

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
hard so that's coming up next so I'll

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.680 
hard so that's coming up next so I'll
break<00:03:44.540> down<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.750> bridge<00:03:45.140> it's<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.709> too<00:03:45.890> hard

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
break down the bridge it's not too hard
