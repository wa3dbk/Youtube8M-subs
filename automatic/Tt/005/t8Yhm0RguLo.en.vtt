00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
very pleasing factor there's a great

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.500 
very pleasing factor there's a great
team<00:00:20.130> performance<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.820> well<00:00:20.970> come<00:00:21.300> under

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
team performance as well come under

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.759 
team performance as well come under
pressure<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:21.960> bit<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> second<00:00:22.619> half

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
pressure a little bit in the second half

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
pressure a little bit in the second half
but<00:00:22.949> held<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.939> nicked<00:00:24.630> one<00:00:24.689> at<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
but held on and you nicked one at the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.380 
but held on and you nicked one at the
end<00:00:25.080> yeah<00:00:25.769> obviously<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.789> had<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.000> soak<00:00:27.150> up<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
end yeah obviously we had to soak up the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.019 
end yeah obviously we had to soak up the
pressure<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.320> once<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.650> went<00:00:28.769> 11<00:00:28.949> ahead<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
pressure and once we went 11 ahead and I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
pressure and once we went 11 ahead and I
think<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.570> defended<00:00:30.960> really<00:00:31.289> well<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> team

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
think we defended really well as a team

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.000 
think we defended really well as a team
and<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.640> limited<00:00:33.210> their<00:00:33.360> chances<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.440> think

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and we limited their chances and I think

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.310 
and we limited their chances and I think
we<00:00:35.130> kind<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.820> set<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.510> our<00:00:36.630> game<00:00:36.809> plan<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.110> bit

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
we kind of set up our game plan a bit

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.380 
we kind of set up our game plan a bit
different<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:37.770> once<00:00:38.160> they<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:39.329> was

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
different because once they was a it was

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.760 
different because once they was a it was
a<00:00:39.480> bit<00:00:39.660> more<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.899> control<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> game<00:00:40.559> you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
a bit more in control of the game you

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.619 
a bit more in control of the game you
had<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.040> work<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> current<00:00:42.030> return<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.510> knew

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
had to work on a current return we knew

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.940 
had to work on a current return we knew
we<00:00:42.719> had<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> players<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> speed<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
we had the players of the speed to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.830 
we had the players of the speed to
obviously<00:00:44.579> breaking<00:00:44.969> down<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.390> coming<00:00:45.539> in

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
obviously breaking down and coming in

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.119 
obviously breaking down and coming in
the<00:00:45.899> dying<00:00:46.110> minutes<00:00:46.230> we've<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.800> second
