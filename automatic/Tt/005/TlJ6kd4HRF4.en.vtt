00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.840
 for a new telekoopwijzer in which one 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.250
 of course to tell again what in 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.630
 different categories 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.610
 as far as we are concerned the best buy 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.590
 categories that we will depend on 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.939
 waving hello and smit frame 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.170
 We have the best smartphone 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.310
 per platform best 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.740
 value for money web platform 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.699
 best tablets and of course preorder 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.930
 category in which one devices 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.770
 treatment that is not yet on the market 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.699
 to be 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.050
 in the category of the best 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.550
 value for money is what us 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.360
 concerns on android area acer liquid 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.350
 e1 best aps-c me say to us he 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.350
 not all nexus 5 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.050
 a difficult choice in terms of price-quality 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.850
 ratio is also very good but in 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.409
 this category on the other especially 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.059
 devices for people who just don't 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.589
 want to spend too much money on one 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.960
 smartphone and still a good device 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.729
 like after liquid e1 certainly x5 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.650
 of course still costs 400 euros 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.879
 certainly not a cheap smartphone despite 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.610
 that the price quality of your still quite 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.290
 good is a nice tea one offers one 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.519
 dual-core processor just like that 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.589
 takes a disaster 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.930
 pretty nice and big screen and 5 via 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.150
 a half inch qhd screen a 5 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.260
 megapixel camera that is not very good 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.390
 design looks pretty nice 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.670
 attribute good speakers so what that 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.659
 regards it is sure to be good and red 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.090
 for the phone call 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.750
 at 150 euros for the scrub 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.159
 just very good 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.780
 value for money 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.789
 and if you do it for as little money as possible 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.320
 good android phone this is for sure 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.000
 one of the better choices for the ones too 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.130
 a number of other devices on this 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.509
 area perform well on windows from 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.659
 area of ​​slightly more expensive device 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.799
 Go that the device is the cheapest 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.159
 windows phone is good 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.600
 user experience, and that because it 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.249
 price difference is not very big and it 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.030
 very big difference in specification 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:40.850
 is 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.820
 comes to the samsung ativ s carbon 490 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.399
 euro or moment and before that beatty one 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.249
 very nice screen is 720 p amoled screen 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.299
 a 4.8 inch 8 megapixel camera that 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.909
 just performs well 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.890
 good performance also doubly concrete 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.740
 processor just very good device 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.210
 actually it is surprised if it is that way 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.469
 is cheap but well he is 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.149
 so if you are looking for good ones 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.189
 windows phone for little then is the advice 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.749
 is definitely the best choice in the field of work 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.369
 was best value attitude 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:09.500
 that as far as we are concerned the iphone 5 on the 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.210
 moment iphone 5 is fang by the iphone 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.220
 So 5c will soon too 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.450
 disappear from stores so you have to 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.100
 be quick if you still have it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.840
 where he will get you one 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.610
 device and simply much better 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.720
 then the iphone 5c that put it in place 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.950
 coming 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.560
 specification doesn't really matter 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.600
 except lt lt is on the iphone 5 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.250
 is not available with all providers 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.380
 but one lt band in the Netherlands that 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.700
 supported by the iPhone 5 on 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.520
 the moment it only gets through 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.520
 vodafone is that band already broadcast it 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.050
 kpn will also be added soon 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.940
 therefore you also have less coverage 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.290
 can help one but well it is lt is 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.210
 of course not really happening yet 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.610
 so we are concerned at the moment not 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.020
 bigger problem and you just get it 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.580
 much better built for back before 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.620
 same price as the iphone 5c 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.230
 maybe even a cheaper time 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.140
 iphone 5s is of course better but also 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.170
 a bit more expensive and yes they are already there 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.550
 sometimes the camera sits better 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.740
 of course in that fingerprint scanner 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.280
 the kind us get the extra price if you like 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.810
 am looking for good 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.210
 value for money not worth it 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.230
 so in that regard, the iphone 5 so 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.310
 the best 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.260
 that was another category of the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.880
 November buying guide to where are we 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.540
 of course with a new category 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.540
 the station
