00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
hi this is patrick eaves today we're

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.119 
hi this is patrick eaves today we're
going<00:00:07.299> to<00:00:07.389> talk<00:00:07.540> about<00:00:07.689> how<00:00:08.170> to<00:00:08.230> stand<00:00:08.740> on<00:00:08.980> your

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.129 
going to talk about how to stand on your

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.299 
going to talk about how to stand on your
inline<00:00:09.459> skates<00:00:10.049> now<00:00:11.049> if<00:00:11.349> you<00:00:11.769> have<00:00:11.889> some<00:00:12.099> place

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
inline skates now if you have some place

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.330 
inline skates now if you have some place
where<00:00:12.939> you<00:00:13.180> can<00:00:13.389> sit<00:00:13.750> down<00:00:13.779> in<00:00:14.410> a<00:00:14.500> chair<00:00:14.529> for

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
where you can sit down in a chair for

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.550 
where you can sit down in a chair for
example<00:00:15.430> and<00:00:16.029> put<00:00:16.240> your<00:00:16.330> skates<00:00:16.630> on<00:00:16.930> that's

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
example and put your skates on that's

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.929 
example and put your skates on that's
really<00:00:17.890> best<00:00:18.160> because<00:00:18.430> it's<00:00:18.670> going<00:00:18.760> to<00:00:18.820> be

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
really best because it's going to be

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.060 
really best because it's going to be
easier<00:00:19.420> to<00:00:19.689> get<00:00:20.140> up<00:00:20.260> and<00:00:20.439> stand<00:00:20.710> on<00:00:20.950> your

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
easier to get up and stand on your

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.270 
easier to get up and stand on your
skates<00:00:21.520> while<00:00:22.180> you<00:00:22.300> hold<00:00:22.539> on<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.780> the<00:00:22.869> chair

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.280 
skates while you hold on to the chair

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.040 
skates while you hold on to the chair
but<00:00:24.280> let's<00:00:24.430> say<00:00:24.610> for<00:00:24.640> example<00:00:24.820> you<00:00:25.630> came<00:00:25.869> out

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
but let's say for example you came out

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.220 
but let's say for example you came out
here<00:00:26.320> to<00:00:26.440> the<00:00:26.530> park<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:28.240> put<00:00:28.869> your<00:00:28.990> skates

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
here to the park and you put your skates

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.810 
here to the park and you put your skates
on<00:00:29.500> sitting<00:00:29.890> down<00:00:30.039> and<00:00:30.250> now<00:00:30.369> it's<00:00:30.550> time<00:00:30.789> to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
on sitting down and now it's time to

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.010 
on sitting down and now it's time to
stand<00:00:31.180> up<00:00:31.390> my<00:00:32.289> first<00:00:33.270> piece<00:00:34.270> of<00:00:34.300> advice<00:00:34.510> would

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
stand up my first piece of advice would

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.649 
stand up my first piece of advice would
be<00:00:35.079> put<00:00:36.010> your<00:00:36.219> skates<00:00:36.460> on<00:00:36.699> in<00:00:36.969> a<00:00:37.059> grassy<00:00:37.629> area

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:37.659 
be put your skates on in a grassy area

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.219 
be put your skates on in a grassy area

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
if there's one available for one it's

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:42.869 
if there's one available for one it's
going<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.409> be<00:00:41.469> more<00:00:41.979> comfortable<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.489> sit<00:00:42.699> down

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
going to be more comfortable to sit down

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.549 
going to be more comfortable to sit down

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
nice and tight as that's really

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.259 
nice and tight as that's really
important<00:00:46.829> once<00:00:47.829> you<00:00:47.949> get<00:00:48.159> them<00:00:48.309> on<00:00:48.460> I<00:00:48.729> find

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
important once you get them on I find

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.139 
important once you get them on I find

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
the easiest way to get up is to first go

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.930 
the easiest way to get up is to first go
to<00:00:52.179> your<00:00:52.389> knees<00:00:52.679> then<00:00:53.679> one<00:00:53.949> skate<00:00:54.399> at<00:00:54.549> a<00:00:54.670> time

you keep your knees bent you never stand

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.320 
you keep your knees bent you never stand
just<00:01:10.990> straight<00:01:11.290> up<00:01:11.880> because<00:01:12.880> if<00:01:13.030> there<00:01:13.180> is<00:01:13.300> a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
just straight up because if there is a

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.150 
just straight up because if there is a
hard<00:01:13.600> surface<00:01:13.870> that<00:01:14.260> your<00:01:14.560> skates<00:01:14.920> are<00:01:15.040> going

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
hard surface that your skates are going

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.320 
hard surface that your skates are going
to<00:01:15.220> slip<00:01:15.460> out<00:01:15.640> from<00:01:15.790> under<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.240> you're

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
to slip out from under you and you're

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.820 
to slip out from under you and you're
going<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.480> fall<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.440> nice<00:01:17.590> thing<00:01:17.800> about

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
going to fall so the nice thing about

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.460 
going to fall so the nice thing about
grass<00:01:18.280> is<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:19.600> skates<00:01:19.930> aren't<00:01:20.170> really<00:01:20.350> going

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
grass is your skates aren't really going

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.410 
grass is your skates aren't really going
to<00:01:20.560> roll<00:01:20.740> too<00:01:20.980> much<00:01:21.220> so<00:01:22.030> it's<00:01:22.150> going<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.300> be

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
to roll too much so it's going to be

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.390 
to roll too much so it's going to be
easy<00:01:22.900> for<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.440> get<00:01:23.590> up<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:23.860> stand<00:01:24.160> on<00:01:24.340> your

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
easy for you to get up and stand on your

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.120 
easy for you to get up and stand on your
skates<00:01:24.820> once<00:01:25.780> you're<00:01:25.990> up<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.650> just<00:01:26.800> take<00:01:27.010> your

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
skates once you're up you just take your

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.500 
skates once you're up you just take your
baby<00:01:27.370> steps<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:27.940> you've<00:01:28.120> probably

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
baby steps that you've probably

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.990 
baby steps that you've probably
practiced<00:01:28.960> before<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.590> baby<00:01:30.220> step<00:01:30.580> out<00:01:30.790> to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
practiced before and baby step out to

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.260 
practiced before and baby step out to
your<00:01:31.360> skating<00:01:31.900> surface<00:01:32.350> surface<00:01:32.830> now<00:01:33.820> if<00:01:34.090> you

your skating surface surface now if you

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.940 
your skating surface surface now if you

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.880 
ground I recommend doing it next to a
wall<00:01:43.660> or<00:01:43.900> a<00:01:43.930> fence<00:01:44.170> or<00:01:44.380> something<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.740> can

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
wall or a fence or something you can
