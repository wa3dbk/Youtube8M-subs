00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.620
 Welcome to the car practice of 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.510
 DE we drive today in a seat leon 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.440
 best this is a combo 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.200
 the leon st is actually one 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.500
 sister product to the golf variant is yes 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.520
 a wholly owned daughter of 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.290
 Volkswagen Group 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.119
 the cars will be its Spanish 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.039
 daughter the cars will be there too 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.080
 Built in nature that it is close to 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:39.350
 from barcelona that the seat is a daughter 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.320
 from the house volkswagen you can see the show 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.230
 especially in the interior, it is actually 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 here identical to what else you would expect from 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.900
 recognizes people or partially as it 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.200
 in the audi but are the power of the group 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.150
 very aware that actually the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.710
 Models taken out of the box 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.970
 can be as example to become a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.150
 parts such as Amazon 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.320
 people or steering wheel that lowers the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.930
 costs 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.120
 Unfortunately, this cost reduction comes at vw 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.670
 not so often the ones are 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.740
 cars 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.680
 is very cheap 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.820
 however the s &amp; t we sit here 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.090
 the leon is in comparison to the volkswagen 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.579
 was new 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.869
 The car itself has a diesel engine 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.890
 150 ps 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.500
 the equipment is called fr stands 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.100
 seat for very high quality 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.740
 Equipment of the engine is a real one 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.130
 cream part of which does not work out only reason 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.799
 wonderful wonderful gas has right 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.969
 you want to power with the on the 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.820
 wants to overtake the country road 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.640
 quick and that is very pleasant 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.080
 and makes the car in the seat leon 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.090
 really for a pleasure 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.670
 the meanwhile with Volkswagen and also 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.190
 Of course , that's why it can be very common 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.430
 a lot of things especially when it comes to 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.000
 the Ford dealers or even around 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.180
 information about engine 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.440
 query on the steering wheel but there is 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.230
 small rather small rolls 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.240
 in addition to thanks and the result would be if 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.480
 the touch then shows up in the front 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.920
 dashboard between the two 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.940
 round instruments is a small one 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.920
 digital surface and on the surface 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.410
 then come read either by phone 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.920
 or in which illness is or 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.170
 He shows if you have the phone unit 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.330
 denotes consumption and so on and 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.280
 so on, that's what our topic is 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.000
 technical data can be very easily 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.319
 here on finger play on steering wheel 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.239
 Interrogate 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.200
 The steering wheel is extremely handy 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.569
 looks very elegant with a red 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.540
 nathan leather steering wheel schÃ¶nau four that 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.049
 this little in chrome and carbon part 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.090
 here 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.150
 that evaluates the car just as I said 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.610
 it is a fr it equipment 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.620
 You notice this everywhere as well 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.900
 These chrome applications here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.670
 they are very finely worked and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.620
 that is exactly the keyword that one with 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.220
 vw again before must 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.260
 Processing is simply the best one 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.989
 there in the automotive sector 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.610
 the leon is where we drive here 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.220
 a manual gearbox 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.510
 six-speed transmission that insanely accurate 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.030
 and smooth 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.300
 The car consumes itself very much 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.410
 continues 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.210
 6 liters per 100 kilometers that's for 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.860
 a car 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.410
 150 ps 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.980

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.650

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.580
 who once the spanish marca the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.310
 spanish daughter of vw is known for 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.440
 a very sporty design and for 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.329
 a sporty chassis is the 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.459
 he is the youngest brand in the group waiting 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.660
 on 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.630
 again as a family car 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.310
 a lot of space behind has an easy to 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.700
 easy to load the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.520
 trunk

 even five people can stay in here 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.230
 even sit comfortably 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.760
 so it's good 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.660
 because that mey 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.660
 everything white again
