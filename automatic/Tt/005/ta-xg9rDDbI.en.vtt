00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.379
 hello guys with you jov and this 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.020
 new developer answers and we'll start 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.300
 today as always with interesting news 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.710
 You all probably noticed that patch 1 90 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.810
 dropped your performance 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.900
 computers as very powerful and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.279
 very weak site game gpu produced 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.500
 small performance comparison 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.439
 video cards in patch 0 8 10 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.079
 in the world of tanks and malware than the 2 course for 90 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.360
 patch 090 measure still clearly the bottom of the micro patch 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.860
 and that fixed new bugs and fixed 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.720
 some kind of fps drawdown 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.550
 but the difference is all the same 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.190
 impressive average for all video cards 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.350
 performance loss is 10-20 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.750
 percent but what surprised me personally 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.210
 lost fps not only weak video cards 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.750
 but also the most top solutions such as 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.949
 gifors 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.320
 780 770 760 they all decided at least 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.960
 10-12 percent of the previous value 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.030
 fps here are these guys pies 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.500
 of course it all looks very sad 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.560
 I hope that in the future the developers 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.420
 will do and finish our graphics in 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.490
 the game but will do it some 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.240
 in other ways to fps so much 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.929
 didn't fall 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.330
 well now to the other news 47 07 you 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.990
 says this figure if not i 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.819
 I will explain to you 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.340
 just such an average winning percentage of 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.770
 object 268 on the server among all 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.750
 players according to unofficial statistics this 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.959
 the lowest result among all 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.759
 a dozen yes yes guys and that's true here 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.110
 such information was recently made public 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.720
 one of the VKontakte groups 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.729
 what can i say of course we all know 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.959
 that some tanks imbo you of course we 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.369
 we all know that some tanks are the opposite 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.959
 let's say do so nicked 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.119
 compared to other dozens 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.459
 nines or eights developers 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.349
 all the time persistently looks only at 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.420
 statistics and do not pay attention to 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.940
 real state of affairs and on real 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.009
 player reviews and now guys what is it 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.289
 leads this leads to the fact that one of 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.160
 the strongest Bottas at the tenth level 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.590
 It has 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.300
 due to the large number of not very 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.099
 skillful players the lowest percentage 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.020
 wins and how do you think it is somehow 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.640
 in the future, this 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.680
 patusan led to normal values 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.310
 no, she is so very long imbo you 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.049
 stay 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.390
 and will be the same guys by the way 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.180
 concerns and tank t57 heavy, too, because of 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.859
 that him 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.989
 siri many players who love easy bending 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.269
 stats average server he slipped and 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.069
 he decided not to nerf but at the same time he was like 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.310
 he would have been stronger 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.109
 an expert on the head as he left it, and 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.909
 I think developers need 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.400
 change the nerf policy and start 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.109
 let's say measure imbovo tass tanks already 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.030
 some other tools 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.159
 another interesting case occurred at 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.079
 world of tanks and he was associated with and bonus 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.879
 codes as you know and maybe someone from 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.370
 you and not know some players 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.099
 tried to pick up a bonus code with 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.069
 using some programs these programs 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.760
 tried on 2 to pick up a possible code and 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.260
 based on numbers and letters in previous bonus 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.069
 codes that were distributed there by some 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.620
 magazines 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.079
 were distributed at some events and 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.069
 so on generally one of these players 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.950
 jumped 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.019
 his account was banned, he asked why and 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.519
 Your account has been blocked. 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.950
 due to the fact that you have not been activated 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.599
 bonus code 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.030
 provide checks photos of cats 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.500
 which you activated as well as data 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.480
 which confirm your right to 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.889
 use of these bonus case codes 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.540
 if you can't do it for you 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.290
 will need to pay off debt here 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.900
 these are the guys 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.079
 pies here is such a punishment to get those 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.479
 who's chasing easy prey yes for 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.129
 a freebie trying to fool wargaming and 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.659
 try there some bonus code yourself 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.159
 pick up by us 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.750
 or have some programs 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.609
 automatically who pick these 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.379
 bonus codes or by manually 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.470
 sit and substitutes tsiferki and bukovki 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.479
 so be careful and remember that 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.790
 big brother is always watching you so 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.409
 time people of Europe complain that often 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.810
 go to the historical battles just 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.430
 impossible why yes because just 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.370
 no one wants to play these historical 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.659
 battles especially few people in the ardennes on 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.099
 on your screens now you see 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.199
 indicators screenshots are made when 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.939
 sixty five thousand online on 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.979
 our servers are also on some technology 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.780
 impossible to enter the historical battle 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:13.699
 for example it is very difficult to get into a fight on 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.680
 t-70 what did he say not by the way 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.150
 learn why it happens but 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.989
 it will be fixed at least 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.940
 next patch 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.229
 these are the guys you want 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.330
 have been playing historically but not 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.610
 it turns out we suffer but imagine 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.320
 how Europeans suffer much 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.900
 stronger than us well now go 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.419
 actually to the developers storm response 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.120
 wrote in patch 91 there will be no 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.699
 new 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.840
 de models almost 91 concentrate 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.720
 only on edits 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.729
 and finalized his clarified if in 91 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.710
 there will be no hd models in it 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.960
 it turns out to be fix and rebalance bugs and 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.550
 + The new storm map will be answered 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.340
 new game mode for clans 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.560
 fortifications assault responded that yes even 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.630
 the storm was asked why it was done so badly 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.729
 with sherman why did he ponerfili 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.949
 and why the rate of fire is now in 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.990
 drain tower is better than top 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.720
 because there are rumors that the Sherman seems to be 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.000
 error of the monarchs whether the storm answered no neither 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.310
 by mistake just sherman ponerfili 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.070
 ahead of time and that was a mistake 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.870
 planned to do it in 91 as well 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.150
 you just need a stock tower too panel 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.919
 rate of fire and everything will be ok here 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.630
 here we are guys sad news 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.639
 so I sympathize with all lovers 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.500
 Sherman really asked not to brake 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.530
 plan or reduce report time with 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.539
 30 seconds at least until 10 is planned 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.580
 if there to the rear tower 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.680
 is behind the building and wants to look behind 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.930
 he won't see anyone until the corner 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.370
 stick out the body because of the corner so that 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.520
 seem at least an attachment point 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.820
 guns ca tower storm answered yes exactly 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.190
 so I guys personally find it big 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.020
 error maybe this is a feature of the geshka 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.760
 Our up to the game feature is not yet 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.919
 it turns out to do differently but in reality 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.340
 Actually on many tanks of heat slippers b 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.590
 fv215b is very uncomfortable because you 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.090
 somewhere in the heat of battle you and more often you 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.070
 put on a skating rink and at the same time the enemy is not 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.849
 the light of which you are thrown on the ice rink and 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.560
 you from inviz 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.380
 shoots or kill or anything 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.030
 still generally rapes and you will agree 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.330
 somehow wrong that you just 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.280
 raping rat cheats from inviz if you 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.870
 plan on doing 10 hd models in 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.699
 patches then I understand that 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.710
 alteration of all models may be delayed 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.840
 for three three and a half year storm 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.729
 answered further entering new tanks 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.650
 greatly accelerate now 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.990
 we develop the so-called conveyor 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.419
 will there be a choice between the old 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.490
 avtopritselom and new curtains replied that 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.490
 no what use in battle seen 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.320
 developers bring Chinese straight 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.320
 t-34 3 into the game and is it not knocked out by 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.760
 statistics answered application for pharma 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.830
 silver with tasks 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.140
 Cope and nowhere 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.300
 knocked remind guys that this 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.070
 t-34 3 reception is considered one of the worst 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.290
 straight tanks of our game and he really 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.720
 wretched until the least so says so and 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.940
 for that, I personally do not know much did not ride 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.650
 most likely that is why it sounded 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.270
 this question is just interesting for the players 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.950
 that they paid their money 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.010
 Do you observe an increase in the number 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.340
 art brands 8 10 levels over the last 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.770
 month 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.000
 developers answered no amount 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.430
