00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920 
outside so I always add butter when I'm
doing<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:57.060> gives<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.479> much<00:01:57.720> more

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
doing that just gives it a much more

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.920 
doing that just gives it a much more
stable<00:01:58.729> stronger<00:01:59.729> frosting<00:02:00.330> because<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
stable stronger frosting because on the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.020 
stable stronger frosting because on the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
outside and you won't sink in on itself

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.380 
outside and you won't sink in on itself
and<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.570> lot<00:02:03.690> sturdier<00:02:05.390> gradually

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
usually use a piping bag to do this but

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.880 
usually use a piping bag to do this but
I<00:03:46.450> didn't<00:03:46.660> have<00:03:46.780> any<00:03:46.959> on<00:03:47.080> hands<00:03:47.320> lady<00:03:47.620> and

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
I didn't have any on hands lady and

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.160 
I didn't have any on hands lady and
spatula<00:03:48.430> but<00:03:48.940> you'll<00:03:49.120> see<00:03:49.330> why<00:03:49.570> I<00:03:49.600> prefer<00:03:49.930> the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
spatula but you'll see why I prefer the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.699 
spatula but you'll see why I prefer the
piping<00:03:50.560> bag<00:03:50.740> soon<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:53.200> make<00:03:53.410> sure<00:03:53.560> that's

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
piping bag soon and make sure that's

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.510 
piping bag soon and make sure that's
centered<00:03:54.870> press<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.050> down<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.709> continue<00:03:57.340> with

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
centered press it down and continue with

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.830 
centered press it down and continue with
the<00:03:57.640> other<00:03:57.670> frosting<00:03:58.180> now<00:03:58.300> see<00:03:58.480> as<00:03:58.690> you're

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
the other frosting now see as you're

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.170 
the other frosting now see as you're
working<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.410> that<00:04:00.100> top<00:04:00.400> layer<00:04:00.610> just<00:04:00.880> starts

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
working it that top layer just starts

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.270 
working it that top layer just starts
shifting<00:04:01.480> around<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.200> it<00:04:02.320> kills<00:04:02.620> me<00:04:02.800> that's

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
shifting around and it kills me that's

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.860 
shifting around and it kills me that's
why<00:04:03.430> when<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:03.670> use<00:04:03.850> a<00:04:03.880> piping<00:04:04.360> bag<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.690> won't

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
why when you use a piping bag you won't

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
why when you use a piping bag you won't
have<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.050> problem<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.620> you'll<00:04:05.739> make<00:04:05.860> sure

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
have that problem and you'll make sure

with your bench scraper my problem areas

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.519 
with your bench scraper my problem areas
always<00:05:48.269> tend<00:05:48.479> to<00:05:48.539> be<00:05:48.689> right<00:05:48.929> at<00:05:49.079> the<00:05:49.169> top<00:05:49.349> as

always tend to be right at the top as

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:55.099 
always tend to be right at the top as
well<00:05:49.709> see<00:05:50.869> just<00:05:51.869> cover<00:05:52.139> all<00:05:52.349> that<00:05:52.559> up<00:05:52.799> and<00:05:54.109> go

well see just cover all that up and go

00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:58.309 
well see just cover all that up and go
around<00:05:55.199> it<00:05:55.469> again<00:05:56.269> as<00:05:57.269> you're<00:05:57.479> satisfied<00:05:57.689> with

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
around it again as you're satisfied with

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.219 
around it again as you're satisfied with
how<00:05:59.219> smooth<00:05:59.549> the<00:05:59.789> outside<00:06:00.179> of<00:06:00.329> the<00:06:00.509> cake<00:06:00.719> you

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
how smooth the outside of the cake you

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.439 
how smooth the outside of the cake you
can<00:06:01.439> start<00:06:01.979> removing<00:06:02.219> any<00:06:02.729> excess<00:06:02.939> off<00:06:03.329> the

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
can start removing any excess off the

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.449 
can start removing any excess off the
top<00:06:06.349> and<00:06:07.349> I<00:06:07.439> find<00:06:07.709> that<00:06:07.769> when<00:06:07.919> I<00:06:07.949> do<00:06:08.039> this<00:06:08.249> it

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:08.459 
top and I find that when I do this it

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:11.569 
top and I find that when I do this it
pulls<00:06:08.789> the<00:06:08.999> edges<00:06:09.329> out<00:06:09.509> a<00:06:09.569> little<00:06:09.839> bit<00:06:10.079> so<00:06:10.579> I

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:11.579 
pulls the edges out a little bit so I

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.249 
pulls the edges out a little bit so I
always<00:06:11.909> go<00:06:12.089> around<00:06:12.209> the<00:06:12.449> cake<00:06:12.659> a<00:06:12.809> second<00:06:13.079> time

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
always go around the cake a second time

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.989 
always go around the cake a second time
just<00:06:13.289> to<00:06:13.589> make<00:06:13.709> sure<00:06:13.919> that<00:06:14.189> lip<00:06:14.489> is<00:06:14.729> raised

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:14.999 
just to make sure that lip is raised

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.389 
just to make sure that lip is raised
again<00:06:15.389> and<00:06:15.869> then<00:06:16.379> just<00:06:16.469> continue<00:06:16.769> to<00:06:17.099> remove

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:17.399 
again and then just continue to remove

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:21.619 
again and then just continue to remove
