00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
today I want to cover the general safe

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.130 
today I want to cover the general safe
rule<00:00:16.460> for<00:00:16.699> flying<00:00:16.939> your<00:00:17.150> helicopter<00:00:17.750> approach

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
your airspeed until your rate of descent

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.440 
your airspeed until your rate of descent
is<00:00:32.780> below<00:00:33.320> 300<00:00:34.310> feet<00:00:34.490> per<00:00:34.520> minute<00:00:34.820> if<00:00:35.270> you

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
is below 300 feet per minute if you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.540 
is below 300 feet per minute if you
follow<00:00:35.690> this<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:36.410> will<00:00:36.740> not<00:00:37.040> get<00:00:37.400> into

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
follow this you will not get into

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.250 
follow this you will not get into
selling<00:00:37.880> with<00:00:38.000> power<00:00:38.240> it<00:00:38.570> just<00:00:38.780> plain<00:00:39.020> won't

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
selling with power it just plain won't

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.990 
selling with power it just plain won't
happen<00:00:39.470> if<00:00:39.860> you<00:00:40.070> have<00:00:40.220> all<00:00:40.460> three<00:00:40.700> of<00:00:40.790> these

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
happen if you have all three of these

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.480 
happen if you have all three of these
flight<00:00:41.330> situations<00:00:41.930> together<00:00:42.100> this<00:00:43.100> can

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
flight situations together this can

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.580 
flight situations together this can
cause<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.660> to<00:00:44.750> get<00:00:44.840> into<00:00:44.990> selling<00:00:45.290> with<00:00:45.380> power

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
cause you to get into selling with power

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.590 
cause you to get into selling with power
take<00:00:46.070> away<00:00:46.310> any<00:00:46.520> one<00:00:46.730> of<00:00:46.760> those<00:00:46.970> three<00:00:47.450> and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
take away any one of those three and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.120 
take away any one of those three and
you're<00:00:48.530> not<00:00:48.740> in<00:00:48.860> it

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
you're not in it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.440 
you're not in it
so<00:00:49.280> let's<00:00:49.430> break<00:00:49.580> these<00:00:49.790> three<00:00:50.000> down<00:00:50.150> just<00:00:50.390> a

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
so let's break these three down just a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.390 
so let's break these three down just a
little<00:00:50.480> bit<00:00:50.660> ready<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.530> sent<00:00:51.800> 300<00:00:52.220> feet<00:00:52.370> per

little bit ready to sent 300 feet per

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.750 
little bit ready to sent 300 feet per
minute<00:00:52.610> or<00:00:52.820> greater<00:00:53.090> if<00:00:53.630> you<00:00:54.050> are<00:00:54.260> at<00:00:54.530> 300<00:00:55.340> or

100 percent of available power meaning

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.410 
100 percent of available power meaning

occurs somewhere between 16 to 24 knots

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.970 
occurs somewhere between 16 to 24 knots
so<00:01:16.070> if<00:01:16.159> you're<00:01:16.310> at<00:01:16.430> 30<00:01:16.760> or<00:01:16.880> above<00:01:17.500> again<00:01:18.500> you're

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
so if you're at 30 or above again you're

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.770 
so if you're at 30 or above again you're
not<00:01:19.220> in<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:19.460> zone<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.270> there<00:01:20.420> is<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> little

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
not in that zone so there is a little

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.350 
not in that zone so there is a little
bit<00:01:20.930> of<00:01:21.080> fudge<00:01:21.530> factor<00:01:21.980> figured<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:22.430> there<00:01:22.640> but

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
bit of fudge factor figured in there but

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.720 
bit of fudge factor figured in there but
that's<00:01:23.510> to<00:01:23.720> keep<00:01:23.900> you<00:01:24.050> safe<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.100> remember<00:01:25.550> if

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
that's to keep you safe so remember if

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.280 
that's to keep you safe so remember if
you<00:01:25.850> always<00:01:25.970> keep<00:01:26.180> 30<00:01:26.540> on<00:01:26.720> your<00:01:26.840> airspeed

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
you always keep 30 on your airspeed

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.410 
you always keep 30 on your airspeed
until<00:01:28.010> you're<00:01:28.130> ready<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.400> sentence<00:01:28.790> below<00:01:28.940> 300

until you're ready to sentence below 300
feet<00:01:29.540> per<00:01:29.570> minute<00:01:30.050> you<00:01:30.620> will<00:01:30.860> not<00:01:31.130> get<00:01:31.670> into

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
feet per minute you will not get into

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.670 
feet per minute you will not get into
selling<00:01:32.180> with<00:01:32.270> power<00:01:32.479> hey<00:01:33.080> don't<00:01:33.440> go<00:01:33.530> away

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680
