t12 and it won't be out this month so

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.550 
t12 and it won't be out this month so
obviously<00:03:07.080> no<00:03:07.350> June<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.970> leads<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.900> probably

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
obviously no June that leads to probably

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.220 
obviously no June that leads to probably
July<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.459> know<00:03:11.580> midway<00:03:11.970> through<00:03:12.239> July<00:03:12.600> you

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
July you know midway through July you

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.780 
July you know midway through July you
know<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.500> could<00:03:13.650> even<00:03:13.830> possibly<00:03:14.069> come<00:03:14.549> out<00:03:14.670> on

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790

know it could even possibly come out on
july<00:03:15.030> 4th<00:03:15.329> maybe<00:03:15.570> they<00:03:15.720> sort<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.110> do<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.739> sent

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
july 4th maybe they sort of do that sent
