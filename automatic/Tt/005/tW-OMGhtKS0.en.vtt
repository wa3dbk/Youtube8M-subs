00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.580 
want to cover it up right away with the
mulch<00:01:58.250> because<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:01.079> want<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> give<00:02:01.439> your

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
mulch because you want to give your

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
mulch because you want to give your
plant<00:02:01.920> time<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.460> come<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.060> sprout<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
plant time to come out and sprout and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.899 
plant time to come out and sprout and
then<00:02:04.290> once<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.770> comes<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:05.159> high<00:02:05.340> enough<00:02:05.610> thing

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
then once it comes up high enough thing

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.330 
then once it comes up high enough thing
you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.180> mulch<00:02:06.360> back<00:02:06.600> around<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:08.160> you're

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you can mulch back around it and you're

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.809 
you can mulch back around it and you're
good<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.610> go

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
good to go

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.880 
good to go
the<00:02:09.450> mulch<00:02:09.660> will<00:02:09.840> actually<00:02:10.200> hold<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the mulch will actually hold the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.040 
the mulch will actually hold the
moisture<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.520> all<00:02:11.610> this

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
moisture and all this

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.750 
moisture and all this
now<00:02:12.440> if<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.560> could<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:12.830> keep<00:02:13.010> my<00:02:13.190> chickens<00:02:13.610> out

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
now if I could just keep my chickens out

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.230 
now if I could just keep my chickens out
of<00:02:13.790> here<00:02:14.410> I'll<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:15.680> styling<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.460> let's<00:02:17.090> see

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
of here I'll be styling so let's see

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.070 
of here I'll be styling so let's see
what<00:02:17.390> happens

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
what happens

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.510 
what happens
I<00:02:18.110> think<00:02:18.620> I'm<00:02:18.710> planting<00:02:18.950> them<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.160> little<00:02:19.370> late

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
I think I'm planting them a little late

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.140 
I think I'm planting them a little late
in<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.700> season<00:02:19.940> but<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:20.900> been<00:02:21.080> hot<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.150> I'm

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150
