00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.210
 I do not know 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.010
 look what i know 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.140
 hello to everyone here again start news.it e 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.200
 we are pleased to offer you ours 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.710
 one piece kaizoku video review 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.450
 mutu 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.460
 we have already written the review 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.010
 we therefore wanted to do the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.989
 videorecensione to offer all 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.760
 fan a bit of gameplay video 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.489
 some technical details the title is 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.980
 developed by the omega force published 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.809
 from namco bandai games came out in 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.480
 Japan on March 1st and is 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.980
 an exclusivity regarding the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.230
 japan playstation 3 is going a lot 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.480
 good at the level of sales so that one is 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.200
 also imposed on other titles much more 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.490
 emblazoned once the game is launched 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.310
 the only way we have a 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.650
 then unlocked is the mail 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.120
 log where we will be catapulted two years 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.420
 after workouts that each member 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.490
 of the f4 crew away from the companions e 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.380
 in the classic exploratory tutorial there 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.880
 basic checks will be explained in 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.600
 a fight against the group of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.700
 marina and pacifists we will notice 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.410
 immediately of the greatest depth of combos 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.390
 of which one piece was adopted 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.270
 unlike other episodes already seen 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.720
 of the dynasty warriors series or titles 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.370
 similar what we will find what 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.140
 we will be in front of it is not in fact the 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.030
 usual system based only on how many 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.270
 sometimes you press squares and triangle for 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.160
 close the combos but it's a system 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.010
 a bit more complex that also introduces 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.130
 the r1 and r2 keys with some unique moves 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.960
 and different from character character 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.490
 thus reinventing the basic system of 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.170
 unique skills now line me up 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.120
 square and triangle to have many more 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.730
 variants of moves 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.030
 each character will have two final moves e 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.769
 rufy even dinners with four and in 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.239
 based on the duration of the pressure of the 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.190
 circle button 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.250
 if we have two bars of 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.940
 energy we can launch the move of 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.440
 second level 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.569
 another particularity introduced e 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.370
 exploring maps in 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.370
 main story mode we will find ourselves 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.830
 often in front of platform section e 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.280
 topped off with pleasant mini pitch times 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.170
 event the jorge mail will travel 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.530
 through all the most important stages 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.270
 of the series designed by ciro da che 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.980
 we could revisit using the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.440
 other characters within another 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.030
 mode we are talking about another 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.140
 log in which it will also be possible 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.550
 play in two players 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.420
 missions will be divided by 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.860
 typology 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.959
 after the tutorial will indeed be 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.459
 present scenarios divided by gender nor 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.500
 mutu action or stall the action as maps 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.819
 already anticipated they will see us solve 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.670
 some enigma and more generally 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.500
 move here and there with Russian missions 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.420
 mousse will repeat the classic ones 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.550
 mechanical of the series while the bags 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.990
 they will last little more than they will foresee 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.240
 together with the defeat of one of the 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.950
 our greatest antagonists 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.230
 once the best is over we will have access 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.910
 also the challenge mode that you like 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.010
 can guess from the name we will put of 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.690
 face some challenges even enough 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.520
 difficult compared to the rest of the game 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.950
 in which we can choose retreats 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.080
 which we prefer 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.670
 in this mode or the challenge 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.110
 we will also find those missions that 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.950
 will be downloadable from the playstation 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.720
 store as additional content 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.720
 let's see now the system of 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.190
 leveling and strengthening by completing 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.230
 missions we will always acquire a 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.720
 quantity of expo in relation to 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.860
 our vote then taking advantage of a bonus a 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.890
 depending on how we behaved 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.840
 in the map regarding the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.489
 strengthening this will happen through 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.830
 some coins that we will get at the end 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.230
 mission in a system similar to dynasty 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.319
 warriors gundam in which they could 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.190
 keep the spirits open and beat us and 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.030
 replace them from time to time with 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.739
 better objects, skills instead 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.900
 will always get through the coins 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.910
 we should combine 3 of them trying to 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.259
 match characters and objects they have 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.259
 between them in a relationship 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.280
 as for multiplayer 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.110
 we will be able to travel between the maps of the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.720
 another love mode that together with a 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.220
 other online player 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.590
 unfortunately, little is left of the variety of 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.389
 this sector but fortunately it is not 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.770
 not even present the devastating lag that 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.180
 of hera with dynasty warriors gundam 3 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.280
 every time you complete a mission with 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.490
 another user will get a coin with 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.740
 his username and if it happens he will 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.750
 play with that user again 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.910
 his coin will level up and will be 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.910
 can be strengthened and vice versa 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.930
 graphically the title is attested on 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.630
 classic levels of the dynasty series 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.340
 warriors we will find characters very well 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.680
 characterized and from the center 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.260
 of attention the enemies are a little less 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.120
 treated like the backgrounds in the background 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.000
 as indeed the sagacia unfortunately 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.550
 accustomed regarding the 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.130
 longevity one piece kaizoku mursu yes 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.200
 certifies on good levels and if you want 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.280
 getting the coveted platinum will cost you 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.080
 several hours of play is to be expected 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.970
 a lance in favor of the videos that they are 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.590
 really well made and damage 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.450
 the impression that maybe it could be done 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.419
 even more for scenarios and enemies 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.190
 the sound sector as always very much 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.470
 edited in the titles inspired by 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:52.419
 a soul and also here namco bandai games 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.580
 already supplied the original voice actors one 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.500
 piece kaizoku musso is a title 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.450
 really well done the compliments 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.880
 that must be paid to the work of 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.070
 omega force are so many a cold up 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.740
 all is the great loyalty to the manga of the 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.720
 maestro or from the renowned formula of the 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.510
 Dynasty Warriors series was a lot 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.400
 enhanced the ruby skills were 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.270
 exploited to create mini sequences of 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.610
 I start exploring and platforming 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.860
 the gameplay is well studied the kids of 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.960
 omega force have created different skills 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.000
 unique for each of the 13 characters 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.280
 playable characterizing perfectly 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.720
 all pirates including so many 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.210
 opponents we will meet but who 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.850
 unfortunately we will not be able to control 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.740
 namco bandai continues to support well 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.500
 the title that has already been issued since its release 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.180
 collected 3 to don or in one 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.400
 week the add ons 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.490
 they are composed of a special mission 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.530
 and a costume of costumes will be 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.930
 available in all mode another 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.630
 love and while the missions we will find them again 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.639
 in challenge mode 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.710
 in conclusion adding all these 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.660
 positive aspects, struggling to 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.310
 find negative ones one piece yes 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.979
 demonstrates an enjoyable experience for 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.020
 all this title could be 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.120
 easily underestimated mix at 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.099
 unanimous perfection and a style of play 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.320
 much loved 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:14.690
 the only criticism if by force we must 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.789
 find one resides in the few 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.380
 playable characters and in many episodes 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:21.620
 of the story that might have been 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.530
 important not to jump as a final grade 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:28.280
 and we gave him an 8.3 then the 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:30.229
 titolo is super promoted gamestar news vi 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.210
 greet with this is all we invite you to 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.849

 news also a little niche of 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.970
 Japanese productions that hardly 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.800
 they are on the net thanks to the contribution 

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:46.479
 of tia and leo
