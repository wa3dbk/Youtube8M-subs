00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
quite some time but it still seems

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
quite some time but it still seems

little<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:16.830> time<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.689> make<00:01:18.689> sure<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> game

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
little more time to make sure the game

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.100 
little more time to make sure the game
as<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.560> good<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:19.890> possible<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.840> as<00:01:21.840> I've<00:01:21.990> said

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
