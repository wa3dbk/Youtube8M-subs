guess<00:00:28.019> whether<00:00:28.880> my<00:00:29.880> approach<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.480> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
guess whether my approach for this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.830 
guess whether my approach for this
series<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:32.160> not<00:00:33.059> breaking<00:00:33.690> any

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
series is going to be not breaking any

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.470 
series is going to be not breaking any
rules<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:35.130> I'm<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.640> push<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
rules but I'm going to push the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.549 
rules but I'm going to push the
boundaries<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.070> limit<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.960> do

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
boundaries to the limit of what I can do

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.650 
boundaries to the limit of what I can do
