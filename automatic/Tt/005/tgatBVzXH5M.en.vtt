00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:36.679 
my demonstration over here I'm going to

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.799 
my demonstration over here I'm going to
close<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:36.979> door<00:00:37.159> my<00:00:37.339> CDs<00:00:37.670> in<00:00:37.850> there<00:00:38.120> that's

close the door my CDs in there that's

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.169 
close the door my CDs in there that's
the<00:00:38.989> button<00:00:39.550> it's<00:00:40.550> not<00:00:40.729> gonna<00:00:40.879> work<00:00:41.120> because

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:41.179 
the button it's not gonna work because

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.379 
the button it's not gonna work because
obviously<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:42.559> DPC<00:00:43.129> this<00:00:43.550> PC<00:00:43.850> is<00:00:43.940> not<00:00:43.999> plugged

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:44.389 
obviously the DPC this PC is not plugged

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:47.979 
obviously the DPC this PC is not plugged
to<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:44.899> power<00:00:45.109> so<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.159> only<00:00:46.370> way<00:00:46.729> to<00:00:47.510> open<00:00:47.870> it
