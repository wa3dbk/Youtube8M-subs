and I just thought it really felt like a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
and I just thought it really felt like a
city<00:01:00.870> as<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> few<00:01:01.859> blacksmiths

there and archery ranges as well and it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.730 
there and archery ranges as well and it
really<00:01:05.640> did<00:01:05.820> feel<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.270> City<00:01:06.600> ish<00:01:06.840> although<00:01:07.530> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
really did feel very City ish although I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.060 
really did feel very City ish although I
did<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.570> quite<00:01:09.570> well<00:01:09.979> quite<00:01:10.979> well
