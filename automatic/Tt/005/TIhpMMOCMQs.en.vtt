00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660
 sitting here I thought 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.290
 that fascism is so 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.299
 so bravo to say it somehow 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.610
 that I had time that did not scream 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.240
 family today proudly here for 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.240
 you say 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.530
 this morning 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.200
 my son guyton alexander 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.980
 of two years and a bath two years and a 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.980
 month two years 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.500
 he told me he wanted to go out 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.360
 my wife and my person 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.830
 since I committed myself to this process 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.110
 we have not been able to go outside 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.570
 to have a normal life 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.280
 my son can not take him to park 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.280
 later, I could no longer a shopping center 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.920
 we have been constantly besieged and 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.190
 now I thought that quietly while 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.540
 drank the trees heard the song 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.070
 I saw the tree and remembered the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.470
 trees that have cut and said that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.710
 scream on those trees that have cut 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.020
 so many years to grow beautiful pretty 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.170
 and these people come in a second and the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.270
 cut the cuts 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.700
 and I thought 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.560
 if it were my turn to make the decision again 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.020
 to take a step forward for the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.149
 revolution with everything that has touched me 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.340
 live in this year where I felt it was 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.590
 inevitable to take that step forward if 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.719
 would do again for everything that has 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.670
 touched live for what he has touched 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.880
 to live my family and tell them everything 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.219
 heart would take it one step further 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.350
 front for the Bolivarian revolution for 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.400
 Commander Chávez and the President 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.820
 nicolás mature 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.340

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.829

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.189
 impotent in certain situations 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.530
 imagine yourself mature nicholas president who 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.239
 I do not see smile at all 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.560
 vicissitudes and before all 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.620
 difficulties in the face of a coup d'état 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.510
 and there it is 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.480

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.880
 remove the artists the cultores 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.560
 intellectuals all committed to 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.640
 this wonderful country with venezuela not 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.940

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.830

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.980
 Alexander the classmates said it 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.890
 that we extend our hands to everyone 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.270
 those artists who think differently 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.250
 but what is the reality that nobody is 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.930
 dare to say the great reality is that 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.880
 many of those artists do not dare to 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.270
 dialogue with us because they fear 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.580
 lose their jobs 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.100
 as it happened to me and it has happened to 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.200
 many who take a step forward with 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.900
 the revolution touches us the retaliation 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.050
 politics touches us that we can not have 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.600
 a normal life and it's not a lie and not in 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.980
 game to my house they went to tell him that 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.320
 they were going to burn the street that I was going to 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.690
 program program is all there without 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.640
 But people believe that those who 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.850
 mock believe that it is that one is afraid 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.940
 no gentlemen it is not fear but we love 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.360

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.180
 violence can not be negotiated with the 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.340

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.770
 sectarianism 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.770

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.010
