00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello very good to all here little hands and 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.140
 welcome to another video more for the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.220
 channel we are in another Fallout 4 video 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.170
 and this time I will comment on 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.320
 impressions I've had from the gamescom 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.570
 2015 what has been seen and also give a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.100
 little my opinion about it too 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.230
 comment a bit on the opinion of some 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.660
 means and from some people that in this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 case contrasts a bit with what I 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.250
 I think but well let's go there what's shown 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.930
 here in the gamescom or has been quite 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.490
 more concise than what it was in the e3 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.009
 also to say that the e3 was the boom 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.359
 and it has shown mainly the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.130
 combat has also shown a 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.710
 little customization of weapons 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.870
 and that the pivot therefore charges more 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.480
 importance that never or at least 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.030
 regarding the phallus 3 and the new vegas phallus and 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.480
 that's good but the controversy has come 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.600
 from the gameplay of the gameplay 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.370
 regarding phallus as a shooter, not because 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.870
 well what has been shown has been that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.820
 an urban area is worth having already been 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.430
 seen before I'll leave some images 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.710
 and clips that although they are not of that same 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.170
 presentation of the gamescom represent 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.510
 pretty good what I want to say and what 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.000
 principal is that almost all the time 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.860
 what was happening in the area the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.510
 days without using the glass what used it 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.790
 even more than once 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.120
 used but above all passing it 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.100
 as if it were a shooter and this has been 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.110
 made on purpose to show that they have 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.200
 improved gameplay in fallout 4 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.150
 but this has not caught all well 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
 all the people or all the fans and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.310
 some media have pointed out that this 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.610
 It can be worrisome for those who 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.260
 be very dieout fans of the fallout or 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.120
 for those new ones where 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.850
 watch that video and tell these others 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.740
 shooter more and it's not like that either but I 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.240
 here I want to say a little why I 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.700
 it seems that what they have done is well done 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.410
 wanted to show respect to the opinion of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 other people and I'm going to get some 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.110
 past examples such as phallus 3 and phallus 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.610
 new vegas for the three and falo new vegas 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.170
 I played it in console I also have them 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 in pc but mostly in console they had 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.760
 a very rough gameplay very very rough 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.440
 and then at the beginning of the game 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.390
 we always start with very weapons 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.890
 deteriorated weapons in which it failed 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.080
 a lot at the time of shooting because 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.280
 you had little skill in weapons and 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.260
 also jammed bam and so on 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.200
 then they were quite annoying 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.689
 now if the weapons let's say shooter roll 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.959
 but then there was the bat the bat that is 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:24.569
 something characteristic of fallout about 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.040
 all of the 3 and the new vegas as the base 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.930
 what it did to you was to facilitate 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.400
 defeat the enemies do not sign up to 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.430
 his head was flying his head pointed 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.620
 the leg to fly the leg then it was 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.000
 a great help that in my opinion on phallus 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.379
 309 gas about too much use comes a 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.879
 point where I fellout 3 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.200
 happened to shoot especially at 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.170
 start of the game pointed to the head 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.480
 of the enemies hit shot if any 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.609
 would give in the head and especially the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.019
 kill and as well as the action points 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.670
 which are what was used to use 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.310
 the bat regenerates very fast 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.470
 it was just an inconvenience you went back to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.299
 wait for your moment and you used again 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.220
 the bat in favor do not tell me too 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.810
 I used although my opinion was improved 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.670
 poquillo would play fallon and vegas but 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.459
 still, it was too important to me 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.470
 opinion the bach and here seems to be that 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.530
 been relegated to the background but 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.200
 eye not so much to say well hey no longer 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.990
 will use more the bat but to subtract the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.600
 use not frequency of use 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.150
 of the pothole to give it a greater 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.100
 importance at certain times by 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.080
 example here has shown a little that 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.140
 the pothole will be used mostly 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.700
 to kill a specific enemy 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.920
 in an ambush the enemy more 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.200
 dangerous to take down a very enemy 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.690
 hard to disarm an enemy to 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.790
 burst a particular part that is 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.780
 the weak point of that enemy the bats 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.370
 it seems that he has charged more 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.290
 importance in that aspect 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.850
 use it less but use it in 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.410
 moments that are necessary or at least 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.410
 the impression he has given me and that to me 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.080
 I like it seems to me that it is a better use and 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.360
 that will make people hear us we 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.670
 let's get better at the time of shooting 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.050
 and such and use the bat when necessary 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.430
 It also has to be said that 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.440
 demonstrated that the gameplay has 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.450
 improved and that's a very good thing that I 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.150
 I think especially fallout 3 and new 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.140
 Vegas in console I needed it and then 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.970
 I'm going to show a little bit of the version 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.920
 of personalization of weapons we have 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.990
 I was a little bit of the gib I'm going but good 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.850
 hence I will not comment much on 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.350
 the whole combat theme some 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.940
 people that is not good in my opinion 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.410
 yes it is as if it had a gameplay 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.340
 call of duty to me I would not be any 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.680
 problem while maintaining the appearance 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.480
 that the enemies have the same life that 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.669
 I do x damage that damages me 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.320
 depending on the weapons you have 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.210
 etcetera is a fallout and I think that 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.160
 keeps on staying and I have no reason 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.050
 for which to distrust that they are going to 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.000
 keep that essence improving the 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.680
 gameplay and little more than saying people 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.180
 that was everything I would like you to leave 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.160
 your opinion in the comments if you 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.340
 it looks good so suffers bad I like it more 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.600
 the old roll or the roll that goes to 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.280
 have failed or 4 or if you like more the 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.139
 roll Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 which 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.210
 you want and nothing else I hope that I have 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.860
 liked and subscribe to the channel if not 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.010
 you are subscribed a greeting and even the 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.010
 next
