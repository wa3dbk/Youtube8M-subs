00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
through tough in the beginning and then

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.519 
through tough in the beginning and then
all<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.119> sudden<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.779> break<00:00:31.320> you're

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
all of a sudden you get the break you're

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
all of a sudden you get the break you're
looking<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.399> things<00:00:33.210> change

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
looking for and things change

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.000 
looking for and things change
dramatically<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:34.860> bit

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
dramatically and that was a little bit

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.650 
dramatically and that was a little bit
how<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.370> today<00:00:35.610> same<00:00:36.120> thing<00:00:36.329> happened

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
how it was today same thing happened

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.780 
how it was today same thing happened
last<00:00:37.200> year<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.530> against<00:00:38.010> Del<00:00:38.129> Potro<00:00:38.489> actually

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
last year was against Del Potro actually

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
last year was against Del Potro actually
so<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.600> nice<00:00:39.870> obviously<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.500> through<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
so it's nice obviously going through a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
so it's nice obviously going through a
match<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.820> obviously<00:00:42.570> already

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
match like this but I obviously already

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.630 
match like this but I obviously already
know<00:00:43.290> now<00:00:43.320> right<00:00:43.500> after<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> match<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> next

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
know now right after the match the next

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.860 
know now right after the match the next
match<00:00:44.820> I'll<00:00:45.000> play<00:00:45.149> against<00:00:45.420> him<00:00:45.600> won't<00:00:45.719> be

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
match I'll play against him won't be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.200 
match I'll play against him won't be
this<00:00:45.989> way<00:00:46.200> well<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:46.980> Jo<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.700> was<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> little

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
this way well I think Jo it was a little

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.970 
this way well I think Jo it was a little
tired<00:00:48.510> clearly<00:00:49.170> had<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> couple<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.800> tough

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
tired clearly had a couple of tough

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.340 
tired clearly had a couple of tough
matches<00:00:50.460> coming<00:00:50.670> into<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.110> think

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
matches coming into this one and I think

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.750 
matches coming into this one and I think
that<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> something<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.610> were

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
that was that something that you were

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.670 
that was that something that you were
keyed<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.510> top<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.020> him<00:00:55.140> early<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
keyed on get on top of him early and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.959 
keyed on get on top of him early and
just<00:00:55.800> try<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.100> make<00:00:56.219> him<00:00:56.399> feel<00:00:56.610> even<00:00:56.940> more

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
just try and make him feel even more

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.060 
just try and make him feel even more
fatigued<00:00:57.420> well<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.530> against<00:00:58.920> top

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
fatigued well I just think against top

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.849 
fatigued well I just think against top
players<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.480> always<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> huge<00:01:00.930> bonus

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
players it's a it's always a huge bonus

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.439 
players it's a it's always a huge bonus
if<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.250> win<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.460> first<00:01:02.730> set<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.329> know

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
if you can win the first set you know

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
if you can win the first set you know
because<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:04.049> after<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:05.010> always<00:01:05.129> gets

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
because then after that it always gets

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.710 
because then after that it always gets
more<00:01:05.519> difficult<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.180> once<00:01:06.420> you're<00:01:06.570> down

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
more difficult you know once you're down

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
more difficult you know once you're down
but<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.560> actually<00:01:07.920> thought<00:01:08.189> he<00:01:08.790> did<00:01:08.970> really

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
but I actually thought he did really

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
but I actually thought he did really
well<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.450> those<00:01:09.659> five<00:01:10.200> set<00:01:10.439> matches<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
well in those five set matches and I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.010 
well in those five set matches and I
expected<00:01:11.520> him<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.700> come<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.450> be

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
expected him to come out here and be

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.840 
expected him to come out here and be
really<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.500> athletic<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> way<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.670> him

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
really like athletic the way we know him

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.070 
really like athletic the way we know him
you<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> think<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.509> beginning<00:01:15.780> was<00:01:15.900> tough

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you know I think the beginning was tough

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.859 
you know I think the beginning was tough
I<00:01:16.229> thought<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.530> very<00:01:16.710> intense<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.869> you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
I thought it was very intense and you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.210 
I thought it was very intense and you
know<00:01:18.960> maybe<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.470> him<00:01:19.619> he<00:01:19.710> maybe<00:01:19.890> was

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
know maybe just for him he maybe was

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.620 
know maybe just for him he maybe was
mentally<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.759> fatigued<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.270> maybe

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
mentally more fatigued and maybe

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.450 
mentally more fatigued and maybe
physically<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> thought<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.250> showed

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
physically I thought and that showed

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.350 
physically I thought and that showed
maybe<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.790> bit<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> end<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.299> was

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
maybe a bit at the end it was

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
maybe a bit at the end it was
unfortunate<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:24.869> him<00:01:25.049> well<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.799> talked<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> lot

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
unfortunate for him well we talked a lot

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
unfortunate for him well we talked a lot
about<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.820> game<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.270> talked<00:01:27.479> about<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:28.020> your

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
shots and your experience one thing that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.600
