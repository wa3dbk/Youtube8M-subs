emergencies they mean that the computer

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.970 
emergencies they mean that the computer
on<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:40.980> engine<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:42.200> sensing<00:00:43.200> something<00:00:43.590> isn't

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
on the engine is sensing something isn't

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.850 
on the engine is sensing something isn't
quite<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.489> or<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.820> sensor<00:00:45.629> went<00:00:45.840> bad<00:00:46.079> well

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
quite right or a sensor went bad well

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
quite right or a sensor went bad well
most<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> sensors<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.059> engine<00:00:48.480> have

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
most of the sensors on your engine have

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.299 
most of the sensors on your engine have
to<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:48.989> emissions<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.710> stuff<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.070> that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to do with emissions and stuff like that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.090 
to do with emissions and stuff like that
so<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> affect<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.829> fuel

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
so it's just going to affect your fuel

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.889 
so it's just going to affect your fuel
economy<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.699> your<00:00:53.820> emissions<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.690> hurt

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
economy and your emissions but not hurt

your<00:00:55.110> motor<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:56.010> y'all<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.579> does<00:00:56.850> come<00:00:57.120> on

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
your motor if y'all like does come on

everything looks fine well you've got a
long<00:01:13.560> time<00:01:13.830> maybe<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.760> still<00:01:14.939> drive<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
long time maybe you can still drive it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.609 
long time maybe you can still drive it
around<00:01:15.450> before<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.080> might<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> get

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
around before you might want to get

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
around before you might want to get
someone<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.159> run<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.580> through<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.820> Diagnostics

if you've got a vehicle newer than 1996

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.719 
if you've got a vehicle newer than 1996
it<00:01:23.009> likely<00:01:23.280> has<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.880> obd2<00:01:25.340> code<00:01:26.340> reading

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it likely has the obd2 code reading

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.480 
it likely has the obd2 code reading
system<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.360> well<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.159> not<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
system in it well this is not like the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.830 
system in it well this is not like the
older<00:01:29.790> cars<00:01:29.970> when<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> could<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
older cars when you could just get a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.890 
older cars when you could just get a
book<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> turn<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> key<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.250> three<00:01:32.700> times<00:01:32.970> or

book and turn the key on three times or

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.890 
book and turn the key on three times or
jump<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> wire<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.460> much<00:01:36.000> simpler<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
jump a wire but it is much simpler and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.749 
jump a wire but it is much simpler and
nicer<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.530> use<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.640> these

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
nicer to use if you have one of these

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.889

there's<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.229> GM<00:01:46.590> style<00:01:46.979> where<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.310> find<00:01:47.700> this

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
there's the GM style where you find this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.600 
there's the GM style where you find this
little<00:01:48.060> clip<00:01:48.450> under<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> hood<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.310> those<00:01:50.310> two

you wait for this machine to read your

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.260 
you wait for this machine to read your
codes<00:02:43.319> then<00:02:43.980> it'll<00:02:44.190> tell<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.520> what's<00:02:44.760> wrong

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
codes then it'll tell you what's wrong

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.150 
codes then it'll tell you what's wrong
and<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:45.959> you've<00:02:46.110> repaired<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.680> problem<00:02:47.040> or

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and if you've repaired the problem or

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.150 
and if you've repaired the problem or
change<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.520> sensor<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:49.110> can<00:02:49.140> clear<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.920> code

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
change the sensor you can clear the code

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.479 
change the sensor you can clear the code
too<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.080> one<00:02:52.320> says<00:02:52.560> there's<00:02:52.769> no<00:02:52.980> codes

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
too so this one says there's no codes

driving<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.670> next<00:03:47.970> thing<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.299> check<00:03:48.510> which

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
driving the next thing you check which

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.270 
driving the next thing you check which
is<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.440> easiest<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:50.100> vacuum<00:03:50.579> hoses<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:52.280> just

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
is the easiest is vacuum hoses you just

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280 
is the easiest is vacuum hoses you just
start<00:03:53.519> wiggling<00:03:54.030> them<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.450> looking<00:03:55.019> for

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
start wiggling them and looking for

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.400 
start wiggling them and looking for
cracks<00:03:55.739> forming<00:03:56.250> stuff<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.480> sometimes

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
cracks forming stuff like that sometimes

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.470 
cracks forming stuff like that sometimes
you<00:03:58.530> can't<00:03:58.739> find<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.190> other<00:03:59.340> end<00:03:59.430> so<00:04:00.180> then<00:04:00.329> you

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
you can't find the other end so then you

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.420 
you can't find the other end so then you
pinch<00:04:00.930> them<00:04:01.170> with<00:04:01.320> needlenose<00:04:01.620> vice<00:04:01.980> grips<00:04:02.280> or

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
pinch them with needlenose vice grips or

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.020 
pinch them with needlenose vice grips or
pliers<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.180> see<00:04:03.630> if<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.840> makes<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.230> run<00:04:04.410> better

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
pliers and see if it makes it run better

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.180 
pliers and see if it makes it run better
sometimes<00:04:06.230> even<00:04:07.230> your<00:04:07.380> big<00:04:07.590> brake<00:04:07.950> booster

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
sometimes even your big brake booster

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.250 
sometimes even your big brake booster
which<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> big<00:04:08.940> vacuum<00:04:09.150> diaphragm<00:04:09.690> inside

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
which is a big vacuum diaphragm inside

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.110 
which is a big vacuum diaphragm inside
that<00:04:10.500> metal<00:04:10.680> housing<00:04:10.980> gets<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.609> crack<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
that metal housing gets a crack in the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.810 
that metal housing gets a crack in the
rubber<00:04:12.359> and<00:04:12.630> you're<00:04:13.530> losing<00:04:13.739> vacuum<00:04:14.459> from<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
rubber and you're losing vacuum from the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.270 
rubber and you're losing vacuum from the
hose<00:04:15.030> that<00:04:15.239> feeds<00:04:15.480> your<00:04:15.630> power<00:04:15.840> brake<00:04:16.109> booster

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
hose that feeds your power brake booster

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.699 
hose that feeds your power brake booster
so<00:04:17.280> your<00:04:18.000> engine<00:04:18.390> changes<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.229> lot<00:04:19.500> when<00:04:19.680> you

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
so your engine changes a lot when you

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.050 
so your engine changes a lot when you
push<00:04:20.010> your<00:04:20.190> brake<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.549> might<00:04:20.700> start<00:04:20.910> running

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
push your brake it might start running

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.480 
push your brake it might start running
better<00:04:21.600> when<00:04:22.530> you're<00:04:22.650> pushing<00:04:22.890> your<00:04:23.070> brake<00:04:23.250> or

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
better when you're pushing your brake or

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.850 
better when you're pushing your brake or
running<00:04:23.820> worse<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.990> way<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.169> test<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.680> see<00:04:25.830> if

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
running worse the way you test to see if

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.740 
running worse the way you test to see if
your<00:04:26.160> brake<00:04:26.550> booster<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:26.970> leaking
