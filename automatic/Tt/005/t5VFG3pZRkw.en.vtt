00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.840 
we're doing well a moment keep it up
or<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.680> you're<00:00:52.829> doing<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:53.129> poorly<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.699> can

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
or if you're doing really poorly you can

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.660 
or if you're doing really poorly you can
say<00:00:54.559> we're<00:00:55.559> doing<00:00:55.649> poorly<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> try<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
say we're doing poorly can you try and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
say we're doing poorly can you try and
we<00:00:57.600> need<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> try<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.140> raise<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
we need to try and raise it and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.970 
we need to try and raise it and
basically<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.789> ask<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.420> team<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.800> need

basically you ask the team what you need

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.889 
basically you ask the team what you need
to<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.910> quite<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> handy<00:01:03.329> thing<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> do

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to do so it's quite a handy thing to do

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.210 
to do so it's quite a handy thing to do
if<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.650> didn't<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:04.979> about<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:07.220> something
