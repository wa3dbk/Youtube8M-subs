00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
more chill next topic I got here is

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
more chill next topic I got here is
should<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.760> interactive<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
should there be more interactive and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.810 
should there be more interactive and
dynamic<00:01:03.750> maps<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.619> halo<00:01:04.650> reach<00:01:05.129> an

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
dynamic maps in halo reach an

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.780 
dynamic maps in halo reach an
interactive<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> dynamic<00:01:06.869> map<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.460> such

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
interactive and dynamic map is one such

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.330 
interactive and dynamic map is one such
as<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.210> Halo<00:01:09.630> 3<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.740> standoff

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
as in Halo 3 when you have standoff

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.530 
as in Halo 3 when you have standoff
where<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.700> open<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> gates<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
where you can open the gates to the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.570 
where you can open the gates to the
bottom<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.650> high<00:01:13.860> ground<00:01:14.189> where<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.460> can

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
bottom or in high ground where you can

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.550 
bottom or in high ground where you can
open<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> main<00:01:15.240> gate<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.720> objective<00:01:16.290> games

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
open the main gate in objective games

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.830 
open the main gate in objective games
now<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.759> these<00:01:17.850> add<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> nice<00:01:18.540> touch

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
now I think that these add a nice touch

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.530 
now I think that these add a nice touch
to<00:01:19.380> certain<00:01:19.650> objective<00:01:20.189> games<00:01:20.430> Slyder<00:01:21.150> games

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to certain objective games Slyder games

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
to certain objective games Slyder games
I<00:01:21.720> don't<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.290> nice<00:01:22.500> effect<00:01:22.920> but

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
I don't really have a nice effect but

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.340 
I don't really have a nice effect but
they<00:01:23.520> certainly<00:01:23.759> bring<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.570> new<00:01:24.750> element<00:01:25.170> into

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
they certainly bring a new element into

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.640 
they certainly bring a new element into
objective<00:01:25.920> games<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.369> rewards<00:01:27.299> your<00:01:28.020> team<00:01:28.290> for

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
objective games it rewards your team for

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.289 
objective games it rewards your team for
working<00:01:29.009> together<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.729> behind<00:01:29.850> enemy

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
working together to get behind enemy

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
working together to get behind enemy
lines<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.990> open<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> gate<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.829> which<00:01:32.280> allows

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
lines to open the gate up which allows

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.490 
lines to open the gate up which allows
another<00:01:32.909> possible<00:01:33.450> route<00:01:33.689> /<00:01:33.869> escape<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
another possible route / escape and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.350 
another possible route / escape and
there<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> lack<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> these<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.060> Halo<00:01:36.240> Reach

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
there are a lack of these in Halo Reach

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.760 
there are a lack of these in Halo Reach
so<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.750> definitely<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.740> should

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
so I definitely think that there should

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.340 
so I definitely think that there should
be<00:01:38.009> more<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.759> they<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.180> always<00:01:39.750> bring<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
be more because they do always bring a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.679 
be more because they do always bring a
new<00:01:40.500> interesting<00:01:41.130> element<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> game<00:01:42.090> rather

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
new interesting element to a game rather

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.300 
new interesting element to a game rather

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
here is mid game quitters although I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.410 
here is mid game quitters although I
think<00:01:49.500> about<00:01:49.950> them<00:01:50.159> now<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.000> mid-game

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
think about them now this is a mid-game

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.630 
think about them now this is a mid-game
quitter<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.930> Halo<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.560> necessarily<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
quitter for Halo not necessarily like a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
quitter for Halo not necessarily like a
game<00:01:54.060> such<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.420> call<00:01:54.659> duty<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:55.079> battlefield<00:01:55.470> or

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
as if someone quits someone can join

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.450 
as if someone quits someone can join
their<00:01:57.840> place<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.590> Halo<00:01:58.950> where<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
their place this is in Halo where if you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.030 
their place this is in Halo where if you
quit<00:01:59.729> no<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.750> join<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.110> their<00:02:01.229> place<00:02:01.469> now

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
quit no one can join in their place now

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
quit no one can join in their place now
basically<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.850> obviously<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.990> something

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
basically if obviously if something

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.690 
basically if obviously if something
terrible<00:02:04.439> happens<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:05.130> your<00:02:05.280> connection

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
terrible happens like your connection

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.910 
terrible happens like your connection
totally<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.090> drops<00:02:06.509> itself<00:02:07.049> or<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.770> your

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
totally just drops itself or if your

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.680 
totally just drops itself or if your
power<00:02:08.099> totally<00:02:08.580> goes<00:02:08.759> out<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.300> quit<00:02:09.539> from

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
power totally goes out and you quit from

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.420 
power totally goes out and you quit from
the<00:02:09.810> game<00:02:09.989> obviously<00:02:10.800> those<00:02:10.979> things<00:02:11.220> happen

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the game obviously those things happen

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
the game obviously those things happen
but<00:02:11.760> some<00:02:11.970> people<00:02:12.270> quit<00:02:12.569> as<00:02:12.780> soon<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:13.140> they

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
but some people quit as soon as they

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.030 
but some people quit as soon as they
find<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.650> chat

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
find a chat

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.369 
find a chat
as<00:02:14.489> soon<00:02:15.000> as<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.209> seem<00:02:15.450> for<00:02:15.810> some<00:02:16.049> form<00:02:16.319> of

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
as soon as they seem for some form of

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.869 
as soon as they seem for some form of
resistance<00:02:16.620> against<00:02:17.280> them<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.640> fact

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
resistance against them and the fact

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.309 
resistance against them and the fact
that<00:02:17.969> they're<00:02:18.150> going<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:18.480> lose<00:02:18.689> because<00:02:19.019> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
that they're going to lose because the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.319 
that they're going to lose because the
other<00:02:19.439> team<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.799> very<00:02:19.920> good<00:02:20.189> they<00:02:20.370> quit<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.879> I

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
other team is very good they quit and I

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.670 
other team is very good they quit and I
really<00:02:21.629> do<00:02:21.750> not<00:02:21.900> think<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.200> that's<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.469> good

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
really do not think that that's a good

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.559 
really do not think that that's a good
thing<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.189> think<00:02:23.489> they<00:02:23.609> should<00:02:23.760> stick<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.209> even

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
thing I think they should stick out even

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.789 
thing I think they should stick out even
though<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.140> other<00:02:25.290> team<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.680> better

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
though that the other team is better

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.679 
though that the other team is better
than<00:02:26.010> them<00:02:26.189> because<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.790> allows<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.569> to

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
than them because it is allows you to

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.300 
than them because it is allows you to
improve<00:02:28.019> your<00:02:28.170> skills<00:02:28.500> by<00:02:28.680> playing<00:02:28.950> against

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
improve your skills by playing against

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.399 
improve your skills by playing against
people<00:02:29.579> who<00:02:29.609> are<00:02:29.760> better<00:02:29.939> than<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.290> next<00:02:31.290> time

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
people who are better than you next time

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.899 
people who are better than you next time
I<00:02:31.439> got<00:02:31.739> here<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.099> whether<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.430> think<00:02:32.609> about<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
I got here is whether I think about the

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.539 
I got here is whether I think about the
kill<00:02:33.180> death<00:02:33.450> ratio<00:02:33.599> my<00:02:34.170> k/d<00:02:34.379> ratio<00:02:34.590> now

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
kill death ratio my k/d ratio now

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.559 
kill death ratio my k/d ratio now
personally<00:02:35.819> my<00:02:36.269> k/d<00:02:36.569> ratio<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:37.260> 1<00:02:37.799> point<00:02:38.239> 27<00:02:39.239> it

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
personally my k/d ratio is 1 point 27 it

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.910 
personally my k/d ratio is 1 point 27 it
might<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.870> actually<00:02:40.019> one<00:02:40.319> point<00:02:40.620> thirty

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
might be actually one point thirty

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.099 
might be actually one point thirty
something<00:02:41.280> but<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:42.180> point<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.659> I<00:02:42.900> don't

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
something but the point is that I don't

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.690 
something but the point is that I don't
think<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.439> matters<00:02:43.560> too<00:02:43.980> much<00:02:44.189> I<00:02:44.370> don't<00:02:44.609> really

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
think it matters too much I don't really

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.610 
think it matters too much I don't really
think<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.420> greatest<00:02:45.780> assessment

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
think that it's the greatest assessment

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.280 
think that it's the greatest assessment
of<00:02:46.709> skill<00:02:47.129> it<00:02:47.370> certainly<00:02:48.000> isn't<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.629> major

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
of skill it certainly isn't a major

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.960 
of skill it certainly isn't a major
assessment<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.099> skill<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.430> don't<00:02:50.700> believe

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
assessment of skill I don't believe

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.030 
assessment of skill I don't believe
because<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.049> getting<00:02:52.439> a<00:02:52.530> ton<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.739> kills

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
because if I'm getting a ton of kills

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.339 
because if I'm getting a ton of kills
and<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:53.700> i'm<00:02:53.819> not<00:02:53.970> i'm<00:02:54.150> dying<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.659> lot<00:02:54.840> but<00:02:55.139> i'm

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
and but i'm not i'm dying a lot but i'm

and but i'm not i'm dying a lot but i'm
still<00:02:55.680> advancing<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.310> game<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:56.700> such<00:02:56.909> a<00:02:56.939> way

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
still advancing the game in such a way

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.330 
still advancing the game in such a way
I'm<00:02:57.689> getting<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.989> lot<00:02:58.139> of<00:02:58.169> kills<00:02:58.439> I<00:02:58.680> mean<00:02:58.889> the

I'm getting a lot of kills I mean the

I'm getting a lot of kills I mean the

topic<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.500> got<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:16.919> is<00:03:17.099> beyond<00:03:17.970> halo<00:03:18.599> 4<00:03:18.930> what's

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
topic I got here is beyond halo 4 what's

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.020 
topic I got here is beyond halo 4 what's
going<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.829> happen<00:03:20.129> to<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> Halo<00:03:20.549> series<00:03:20.579> after

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
going to happen to the Halo series after

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.750 
going to happen to the Halo series after
the<00:03:21.569> halo<00:03:21.989> 4<00:03:22.319> drops<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:24.060> rather<00:03:24.870> next

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
the halo 4 drops this rather next

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.119 
the halo 4 drops this rather next
December<00:03:26.760> apparently<00:03:27.479> so<00:03:28.049> basically<00:03:28.500> if<00:03:28.829> the

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
December apparently so basically if the

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.849 
December apparently so basically if the
halo<00:03:29.489> 4<00:03:29.760> cells<00:03:30.180> well<00:03:30.569> then<00:03:31.139> certainly<00:03:31.620> there

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
halo 4 cells well then certainly there

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.189 
halo 4 cells well then certainly there
will<00:03:32.010> be<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.220> halo<00:03:32.489> 5<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.180> halo<00:03:33.510> 4<00:03:33.750> does<00:03:33.930> very

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
will be a halo 5 but if halo 4 does very

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.619 
will be a halo 5 but if halo 4 does very
poorly<00:03:34.530> because<00:03:34.889> bungee<00:03:35.400> has<00:03:35.579> left<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.209> 343

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
poorly because bungee has left and 343

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.259 
poorly because bungee has left and 343
has<00:03:36.959> taken<00:03:37.379> over<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.340> don't<00:03:38.849> think<00:03:39.180> that

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
has taken over that I don't think that

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.000 
has taken over that I don't think that
though<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.870> think<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.290> halo<00:03:40.470> will<00:03:40.650> look<00:03:40.769> for<00:03:40.949> a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
though I think the halo will look for a

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.830 
though I think the halo will look for a
different<00:03:41.129> direction<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:42.000> do<00:03:42.269> think

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
different direction I do think

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.809 
different direction I do think
personally<00:03:43.349> that<00:03:43.470> halo<00:03:43.859> 4<00:03:44.069> will<00:03:44.310> do<00:03:44.519> very<00:03:44.549> well

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
personally that halo 4 will do very well

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.240 
personally that halo 4 will do very well
I<00:03:45.209> think<00:03:45.479> that<00:03:45.780> there<00:03:45.930> will<00:03:46.109> be<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.349> halo<00:03:46.590> 5<00:03:46.919> and

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
I think that there will be a halo 5 and

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.430 
I think that there will be a halo 5 and
I<00:03:47.879> don't<00:03:48.120> really<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.540> don't<00:03:48.569> really<00:03:48.840> see<00:03:49.019> there

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
I don't really I don't really see there

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.349 
I don't really I don't really see there
many<00:03:49.650> being<00:03:49.889> many<00:03:50.159> halo<00:03:50.519> spin-offs<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.180> think

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
many being many halo spin-offs I think

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.849 
many being many halo spin-offs I think
there's<00:03:51.479> gonna<00:03:51.569> be<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.840> new<00:03:52.049> trilogy<00:03:52.470> we're

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
there's gonna be the new trilogy we're

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.159 
there's gonna be the new trilogy we're
gonna<00:03:52.949> have<00:03:53.280> here<00:03:53.579> made<00:03:54.090> by<00:03:54.269> 3<00:03:54.540> for<00:03:54.750> 3<00:03:54.959> which<00:03:55.109> is

gonna have here made by 3 for 3 which is

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.309 
gonna have here made by 3 for 3 which is
gonna<00:03:55.319> be<00:03:55.409> halo<00:03:55.769> 5<00:03:56.069> 6<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:56.879> 4<00:03:57.479> 5<00:03:57.689> rather<00:03:58.049> four

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
gonna be halo 5 6 and 4 5 rather four

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.509 
gonna be halo 5 6 and 4 5 rather four
five<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.560> six<00:03:58.859> my<00:03:59.819> bad<00:04:00.620> next<00:04:01.620> topic<00:04:01.829> is<00:04:02.220> what

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
five and six my bad next topic is what

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.059 
five and six my bad next topic is what
do<00:04:02.729> I<00:04:02.819> think<00:04:02.849> about<00:04:03.030> pre-order<00:04:03.989> bonuses<00:04:04.769> now

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
do I think about pre-order bonuses now

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.069 
do I think about pre-order bonuses now
this<00:04:05.669> is<00:04:05.790> an<00:04:05.909> interesting<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.810> touchy

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
this is an interesting and touchy

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.589 
this is an interesting and touchy
subject<00:04:07.680> but<00:04:08.159> pre-order<00:04:08.639> bonuses<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.120> really

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
subject but pre-order bonuses I really

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.899 
subject but pre-order bonuses I really
don't<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.019> pre-order<00:04:10.829> bonuses<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.310> affect

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
don't like pre-order bonuses that affect

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.509 
don't like pre-order bonuses that affect
the<00:04:12.150> gameplay<00:04:12.389> if<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.229> have<00:04:13.409> an<00:04:13.530> RPG<00:04:14.040> game<00:04:14.250> and

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
the gameplay if you have an RPG game and

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.069 
the gameplay if you have an RPG game and
you<00:04:14.579> get<00:04:14.729> some<00:04:14.879> kind<00:04:15.120> of<00:04:15.180> like<00:04:15.359> amazing

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
you get some kind of like amazing

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.810 
you get some kind of like amazing
upgrades<00:04:16.620> right<00:04:16.919> from<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.220> start<00:04:17.310> for<00:04:17.639> pre

we're<00:04:17.940> in<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.150> game<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.570> think<00:04:19.109> that<00:04:19.139> is<00:04:19.289> very

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
we're in a game I think that is very

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.899 
we're in a game I think that is very
stupid<00:04:19.949> because<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.310> breaks<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.729> game

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
stupid because it breaks the game

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.480 
stupid because it breaks the game
obviously<00:04:21.389> giving<00:04:22.109> special<00:04:22.590> content<00:04:23.279> that

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
obviously giving special content that

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.330 
obviously giving special content that
that<00:04:24.020> affects<00:04:25.020> gameplay<00:04:25.650> rather<00:04:25.979> than<00:04:26.159> just

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
that affects gameplay rather than just

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
that affects gameplay rather than just
giving<00:04:26.520> if<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.180> if<00:04:27.510> you<00:04:27.690> preorder<00:04:27.960> game

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
giving if you if you preorder game

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.540 
giving if you if you preorder game
aim<00:04:28.449> and<00:04:28.629> you<00:04:28.719> get<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.900> special<00:04:29.229> skin<00:04:29.919> for<00:04:30.219> a<00:04:30.250> gun

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
aim and you get a special skin for a gun

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.640 
aim and you get a special skin for a gun
I<00:04:30.789> think<00:04:31.330> stuff<00:04:31.539> like<00:04:31.599> that<00:04:31.689> is<00:04:31.990> fine<00:04:32.199> but

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
I think stuff like that is fine but

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.830 
I think stuff like that is fine but
affecting<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.490> gameplay<00:04:34.120> for<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.750> other

affecting the gameplay for the other
players<00:04:35.229> definitely<00:04:35.889> is<00:04:36.310> not<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.550> fair<00:04:36.819> thing

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
players definitely is not a fair thing

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.790 
players definitely is not a fair thing

aspect but of course you definitely want
to<00:05:15.939> be<00:05:16.029> aggressive<00:05:16.330> because<00:05:16.719> you<00:05:16.990> don't<00:05:17.139> want

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
topic I got here is what do I think

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.749 
topic I got here is what do I think
about<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.539> quits<00:05:34.870> band<00:05:35.229> and<00:05:35.589> the<00:05:36.250> quit<00:05:36.490> then

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
about the quits band and the quit then

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.119 
about the quits band and the quit then
is<00:05:37.029> if<00:05:37.270> you<00:05:37.509> quit<00:05:37.990> too<00:05:38.289> many<00:05:38.469> games<00:05:38.740> in<00:05:39.009> a<00:05:39.099> row

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:39.129 
is if you quit too many games in a row

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.490 
is if you quit too many games in a row
you<00:05:40.000> will<00:05:40.150> be<00:05:40.389> put<00:05:40.719> out<00:05:40.900> of<00:05:40.930> matchmaking

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
you will be put out of matchmaking

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.140 
you will be put out of matchmaking

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.570 
unable to join back in for like ten
minutes<00:05:43.180> now<00:05:43.900> this<00:05:44.050> ties<00:05:44.319> back<00:05:44.349> nicely<00:05:45.279> the

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
minutes now this ties back nicely the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.640 
minutes now this ties back nicely the
mid-game<00:05:46.029> quitters<00:05:46.599> and<00:05:46.839> I<00:05:47.199> do<00:05:47.259> not<00:05:47.589> think

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
mid-game quitters and I do not think

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.760 
mid-game quitters and I do not think
that<00:05:48.069> the<00:05:48.279> quit<00:05:48.580> band<00:05:48.909> actually<00:05:49.409> does<00:05:50.409> much

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
that the quit band actually does much

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.350 
that the quit band actually does much
for<00:05:51.039> the<00:05:51.129> game<00:05:51.339> I<00:05:51.370> don't<00:05:51.699> think<00:05:51.940> that<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.180> does

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
for the game I don't think that it does

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.450 
for the game I don't think that it does
its<00:05:52.599> intended<00:05:52.930> purpose<00:05:53.199> it<00:05:53.830> does<00:05:54.069> not<00:05:54.250> really

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
its intended purpose it does not really

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.760 
its intended purpose it does not really
stop<00:05:54.819> people<00:05:55.240> from<00:05:55.330> quitting<00:05:55.629> at<00:05:55.779> all<00:05:55.960> I<00:05:56.199> have

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
gotten the quick ban I think once or

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.959 
gotten the quick ban I think once or
twice<00:05:58.689> I<00:05:59.139> know<00:05:59.199> and<00:05:59.589> I<00:05:59.919> do<00:05:59.979> I<00:06:00.430> know<00:06:00.490> that<00:06:00.610> it<00:06:00.819> has

twice I know and I do I know that it has

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.510 
twice I know and I do I know that it has
not<00:06:01.150> stopped<00:06:01.569> me<00:06:01.810> from<00:06:01.960> quitting

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
not stopped me from quitting

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
unfortunately and I know many many

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.189 
unfortunately and I know many many
people<00:06:05.050> who<00:06:05.789> does<00:06:06.789> not<00:06:07.029> just<00:06:07.479> does<00:06:07.719> not<00:06:07.930> stop

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
people who does not just does not stop

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.079 
people who does not just does not stop
them<00:06:08.529> from<00:06:08.620> quitting<00:06:08.919> and<00:06:09.159> in<00:06:09.610> fact<00:06:09.879> it

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.089 
them from quitting and in fact it

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:11.790 
them from quitting and in fact it
actually<00:06:10.120> detracts<00:06:10.659> from<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:11.050> game<00:06:11.289> because

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
actually detracts from the game because

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.929 
actually detracts from the game because
it<00:06:11.919> makes<00:06:12.039> these<00:06:12.250> people<00:06:12.580> want<00:06:12.669> to<00:06:12.789> put<00:06:12.909> a

it makes these people want to put a

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.610 
it makes these people want to put a
different<00:06:13.180> game<00:06:13.539> rather<00:06:13.779> than<00:06:13.870> halo<00:06:14.139> so<00:06:14.500> it

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
different game rather than halo so it

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.040 
different game rather than halo so it
really<00:06:14.770> detracts<00:06:15.250> from<00:06:15.339> the<00:06:15.669> people<00:06:16.060> next

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
really detracts from the people next

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.230 
really detracts from the people next
time<00:06:17.319> I<00:06:17.349> got<00:06:17.680> here<00:06:17.889> is<00:06:18.069> in<00:06:18.400> the<00:06:18.580> last<00:06:18.849> half<00:06:19.120> way

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
time I got here is in the last half way

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.999 
time I got here is in the last half way
I<00:06:19.270> got<00:06:19.479> here<00:06:19.629> is<00:06:19.750> the<00:06:19.900> leaderboards<00:06:20.620> what<00:06:20.860> do<00:06:20.949> I

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
I got here is the leaderboards what do I

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.040 
I got here is the leaderboards what do I
think<00:06:21.039> about<00:06:21.310> them<00:06:21.610> now<00:06:22.060> personally<00:06:22.300> Xbox

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
think about them now personally Xbox

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.230 
think about them now personally Xbox
leader<00:06:23.319> boards<00:06:23.620> are<00:06:23.740> total<00:06:24.159> trash<00:06:24.550> I<00:06:24.879> believe

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
leader boards are total trash I believe

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.600 
leader boards are total trash I believe
I<00:06:25.419> mean<00:06:25.990> there's<00:06:26.259> so<00:06:26.500> many<00:06:26.620> hackers<00:06:26.979> on<00:06:27.339> them<00:06:27.520> I

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
I mean there's so many hackers on them I

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.579 
I mean there's so many hackers on them I
think<00:06:27.819> that<00:06:27.939> they're<00:06:28.060> trite<00:06:28.629> and<00:06:28.870> meaningless

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:29.589 
think that they're trite and meaningless

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.740 
think that they're trite and meaningless
because<00:06:30.370> there<00:06:30.729> are<00:06:30.819> just<00:06:30.939> so<00:06:31.150> many<00:06:31.210> people

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
because there are just so many people

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.209 
because there are just so many people
that<00:06:31.900> just<00:06:32.050> hack<00:06:32.289> them<00:06:32.529> just<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.860> get<00:06:32.949> all<00:06:33.039> that

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:33.219 
that just hack them just to get all that

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.249 
that just hack them just to get all that
score<00:06:33.759> and<00:06:33.789> I<00:06:34.120> don't<00:06:34.599> know<00:06:34.659> some<00:06:34.870> internet

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259 
score and I don't know some internet

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:36.600 
score and I don't know some internet
cred<00:06:35.589> or<00:06:35.620> whatever<00:06:36.069> just<00:06:36.189> because<00:06:36.459> they're

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
cred or whatever just because they're

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.309 
cred or whatever just because they're
hacking<00:06:36.819> them<00:06:37.089> and<00:06:37.300> I'm<00:06:37.599> certain<00:06:38.020> that<00:06:38.050> there

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 
hacking them and I'm certain that there

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.689 
hacking them and I'm certain that there
are<00:06:38.440> some<00:06:38.649> people<00:06:38.770> that<00:06:38.889> definitely<00:06:39.279> deserve

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
are some people that definitely deserve

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.309 
are some people that definitely deserve
the<00:06:39.940> credit<00:06:40.120> that<00:06:40.270> and<00:06:40.630> they're<00:06:40.899> just<00:06:41.020> not

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
the credit that and they're just not

the credit that and they're just not
getting<00:06:41.649> it

getting it

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.990 
getting it
because<00:06:42.069> they're<00:06:42.250> being<00:06:42.460> covered<00:06:42.669> up<00:06:42.819> by<00:06:42.969> the

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
because they're being covered up by the

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.360 
because they're being covered up by the
people<00:06:43.360> who<00:06:43.449> just<00:06:43.629> hack<00:06:44.139> their<00:06:44.620> xboxes<00:06:45.340> and

very<00:06:50.110> hard<00:06:50.349> for<00:06:50.439> developers<00:06:51.039> to<00:06:51.069> clean<00:06:51.520> up<00:06:51.699> the

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
very hard for developers to clean up the

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.700 
very hard for developers to clean up the
leaderboards<00:06:52.330> and<00:06:52.419> get<00:06:52.960> rid<00:06:53.229> of<00:06:53.259> the<00:06:53.379> people

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.860
