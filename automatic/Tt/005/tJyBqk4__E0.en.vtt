going to that instead I want to discuss

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.570 
going to that instead I want to discuss
what<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.630> fundamental<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.920> success<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.460> an

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
action film which is simply a bad ass

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
action film which is simply a bad ass
protagonist<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.030> fact<00:01:21.420> here's<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> simple

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
protagonist in fact here's a simple

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.620 
protagonist in fact here's a simple
equation<00:01:22.369> badassery<00:01:23.369> equals<00:01:24.030> Outlander

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
equation badassery equals Outlander

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990 
equation badassery equals Outlander
stands<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> ability<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> give<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.460> well<00:01:26.850> as

take<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.600> beat<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:28.740> obviously<00:01:28.950> this

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
take a beat down now obviously this

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
take a beat down now obviously this
doesn't<00:01:29.610> happen<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.180> often<00:01:30.509> anyway<00:01:31.110> but

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
doesn't happen very often anyway but

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.050 
doesn't happen very often anyway but
here's<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> difference<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> male<00:01:32.820> action

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
here's the difference when a male action

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
here's the difference when a male action
star<00:01:33.420> fails<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.840> achieve<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.530> industry

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
star fails to achieve this the industry

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.830 
star fails to achieve this the industry
continues<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> churn<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:35.939> those<00:01:36.090> movies<00:01:36.479> but

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
continues to churn up those movies but

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.420 
continues to churn up those movies but
when<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> female<00:01:37.259> lead<00:01:37.590> fails<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.009> achieve<00:01:38.100> this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430

Hollywood stops making those movies and
unfortunately<00:01:41.490> there<00:01:42.000> aren't<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> many

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
unfortunately there aren't that many

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.660 
unfortunately there aren't that many
good<00:01:42.780> ones<00:01:42.930> anyway<00:01:43.140> when<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> works<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.520> have

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
good ones anyway when it works you have

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.300 
good ones anyway when it works you have
kill<00:01:44.970> bill<00:01:45.210> aliens<00:01:46.110> or<00:01:46.290> hit<00:01:46.500> go<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.920> kick<00:01:47.159> ass

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
and when it doesn't work well you have
every<00:01:49.770> other<00:01:49.920> film<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> big<00:01:51.240> question<00:01:51.390> is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
every other film so the big question is

this<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.720> Bourne<00:02:37.959> films<00:02:38.290> which<00:02:38.470> i<00:02:38.590> think

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
this to the Bourne films which i think

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.229 
this to the Bourne films which i think
is<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.860> fair<00:02:39.070> comparison<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:39.880> far<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
is a fair comparison so far as the

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.390 
is a fair comparison so far as the
action<00:02:40.510> scenes<00:02:40.750> but<00:02:41.200> as<00:02:41.320> an<00:02:41.470> overall<00:02:41.920> film<00:02:42.220> I

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
action scenes but as an overall film I

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.130 
action scenes but as an overall film I
would<00:02:42.670> say<00:02:42.850> somewhere<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.270> between<00:02:43.390> Bourne

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
would say somewhere in between Bourne

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.229 
would say somewhere in between Bourne
film<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.950> straight-to-dvd<00:02:45.370> action<00:02:46.030> film
