00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
scatterer you think about yeah it's

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.710 
scatterer you think about yeah it's
pretty<00:02:03.860> simple<00:02:04.159> it's<00:02:04.549> just<00:02:04.789> a<00:02:04.939> one<00:02:05.360> guitar

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
pretty simple it's just a one guitar

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.699 
pretty simple it's just a one guitar
pedal<00:02:06.110> called<00:02:06.349> a<00:02:06.469> line<00:02:06.799> 60<00:02:07.219> l4<00:02:07.579> and<00:02:07.610> it's<00:02:08.239> a

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
pedal called a line 60 l4 and it's a

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.589 
pedal called a line 60 l4 and it's a
it's<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.799> pedal<00:02:09.979> that's<00:02:10.280> designed<00:02:11.060> mainly<00:02:11.239> due

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
it's a pedal that's designed mainly due

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.619 
it's a pedal that's designed mainly due
to<00:02:11.630> emulate<00:02:12.440> delay<00:02:13.160> pedals<00:02:13.940> all<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.480> way<00:02:14.599> from

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
to emulate delay pedals all the way from

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.110 
to emulate delay pedals all the way from
like<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.379> 60<00:02:15.680> s<00:02:15.799> until<00:02:16.220> now<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:16.730> kind<00:02:17.060> of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
like the 60 s until now so just kind of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.930 
like the 60 s until now so just kind of
like<00:02:17.329> it<00:02:18.200> fakes<00:02:18.950> all<00:02:19.220> these<00:02:19.400> different<00:02:19.579> kinds

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
like it fakes all these different kinds

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.199 
like it fakes all these different kinds
of<00:02:20.030> delays<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:20.599> there's<00:02:20.780> one<00:02:20.959> setting<00:02:21.769> on<00:02:21.920> it

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
of delays but there's one setting on it

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.190 
of delays but there's one setting on it
called<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.269> loop<00:02:23.480> sampler<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.049> loop

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
called the loop sampler and the loop

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.449 
called the loop sampler and the loop
sampler<00:02:24.620> enables<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.660> loop<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:28.340> know

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
sampler enables you to loop and you know

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.640 
sampler enables you to loop and you know
basically<00:02:28.670> record<00:02:29.269> loop<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:29.959> then<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.560> know

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
basically record loop and then you know

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.500 
basically record loop and then you know
add<00:02:30.950> stuff<00:02:31.370> over<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.120> change<00:02:32.329> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
add stuff over it you can change the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.020 
add stuff over it you can change the
speed<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.799> few<00:02:34.220> really<00:02:34.670> basic

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
speed and have a few really basic

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.970 
speed and have a few really basic
effects<00:02:35.359> over<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.319> it's<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.500> very<00:02:36.530> simple

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
effects over it so it's a very simple

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.840 
effects over it so it's a very simple
machine<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:38.470> but<00:02:39.470> if<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.709> if<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.340> use<00:02:40.609> it

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
machine but but if you if you use it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.690 
machine but but if you if you use it
like<00:02:41.239> really<00:02:41.480> go<00:02:42.079> through<00:02:42.350> its<00:02:42.859> maximum

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
like really go through its maximum

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.160 
like really go through its maximum
capabilities<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.569> can<00:02:44.630> come<00:02:44.840> up<00:02:44.959> with<00:02:45.079> some

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
capabilities you can come up with some

00:02:45.170 --> 00:04:29.150 
capabilities you can come up with some
pretty<00:02:45.200> cool<00:02:45.500> stuff

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.010 

you<00:04:30.160> have<00:04:30.340> like<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:30.970> dungeon<00:04:31.240> master<00:04:31.720> showed<00:04:31.900> on

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
you have like a dungeon master showed on

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.440 
you have like a dungeon master showed on
in<00:04:32.200> some<00:04:32.350> of<00:04:32.440> your<00:04:32.500> publicity<00:04:32.800> shots<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:34.180> we're

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
wondering what your thoughts are on

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.140 
wondering what your thoughts are on
dungeons<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.640> dragons<00:04:37.090> in<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.330> lifestyle

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150

comforting thing for me you know like I
I<00:04:45.850> didn't<00:04:46.420> really<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:46.660> played<00:04:47.080> Dungeons<00:04:47.440> and

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
I didn't really I played Dungeons and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.960

Dragons<00:04:47.560> for<00:04:48.010> probably<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.490> would<00:04:48.730> say<00:04:48.820> two

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
Dragons for probably I would say two

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.260 
Dragons for probably I would say two
years<00:04:50.130> although<00:04:51.130> I<00:04:51.310> wasn't<00:04:51.580> like<00:04:51.820> hardcore

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
years although I wasn't like hardcore

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.730 
years although I wasn't like hardcore
hardcore<00:04:52.780> like<00:04:52.990> than<00:04:53.290> what<00:04:53.410> i<00:04:53.440> mean<00:04:53.620> by

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
hardcore like than what i mean by

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.620 
hardcore like than what i mean by
hardcore<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.310> like<00:04:54.520> getting<00:04:55.120> all<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.300> puter

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
hardcore is like getting all the puter

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.660 
hardcore is like getting all the puter
figures<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:56.530> like<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.950> know<00:04:56.980> putting<00:04:57.490> the

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
figures and like you know putting the

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.490 
figures and like you know putting the
campaign<00:04:58.150> map<00:04:58.420> out<00:04:58.720> there<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.170> putting<00:04:59.320> your

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
campaign map out there and putting your

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.230 
campaign map out there and putting your
pieces<00:04:59.710> on<00:05:00.010> there<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.400> moving<00:05:00.790> them<00:05:00.940> in<00:05:01.180> a

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
pieces on there and moving them in a

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.180 
pieces on there and moving them in a
proximity<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.960> where<00:05:02.080> they<00:05:02.260> are<00:05:02.290> in<00:05:02.590> space<00:05:02.950> on

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
proximity to where they are in space on

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.880 
proximity to where they are in space on
the<00:05:03.280> grid<00:05:03.550> we<00:05:04.240> played<00:05:04.720> more<00:05:04.960> like<00:05:05.080> imagination

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
the grid we played more like imagination

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
maybe a couple figures but usually we

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.150 
maybe a couple figures but usually we
