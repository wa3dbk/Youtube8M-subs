00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.060
 today is the day 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.800
 very good to all kids since 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.180
 We are again after 5 days of 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.689
 inactivity and well then let's do 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.670
 an attack I have seen that has made annihilated 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.910
 gamer okay I do not know I guess what 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.610
 you will know and it is a mega attack with mounts 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.140
 pork is not a never tried it if 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.149
 I did not call enough attention 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.360
 that I'm even going to make a video but 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.250
 adapted for ayuntamiento 8 we go to 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.720
 try it for the first time not yet not 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.910
 I've tried it, I do not know if it's going to work 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.340
 it works well if it works badly besides my 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.340
 troops are of a low level and good me 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.430
 I meet in real empire top so 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.530
 good many thanks to this clan 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.910
 that commanded a small level 5 is going to be 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.690
 the first time you try a small one 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.079
 5 so well you know an army 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.079
 mega either uy uy uy uy pe in my case 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:09.040
 I take güipe vale with mounts pigs in 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.450
 this case I have 1012 ride pigs and that 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.310
 besides spells as is a 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.610
 town hall of 8 only three spells I've 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.820
 born one of 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.220
 only healing alone have I taken to any 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.550
 of rage like I could do in a 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.460
 City Hall 9 and little else the truth like that 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.160
 I 'm going to look for a town hall 8 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.870
 maximum or so and we attack it too 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.670
 I want to tell you that my troops are not 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.580
 maximum for example the goals do not have it 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.470
 the 2 the mount because I do not have it to 4 what 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.660
 I'm improving and at 3000 missing 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.570
 days with a week missing 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.000
 a week approximately the pk 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.000
 I have it to 3 and to the others I have it 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.210
 to the maximum so nothing short the video and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.040
 here we find a town hall 8 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.040
 to the maximum and good then 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.490
 I want to tell you how good I am 40 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.110
 Less spaces 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.110
 one less cure 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.030
 I do uip I can not do with wii wii 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.970
 because I do not have witches or is it a 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.160
 attack adapted not but let's try 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.600
 do your best and let's see 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.489
 Yes, really 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.010
 this attack as I have thought 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.170
 could work, let's attack him 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.880
 below by mega and above with mounts 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.560
 pigs then what is going to do that 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.709
 mounts them because it's remove the defenses 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.110
 and already when the mega is breaking everything 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.040
 what below would have the attack 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.610
 practically done to his jumping the three 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.610
 of week 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.550
 perfect let's lower it a little 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.000
 volume 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.210
 I believe that you release 12 veneers here 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.770
 loose 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.290
 this already loose the incredible level 5 pk 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.680
 let's accept now the king 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.109
 and we will open if we can 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.200
 I do not even know why I bring them hard breaks 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.360
 honestly so good 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.879
 we will attack from above with mounts 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.450
 pigs there are all the mounts 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.250
 pigs already loose the ability of the king 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.920
 let's see are mount to ports level 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.360
 two die too fast but good 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.569
 let's try to do the best 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.730
 possible and see how the truth comes out 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.790
 I am not sure it leaves something 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.580
 very good but what comes out 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.370
 honestly so well let's see 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.370
 the level 5 pk will kill him no longer 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.380
 well for now I still have mounts 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.210
 few live there quite well goes the 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.820
 attack is that I do not know how much life is left 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.820
 to that that pk to die and 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.930
 do not 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.670
 let's see we still depend on some 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.260
 how many pigs are level 2 already 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.710
 you know I still do not have everything to the fullest 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.370
 I'm missing the golems the king either 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.040
 I have the maximum and also have in 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.090
 mind that I do not have everything to the maximum and that 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.090
 this is what there is 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.760
 there is not much better 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.069
 I believe that yes I believe that I believe in 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.739
 this thing I think we can 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.479
 get something out of this attack we have in 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.720
 account that is a city ​​council 8 to 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:23.800
 maximum that with dragons sometimes you do 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.320
 100% and very few with depends on who 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.470
 It is to attack sometimes they do not do in 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.110
 100% we are also going to keep in mind that 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:37.090
 we have attacked what we can 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.620
 then I honestly do not know what to tell you 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.620
 we have made two stars 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.340
 is that it is from this attack that I just 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.520
 to do is draw conclusions is the only thing 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.289
 what can we do then I think 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.289
 If I had the pigs, level 4 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.400
 collins, well, it does not matter at level 1 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.389
 level 2 by now I do not know it does not show 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.060
 difference but nothing more or we have 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.590
 taken a good attack then I 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.870
 I would like you to tell me in the 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.750
 comments if I think I see him future 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.789
 to this attacks a mega compound of 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.650
 ride because I do not know when I saw it 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.460
 that recorded it annihilated then host 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.530
 I said this this can be something something 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.539
 incredible for a town hall 8 and the 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.940
 seem if it is to draw two stars is a 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.300
 City Hall 8 to the fullest with all 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.680
 activated traps 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.960
 it's like an attack in war more than anything 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.710
 then we can draw conclusions from 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.620
 this attack 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.120
 I say that there is a future then 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.180
 you tell me in the description if 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.610
 you see future to this attack I will be 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.800
 practicing changing troops to the best and 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.740
 I ask witches instead of pk you can not 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.280
 be changing a lot and when you have the 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.380
 rides pigs level 3 or 4 does not depend 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.710
 of how he caught me then he will be going up 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.960
 attacks of this type is worth seeing if I can 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.980
 perfect this attack so good 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.960
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.580
 I hope it 's entertaining and see you 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.580
 in a next video bye bye
