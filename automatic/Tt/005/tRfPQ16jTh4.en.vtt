two racks is a very aggressive opening

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.960 
two racks is a very aggressive opening
especially<00:02:18.950> when<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.100> put<00:02:19.250> these<00:02:19.340> barracks

in a forward position like this so

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.350 
in a forward position like this so
expect<00:02:21.680> not<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.460> put<00:02:22.580> some<00:02:22.700> pressure<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.150> here

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
expect not it put some pressure on here

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.910 
expect not it put some pressure on here
and<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.690> hatchery<00:02:23.870> first<00:02:24.380> build<00:02:24.650> from

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
have to wait and see now as I mentioned

before this is Game three I've mentioned
in<00:02:36.050> three<00:02:36.470> times<00:02:36.710> now<00:02:36.890> as<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.070> matter<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.310> fact<00:02:37.400> i

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
in three times now as a matter of fact i

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.170 
in three times now as a matter of fact i
casted<00:02:38.300> game<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.590> about<00:02:40.550> five<00:02:40.760> minutes<00:02:41.000> ago

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
casted game to about five minutes ago

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.090 
casted game to about five minutes ago
but<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.450> was<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.570> really<00:02:41.810> one<00:02:42.050> sided<00:02:42.080> matchup<00:02:42.980> I

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
but it was a really one sided matchup I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.380 
but it was a really one sided matchup I
wanted<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.400> bit<00:02:43.520> of<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> longer<00:02:43.850> cast<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:44.330> I

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
wanted a bit of a longer cast so I

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.050 
wanted a bit of a longer cast so I
picked<00:02:44.600> game<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.990> really<00:02:45.890> one<00:02:46.040> sided<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:46.760> I

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
picked game to really one sided and I

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.510 
picked game to really one sided and I
didn't<00:02:47.300> want<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.080> post<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.740> not<00:02:49.070> actually

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
didn't want to post that not actually

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.850 
didn't want to post that not actually
won<00:02:49.670> Game<00:02:49.880> two<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.420> apparently<00:02:50.900> moral<00:02:51.650> one

game<00:02:52.070> one<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.520> this<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.820> sort<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.120> rubber

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
game one so this is sort of the rubber

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.790 
game one so this is sort of the rubber
match<00:02:53.540> winner<00:02:53.840> takes<00:02:54.110> all<00:02:54.260> here<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.620> there's<00:02:54.770> a

it's<00:03:15.170> too<00:03:15.440> bad<00:03:15.590> spine<00:03:15.950> crawlers<00:03:16.250> just<00:03:16.430> take

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
it's too bad spine crawlers just take

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.270 
it's too bad spine crawlers just take
forever<00:03:17.060> 50<00:03:17.780> seconds<00:03:18.320> longer<00:03:18.770> than<00:03:18.890> any<00:03:19.130> other

SUV<00:03:26.630> goes<00:03:26.900> down<00:03:27.140> as<00:03:27.320> well<00:03:27.590> another<00:03:28.370> SUV<00:03:28.580> with

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
SUV goes down as well another SUV with

SUV goes down as well another SUV with
just<00:03:29.300> ten<00:03:29.450> ten<00:03:29.660> ten<00:03:29.930> hit<00:03:30.140> points<00:03:30.470> left<00:03:30.530> and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
just ten ten ten hit points left and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.830 
just ten ten ten hit points left and
this<00:03:31.490> is<00:03:31.610> how<00:03:31.700> Terran<00:03:32.030> players<00:03:32.240> like<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.570> do<00:03:32.690> it

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
this is how Terran players like to do it

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.480 
this is how Terran players like to do it
you<00:03:32.930> pump<00:03:33.170> Marines<00:03:33.650> out<00:03:33.830> of<00:03:33.950> two<00:03:34.070> barracks<00:03:34.370> and

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
you pump Marines out of two barracks and

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.270 
you pump Marines out of two barracks and
you<00:03:34.580> start<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.820> leapfrog<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.600> bunkers

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
you start to leapfrog the bunkers

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.520 
you start to leapfrog the bunkers
and<00:03:37.400> there<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.060> now<00:03:38.270> two<00:03:38.330> Marines<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:39.410> that

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
and there is now two Marines in that

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.660 
and there is now two Marines in that
bunker<00:03:39.860> it's<00:03:39.980> going<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.160> be<00:03:40.250> really<00:03:40.430> difficult

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
bunker it's going to be really difficult

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.740 
bunker it's going to be really difficult
for<00:03:42.370> more<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.580> break<00:03:43.819> that<00:03:44.000> but<00:03:44.240> now<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.600> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
for more to break that but now that the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.860 
for more to break that but now that the
spine<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.410> up<00:03:45.910> I'm<00:03:46.910> not<00:03:47.180> actually<00:03:47.390> sure<00:03:47.600> if

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
spine is up I'm not actually sure if

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.860 
spine is up I'm not actually sure if
moro<00:03:48.500> is<00:03:48.830> going<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.340> have<00:03:49.520> much<00:03:49.880> more<00:03:49.940> success

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
moro is going to have much more success

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.690 
moro is going to have much more success

produce off of two barracks he's putting

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.059 
produce off of two barracks he's putting
a<00:03:58.190> command<00:03:58.640> center<00:03:58.760> down<00:03:59.300> and<00:03:59.830> I<00:04:00.830> mean<00:04:01.040> this

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
a command center down and I mean this

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.100 
a command center down and I mean this
bunker<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.090> just<00:04:02.420> sort<00:04:02.600> of<00:04:02.660> out<00:04:02.810> in<00:04:02.959> no<00:04:03.080> man's

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.349 
now army count is virtually neck and
neck<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:15.140> there's<00:04:15.709> no<00:04:15.890> zergling<00:04:16.790> speed<00:04:17.180> on

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
the way morale is just mining you know

three workers on one extractor take a

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.220 
three workers on one extractor take a

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
look at the unit stabbed as well 22

but<00:04:28.790> only<00:04:29.000> for<00:04:29.360> zerglings<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:32.530> it's<00:04:33.530> difficult

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
but only for zerglings so it's difficult

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.820 
but only for zerglings so it's difficult
for<00:04:34.310> me<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.790> judge<00:04:35.030> at<00:04:35.210> this<00:04:35.330> point<00:04:35.830> who's

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
for me to judge at this point who's

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.790 
for me to judge at this point who's
really<00:04:37.250> ahead<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:39.169> Zerg<00:04:39.380> player<00:04:39.590> has<00:04:39.770> a

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
really ahead the Zerg player has a

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.570 
really ahead the Zerg player has a
slight<00:04:40.390> army<00:04:41.390> lead<00:04:41.630> now<00:04:42.070> but<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.220> Terran

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
slight army lead now but the Terran

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.120 
slight army lead now but the Terran
player<00:04:43.700> has<00:04:44.030> pretty<00:04:44.300> much<00:04:44.680> nada<00:04:45.680> here<00:04:45.979> has<00:04:46.100> a

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
player has pretty much nada here has a

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.770 
player has pretty much nada here has a
pretty<00:04:46.370> much<00:04:46.520> uncontested<00:04:47.330> natural

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
pretty much uncontested natural

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.440 
pretty much uncontested natural
expansion<00:04:48.850> especially<00:04:49.850> with<00:04:49.940> this<00:04:50.060> wall<00:04:50.300> off

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
expansion especially with this wall off

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.810 
expansion especially with this wall off
and<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.690> see<00:04:50.870> nada<00:04:51.080> doing<00:04:51.410> this<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.590> lot<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:52.190> I

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
and I see nada doing this a lot and I

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.250 
and I see nada doing this a lot and I
mean<00:04:53.030> yeah<00:04:53.270> keep<00:04:53.510> an<00:04:53.630> eye<00:04:53.720> out<00:04:53.750> for<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:54.110> you

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
mean yeah keep an eye out for this you

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.250 
mean yeah keep an eye out for this you
Terran<00:04:54.590> players<00:04:54.800> out<00:04:55.070> there<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:56.810> can<00:04:56.960> wolof

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
Terran players out there you can wolof

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.230 
Terran players out there you can wolof
choke<00:04:57.590> points<00:04:57.979> for<00:04:58.520> sure<00:04:58.729> with<00:04:59.000> three

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
choke points for sure with three

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.969 
choke points for sure with three

barracks smaller choke points with two

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.279 
barracks smaller choke points with two
barracks<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.810> mean<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:02.870> seems<00:05:03.020> pretty<00:05:03.169> obvious

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
barracks I mean it seems pretty obvious

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.779 
barracks I mean it seems pretty obvious
but<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.680> don't<00:05:03.860> actually<00:05:04.039> see<00:05:04.280> enough<00:05:04.520> Terran

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
but I don't actually see enough Terran

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.700 
but I don't actually see enough Terran
players<00:05:05.000> doing<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:05.479> walling<00:05:06.140> off<00:05:06.289> in<00:05:06.500> such<00:05:06.680> a

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
players doing it walling off in such a

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.440 
players doing it walling off in such a
way<00:05:06.950> so<00:05:07.010> that<00:05:07.190> you<00:05:07.430> have<00:05:07.580> sort<00:05:08.060> of<00:05:08.360> a

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
way so that you have sort of a

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.750 
way so that you have sort of a
guaranteed<00:05:08.990> natural<00:05:09.500> expansion<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:10.250> course

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
guaranteed natural expansion of course

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
guaranteed natural expansion of course
I'm<00:05:10.910> terminus<00:05:11.270> tree<00:05:11.390> there<00:05:11.539> are<00:05:11.630> these

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
I'm terminus tree there are these

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.690 
I'm terminus tree there are these
destructible<00:05:12.320> rocks<00:05:12.380> as<00:05:12.740> well<00:05:13.100> that<00:05:13.340> lead<00:05:13.669> to

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
destructible rocks as well that lead to

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.930 
destructible rocks as well that lead to
a<00:05:14.000> third<00:05:14.510> base<00:05:14.780> so<00:05:15.650> I<00:05:16.190> guess<00:05:16.400> not<00:05:16.729> it<00:05:16.910> just

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
a third base so I guess not it just

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.460 
a third base so I guess not it just
needs<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.330> be<00:05:17.360> wary<00:05:17.660> of<00:05:17.750> that<00:05:17.870> and<00:05:18.289> he<00:05:18.350> actually

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
needs to be wary of that and he actually

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.779
