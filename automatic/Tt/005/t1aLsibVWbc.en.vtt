00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.100
 And then people, beauty of the things that most 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.980
 once and gave today looks quite different from the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.070
 that the common I bring there is a video 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 it's not that I had is it koff 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.010
 modernity refers to those who do not know 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.449
 machine just do not have a good pc well one 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.539
 legal setup to play some 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.070
 games of this type entered the fusca and tals 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.810
 maybe you 're already proving why I 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.550
 open is also four 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.679
 keys hunting while they played this 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.690
 video and banking was in this next video 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.090
 has been special for some time and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.149
 since I started recording the channel I 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.070
 I only play then I have mw3 here I 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.280
 I do not even have skype and there's a lot 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.680
 of games and I play only two of them 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.360
 so I decided to record a different video 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.719
 but you can rest easy not to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.430
 make a mix in the video here on the channel 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.989
 because I think it would be a fucking lack 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.699
 because I know that the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.030
 expectation of who watches my channel 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.040
 sdpk is for 2010 I bring a video that the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.780
 sbt already complains imagination bring a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.900
 video of you biÃ© 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.299
 I think the staff will be very 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.750
 satisfied with that 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.400
 so what was going to make a new channel and me 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.189
 wanted to help you a name I thought the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.070
 we associate who occupies in access to the game 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.049
 or something but leave these tips the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.259
 fact is that you think I gave my name 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.400
 It's also the first time I play 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.100
 number 3 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.079
 I played but it will get a little bit 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.090
 here only obviously 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.130
 with five minutes and my big show 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.380
 the problem was to use and start 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.400
 again 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.470
 then bora one thing I'm one 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.750
 mw3 than the other species is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.600
 that when you push the subject where you were going 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.149
 download for example is the control 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.770
 It's not how much you hold her there. 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.960
 you press again then there is a 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.579
 statue with the mother not undermined 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.850
 here it will only rise again when 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:05.070
 tighten control of where this is a 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.000
 bit bad fps so I did not find the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.709
 shit to do and I want to serve 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.850
 also to test the image quality 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.520
 and sound 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.880
 a jingle recording the games I do not know 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:23.040
 How are you? This helmet goes out on 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.750
 there with the same tips on which games are 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.010
 would like to see this channel if it would be good 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.420
 make this channel 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.460
 and I'm doing mostly scale 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.560
 because 2d and I have said many times that 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.520
 does not play the publishing team through the channel and 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.780
 tals 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.730
 and lately the discussions of the forum and 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.370
 lots of rattlesnake collection 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.830
 deletes each application does nothing is 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.750
 in game today because such a lot of charge 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.220
 military be it any subject 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.510
 especially in a game that was to 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.540
 have fun 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.450
 he is charging me something to do the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.530
 pk or make radio then captive in tse 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.300
 I do not like it 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.940
 so for this reason you will play some 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.680
 other games to interest one 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.390
 Little bit 2 book is because if I stayed 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.460
 very just I have not had the goal is to get 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.300
 fill the bag I'll end up wanting 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.040
 stop 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.140
 and it's worse than I'm going to stop with the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.150
 channel I will not be able to continue without 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.620
 have something to pass on to you 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.050
 then so I'm recording and and 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.210
 this video making a new channel 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.750
 I do not want to take too long in this video. 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.970
 because it only announced the species is a 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:30.060
 cool guy 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:33.450
 the report pleases me to everyone does this 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.240
 to explain that he did not intend to play in 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.540
 various multiplayer single online games 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.760
 player and I would really like to know how 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.650
 I would go spitting on other games that 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.320
 dominates what I do not know is not a 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.750
 time b not a kind of beauty 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.240
 mastering Portuguese is good too, right? 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.050
 good, that's what you think 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.930
 did you think would be a good and 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.290
 If you create this channel, I hope 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.540
 I have the support of you there for the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.250
 disclosure and for registrants and that 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.900
 be a lot of voters saying that 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:18.049
 I only ask for after trying to kill him. 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.739
 with a stab stab I found the fan 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.750
 operated 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.520
 Well, that's it , I hope you 're enjoying it. 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.520
 and thanks
