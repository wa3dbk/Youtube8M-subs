Shani Davis I'm a huge fan of his and he

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.180 
Shani Davis I'm a huge fan of his and he
didn't<00:00:45.510> medal<00:00:45.840> I'm<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.469> hard<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> win<00:00:46.890> three

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
didn't medal I'm just hard to win three

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.729 
didn't medal I'm just hard to win three
gold<00:00:47.370> medals<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.570> 12<00:00:48.960> years<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.379> top
