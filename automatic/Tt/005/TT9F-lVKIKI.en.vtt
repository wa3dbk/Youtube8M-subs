it's<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.590> guess<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it's like a I guess is like a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.999 
it's like a I guess is like a
submersible<00:01:15.290> vehicle<00:01:16.290> or<00:01:16.680> something<00:01:16.950> like

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
submersible vehicle or something like

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.609 
submersible vehicle or something like
that<00:01:17.100> almost<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> submarine<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.960> think

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that almost like a submarine I think

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.070 
that almost like a submarine I think
this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.250> interesting<00:01:20.960> then<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
this is it's really interesting then of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020 
this is it's really interesting then of
course<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> pontoon<00:01:23.130> boat<00:01:23.430> which<00:01:23.820> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
