 hello everyone is welcome to 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.210
 this thirteenth episode of league of 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.860
 legends did you know this thirteenth 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.539
 episode will be specially devoted to 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.130
 our friend zac who has the ability to do 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.130
 so invisible mike in the jungle 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.680
 I explain myself when you are glued 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.120
 against the outer edge of the drake and that 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.680
 preferably you have the vision there 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.930
 you just need diagonal jobs from 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.580
 drake for that corn sachs last in 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.020
 being totally invisible to the enemy 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.620
 in front and so to humiliate them 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.620
 correctly 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.890
 this technique that I taught you 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.449
 previously is also possible nashor 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.219
 it's always the same principle 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.550
