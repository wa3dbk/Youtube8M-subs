00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 Fashion segment of the magazine from Sun to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.220
 good sun and for this Christian week 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.529
 is going to talk about what are the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.270
 more and skirts in what way we can look 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.829
 what and what kind of women are those who 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.660
 they can look depending on their type of 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.160
 body also then I would like me 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.809
 comment is a bit about that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.879
 trend in maxi skirts 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.469
 this is how the maxi skirt or the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.719
 long skirts as some people what 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.430
 know is a skirt that suddenly the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.530
 people think that only the high one can 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.239
 look true and it's not like that but 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.750
 also the casualties can look good 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.219
 Lamas and skirts are very versatile because 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.590
 I can use the day for both 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.940
 as for the night and at the same time 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.760
 make looks with different 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.799
 different style to say so the day of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.500
 today I prepare different concepts 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.400
 so that our viewers can 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.710
 know a little bit about what we are 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.040
 speaking truth here we have the part of 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.960
 back what a skirt a maxifalda 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.030
 we combine it with a jacket 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.180
 of jeans is a slightly more informal look 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.790
 a little more casual than at the same time you can 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.080
 use to go to the movies for example that 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.750
 the cinema has suffered for a little bit 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.090
 cold and the jeans jacket is processed and 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.030
 something pretty pretty fashionable 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.890
 Pretty fashion for this look too 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.560
 you can perfectly use the maxxis 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.880
 skirt for a baptism or a communion a 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.369
 activity a little more elegant than 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.649
 has in the day we put together another look in the 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.080
 skirt printed in light blue that 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.520
 we put a white blouse similar to the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.979
 fabric that I wear today 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.110
 put and that was done that way 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.750
 because when we use stamping in the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.280
 bottom part it is important not to load 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.130
 both the top part then you 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.470
 We put a white blouse that gives the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.899
 detail of elegance truth and at the same time 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.580
 gives the balance to the complete look for 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.510
 that is not so always loaded 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.520
 important 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.610
 on the subject of dressing when one uses 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.170
 a print up down goes solid or 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.170
 vice versa when you use a stamp 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.080
 up down it goes in solid too 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.030
 we put together another concept truth that is this 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.370
 that of the other skirt stamped with the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.230
 white blouse and the straw and in that to me 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.090
 would like to highlight a lot what the use 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.470
 Drawer sometimes people say 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.410
 how can I use the drawer with the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.900
 maximum and perfectly if one wants you 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.630
 enhance your waist then you can 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.150
 use a thick fajón which sweeps 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.150
 will visually cause greater 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.920
 attraction to the waist then it goes to 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.960
 Pull the eye and it's going to give it more shape 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.450
 by saying so the body highlight the 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.340
 waist or there are people who do not 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.320
 they have a lot of hip then what 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.240
 they want is visually make it look 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.980
 a little more expensive than true truth 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.870
 so what they do is use to 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.060
 fine young people and they use it in the part 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.010
 from below the waist I personally 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.930
 today he decided to use the bassoon 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.150
 fine on the top by the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.190
 waist but as many know I'm 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.290
 pregnant I'm waiting for baby then 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.550
 What I wanted was to highlight my waist 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.110
 because the pregnant woman what 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.740
 we need is to highlight 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.090
 figure because obviously others come 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.370
 other new curves in the body 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.830
 so it is always important 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.750
 highlight it also today 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.600
 we prepare with Christian here we have a 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.030
 Christian the model that comes with a 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.000
 look a bit hippie chic a little more 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.310
 casual as you can see she will 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.710
 We put him in a shirt 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.900
 lace and lace skirt having one 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.790
 Maxifalda with lace suddenly people 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.250
 You want to ask me a lot and I can 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.140
 combine the textures definitely 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.390
 yes, how can you see this look? 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.239
 very well very fashionable and they are 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.800
 combining both lace and lace in 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.080
 a hippie chic look that can be 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.090
 use both with platform and already 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.770
 is wearing today as well 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.200
 if you want to give a more casual approach 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.510
 you use your flash sandal that is without 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.250
 heels also the accessories that you 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.220
 can use in this particular you 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.350
 we put a long accessory a lot 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.780
 when we use solid shirts up 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.480
 the long accessory can look very good 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.000
 always the accessory is the one that you 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.030
 can give the pattern so you do it very 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.830
 or makes it more casual like the shoes 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.200
 they always set the tone if one wants to look 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.630
 something quite casual then the shoes 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.430
 Come on, they are super comfortable when one day a 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.890
 Saturday that does not want to be sent and look 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.770
 and comfortable walking the maxi skirts are a 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.170
 perfect and a perfect option you can 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.030
 true because I really could use them 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.770

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.000

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.730

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.710
 and walk well dressed and at the same time very 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.240
 appropriate for the occasion this is one of 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.370
 the big stitches of the maxi fault 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.080
