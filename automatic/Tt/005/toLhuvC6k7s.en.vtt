00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.260
 we are ready by evening 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.480
 with information about the forecast 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.860
 time we watch the satellite image 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.570
 which shows us how moisture flows 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.009
 coming from the gulf of mexico 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.390
 from the Pacific Ocean generate 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.279
 cloudy sky conditions in the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.450
 center and south of the country even this mind 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.980
 the probability of showers and activity 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.630
 electrical during the next hours 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.189
 towards the center of the national territory 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.560
 although these squalls are going to be maintained 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.689
 especially in mountainous areas in the 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.160
 East southeast of the country medium sky 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.509
 cloudy some rain has registered 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.329
 in a very isolated way we can 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.640
 observe that that front is maintained 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.930
 stationary from the north of the region 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.910
 now this Friday from the state of texas 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.410
 to the florida area generating 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.640
 conditions dispersed clouds and 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.380
 precipitation also of form 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.760
 dispersed so much with the state of texas 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.900
 as well as for the northeast of 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.940
 national territory towards Tamaulipas 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.290
 new lion and coahuila is still 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.640
 latent the probability of rain although 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.650
 very lightly only in 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.060
 some lapses this afternoon and also 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.710
 in the course of the night we can 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.420
 observe there are two systems very 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.270
 important to be highlighted by a 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.800
 part a cold front that is approaching 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.899
 towards the northwest of the territory 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.009
 national advancing through the southwest 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.450
 of the American union and that will be 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.760
 generating cloudiness conditions and 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.390
 rain from the next hours even 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.750
 also for tomorrow 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.580
 this next Friday and Saturday towards the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.200
 northwest of the republic above all is 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.610
 the area of ​​baja california north and 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.020
 also towards the sound area there is 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.060
 take it into account although this front 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 cold tends to dissipate little by little 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.570
 I comment the most remarkable thing without a doubt 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.360
 some in terms of the systems image 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.400
 is this frontal system would be the number 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.479
 14 of the season that is progressing to 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.710
 across the south and the center of the us and 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.820
 at least me is coming to the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.619
 north and northeast of the country in 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.960
 the course of the next days 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.030
 Generating important changes descents 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.530
 important in values even for 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.360
 some chihuaua points we hope 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.009
 temperatures below 0 degrees 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.229
 centigrade during the weekend 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.780
 the probability of snow or snow is latent 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.770
 of sleet so you have to extreme 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.080
 precautions 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.820
 We expect warm temperatures during 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.140
 the next days besides that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.700
 cold front as you go through the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.720
 northeast of the country will also be 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.520
 generating an increase in cloudiness 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.350
 and a very important decrease to the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.179
 values towards coahuila new lion and for 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.739
 course also towards the state of 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.150
 Tamaulipas is the cold front more 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.040
 strong that has been reported at least in 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.870
 this season so you have to take it 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.830
 account and be very aware of the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.570
 weather forecast I commented 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.220
 the probability of squalls is 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.080
 dormant during the next hours 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.060
 although in an isolated way also for the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.800
 tomorrow's day 12 the minimum 22 reaching 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.210
 in the course of the day half sky 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.500
 Cloudy with isolated showers 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.720
 Friday and Saturday temperatures 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.920
 stable minimums at 11 to 12 degrees and 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.740
 maximum that will be reaching near 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.850
 of 21 or 22 degrees Celsius in the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.560
 'sultana del norte' tomorrow 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.540
 we expect some fog banks of 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.130
 fog only during the first 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.770
 hours of the day in the afternoon we expect a 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.990
 cloudy mid- 18 sky with 26 the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.310
 values ​​that we expect on Friday wind 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.050
 from the north it begins to blow 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.450
 the cloudiness will increase 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.890
 We expected some rain at least already 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.510
 during the afternoon or during the night of 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.950
 Friday and temperatures are going to go 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.080
 down during the day maximum if 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.490
 let's go to the 25 degrees we add this 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.200
 this disc precisely because the value 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.120
 minimum we expect it already during the afternoon 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.220
 overnight at about 14 or 15 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.050
 degrees centigrade on Saturday the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.240
 cloudiness will continue the increase 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.670
 we wait for a completely closed sky 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.470
 rains in a generalized way that is 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.610
 for much of the Saturday without 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.810
 rule out that some of these 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.480
 precipitations are recorded from 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.370
 moderate to strong 14 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.920
 is going to be the maximum and this temperature the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.870
 we wait for the morning in some in 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.489
 some part of the afternoon will go down 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.370
 during the day to reach a minimum 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.989
 of 6 or 7 degrees Celsius this 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.580
 increase in cloud cover this decrease 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.989
 the values ​​is associated precisely to 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.060
 this cold front that already commented to him the 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.670
 number 14 of the season of the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.140
 temperatures will fall to the 5 or 6 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.970
 degrees centigrade during Sunday and 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.920
 Monday so you have to take it into account 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.910
 and be very aware of one more for 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.739
 the city ​​of monterrey but 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.690
 practically throughout the northeast of 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.370
 national territory I recommend 6 in 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.200
 the pearl tapatía the day of tomorrow sky 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.049
 completely sunny in guadalajara 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.940
 same for this next Friday while 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.530
 that Saturday is latent the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.269
 Chance of rain lightly 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.920
 in an occasional way already there 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.480

 we look forward to tomorrow a sky 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.129
 half cloudy with the probability of 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.480
 showers rather isolated 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.129
 less in querétaro on the scale and in the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.329
 area of ​​Cuernavaca prior to these 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.190

 reaching about 26 28 degrees 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.729
 for partly cloudy area oaxaca 13 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.560
 with 28 to the values ​​that we expect 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.870
 sunny in morelia equal for the area of 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.340
 Manzanillo showers enough 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.750
 isolated but generally dominating a 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.700
 partially cloudy cloudy sky 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.800
