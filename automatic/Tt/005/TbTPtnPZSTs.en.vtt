00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
interesting to see exactly what height

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.400 
interesting to see exactly what height
the<00:00:34.140> ball<00:00:34.440> went<00:00:34.650> through<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:35.220> Marx<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.410> quite

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.869 
the ball went through like Marx is quite
interested<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.309> height<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.670> ball

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879

went<00:00:39.090> through<00:00:45.080> there's<00:00:46.080> interesting<00:00:46.410> why

nice<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.160> suppose<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:48.120> question<00:00:48.269> what<00:00:48.600> would

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
nice I suppose the question what would

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
nice I suppose the question what would
ask<00:00:48.900> is<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.620> he<00:00:49.710> hit<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.040> was<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> shoulder

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
ask is when he hit it was it shoulder

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.500 
ask is when he hit it was it shoulder
height<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.760> infer<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.000> continued<00:00:54.420> its

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
height and infer that it continued its

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.939 
height and infer that it continued its
path<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.350> looking<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.890> probably

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
path but just looking there it probably

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.079 
path but just looking there it probably
would<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.280> been<00:00:56.370> above<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> shoulder

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
would have been above the shoulder

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.119 
would have been above the shoulder
height<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:57.900> little<00:00:58.470> bit<00:00:58.680> unlucky<00:00:58.799> I

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
height so really a little bit unlucky I

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.680 
height so really a little bit unlucky I
think<00:00:59.369> is<00:00:59.430> probably<00:00:59.549> the<00:00:59.850> way<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.269> describe

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
think is probably the way to describe

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.950 
think is probably the way to describe
that<00:01:00.750> dismissal<00:01:01.080> 14<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.890> 26<00:01:02.220> balls<00:01:02.960> South

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:14.650

day<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.760> think<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:32.200> looks<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.650> me<00:02:32.680> as<00:02:33.550> if<00:02:33.610> it's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
day I think it looks to me as if it's

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.390 
day I think it looks to me as if it's
right<00:02:34.600> in<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.110> in<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.770> middle<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.100> splice

Shoaib now being stretched out a little

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.130 
Shoaib now being stretched out a little
bit<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.450> don't<00:02:40.450> think<00:02:40.570> he's<00:02:40.750> got<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.930> problem

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
bit I don't think he's got a problem

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.110 
bit I don't think he's got a problem
there<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.830> crack<00:02:42.250> down<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.640> center<00:02:42.970> there

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
there a crack down the center there

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.520 
there a crack down the center there
looks<00:02:43.330> here<00:02:43.570> right<00:02:43.810> in<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.080> right<00:02:44.230> by<00:02:44.470> the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
looks here right in the right by the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.910 
looks here right in the right by the
splice<00:02:45.070> of<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.310> Baptist<00:02:45.760> where<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.920> massacre

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
splice of the Baptist where the massacre

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.380 
splice of the Baptist where the massacre
near<00:02:48.280> was<00:02:48.400> right<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.910> nothing<00:02:49.120> wrong<00:02:49.180> with<00:02:49.330> a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
near was right and nothing wrong with a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.900 
near was right and nothing wrong with a
bat<00:02:49.600> it's<00:02:49.959> just<00:02:50.230> where<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.770> handle<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.670> fact

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
bat it's just where the handle in fact

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.110 
bat it's just where the handle in fact
is<00:02:52.060> spliced<00:02:52.420> into<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> bat<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:55.000> that's

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
is spliced into the bat I think that's

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.420 
is spliced into the bat I think that's
often<00:02:55.600> happens<00:02:56.080> with<00:02:56.290> quick<00:02:56.800> bowlers<00:02:57.190> like

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
often happens with quick bowlers like

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.970 
often happens with quick bowlers like
show<00:02:57.820> your<00:02:57.970> back<00:02:58.120> toe<00:02:58.330> they<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:59.680> get<00:02:59.860> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
show your back toe they do get the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.470 
show your back toe they do get the
handle<00:03:02.130> away<00:03:03.130> from<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.520> bat<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.239> think

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
handle away from the bat and I think

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.820 
handle away from the bat and I think
that<00:03:04.600> was<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:05.020> pace<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.470> delivery

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
that was just the pace of the delivery

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.370 
that was just the pace of the delivery
early<00:03:06.130> on<00:03:06.280> maybe<00:03:06.520> eating<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.450> bat<00:03:07.630> quite<00:03:07.900> low

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
early on maybe eating the bat quite low

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.290 
early on maybe eating the bat quite low
early<00:03:08.860> on<00:03:11.640> explain<00:03:12.640> this<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:13.000> us

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
early on explain this to us

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.320 
early on explain this to us
well<00:03:14.020> I<00:03:14.110> think<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.440> show<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.580> obviously<00:03:15.760> with

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
well I think that show up obviously with

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.750 
well I think that show up obviously with
the<00:03:16.750> amount<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.230> base<00:03:18.070> that<00:03:18.280> he<00:03:18.340> generates

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
the amount of base that he generates

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.699 
the amount of base that he generates
puts<00:03:19.060> quite<00:03:19.270> a<00:03:19.300> lot<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.420> strain<00:03:20.170> on<00:03:20.200> his<00:03:20.440> lower

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
puts quite a lot of strain on his lower

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.860 
puts quite a lot of strain on his lower
back<00:03:20.950> nothing<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.420> what<00:03:22.570> he<00:03:22.660> was<00:03:22.720> trying

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
back nothing this is what he was trying

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.229 
back nothing this is what he was trying
to<00:03:23.020> keep<00:03:23.230> warm<00:03:23.470> whilst<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.700> times<00:03:24.940> about

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
to keep warm whilst the times about

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.270 
to keep warm whilst the times about
trying<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.540> keep<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.840> back<00:03:26.020> loose<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:27.220> you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
trying to keep the back loose so you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.490 
trying to keep the back loose so you
make<00:03:27.489> sure<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.790> next<00:03:28.000> deliveries<00:03:28.500> spot-on

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
make sure the next deliveries spot-on

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.530 
make sure the next deliveries spot-on
again<00:03:30.209> right<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.239> last<00:03:31.600> close<00:03:31.900> that

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
again right so last close that

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.390 
again right so last close that
on<00:03:34.540> strike<00:03:35.050> you<00:03:35.290> have<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> few<00:03:35.680> problems<00:03:36.130> with

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
on strike you have a few problems with

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.180 
on strike you have a few problems with
these<00:03:36.730> growing<00:03:37.090> isn't<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:38.440> right<00:03:38.650> glute<00:03:38.860> is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
these growing isn't that right glute is

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.610 
these growing isn't that right glute is
on<00:03:39.340> strike<00:03:39.640> two<00:03:39.880> stops<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.330> position<00:03:40.840> tearing

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
on strike two stops in position tearing

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.890 
on strike two stops in position tearing
away<00:03:41.740> again

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.910 

falling<00:03:48.319> shower<00:03:48.620> back

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
so his squad on target and furiously

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.720 
so his squad on target and furiously
passed<00:03:54.890> he's<00:03:55.890> brought<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.640> place<00:03:56.970> alive<00:03:58.730> not

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
passed he's brought this place alive not

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.720 
passed he's brought this place alive not
easy<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.870> let<00:04:01.050> these<00:04:01.260> Pakistanis<00:04:02.190> get<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.430> few

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
easy you let these Pakistanis get a few

once<00:04:13.820> again<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.270> length<00:04:14.450> is<00:04:14.750> very<00:04:15.110> very<00:04:15.350> good

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.259 
once again the length is very very good
I<00:04:15.800> mean<00:04:16.100> that's<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.459> same<00:04:16.700> link<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.000> got
