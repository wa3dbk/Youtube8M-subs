00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.960
 plot is today roger and this is the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.099
 report about parkour with the group 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.099
 emerging jim rogers 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.840
 the sprints and practice parkour how much 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.360
 prince how do you live the boat well I have 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.730
 5 years training parkour I've been 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.390
 from small very sickly to such a degree 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.430
 who sometimes suffered seizures and 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.800
 helped me to recover physically and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.390
 not be so sick apart from this for 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.390
 some physical problems that I had from 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.280
 coordination and others helped me to 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 remove me in sidor italy what I 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.420
 like to me are apart from the parkour in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 many extreme sports and what here 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.129
 it is not that it helps you all 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.030
 fundamentals in all sports goes 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.030
 being more or less this 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.789
 what does it mean for you to be another one? 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.539
 This is how the girls are told 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.640
 practice for which is how to feel 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.229
 more free or be able to do with your 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.030
 body more things that nobody tells you anything 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.830
 and what is your trick that best comes out 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.450
 right now I think the 360 process very 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.360
 well how long have you been practicing 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.880
 part like about a year or more 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.229
 less but good actually I know 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.320
 the guys like four years ago 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.580
 but as celoni as truth candle and 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.580
 just a year ago 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.660
 in half what it means to you to be a 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.880
 back so the boys are told that 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.390
 they practice parkour because for me to be a 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.740
 back comes off as a nickname if 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.350
 it's not like a symbol to me like that 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.540
 decides that after following someone who does not 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.830
 does what anybody does good for 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.290
 me and what is the best trick you get 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.140
 Well you see there are several but I like a 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.700
 special called mystic flip very 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.400
 well as how long you wear 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.050
 I've been practicing this sport for three years 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.930
 and a half 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.690
 practicing mauro for you what it means 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.600
 to make a butt be a butt is like 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.180
 a philosophy of life is a discipline 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.000
 in which you are progressing 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.950
 at your own pace you are improving 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.160
 overcoming obstacles overcoming fears 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.200
 that is what is really important 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.570
 surpass yourself getting better and go 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.680
 move forward more and more and more until 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.689
 that movement that displaces that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.450
 that fluency that you would like to have 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.700
 that is for me to be in this discipline 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.439
 constant improvement is like a discipline 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.450
 that you not only apply it on the boat 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:14.150
 but in your life in any aspect of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.890
 your life can improve even if it's 1% 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.890
 every day you can improve 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:25.550
 the precision highs are those jump 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.970
 from one portion of space to another and 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.560
 have as the 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.360
 the control over your body to stay 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.310
 in that space or to continue with the 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.560
 I trace this you can see it called the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.360
 screen before in the movies 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.210
 that jump from one building to another 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.330
 here we start in shorts in places 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.800
 shorts in short distances so that 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.590
 then since you do a million 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.690
 times when you are up or in a 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.220
 dangerous situation does not give you much 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.290
 fear gives you fear always scares you 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.340
 but it's like I already did a million 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.860
 times on the ground, three meters from 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.810
 height of 10 meters height is because what 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.840
 same no and how do I jump from 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.900
 precision you can do with both 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.200
 legs or with one leg you can start 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.570
 with both legs has you ducking 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.610
 lowering your center of gravity by pushing 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.000
 you with your hands and throwing your body 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.370
 of 100 versus that is after art of 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 little of goals you can measure the distance 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:30.280
 from your jump with feet 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.700
 you can write forward 1 2 3 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.980
 and you can put a brick any 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.260
 thing is good to practice the jumps 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.080
 of precision we will learn a 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.590
 movement that is called claw the 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.840
 movement will consist 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.850
 and so run 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.210
 support a foot with which you go to 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.210
 accommodate 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:05:00.150
 I have to do vote with tips to raise 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.150
 the knee and reaching with one foot is claw 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.970
 yes 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.970
 something very important in your journey 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.250
 backside is that you're going to have to fall to 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.530
 strong we are going to have to fall and for that 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.420
 we have what are called receptions the 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.920
 receptions are very important for 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.850
 avoid that your knees we have them 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.920
 the theory says you have to drop as much 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.820
 quietly possible between less 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:41.540
 listen better for that you're going to bend down 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.090
 you are going to jump and when your legs are going to 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.270
 go towards the towards your chest after 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:51.530
 you are going to push and it is like a small 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:55.810
 pass your legs do this and between 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.810
 do not listen to us better this jump 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.840
 yes 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.180
 the rolling is a tool of 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.270
 reception that is useful when you jump 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.550
 of a height that you consider dangerous 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.170
 like two or three meters so that the 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.440
 impact do not go on your knees 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.720
 only to transfer that force that 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.060
 you have when falling towards the movement that 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.280
 is the case roll as we do not know the 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.560
 quality of the surface on which you are going to 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.370
 fall let's do as a kind of 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.580
 diagonal line in the back in your 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.580
 back 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.720
 you can practice it looking like a blow 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.180
 here many accommodate different 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.670
 way you can put your hands like this you can 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.800
 throw a hit here you can 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.450
 throwing yourself like that is nothing more than you 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.130
 accommodates tries well I'm going to 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.620
 explain what the fund consists of 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.930
 basically when we are in a place 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.640
 very high and where it will not be with a 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.410
 simple reception and it is necessary to turn 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.860
 so that all the strength and pressure that 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:07.710
 has your body this go to this channel and 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.020
 c &amp; a denot with your body does not contain all 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.020
 that force and you hurt yourself 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:22.430
 ok let's see the speed the speed is 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.430
 one of the two basic classes of the boat 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.740
 yes 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.290
 rivas for you what it means to be a 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:38.560
 butt for me and being a butt is 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.510
 Take your body to places where nobody 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.540
 has led them to experience things 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.550
 new entity lina pledge also and 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.360
 what is the tri that the trick that you most 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.639
 like or salt 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.650
 I like it closer 

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:54.280
 how fine and how long is it 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:58.479
 modifying this sport two months 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.479
 thank you 

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.500
 yes no 

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.430
 and the cut
