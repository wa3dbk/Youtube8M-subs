00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:15.960
 also and found guys here mic this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.720
 is the fifth episode of the 14th 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.939
 first of all I say immediately that this 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.789
 episode will feature three 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.750
 matches with the bronze team of the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.070
 Australian alloy elodie built because 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 I forgot to film the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.170
 team and so I'll tell you right away 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.180
 however it is a normal team 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.989
 of the a league if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.899
 they call the Australian league short alligo 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.480
 a champion I remember a stuff of 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.640
 kind mum simple team 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.809
 the form is 4 5 1 and that's it 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.510
 let's say these are the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.329
 main features I chose 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.449
 this form against myself let's say 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.720
 because usually I don't choose but i 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.990
 modules that have less than two attackers 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.970
 with the bronze teams because in short 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.310
 bronze teams must must 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.049
 attack because with those players they are 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.180
 therefore fewer from more players you have 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.240
 more ahead and chance to score 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.520
 In fact, I recommend that is, there is a 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.689
 I recommend to always have a good 4 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.820
 always the three-man defense 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.710
 so let's say with a good 4 4 2 beautiful 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.110
 adjust with the attackers as well or 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.329
 maybe even a 4 3 3 with two wings 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.670
 beautiful and fast because but from you are the wings 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.430
 fast and defenders of the opponent are 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.840
 the president's game is almost already slow 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.149
 won because a long throw is enough for 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.310
 go get it because surely 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.590
 the opponent the bronze defender does not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.630
 knows if not at speed in addition to having 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.540
 speed does n't even have so much defense 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.920
 so maybe even position here 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.200
 then long throw goes to get it 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.159
 so I went a little against me too 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.500
 same because I saw that Australia 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.110
 he had good fast midfielders 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.239
 while he had few fast attackers and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.629
 so then I decided to put the 4 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.580
 5 1 which they know well for others 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.000
 it's practically here are four 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.950
 simple defenders two external one cc two 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.950
 coc trequartisti is a striker 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.379
 it will be a match there is an episode 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.180
 that will be the first to open the second 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.590
 so I am eliminated against this 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.590
 team that game you're seeing 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.910
 and then I play the third because I didn't want to 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.610
 already change team immediately after two 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.620
 so I decided to start again 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.480
 another giving we say another 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.450
 possibility this team though 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.190
 however I didn't like it so much I didn't 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.690
 looks like a fairly regular team 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.640
 there is in the norm 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:57.239
 the classic team that you do yourself 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.269
 no one knows what to choose and then yes 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.700
 wants to try let's say an experience 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.930
 del piero go to australia 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.180
 then you choose this team that is 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.310
 good and also quite fast though 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.330
 I advise you not to take them with this 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.310
 form for the reason I mentioned earlier 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.120
 in fact we really struggle to 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.200
 attack 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.090
 so let's say i got a little due 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.470
 engage in the attack phase a 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.560
 a little less defensive 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.090
 more than anything is the game I took 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.739
 more trouble in defense has been this 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.099
 because it's ok I had against 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.420
 england is that fast fast 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.670
 in front of fast attackers 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.810
 however, also in midfield a 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.680
 center field 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.079
 I was well made so I could do 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.170
 filter to take possession as much 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.829
 possession of the ball for the team of 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.480
 bronze if you can do it a minimum is 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:54.400
 we say essential because you can 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.269
 find the cue for the player for 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.930
 then throwing it I could do this 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.120
 so that is how the module is good 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.299
 the problem is precisely to succeed 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.390
 attack that is a bit difficult 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.909
 everything here so if you want to try it 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.549
 I also sail for advice because it's good 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.919
 there is a smooth beautiful fast and very fluid 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.859
 and the players at risk, that is, they are 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:24.039
 also quite good another thing that 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.490
 I wanted to tell you anyway before we say 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.590
 close with the episode this is one 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.450
 game that I win on penalties 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.220
 I have put you at the last mile towards solo 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.750
 the last rigor what I do for 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.700
 win because put them all on 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.840
 president would be two more 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.389
 minutes ends 4 to 4 if I'm not mistaken with 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.099
 his goal to the ninetieth that I already was 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.740
 I imagined myself going to play there 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.410
 the quarter-finals this makes me goals to 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.910
 ninetieth absolute go rigors and 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.240
 I wanted to say something else 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.729
 many of you have asked me for opinions 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.650
 on the ghana team as we had 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.380
 since in the episode he was very strong 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.260
 here I tell myself that probably indeed 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.789
 certainly the first episode of the ti 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.470
 like to win easy will be on the team 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.900
 of Ghana, however, that is enhanced 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.180
 the one with the rare brilliant players 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.810
 because I tried it on my account 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.510
 personal and is really really strong 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.460
 very very strong stronger than that 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.890
 normal, therefore probably rightly 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.050
 then you will see it I will also tell you the names of the 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.169
 players since we say that is 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.090
 the seat that this thing is for 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.210
 it is rigor to wring out the episode if 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.500
 I'm not wrong here 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.330
 when you sign up, please 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.380
 we feel tomorrow with a new one 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.380
 beautiful episode
