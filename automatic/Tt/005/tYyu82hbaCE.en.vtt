00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.050
 frying 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:37.770
 start making batter 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:38.820
 pacton mixing water uses a mixer 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.570
 with dough hooks 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.570
 nice to lay claim 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:57.239
 the stroke is ready can fill and through 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 I've been here Euros 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.879
 I have 15 minutes of violence in lukewarm water

 candied peel in small pieces I 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.000
 learned candied orange peel 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.690
 must have a round car that almost every 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.690
 sell supermarket 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.950
 I think well stirred batter now 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.479
 cover with plastic wrap 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.740
 then mash three quarters ice stays on 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.690
 room temperature 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.860
 not me in the cold place and draft free 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.990
 so not very old shed or be 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.250
 report has been raised nicely 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.810
 It is important to get it right after the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.429
 45 minutes to use because the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.929
 oliebollen otherwise I get too airy 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.009
 preheat the fryer with a clean one 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.360
 sunflower oil 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.860
 it is important to have sunflower oil 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.420
 use because if you were frying fat 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.950
 use in whitish layer one 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.750
 exterior of oliebollen and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 preheated at 190 degrees 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.469
 we are going to bake I use an ice scoop 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.670
 nice round shape 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.990
 it may also be 2 separate ones 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.549
 do spoons 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.140
 try to leave enough space in the pan 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.000
 so that the oil balls do not resist 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.950
 stick together and they turn themselves around 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.939
 on New Year's Eve like my father always was 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.979

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.480

 do not dry it with water or 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.209
 eating oil does not go very well together 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.700
