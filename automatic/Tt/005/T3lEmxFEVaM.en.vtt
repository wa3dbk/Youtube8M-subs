00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello, now I will show you how 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.040
 knit gum 2 by 2 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.880
 it looks like a gum 11 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.860
 but it happens that some products 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.430
 she looks gum two by two 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.949
 looks better means what as always 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.910
 we collect loops on two spokes so that they 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.910
 were not very tight 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.700
 10 loops 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:48.720
 take out one knitting needle 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.720
 with free from right and knit 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:02.160
 first knit 2 facial 2 facial loops 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:11.580
 2 purl is not now knitting 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:14.580
 purl loops again knit 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.580
 molded 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.479
 turn over knitting and repeat loops 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 by drawing here purl steel hinges 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.450
 facial facial loops and lore 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.970
 therefore we ended up with the wrong 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:55.770
 this side begin with facial loops 2 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.770
 do not know facial 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.680
 is divided 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.509
 you know 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:19.879
 and grow with you again look at 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:22.909
 picture to match drink here 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.849
 when you look at you can see both facial and 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.430
 purl and finishing facial mean 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.650
 start purl better of course 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.250
 always ends so calculate loops 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:39.910
 something always finish purl 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.910
 labor knitting looks better 2 facial and 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:52.420
 purl 2 purl 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.290
 if the last loop with any drawings 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.300
 Total provyazyvat wrong such 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:15.540
 knitting will be smooth and beautiful and comfortable 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:15.540
 connect parts of products and you know 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.430
 so knit as long as all the loops with 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.010
 left needles he goes to the right 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:43.080
 well here is our cabin gum 2 by 2 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:44.850
 it turns out the same from the face with 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.340
 wrong side because be careful and 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.340
 the edges will connect the parts of the product 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.290
 nothing complicated
