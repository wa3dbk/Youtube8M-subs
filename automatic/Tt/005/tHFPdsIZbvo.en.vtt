go underneath and 3 and 5 and then on
the<00:01:25.290> 7<00:01:25.680> I've<00:01:25.829> got<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> lot<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.280> alternatives<00:01:26.579> I

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the 7 I've got a lot of alternatives I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789 
the 7 I've got a lot of alternatives I
could<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.570> back<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.079> regular<00:01:28.470> basic

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
could just go back into a regular basic

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.530 
could just go back into a regular basic
but<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> think<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.700> kind<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.939> fun<00:01:30.150> since<00:01:30.360> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
but I think it's kind of fun since this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
but I think it's kind of fun since this
move<00:01:30.750> has<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.140> drama<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:32.040> you

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
move has a lot of drama to it as you

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.280 
move has a lot of drama to it as you
walk<00:01:32.369> around<00:01:32.549> pick<00:01:33.240> her<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.360> into<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.720> slightly

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
walk around pick her up into a slightly

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.569 
walk around pick her up into a slightly
closer<00:01:34.740> position<00:01:35.189> than<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> might<00:01:35.549> normally
