looping functions a lot of pedals now
have<00:00:22.890> gotten<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.400> many<00:00:23.580> features<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.510> quite

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
have gotten so many features that quite

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.990 
have gotten so many features that quite
frankly<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.890> live<00:00:26.070> environment<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.820> don't

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
frankly in a live environment we don't

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.029 
frankly in a live environment we don't
really<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.599> or<00:00:27.779> even<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.470> practice<00:00:28.830> room

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
really want or even in the practice room

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.740 
really want or even in the practice room
you<00:00:29.429> know<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:29.789> don't<00:00:29.970> always<00:00:30.179> want<00:00:30.539> drum

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
you know we don't always want drum

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.120 
you know we don't always want drum
machines<00:00:31.050> built-in<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> things<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
machines built-in and things like that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459

so<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.180> we've<00:00:33.300> got<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> really<00:00:34.050> stripped

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
what I wanted to show was a couple of

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.850 
what I wanted to show was a couple of
ideas<00:00:44.840> with<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.170> little<00:00:45.380> bit<00:00:45.470> of<00:00:45.560> creativity

using<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.430> RC<00:00:46.820> one<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:47.390> I've<00:00:47.480> actually<00:00:47.600> put<00:00:47.840> a

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
using the RC one so I've actually put a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.050 
using the RC one so I've actually put a
couple<00:00:48.200> of<00:00:48.290> extra<00:00:48.380> pedals<00:00:48.890> with<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:49.190> I've

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
couple of extra pedals with it I've

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.240 
couple of extra pedals with it I've
literally<00:00:50.330> got<00:00:50.450> just<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.200> guitar<00:00:51.320> going<00:00:51.890> into

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250

a<00:00:52.280> distortion<00:00:52.760> pedal<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:53.180> brand<00:00:53.450> you<00:00:53.510> once

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
a distortion pedal the brand you once

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.890 
a distortion pedal the brand you once
again<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.380> s<00:00:54.530> 1x<00:00:55.090> we've<00:00:56.090> got<00:00:56.270> my<00:00:56.420> old<00:00:56.570> tuner

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.990 
again the s 1x we've got my old tuner
pedal<00:00:56.930> my<00:00:57.380> octave<00:00:57.650> pedal<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.310> a<00:00:58.640> digital

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
pedal my octave pedal and a digital

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.320 
pedal my octave pedal and a digital
delay<00:00:59.560> so<00:01:00.560> basically<00:01:01.010> I<00:01:01.160> can<00:01:01.460> create<00:01:01.730> a

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
delay so basically I can create a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.410 
delay so basically I can create a
baseline<00:01:02.900> a<00:01:03.800> rhythm<00:01:04.400> guitar<00:01:04.730> line<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.270> then

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
baseline a rhythm guitar line and then

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.110 
baseline a rhythm guitar line and then
play<00:01:05.780> solos<00:01:06.260> over<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.650> top<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.100> we<00:01:07.850> start

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
play solos over the top and we start

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.970 
play solos over the top and we start
recording<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:09.320> I'll<00:01:09.440> put<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.680> bit<00:01:09.800> of<00:01:09.890> rhythm

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
recording and I'll put a bit of rhythm

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.350 
recording and I'll put a bit of rhythm
guitar<00:01:10.340> down<00:01:10.520> first

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.990 
I turn the octave pedal on now
we're<00:01:33.440> in<00:01:33.530> over<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:33.920> moat<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.490> anything<00:01:34.880> I

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
we're in over the moat so anything I

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.060 
we're in over the moat so anything I
play<00:01:35.270> will<00:01:35.600> add<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:36.050> this

control<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.670> level<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.329> loop

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
control so this is the level of the loop

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.380 
control so this is the level of the loop
coming<00:02:54.930> out<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:56.069> set<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.459> in

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
coming out so you can just set that in

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.170 
coming out so you can just set that in
advance<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:58.079> get<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.769> good<00:02:58.950> balance<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.819> this

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
advance to get a good balance in this

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.879 
advance to get a good balance in this
particular<00:03:00.450> case<00:03:00.840> I've<00:03:01.049> got<00:03:01.079> it<00:03:01.290> set<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.590> that

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
particular case I've got it set so that

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.069 
particular case I've got it set so that
the<00:03:02.099> level<00:03:02.579> pretty<00:03:03.120> much<00:03:03.329> matches<00:03:03.629> what's

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
the level pretty much matches what's

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.319 
the level pretty much matches what's
coming<00:03:04.379> out<00:03:04.469> of<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> guitar<00:03:04.920> over<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:06.000> we've

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
coming out of the guitar over here we've

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.240 
coming out of the guitar over here we've
basically<00:03:06.540> got<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:06.989> screen<00:03:07.319> which<00:03:08.010> you'll<00:03:08.189> see

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
basically got a screen which you'll see

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.220 
basically got a screen which you'll see
was<00:03:08.639> it's<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.879> operation<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.900> start<00:03:10.139> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
was it's in operation if I start the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.429 
was it's in operation if I start the
loop<00:03:10.349> station<00:03:11.180> it's<00:03:12.180> now<00:03:12.329> recording<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.290> we'll

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
loop station it's now recording so we'll

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.740 
loop station it's now recording so we'll
see<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.400> red<00:03:14.700> indicators<00:03:15.209> going<00:03:15.419> round<00:03:15.540> and

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
see the red indicators going round and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.270 
see the red indicators going round and
round<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.019> round<00:03:16.079> although<00:03:16.709> I'm<00:03:16.799> not<00:03:16.919> playing

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
round and round although I'm not playing

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.830 
round and round although I'm not playing
any<00:03:17.430> guitar<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.970> if<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.329> touch<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.599> pedal

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
any guitar and if I touch the pedal

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.800 
any guitar and if I touch the pedal
again<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.829> goes<00:03:20.040> into<00:03:20.430> overdub<00:03:21.030> mode<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.659> now

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
again it goes into overdub mode so now

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.229 
again it goes into overdub mode so now
it's<00:03:21.989> basically<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:22.680> can<00:03:22.799> see<00:03:23.129> it<00:03:23.549> following

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
it's basically we can see it following

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.210 
it's basically we can see it following
the<00:03:24.389> recording<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.109> red<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.409> green<00:03:25.620> recording

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
the recording so red and green recording

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.449 
the recording so red and green recording
over<00:03:26.400> them<00:03:26.659> if<00:03:27.659> I<00:03:27.780> hit<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:27.930> again<00:03:28.099> it's<00:03:29.099> just

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
over them if I hit it again it's just

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.129 
over them if I hit it again it's just
simply<00:03:29.790> playback<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.599> we'll<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.870> see<00:03:31.049> it

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
simply playback so we'll just see it

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.080 
simply playback so we'll just see it
green<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:32.370> length<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.790> loop<00:03:32.939> is

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
green and the length of the loop is

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.509 
green and the length of the loop is
indicated<00:03:33.659> by<00:03:33.689> the<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.560> clockwise<00:03:34.919> rotation

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
indicated by the the clockwise rotation

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.729 
indicated by the the clockwise rotation
of<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.120> indicators<00:03:36.629> if<00:03:37.349> I<00:03:37.500> press<00:03:37.709> the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
of the the indicators if I press the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.399 
of the the indicators if I press the
button<00:03:38.069> again<00:03:38.419> we<00:03:39.419> go<00:03:39.540> back<00:03:39.569> to<00:03:39.750> overdub<00:03:40.199> mode

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
button again we go back to overdub mode

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.080 
button again we go back to overdub mode
so<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.799> will<00:03:40.979> switch<00:03:41.220> backwards<00:03:41.669> and<00:03:41.790> forwards

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
so it will switch backwards and forwards

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.509 
so it will switch backwards and forwards
and<00:03:42.269> it's<00:03:42.750> instantaneous<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.190> can<00:03:44.340> drop

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
and it's instantaneous so you can drop

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.309 
and it's instantaneous so you can drop
in<00:03:44.879> and<00:03:45.209> drop<00:03:45.449> out<00:03:45.829> at<00:03:46.829> will<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:48.269> stop<00:03:48.510> we<00:03:49.169> hit

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
in and drop out at will to stop we hit

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.119 
in and drop out at will to stop we hit
the<00:03:49.379> pedal<00:03:49.799> twice<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:50.430> then<00:03:51.030> two<00:03:51.209> arrays<00:03:52.129> we

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
the pedal twice and then two arrays we

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.270 
the pedal twice and then two arrays we
hold<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.489> pedal<00:03:53.639> for<00:03:53.909> two<00:03:54.030> seconds

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
hold the pedal for two seconds

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.530 
hold the pedal for two seconds
so<00:03:56.280> basically<00:03:56.549> we're<00:03:56.760> back<00:03:56.879> to<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> clean<00:03:57.269> slate

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
so basically we're back to a clean slate

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.180 
so basically we're back to a clean slate
again<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.049> if<00:03:58.169> I<00:03:58.229> demoed<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.680> very<00:03:58.919> quickly

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
again so if I demoed that very quickly

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.650 
again so if I demoed that very quickly
with<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> little<00:03:59.790> look

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.140 

I'm<00:04:05.470> just<00:04:05.680> going<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:05.980> look<00:04:06.220> it's<00:04:06.520> now<00:04:06.700> an<00:04:06.910> over

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
I'm just going to look it's now an over

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.140 
I'm just going to look it's now an over
dog<00:04:07.710> but<00:04:08.710> I'm<00:04:08.800> not<00:04:08.920> playing<00:04:09.160> anything<00:04:09.460> so<00:04:09.970> if<00:04:10.060> I

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
dog but I'm not playing anything so if I

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.880 
dog but I'm not playing anything so if I
just<00:04:10.300> wanted<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.630> jam<00:04:10.810> over<00:04:11.140> this<00:04:11.290> scene<00:04:11.710> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
just wanted to jam over this scene and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.560 
just wanted to jam over this scene and
uh<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.460> know<00:04:12.550> I'm<00:04:12.610> practicing<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.270> song<00:04:18.570> kind

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
uh you know I'm practicing a song kind

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.230 
uh you know I'm practicing a song kind
of<00:04:19.660> cool<00:04:19.860> so<00:04:20.860> I<00:04:20.890> could<00:04:21.130> record<00:04:21.280> that

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
of cool so I could record that

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:35.650 
of cool so I could record that
[Music]

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.670 

it<00:04:36.660> will<00:04:36.780> take<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.169> last<00:04:37.350> thing<00:04:37.560> I've

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
it will take the last thing I've

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.249 
it will take the last thing I've
recorded<00:04:38.009> off<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:39.300> basically<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.990> that

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
recorded off so basically that that

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.620 
recorded off so basically that that
little<00:04:40.860> tap<00:04:41.070> in<00:04:41.250> there<00:04:41.400> removed<00:04:41.789> the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
little tap in there removed the

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.969 
little tap in there removed the
recording<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.139> put<00:04:43.289> on<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.470> top<00:04:43.650> and

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
recording that I put on the top and

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.460 
recording that I put on the top and
that's<00:04:44.669> basically<00:04:45.150> everything<00:04:45.479> you<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.289> do

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
that's basically everything you can do

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.070 
that's basically everything you can do
with<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:47.130> loop<00:04:47.280> station<00:04:47.550> without<00:04:48.539> adding<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
with the loop station without adding the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.550 
with the loop station without adding the
extra<00:04:49.259> pedal<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:50.310> fs7<00:04:50.970> though<00:04:51.389> really<00:04:52.289> does

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
extra pedal the fs7 though really does

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.860 
extra pedal the fs7 though really does
help<00:04:53.130> with<00:04:53.250> creativity<00:04:53.669> a<00:04:53.850> little<00:04:54.150> bit<00:04:54.270> all

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
help with creativity a little bit all

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.990 
help with creativity a little bit all
this<00:04:55.020> is<00:04:55.199> actually<00:04:55.350> doing<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:56.039> it<00:04:56.520> allows<00:04:56.759> me

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
this is actually doing is it allows me

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.810 
this is actually doing is it allows me
to<00:04:57.210> do<00:04:57.360> a<00:04:57.389> complete<00:04:58.229> stop<00:04:58.530> with<00:04:59.070> one<00:04:59.310> tap<00:04:59.610> of

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
to do a complete stop with one tap of
