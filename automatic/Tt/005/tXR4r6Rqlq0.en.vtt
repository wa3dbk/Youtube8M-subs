00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.519
 si 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.080
 we now have the meat temperature 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.580
 let in the core has 20 degrees that makes us 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.580
 the same time came much easier 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.920
 to ensure uniform then 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.299
 I turn to about one and a half 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:27.149
 minutes the piece the very first time 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.149
 Again, until consumption 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.000
 the bathroom is good and we do one in parallel 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.930
 the easiest way to land how to get to 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.939
 steak can do 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.009
 we have salad hearts i just have 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.810
 halves it is now also at the same time 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.599
 a little bit of the pain 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.920
 they go in very carefully and then 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.290
 will be the barbecue 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.739
 that is nothing new but that is 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.340
 just always delicious one 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.510
 salt on top of that as well 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.209
 just to upgrade a bit 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.709
 I have umbrellas and we'll throw them 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.010
 Just need this area here 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.810
 and facts that are pretty crisp from the whole 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.400
 field will leak out so this 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.160
 have beautiful expressed patrick 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.690
 what he is marinated with becomes everything 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.989
 whole story still the necessary seasoning 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.989
 give
