00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.890
 hi to all the guys welcome in 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.350
 this new unboxing video today 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.559
 specifically I want to introduce you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.969
 this kit for the nature of the body and the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.309
 face 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.039
 initial premise I am not an expert in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.529
 this area as it is the first 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.880
 razor that I buy or better than me 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.240
 they gave because I wanted it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.900
 buy from time and therefore as su 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.810
 youtube 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.000
 I have not found videos about it 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.750
 unboxing of this product I thought 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.670
 good to load one yo so that 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 can fill this gap there is on 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.870
 youtube 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.719
 then it will be a video as mentioned 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.870
 quite general demonstration of the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.670
 product and end as it is now in the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.270
 I can't tell you more than that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.640
 which is specified in the box 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.110
 but maybe then with the use if you want 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.550
 ask me some mediapro questions 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:05.519
 respond better then let's start right away 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:08.610
 from the model the RGG y 10 cm model that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.350
 this razor would be bigger here 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.119
 in addition to this in the kit in question 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.869
 we find this panasonic and rg n 30 which 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.040
 serves for the nose and eyelashes to how much 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.680
 I have seen is a 7 in 1 kit 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.540
 or it includes inserts that later 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.740
 we will see that they allow you to 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.880
 shave any part of your body 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.210
 as you can see here specifically 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.170
 beard hair 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.299
 body the body in short and the parts we say 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.180
 intimate and armpits 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.600
 then let's see for a moment the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.930
 features that are listed in 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.330
 this box then cut length 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.399
 adjustable from 3 6 9 12 15 mm 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.440
 I don't know if he sees us very well but I am 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.690
 recording with the iphone for the galaxy 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.090
 yesterday the screen broke and so it is 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.739
 then went about 0 5 mm without comb 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.890
 accessory so if you use it without 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:22.370
 rasa insert at 0.5 mm approx 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:26.120
 washable and both the main one and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.690
 the other for the nose and so on 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.780
 both are water resistant 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.420
 here he shows me all the inserts that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.110
 you can use comprehensive basic for 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.070
 reposition the tools afterwards 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.160
 use and also acts as a battery charger 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.329
 having said that I would say to move on to see 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.329
 inside the package 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.570
 then 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:04.840
 we open we find apart we say the 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:10.490
 machine so I find the usual sheets 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:17.720
 then we have a manual for the r 200 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:20.660
 ign 30 of 160 pages about Italian 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:27.110
 There is of course what we find here then 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:30.830
 the manual for the other razor and rjc y 10 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.370
 cm always italy is not inclusive in 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.930
 this manual is about 123 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:42.170
 pages we find the warranty sheet 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:47.510
 then find also a small sheet that 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:52.310
 reminds you to always oil we say it 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.390
 the head before and after each use by 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.560
 guarantee a longer duration for the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.410
 your appliance well beyond this 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.680
 now let's see what it contains 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.690
 the packaging even if we already have 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.660
 quoted before 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.280
 well then we have the oil I have 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.230
 talked two minutes ago 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:22.280
 indeed even less to oil the tool 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.010
 then find a comb with which 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:32.980
 you will go to remove any hair that 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:36.970
 remain between say what they are called 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.970
 in short, inside the razor 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:46.970
 then we find the peace you can 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.900
 support your razor as I have 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.990
 said earlier it also serves as a loader 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.240
 then find yourself waiting for me to leave 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.290
 a moment with the frame found 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.169
 this door and inserts in which now 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.210
 cause we're going to see what that 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.210
 you can connect 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:23.039
 to the charging base 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:27.900
 now I don't know in any way 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:29.719
 now I do not know so I believe even those who do not 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:35.039
 I love very much staying 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:39.590
 here it is then we find the course 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:44.509
 razor equipped with a 1.2 times daughter 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.509
 internal already functioning 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.190
 the food insert like I said before 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.520
 so it's also easy to clean 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.520
 removal 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:01.740
 to insert it is even easier enough 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:05.849
 get it into the reject you put 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.919
 here and he recharges the note from the led 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.580
 which will turn on when you put it on 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.500
 charge this hole behind serves can 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.650
 allow us the oil 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:21.889
 or you can put the other one 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.889
 this is the accessory 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.750
 this one is not equipped with batteries as there is 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.120
 written in the packaging and polish here 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.080
 if you put a rechargeable battery you can 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.330
 also use him also from the 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:42.419
 charging station also for this 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:46.650
 finally, there are four such tools 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:49.589
 body hair for beard inserts 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:53.969
 and the private parts that must be positioned 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:55.800
 here so that you always have them 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:59.069
 within reach without the werder e 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.199
 out of the box and that's all guys 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:04.889
 we say there is nothing else to do with you 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:06.779
 see now I haven't tried it yet 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.529
 so I can't give you my first 

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:10.830
 impressions 

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:15.540
 but I repeat when sony that always 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:19.050
 a brand that makes good products 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:23.070
 quality so i think it's a good one 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:26.070
 product later I will publish if me 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:28.740
 asks for a video about it 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.830
 my impressions of this razor for the 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.440
 moment I leave you if there are questions 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:37.260
 doubt what you want 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.000
 bring them down in the video and I will 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.500
 I will reply as soon as possible 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.500
 a greeting and the next
