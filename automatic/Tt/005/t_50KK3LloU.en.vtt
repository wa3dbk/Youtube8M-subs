in a way that would be sort of
immediately<00:00:48.780> recognizable<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.590> Tokyo<00:00:49.980> being

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.099 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a
vast<00:00:53.629> agglomeration<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:56.360> urban<00:00:57.360> scape<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
vast agglomeration of of urban scape and
it<00:00:58.859> certainly<00:00:59.100> stretches<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.910> out

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it certainly stretches all the way out

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.900 
it certainly stretches all the way out
to<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.230> east<00:01:01.469> coast<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.219> as
