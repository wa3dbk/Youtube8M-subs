00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello everyone, welcomes you not dms 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.969
 Today came another package wrapped with 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.120
 China 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:27.590
 I do not know China just surprises 12 days 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:38.520
 I quickly ordered this for myself 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:40.730
 sj4000 action camera gas monopod 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.730
 telescopic 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.829
 before coffee 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 packed and the Chinese do not regret any 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.750
 cellophane is not boring for that i am so for 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750
 myself 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:21.170
 good neater do it like this 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:28.460
 here aside so what we mean in 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:32.300
 the original packaging comes but the packaging 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:38.780
 Naturally a little crumpled this is not the kind 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:42.850
 and we also come with an adapter 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.710
 specially reinforced on action camera 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.720
 that is, it is a universal fit as well 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:56.660
 itself as well as j so 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:09.890
 suitable for goupro 1 2 3 that is, on any 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:13.000
 we look at the vertices of the monopod itself 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.000
 wants to get anything 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:31.069
 so he means it looks like this 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.110
 the size of it folded me dark 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:45.440
 here about 20 centimeters probably a little 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:51.459
 less rolling so -called 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:54.670
 sample adapter 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.670
 deploy you 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:11.569
 2000 is not all here about a meter so I 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.620
 I will say I can not show completely 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:21.230
 there will be more videos there I think to see him 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.830
 work in use try 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.830
 attach camera 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.610
 dress up 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.320
 so now the groove is set to something not 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.700
 coming out 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:03.620
 let's see what happened here itself 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.100
 design assembly I will immediately say here it is necessary 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.350
 to put 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.480
 some kind of seal because all the same 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.600
 the mount itself 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.600
 that is, the adapter does not reach the end 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.230
 the grounds that is, they get a gap 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.460
 and that is, it turns right to the left 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.320
 have to twist the ends of the means 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:32.140
 need to put some gasket here 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:39.760
 here so here everything is fixed well 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:43.850
 that is, monopod itself so let's say 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.400
 average quality I think for the night 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.170
 eat and get 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.350
 Well, this is so for the time being for the first time 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:56.750
 well, everything will come down for now 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:01.280

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.669

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.669
