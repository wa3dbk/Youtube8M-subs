I have no idea so from what I can gather
which<00:01:27.880> frankly<00:01:28.300> isn't<00:01:28.540> much<00:01:28.930> this<00:01:29.619> is<00:01:29.800> a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
which frankly isn't much this is a

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.770 
which frankly isn't much this is a
puzzle<00:01:30.520> game<00:01:30.550> in<00:01:30.759> which<00:01:31.060> players<00:01:31.390> have<00:01:31.630> to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
puzzle game in which players have to

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.890 
puzzle game in which players have to
clear<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.050> maze<00:01:32.350> with<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:33.009> blind<00:01:33.790> freaking<00:01:34.540> stick

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
clear a maze with a blind freaking stick

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.990 
clear a maze with a blind freaking stick
is<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.740> most<00:01:35.920> ridiculous<00:01:36.280> thing<00:01:36.580> ever

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
is the most ridiculous thing ever

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.700 
is the most ridiculous thing ever
of<00:01:37.090> course<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.450> catch<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:38.350> stick

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
of course the catch is that that stick

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.530 
of course the catch is that that stick
is<00:01:38.890> constantly<00:01:39.430> spinning<00:01:39.759> so<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.330> move

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
is constantly spinning so to move

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.999 
is constantly spinning so to move
through<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.869> maze<00:01:41.020> without<00:01:41.200> crashing<00:01:41.890> into

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
through the maze without crashing into

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.440 
through the maze without crashing into
walls<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.820> have<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.090> be<00:01:43.650> not<00:01:44.650> me<00:01:45.360> terrible<00:01:46.360> at

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
walls you have to be not me terrible at

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.240 
walls you have to be not me terrible at
this<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.810> know<00:01:47.110> there's<00:01:47.409> an<00:01:47.530> easy<00:01:47.680> mode<00:01:47.920> but

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
this I know there's an easy mode but

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:57.419 
this I know there's an easy mode but
I'll<00:01:48.370> be<00:01:48.520> damned<00:01:48.820> if<00:01:49.000> I<00:01:49.150> can<00:01:49.390> find<00:01:49.600> it

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.700 

despite<00:01:58.429> me<00:01:58.609> lacking<00:01:59.119> even<00:01:59.569> a<00:01:59.840> fraction<00:02:00.499> of

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
despite me lacking even a fraction of

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.700 
despite me lacking even a fraction of
the<00:02:00.890> required<00:02:01.310> patients<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.810> otaku<00:02:03.289> miss

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
the required patients and the otaku miss

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.499 
the required patients and the otaku miss
that's<00:02:04.009> required<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.609> play<00:02:04.789> this<00:02:05.000> thing<00:02:05.270> I

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
that's required to play this thing I

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.510 
that's required to play this thing I
really<00:02:05.959> like<00:02:06.140> kuririn<00:02:06.709> as<00:02:06.859> a<00:02:06.890> puzzle<00:02:07.219> game

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
really like kuririn as a puzzle game

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.490 
really like kuririn as a puzzle game
it's<00:02:07.729> totally<00:02:08.360> unique<00:02:08.509> but<00:02:09.049> it's<00:02:09.140> almost<00:02:09.319> a

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
it's totally unique but it's almost a

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.949 
it's totally unique but it's almost a
genre<00:02:09.890> unto<00:02:10.190> itself<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:11.030> much<00:02:11.330> more<00:02:11.540> complex

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
genre unto itself it's much more complex

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.990 
genre unto itself it's much more complex
than<00:02:12.230> most<00:02:12.260> traditional<00:02:12.620> puzzle<00:02:13.340> games<00:02:13.519> which

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
than most traditional puzzle games which

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.420 
than most traditional puzzle games which
means<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:14.720> also<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:15.019> lot<00:02:15.230> more<00:02:15.379> difficult<00:02:15.860> you

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
means it's also a lot more difficult you

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.550 
means it's also a lot more difficult you
see<00:02:16.549> a<00:02:16.760> game<00:02:17.120> like<00:02:17.299> Tetris<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:17.959> more<00:02:18.170> mental

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
see a game like Tetris is more mental

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.559 
see a game like Tetris is more mental
than<00:02:18.590> physical<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.819> say<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.299> takes

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
than physical that is to say it takes

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.690 
than physical that is to say it takes
more<00:02:20.810> thinking<00:02:21.260> than<00:02:21.440> reflexes<00:02:22.099> although<00:02:22.549> it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
more thinking than reflexes although it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.089 
more thinking than reflexes although it
certainly<00:02:22.849> requires<00:02:23.209> both<00:02:23.810> but<00:02:24.319> with<00:02:24.470> kuririn

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
certainly requires both but with kuririn

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.890 
certainly requires both but with kuririn
