to<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.650> some<00:01:22.830> exhaust<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.610> have

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
to have to have some exhaust so we have

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
to have to have some exhaust so we have
two<00:01:23.880> large<00:01:24.270> exhaust<00:01:24.720> ports<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.259> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
two large exhaust ports in the back that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.249 
two large exhaust ports in the back that
come<00:01:26.189> right<00:01:26.430> off<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.030> tail<00:01:27.270> which<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.229> a

come right off of the tail which is a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.010 
come right off of the tail which is a
perfect<00:01:28.740> scenario<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.490> draw<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.630> tail

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
perfect scenario for a draw that tail

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.569 
perfect scenario for a draw that tail
helps<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.470> create<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.799> good<00:01:31.979> draw<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.520> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
helps to create a good draw out of a

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.640 
helps to create a good draw out of a
helmet<00:01:32.909> helps<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> pull<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.990> heat<00:01:34.259> through

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
helmet helps to pull that heat through

helmet helps to pull that heat through
and<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> helmet<00:01:36.380> internally<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.520 
and out of the helmet internally on this
helmet<00:01:37.829> there's<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.340> whole<00:01:38.520> matrix<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:39.530> vent

helmet there's a whole matrix of vent

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.280 
helmet there's a whole matrix of vent
channels<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.310> holes<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.720> from<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
channels and holes that go from the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.899 
channels and holes that go from the
outside<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> inside<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.640> literally

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
outside of the inside you can literally

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.460 
outside of the inside you can literally
look<00:01:45.240> through<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.540> helmet<00:01:45.930> into<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> light

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
look through this helmet into the light

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.100 
look through this helmet into the light
and<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> holes<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.840> through

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and you can see the holes going through

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.600 
and you can see the holes going through
the<00:01:49.259> entire<00:01:49.530> system

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the entire system

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
the entire system
those<00:01:51.330> holes<00:01:51.600> basically<00:01:52.200> obviously<00:01:52.860> create

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
those holes basically obviously create

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.230 
those holes basically obviously create
an<00:01:54.150> escape<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.810> heat<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:56.580> pathway<00:01:57.210> for

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
an escape for heat and a pathway for

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.170 
an escape for heat and a pathway for
cool<00:01:57.750> air<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.020> come<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.580> if<00:01:59.580> one<00:01:59.760> thing<00:01:59.970> really

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
cool air to come in if one thing really

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.900 
cool air to come in if one thing really
bothers<00:02:00.570> me<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.900> when<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.080> helmet<00:02:01.640> shows<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> lot

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
bothers me is when a helmet shows a lot

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.430

of<00:02:12.780> my<00:02:12.960> peeves<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.620> when<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.070> helmet

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
of my peeves is when you have a helmet

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.470 
of my peeves is when you have a helmet
and<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.240> don't<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:16.370> way<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.430> keep<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.960 
and you don't have a way to keep the
comfort<00:02:19.170> liner<00:02:19.320> from<00:02:19.530> blocking<00:02:19.980> vents<00:02:20.580> so

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
comfort liner from blocking vents so

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.160 
comfort liner from blocking vents so
you'll<00:02:21.180> notice<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.600> lot<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.840> helmets<00:02:22.080> on<00:02:22.140> the

padding<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.590> inside<00:02:25.700> when<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.730> put<00:02:26.970> your

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
padding on the inside when you put your

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.120

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
head in its going to push on that foam

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.470 
head in its going to push on that foam
that<00:02:29.310> foam<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.820> collapse<00:02:30.060> into

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
that foam is going to collapse into

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.870 
that foam is going to collapse into
those<00:02:30.690> vent<00:02:31.590> channels<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.550> block<00:02:32.760> them

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
those vent channels and just block them

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.520 
those vent channels and just block them
off<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.570> no<00:02:33.690> matter<00:02:33.810> how<00:02:34.020> many<00:02:34.170> holes<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.470> on

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
into the vent channels and blocking them

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.050 
into the vent channels and blocking them
off<00:02:38.220> you're<00:02:38.459> never<00:02:38.610> going<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.850> get<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
off you're never going to get the

this helmet the liner basically works
around<00:02:43.950> those<00:02:44.190> channels<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.060> nothing<00:02:45.720> is

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
around those channels so that nothing is

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.210 
around those channels so that nothing is
