tank and as soon as malygos lands you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.590 
tank and as soon as malygos lands you
should<00:00:55.949> use<00:00:56.129> beast<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.579> raft<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.480> is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
should use beast your raft this is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.580 
should use beast your raft this is
because<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:59.070> could<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> once<00:01:00.590> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
because you could use it and once the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.130 
because you could use it and once the
cool<00:01:02.280> down<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.699> few<00:01:02.879> Sarathy<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.359> done<00:01:03.570> you'll

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
cool down a few Sarathy is done you'll

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
cool down a few Sarathy is done you'll
be<00:01:04.290> able<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> use<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.280> again<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.299> have

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
be able to use it again when you have

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300

some<00:01:06.600> power<00:01:06.750> spark<00:01:07.200> buffs<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.799> I'll<00:01:08.100> show<00:01:08.280> you

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
some power spark buffs and I'll show you

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
some power spark buffs and I'll show you
that<00:01:08.490> later<00:01:08.990> every<00:01:09.990> once<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.350> while<00:01:10.530> Malygos

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that later every once in a while Malygos

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.700 
that later every once in a while Malygos
will<00:01:11.430> force<00:01:12.390> everyone<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> vortex<00:01:13.200> which

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
will force everyone into a vortex which

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.420 
will force everyone into a vortex which
spins<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.189> round<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.670> round<00:01:16.159> what<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.250> need

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
spins you round and round what you need

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640 
spins you round and round what you need
to<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> hunter<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> disengaged<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.500> that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
to do as a hunter is disengaged so that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.830 
to do as a hunter is disengaged so that
you're<00:01:19.790> somewhat<00:01:20.790> far<00:01:21.060> away<00:01:21.210> from<00:01:21.270> ala<00:01:21.570> ghosts

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you're somewhat far away from ala ghosts

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.859 
you're somewhat far away from ala ghosts
because<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.350> you're<00:01:22.470> too<00:01:22.619> close<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.869> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
because if you're too close then you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.020 
because if you're too close then you
might<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.080> forced<00:01:25.560> into<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.950> melee<00:01:26.460> range<00:01:26.729> in

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
might be forced into a melee range in

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.359 
might be forced into a melee range in
the<00:01:27.450> vortex<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.110> means<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.159> five

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the vortex and that means for the five

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
the vortex and that means for the five
or<00:01:29.549> ten<00:01:29.700> seconds<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> vortex<00:01:30.689> are<00:01:31.110> only

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
or ten seconds I in the vortex are only

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.890 
or ten seconds I in the vortex are only
doing<00:01:31.439> melee<00:01:31.770> damage<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
doing melee damage so here here it is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.929 
doing melee damage so here here it is
power<00:01:34.200> spark<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.610> should

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
power spark if you see one you should

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910 
power spark if you see one you should
try<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.210> destroy<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.960> you'll<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
try to destroy it and you'll get the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.940 
try to destroy it and you'll get the
power<00:01:38.100> Sparky<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> top<00:01:39.299> right<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.950> each

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
power Sparky see to a top right and each

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.030 
power Sparky see to a top right and each
spark<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.549> 50%<00:01:42.180> damaging<00:01:42.869> piece<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.890> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
spark is 50% damaging piece and as you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.499 
spark is 50% damaging piece and as you
saw<00:01:44.189> i<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.460> used<00:01:44.610> beast<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:45.000> wrath<00:01:45.210> because

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
saw i just used beast your wrath because

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.170 
saw i just used beast your wrath because
I<00:01:46.229> was<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> Sparky<00:01:47.460> my<00:01:47.549> pet<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:47.880> also<00:01:48.119> in

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I was in the Sparky my pet was also in

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.910 
I was in the Sparky my pet was also in
the<00:01:48.240> spark<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.049> was<00:01:49.170> very<00:01:49.200> optimal<00:01:49.710> for

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the spark so that was very optimal for

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.179 
vortex you should use an emulation trap
just<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.189> get<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:57.490> little<00:01:57.640> extra<00:01:57.880> DPS<00:01:58.479> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
just to get that little extra DPS and
