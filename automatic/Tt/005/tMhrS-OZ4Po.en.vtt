really think for new studios would have
given<00:01:15.409> us<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.619> release<00:01:15.890> date<00:01:15.920> by<00:01:16.189> now<00:01:16.400> if<00:01:16.610> we

for Minecraft on the console and I know

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
that here in the tweet they were talking

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.910 
that here in the tweet they were talking
about<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.390> PlayStation<00:01:53.990> experience<00:01:54.170> but

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
about the PlayStation experience but

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.410 
about the PlayStation experience but
they<00:01:55.039> will<00:01:55.250> be<00:01:55.310> releasing<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.850> update<00:01:56.119> on<00:01:56.270> all

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
they will be releasing the update on all

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.850 
they will be releasing the update on all
of<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.630> consoles<00:01:57.020> around<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.380> same<00:01:57.530> time<00:01:57.560> so

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
of the consoles around the same time so

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.080 
of the consoles around the same time so
don't<00:01:57.979> worry<00:01:58.100> about<00:01:58.219> that<00:01:58.610> they<00:01:58.729> were<00:01:58.820> talking

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
don't worry about that they were talking

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.850 
don't worry about that they were talking
about<00:01:59.149> Playstation<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.229> think<00:02:00.380> what<00:02:00.649> this

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
about Playstation but I think what this

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.560 
about Playstation but I think what this
tweet<00:02:01.130> does<00:02:01.369> tell<00:02:01.640> us<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.969> not<00:02:02.119> anything<00:02:02.420> like

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
tweet does tell us is not anything like

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.120 
tweet does tell us is not anything like
I<00:02:02.840> said<00:02:03.020> like<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:03.200> said<00:02:03.380> specifically<00:02:03.770> for<00:02:04.039> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
I said like I said specifically for the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.010 
I said like I said specifically for the
PlayStation<00:02:04.640> but<00:02:05.119> rather<00:02:05.329> it<00:02:05.600> gives<00:02:05.780> us<00:02:05.869> maybe

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
PlayStation but rather it gives us maybe

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.630 
PlayStation but rather it gives us maybe
more<00:02:06.289> so<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.469> a<00:02:06.649> timeline<00:02:07.189> of<00:02:07.219> when<00:02:07.460> we<00:02:07.609> are

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
more so of a timeline of when we are

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.550 
more so of a timeline of when we are
going<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:07.939> be<00:02:08.030> seeing<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.330> update<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.140> because

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
they are going to be unveiling some

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.850 
they are going to be unveiling some
information<00:02:11.330> about<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.810> update<00:02:12.260> at<00:02:12.440> this

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
information about the update at this

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.800 
information about the update at this
thing<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.310> coming<00:02:13.670> weekend<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.180> don't<00:02:14.750> think

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
thing this coming weekend I don't think

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.880 
thing this coming weekend I don't think
it<00:02:15.020> would<00:02:15.110> make<00:02:15.230> sense<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:15.500> them<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.710> release

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
it would make sense for them to release

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.140 
it would make sense for them to release
it<00:02:16.100> before<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.550> right<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:16.970> think<00:02:17.120> that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
it before that right I just think that

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.390 
it before that right I just think that
makes<00:02:17.390> sense<00:02:17.540> however<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.590> do<00:02:18.769> think<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.250> we

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
makes sense however I do think that we

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.589 
makes sense however I do think that we
are<00:02:19.519> going<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.790> be<00:02:19.849> seeing<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.180> relatively

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
are going to be seeing it relatively

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.940 
are going to be seeing it relatively
soon<00:02:20.959> if<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.680> had<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.980> guess<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.370> would<00:02:22.430> say

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
soon if I had to guess I would say

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.920 
soon if I had to guess I would say
we'll<00:02:23.069> be<00:02:23.220> seeing<00:02:23.459> tu<00:02:23.730> 19<00:02:24.120> by<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.540> end<00:02:24.840> of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
we'll be seeing tu 19 by the end of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.720 
we'll be seeing tu 19 by the end of
december<00:02:25.349> or<00:02:25.379> by<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.739> new<00:02:25.950> year<00:02:26.190> because<00:02:26.700> i

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
december or by the new year because i

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.890 
december or by the new year because i
guess<00:02:26.970> they're<00:02:27.120> about<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.360> same<00:02:27.480> thing<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
guess they're about the same thing and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.110 
guess they're about the same thing and
we<00:02:28.890> will<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.069> seeing<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.430> before<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.879> end<00:02:30.030> of

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
we will be seeing it before the end of

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.910 
we will be seeing it before the end of
this<00:02:30.239> month<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.170> my<00:02:31.290> guess<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.800> my

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
this month that is my guess that is my

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.559 
this month that is my guess that is my
prediction<00:02:32.099> I<00:02:32.370> let<00:02:32.489> me<00:02:32.550> tell<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.790> why<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.150> think

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
prediction I let me tell you why I think

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.610 
prediction I let me tell you why I think
we're<00:02:33.660> gonna<00:02:33.750> be<00:02:33.870> seeing<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.140> for<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.290> couple<00:02:34.379> of

we're gonna be seeing it for a couple of

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.900 
we're gonna be seeing it for a couple of

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
reasons right number one because

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.729 
reasons right number one because
whenever<00:02:36.330> we<00:02:36.690> start<00:02:36.750> getting<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.349> number<00:02:37.620> of

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
whenever we start getting the number of

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
they started to shoot out a whole bunch

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.789 
they started to shoot out a whole bunch
of<00:02:48.660> different<00:02:48.720> screenshots<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.530> bunch<00:02:49.739> of

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
of different screenshots and a bunch of

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.500 
of different screenshots and a bunch of
different<00:02:49.890> pictures<00:02:50.340> which<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.030> similar<00:02:51.269> to

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
different pictures which is similar to

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.640 
different pictures which is similar to
what<00:02:51.599> we're<00:02:51.720> getting<00:02:51.810> right<00:02:52.110> now<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.590> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
what we're getting right now and that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.589 
what we're getting right now and that
makes<00:02:53.190> me<00:02:53.340> think<00:02:53.549> that<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.760> update<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.239> coming

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
makes me think that the update is coming

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.270 
makes me think that the update is coming
very<00:02:54.629> soon<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.709> second<00:02:56.130> thing<00:02:56.160> that

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
very soon and the second thing that

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.320 
very soon and the second thing that
makes<00:02:56.519> me<00:02:56.640> think<00:02:56.790> we're<00:02:56.880> going<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.150> seeing

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
makes me think we're going to be seeing

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.970 
makes me think we're going to be seeing
is<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.840> seen<00:02:58.110> screenshots<00:02:58.739> for

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
is that we have seen screenshots for

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.280 
is that we have seen screenshots for
every<00:02:59.370> single<00:02:59.640> different<00:03:00.180> console<00:03:00.690> right<00:03:01.110> we

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
every single different console right we

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.839 
every single different console right we
know<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.680> their<00:03:01.860> their<00:03:02.160> version<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.730> their

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
know that their their version in their

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.520 
know that their their version in their
coding<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.360> just<00:03:03.660> about<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.870> same<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.349> every

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
coding is just about the same on every

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.229 
coding is just about the same on every
single<00:03:04.739> console<00:03:05.220> or<00:03:05.340> how<00:03:05.519> far<00:03:05.790> they<00:03:05.970> are<00:03:06.090> in

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
single console or how far they are in

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.150 
single console or how far they are in
their<00:03:06.329> coding<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:07.260> every<00:03:07.500> console<00:03:07.829> is<00:03:07.950> just

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
their coding for every console is just

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.920 
their coding for every console is just
about<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.489> same<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.030> tells<00:03:09.599> me<00:03:09.780> that

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
about the same and that tells me that

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.300 
about the same and that tells me that
they're<00:03:10.049> getting<00:03:10.200> pretty<00:03:10.590> close<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:11.010> release

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
if they have coded for all of the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.750 
if they have coded for all of the
different<00:03:13.110> consoles<00:03:13.500> already<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.040> have<00:03:14.489> you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
different consoles already and have you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.370 
different consoles already and have you
know<00:03:14.849> at<00:03:15.000> least<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.329> majority<00:03:15.660> from<00:03:16.019> what<00:03:16.260> we've

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
know at least a majority from what we've

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.199 
know at least a majority from what we've
seen<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.680> screenshots<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.819> features

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
seen in the screenshots of the features

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.610 
seen in the screenshots of the features
that<00:03:18.239> we<00:03:18.420> will<00:03:18.540> be<00:03:18.630> seeing<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.230> next<00:03:19.470> big

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
that we will be seeing in the next big

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.500 
that we will be seeing in the next big
update<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.459> like<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.700> said<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:21.000> tells<00:03:21.239> me<00:03:21.299> that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
update so like I said that tells me that

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.910 
update so like I said that tells me that
we're<00:03:21.630> relatively<00:03:22.049> close<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.470> release<00:03:22.709> here<00:03:22.890> I

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
we're relatively close to release here I

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.229 
we're relatively close to release here I
do<00:03:23.069> think<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.459> we<00:03:23.610> will<00:03:23.730> be<00:03:23.849> seeing<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.150> by

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
do think that we will be seeing it by

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.640 
do think that we will be seeing it by
the<00:03:24.299> end<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.690> month<00:03:24.810> however<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.530> think

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the end of the month however I think

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.809 
the end of the month however I think
that<00:03:25.980> we<00:03:26.069> will<00:03:26.190> be<00:03:26.310> getting<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.549> release<00:03:26.790> date

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
that we will be getting a release date

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.640 
that we will be getting a release date
from<00:03:27.120> 4j<00:03:27.480> studios<00:03:27.780> at<00:03:27.930> least<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.290> know<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.440> week

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
from 4j studios at least you know a week

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.500 
from 4j studios at least you know a week
or<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:28.980> advance<00:03:29.160> before<00:03:29.819> we<00:03:30.239> see<00:03:30.389> the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
or so in advance before we see the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
or so in advance before we see the
update<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.049> don't<00:03:31.200> think<00:03:31.260> they're<00:03:31.410> just

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
update and I don't think they're just

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.750 
update and I don't think they're just
gonna<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.769> know<00:03:31.859> drop<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.340> stores<00:03:32.609> the

gonna you know drop it on the stores the
next<00:03:32.970> day<00:03:33.090> kind<00:03:33.359> of<00:03:33.420> like<00:03:33.510> they<00:03:33.600> did<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
next day kind of like they did the the

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.479 
next day kind of like they did the the
Star<00:03:34.350> Wars<00:03:34.500> skin<00:03:34.739> pack<00:03:34.920> it's<00:03:35.130> not<00:03:35.280> it's<00:03:35.430> not

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
Star Wars skin pack it's not it's not

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.830 
Star Wars skin pack it's not it's not
something<00:03:35.880> like<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.120> right<00:03:36.329> they're<00:03:36.750> going

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
something like that right they're going

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.120 
something like that right they're going
to<00:03:36.930> give<00:03:37.049> us<00:03:37.139> a<00:03:37.200> little<00:03:37.290> bit<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.590> warning<00:03:37.829> and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
to give us a little bit of a warning and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.440 
to give us a little bit of a warning and
since<00:03:38.370> they<00:03:38.489> haven't<00:03:38.670> given<00:03:38.850> us<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.090> warning<00:03:39.299> i

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
since they haven't given us a warning i

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.520 
since they haven't given us a warning i
think<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.840> tells<00:03:40.109> us<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.319> we're<00:03:40.440> not

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
think that that tells us that we're not

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.990 
think that that tells us that we're not
going<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.709> be<00:03:40.769> seeing<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.130> week<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.549> not

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
going to be seeing it this week and not

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.729 
going to be seeing it this week and not
to<00:03:42.150> mention<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.870> PS<00:03:43.139> experience<00:03:43.590> thing

there<00:04:18.450> as<00:04:18.599> well<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.780> didn't<00:04:19.289> want<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.470> put<00:04:19.650> an

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
there as well I didn't want to put an

exact date on my prediction because I

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.000 
exact date on my prediction because I
feel<00:04:21.840> like<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.109> just<00:04:22.200> has<00:04:22.380> obviously<00:04:22.950> a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
feel like that just has obviously a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.770 
feel like that just has obviously a
higher<00:04:23.220> probability<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.880> being<00:04:24.000> wrong<00:04:24.210> if<00:04:24.479> I

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
higher probability of being wrong if I

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.600 
higher probability of being wrong if I
just<00:04:24.990> say<00:04:25.110> sometime<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.680> month<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:26.039> highly

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
just say sometime this month is highly

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.890 
just say sometime this month is highly
likely<00:04:26.639> that<00:04:26.940> we<00:04:27.090> will<00:04:27.150> be<00:04:27.270> seeing<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.539> now<00:04:27.570> as

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
likely that we will be seeing it now as

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.150 
likely that we will be seeing it now as
opposed<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.650> know<00:04:28.710> if<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.889> said<00:04:29.039> like

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
opposed to you know if I said like

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.469 
opposed to you know if I said like
December<00:04:29.490> nineteenth<00:04:29.639> we'll<00:04:30.000> be<00:04:30.090> seeing<00:04:30.330> it

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
but I do think we will be seeing it by

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.500 
but I do think we will be seeing it by
the<00:04:32.340> end<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.550> this<00:04:32.640> month<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:33.000> like<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.240> said<00:04:33.330> let
