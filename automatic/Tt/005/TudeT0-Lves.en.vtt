00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
alright guys welcome to your 46 biology

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.789 
alright guys welcome to your 46 biology
video<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.330> on<00:00:03.689> this<00:00:03.870> video<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.380> want<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.680> touch

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
video and on this video I want to touch

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.740 
video and on this video I want to touch
real<00:00:05.009> quick<00:00:05.220> on<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> subject<00:00:05.819> called<00:00:06.000> leading

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
real quick on a subject called leading

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.680 
real quick on a subject called leading
and<00:00:06.930> lagging<00:00:07.319> strands<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.250> DNA<00:00:08.639> now<00:00:09.330> actually

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
and lagging strands of DNA now actually

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.419 
and lagging strands of DNA now actually
the<00:00:09.840> subject<00:00:10.080> can<00:00:10.349> take<00:00:10.530> like<00:00:10.740> five<00:00:11.190> different

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
the subject can take like five different

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.919 
the subject can take like five different
videos<00:00:11.940> but<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.389> want<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> give<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.809> guys

a real basic overview just because if I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.210 
a real basic overview just because if I
skip<00:00:15.929> over<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.289> people<00:00:16.680> are<00:00:16.770> probably<00:00:16.949> gonna

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
skip over it people are probably gonna

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.859 
skip over it people are probably gonna
you<00:00:17.490> know<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:17.820> mad<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.300> didn't<00:00:18.539> touch<00:00:18.720> on

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
you know get mad that I didn't touch on

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.390 
you know get mad that I didn't touch on
it<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.439> let<00:00:19.590> me<00:00:19.650> go<00:00:19.740> ahead<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:19.980> give<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.250> guys

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
it so let me go ahead and give you guys

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.670 
it so let me go ahead and give you guys
a<00:00:20.430> real<00:00:20.699> skinny<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.289> basically

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
a real skinny on this so basically

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.310 
a real skinny on this so basically
whenever<00:00:23.010> your<00:00:23.460> original<00:00:24.210> DNA<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:25.140> your

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
whenever your original DNA or your

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.160 
whenever your original DNA or your
parent<00:00:25.800> strand<00:00:26.039> unzips<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.269> two<00:00:27.539> strands

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
parent strand unzips the two strands

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.500 
parent strand unzips the two strands
aren't<00:00:29.039> identical<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.820> each<00:00:29.939> other<00:00:30.119> at<00:00:30.269> first

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
aren't identical to each other at first

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.049 
aren't identical to each other at first
they<00:00:30.990> will<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> future<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.460> at<00:00:32.820> first

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
they will be in the future but at first

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
they will be in the future but at first
let's<00:00:33.570> go<00:00:33.719> ahead<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.020> take<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> note<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.530> what's

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
let's go ahead and take a note of what's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.819 
let's go ahead and take a note of what's
going<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.510> remember<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:36.840> said<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.710> know

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
going on remember that we said you know

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.770 
going on remember that we said you know
according<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> base<00:00:38.700> pairing<00:00:39.059> rules<00:00:39.300> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
according to the base pairing rules that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.639 
according to the base pairing rules that
a<00:00:40.050> always<00:00:40.770> pairs<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:41.190> T<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.090> C<00:00:42.719> always<00:00:43.350> pairs

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
a always pairs with T and C always pairs

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.130 
a always pairs with T and C always pairs
with<00:00:43.770> G<00:00:44.300> well<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.420> would<00:00:45.570> mean<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.870> soon<00:00:45.960> as

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
with G well this would mean as soon as

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.810 
with G well this would mean as soon as
they<00:00:46.230> split<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.129> our<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
they split that we would have our a and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
they split that we would have our a and
our<00:00:48.239> C<00:00:48.600> over<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.379> our<00:00:49.829> T<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.460> our<00:00:51.030> G<00:00:51.300> over

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
our C over here in our T and our G over

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.439 
our C over here in our T and our G over
here<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.829> basically<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.579> soon<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.270> this

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
here so basically as soon as this

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.319 
here so basically as soon as this
original<00:00:55.050> parent<00:00:55.500> strand<00:00:55.800> splits<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:57.149> have

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
original parent strand splits we have

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.170 
original parent strand splits we have
two<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:58.410> strands<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.039> are

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
two little strands that are

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.760 
two little strands that are
complementary<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.390> each<00:01:00.420> other<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:01.020> sometimes

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
complementary to each other or sometimes

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.470 
complementary to each other or sometimes
I<00:01:02.070> call<00:01:02.219> them<00:01:02.340> offset<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.000> technically

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I call them offset but technically

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.609 
I call them offset but technically
they're<00:01:04.110> called<00:01:04.409> complementary<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.619> even

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
they're called complementary so even

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.109 
they're called complementary so even
though<00:01:07.830> what's<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.520> end<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.790> happening

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
though what's going to end up happening

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.280 
though what's going to end up happening
is<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.869> T<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.670> gonna<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> G

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
is this T is gonna go up here with the G

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440 
is this T is gonna go up here with the G
and<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:14.130> already<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.549> T<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.150> always

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and we already know that T is always

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.390 
and we already know that T is always
gonna<00:01:15.570> pair<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.530> G<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.159> always

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
gonna pair with a a and G is always

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
gonna pair with a a and G is always
going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> pair<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> C<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.080> strand

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
going to pair with a C so this strand

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.020 
going to pair with a C so this strand
right<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.040> gonna<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
right here is gonna be just like the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.570 
right here is gonna be just like the
parent<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.630> also<00:01:22.290> remember<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.400> C

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
parent and also remember this a and C

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240 
parent and also remember this a and C
over<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.320> C<00:01:25.770> over<00:01:26.040> here

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
over here well this a and C over here

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
over here well this a and C over here
are<00:01:26.460> gonna<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.790> paired<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.150> another<00:01:27.299> T<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
are gonna get paired with another T and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
are gonna get paired with another T and
another<00:01:28.500> G<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.159> you're<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.610> what

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
another G so you're like you know what

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.420 
another G so you're like you know what
even<00:01:30.659> though<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.990> splits<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.799> they're<00:01:32.040> not

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
even though it's splits and they're not

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.370 
even though it's splits and they're not
identical<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.060> first<00:01:33.329> you're<00:01:33.930> gonna<00:01:34.049> end<00:01:34.290> up

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
identical at first you're gonna end up

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.640 
identical at first you're gonna end up
with<00:01:34.590> two<00:01:34.890> strands<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> DNA<00:01:36.229> identical<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
with two strands of DNA identical to the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.880 
with two strands of DNA identical to the
original<00:01:38.070> string<00:01:38.369> easy<00:01:39.119> enough<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.079> what's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
original string easy enough so what's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.280 
original string easy enough so what's
really<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.460> problem<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.850> well<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.810> me<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
really the problem here well for me to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.310 
really the problem here well for me to
teach<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.939> very<00:01:45.420> easy<00:01:45.750> but

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
teach it like this it's very easy but

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.219 
teach it like this it's very easy but
for<00:01:46.649> DNA<00:01:47.159> polymerase<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.060> isn't<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.899> easy

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
for DNA polymerase it isn't that easy

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.280 
for DNA polymerase it isn't that easy
because<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.610> again<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> where<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> want

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
because and again this is where I want

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560 
because and again this is where I want
to<00:01:52.350> mention<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.070> forewarning<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.939> could

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to mention you know forewarning I could

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.200 
to mention you know forewarning I could
teach<00:01:55.200> DNA<00:01:55.680> polymerase<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.790> enzyme

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
teach DNA polymerase just this enzyme

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.940 
teach DNA polymerase just this enzyme
for<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.570> five<00:01:57.899> different<00:01:58.110> tutorials<00:01:58.799> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
for like five different tutorials and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.310 
for like five different tutorials and
probably<00:01:59.490> not<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.909> everything<00:02:00.329> covered<00:02:00.509> so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
probably not have everything covered so

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.929 
probably not have everything covered so
I<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.920> want<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> give<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.430> guys<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.579> real

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
I just want to give you guys a real

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.539 
I just want to give you guys a real
quick<00:02:03.360> overview<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.899> whenever<00:02:04.740> DNA

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
quick overview of whenever DNA

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.550 
quick overview of whenever DNA
polymerase<00:02:06.060> which<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> enzyme

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
polymerase which was you know the enzyme

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.869 
polymerase which was you know the enzyme
that's<00:02:07.770> responsible<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.340> laying<00:02:08.640> down<00:02:08.849> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
that's responsible for laying down that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.510 
that's responsible for laying down that
permanent<00:02:09.509> DNA<00:02:09.899> whenever<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.009> lines<00:02:11.250> up<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
permanent DNA whenever it lines up the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.200 
permanent DNA whenever it lines up the
nucleotides<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.840> make

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
nucleotides to make

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.230 
nucleotides to make
DNA<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.530> can't<00:02:14.770> line<00:02:15.100> them<00:02:15.310> up<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.640> any

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
DNA it just can't line them up in any

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.210 
DNA it just can't line them up in any
old<00:02:16.840> fashion<00:02:17.380> needs<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.770> line<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
old fashion needs to line up the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.700 
old fashion needs to line up the
nucleotides<00:02:18.820> in<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.360> very<00:02:19.660> specific<00:02:20.200> in

nucleotides in a very specific in
certain<00:02:21.430> way<00:02:21.610> now<00:02:22.240> how<00:02:22.570> this<00:02:22.750> works<00:02:22.810> again<00:02:23.380> is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
certain way now how this works again is

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.010 
certain way now how this works again is
beyond<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.980> scope<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:25.000> suggest<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.690> read<00:02:25.840> up

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
beyond the scope I suggest you read up

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.600 
beyond the scope I suggest you read up
on<00:02:26.140> DNA<00:02:26.500> polymerase<00:02:26.920> if<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.250> want<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.490> get

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
on DNA polymerase if you want to get

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.610 
on DNA polymerase if you want to get
more<00:02:27.910> involved<00:02:28.150> but<00:02:28.660> just<00:02:28.870> remember<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
more involved but just remember the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.160 
more involved but just remember the
overview<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.190> DNA<00:02:30.610> polymerase<00:02:31.180> needs<00:02:31.990> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
overview of DNA polymerase needs the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.990 
overview of DNA polymerase needs the
line<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.590> nucleotides<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.430> certain<00:02:33.820> way

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
line up the nucleotides in a certain way

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.740 
line up the nucleotides in a certain way
to<00:02:34.450> make<00:02:34.480> DNA<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.950> that's<00:02:36.490> why<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.270> have<00:02:37.510> one

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
to make DNA so that's why you have one

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.480 
to make DNA so that's why you have one
side<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.050> looks<00:02:38.350> different<00:02:38.950> than<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.310> other

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
side that looks different than the other

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.970 
side that looks different than the other
side<00:02:39.790> because<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.720> two<00:02:41.020> strands<00:02:41.590> aren't

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
side because the two strands aren't

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.650 
side because the two strands aren't
identical<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.240> create<00:02:43.390> some

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
identical and this can create some

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.320 
identical and this can create some
problems<00:02:44.020> for<00:02:44.050> DNA<00:02:44.500> polymerase<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:46.060> whenever

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
problems for DNA polymerase so whenever

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.230 
problems for DNA polymerase so whenever
your<00:02:46.840> original<00:02:47.470> parent<00:02:48.070> strand<00:02:48.340> unzips<00:02:48.970> it's

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
your original parent strand unzips it's

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.240 
your original parent strand unzips it's
going<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.510> split<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.870> two<00:02:50.080> strands<00:02:50.560> obviously

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
going to split in two strands obviously

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.340 
going to split in two strands obviously
we<00:02:51.340> know<00:02:51.460> that<00:02:51.640> already<00:02:51.940> now<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.720> piece

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
we know that already now the piece

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.820 
we know that already now the piece
that's<00:02:53.740> going<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.040> be<00:02:54.240> one<00:02:55.240> continuous<00:02:55.830> piece

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
that's going to be one continuous piece

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.610 
that's going to be one continuous piece
right<00:02:57.280> here<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.930> be<00:02:59.080> called<00:02:59.350> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
right here is going to be called the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.100 
right here is going to be called the
leading<00:03:00.220> strand<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:00.910> le<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.390> di<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.830> G<00:03:03.870> now<00:03:04.870> if

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
leading strand so le a di and G now if

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.270 
leading strand so le a di and G now if
you<00:03:05.230> were<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.440> look<00:03:05.560> at<00:03:05.680> DNA<00:03:05.860> under<00:03:06.250> a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
you were to look at DNA under a

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.920 
you were to look at DNA under a
microscope<00:03:06.460> you're<00:03:07.060> gonna<00:03:07.210> see<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.630> one

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
microscope you're gonna see that one

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.260 
microscope you're gonna see that one
side<00:03:08.770> of<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:09.100> DNA<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.580> gonna<00:03:09.760> grow<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.150> a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
side of the DNA is gonna grow in a

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.210 
side of the DNA is gonna grow in a
continuous<00:03:10.870> strand<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:11.860> called<00:03:12.100> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
continuous strand this is called the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.330 
continuous strand this is called the
leading<00:03:12.460> strand<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.060> another<00:03:14.070> side<00:03:15.070> of<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
leading strand and another side of the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.560 
leading strand and another side of the
DNA<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.910> gonna<00:03:16.150> be<00:03:16.270> called<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.510> lagging

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
DNA is gonna be called the lagging

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.240 
DNA is gonna be called the lagging
because<00:03:19.570> unlike<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.470> leading<00:03:20.800> strand<00:03:21.040> this

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
because unlike the leading strand this

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.430 
because unlike the leading strand this
is<00:03:21.430> actually<00:03:21.760> going<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.000> grow<00:03:22.210> in<00:03:22.480> chunks<00:03:23.290> or

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
is actually going to grow in chunks or

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.820 
is actually going to grow in chunks or
fragments<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:25.060> again<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.900> side<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.530> one

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
fragments so again the side that is one

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.850 
fragments so again the side that is one
continuous<00:03:27.420> strain<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.690> called<00:03:28.900> leading<00:03:29.200> the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
continuous strain is called leading the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.860 
continuous strain is called leading the
side<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:30.220> grows<00:03:30.490> in<00:03:30.670> chunks<00:03:31.030> or<00:03:31.210> fragments

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
side that grows in chunks or fragments

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.590 
side that grows in chunks or fragments
is<00:03:32.020> called<00:03:32.320> lagging<00:03:33.100> now<00:03:33.970> basically<00:03:34.480> what

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
is called lagging now basically what

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.780 
is called lagging now basically what
happens<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.080> once<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.620> DNA<00:03:36.010> polymerase<00:03:36.580> is

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
happens is once the DNA polymerase is

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.330 
happens is once the DNA polymerase is
done<00:03:36.940> making<00:03:37.300> these<00:03:37.840> fragments<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.920> DNA

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
done making these fragments the DNA

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.570 
done making these fragments the DNA
ligase<00:03:40.300> right<00:03:40.840> over<00:03:41.140> here<00:03:41.470> that's<00:03:42.280> where<00:03:42.550> I

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
ligase right over here that's where I

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.220 
ligase right over here that's where I
said<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.910> whenever<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.480> have<00:03:43.630> breaks<00:03:43.990> it

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
said that whenever you have breaks it

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.480 
said that whenever you have breaks it
comes<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.710> puts<00:03:44.860> them<00:03:44.980> together<00:03:45.130> with

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
comes and puts them together with

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.180 
comes and puts them together with
covalent<00:03:45.820> bonds<00:03:46.390> well<00:03:47.110> that's<00:03:47.680> what<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.010> does

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
covalent bonds well that's what it does

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.100 
covalent bonds well that's what it does
it<00:03:48.460> pretty<00:03:48.640> much<00:03:48.820> takes<00:03:49.150> all<00:03:49.390> those<00:03:49.570> chunks

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
it pretty much takes all those chunks

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.320 
it pretty much takes all those chunks
and<00:03:50.260> bonds<00:03:50.680> them<00:03:50.770> together<00:03:50.950> now<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:51.940> know<00:03:52.120> this

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
and bonds them together now I know this

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.970 
and bonds them together now I know this
is<00:03:52.450> kind<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.660> confusing<00:03:52.780> because<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.410> drew<00:03:53.800> the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
is kind of confusing because I drew the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.010 
is kind of confusing because I drew the
DNA<00:03:54.400> ligase<00:03:54.940> over<00:03:55.210> here<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.630> this<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.900> the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
DNA ligase over here and this is the

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.960 
DNA ligase over here and this is the
leading<00:03:56.260> strand<00:03:56.650> but<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.310> just<00:03:57.580> drew<00:03:57.760> over

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
leading strand but I just drew over

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.820 
leading strand but I just drew over
there<00:03:58.210> as<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.360> demonstration<00:03:58.900> because<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.530> was

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
there as a demonstration because I was

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.260 
there as a demonstration because I was
running<00:04:00.160> out<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.310> room<00:04:00.430> on<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.910> right<00:04:01.030> hand

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
running out of room on the right hand

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.780 
running out of room on the right hand
side<00:04:01.360> but<00:04:01.900> actually<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:02.500> DNA<00:04:02.980> ligase<00:04:03.400> enzyme

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
side but actually this DNA ligase enzyme

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.060 
side but actually this DNA ligase enzyme
would<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:04.120> over<00:04:04.510> here<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:05.470> know<00:04:05.590> if<00:04:05.770> this<00:04:05.890> were

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
would be over here you know if this were

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.820 
would be over here you know if this were
a<00:04:06.130> proper<00:04:06.640> diagram<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.480> what<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.290> would<00:04:08.380> do<00:04:08.560> is

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
a proper diagram and what it would do is

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.860 
a proper diagram and what it would do is
it<00:04:08.980> would<00:04:09.010> be<00:04:09.220> putting<00:04:09.850> together<00:04:10.180> these

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
it would be putting together these

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.500 
it would be putting together these
pieces<00:04:11.380> or<00:04:11.800> these<00:04:12.040> chunks<00:04:12.490> using<00:04:12.820> covalent

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
pieces or these chunks using covalent

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.870 
pieces or these chunks using covalent
bonds<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:13.990> one<00:04:14.710> last<00:04:14.830> time<00:04:15.130> what<00:04:15.340> happens<00:04:15.670> is

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
bonds so one last time what happens is

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.030 
bonds so one last time what happens is
whenever<00:04:16.359> your<00:04:16.690> original<00:04:17.260> parent<00:04:17.650> strand<00:04:17.890> of

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
whenever your original parent strand of

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.789 
whenever your original parent strand of
DNA<00:04:18.239> splits<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.630> have<00:04:19.780> two<00:04:20.080> strands<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.739> are

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
DNA splits you have two strands that are

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.340 
DNA splits you have two strands that are
complementary<00:04:21.489> one<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.630> leading<00:04:22.870> strand

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
complementary one is the leading strand

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.440 
complementary one is the leading strand
that<00:04:23.830> grows<00:04:24.070> in<00:04:24.280> one<00:04:24.430> continuous<00:04:24.970> piece<00:04:25.210> in

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
that grows in one continuous piece in

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.100 
that grows in one continuous piece in
the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.529 
the
is<00:04:26.289> the<00:04:26.500> lagging<00:04:27.039> strand<00:04:27.069> and<00:04:27.639> this<00:04:28.090> grows<00:04:28.330> in

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
is the lagging strand and this grows in

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.959 
is the lagging strand and this grows in
chunks<00:04:28.960> or<00:04:29.169> fragments<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.069> whenever<00:04:30.610> we<00:04:30.939> have

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 
chunks or fragments and whenever we have

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.719 
chunks or fragments and whenever we have
our<00:04:31.270> fragments<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.349> DNA<00:04:32.770> ligase<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.490> going<00:04:33.669> to

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
our fragments the DNA ligase is going to

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.790 
our fragments the DNA ligase is going to
come<00:04:33.939> with<00:04:34.060> covalent<00:04:34.659> bonds<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.139> put<00:04:35.680> them

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
come with covalent bonds and put them

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.369 
come with covalent bonds and put them
together<00:04:36.219> so<00:04:36.729> I<00:04:37.360> know<00:04:37.479> this<00:04:37.780> can<00:04:38.020> get<00:04:38.169> kind<00:04:38.349> of

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:38.379 
together so I know this can get kind of

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.890 
together so I know this can get kind of
confusing<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:39.069> DNA<00:04:39.819> replication<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.599> actually

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
confusing in DNA replication is actually

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.749 
confusing in DNA replication is actually
pretty<00:04:41.139> confusing<00:04:41.560> but<00:04:42.099> pat<00:04:42.310> yourself<00:04:42.430> on<00:04:42.699> the

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
pretty confusing but pat yourself on the

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.369 
pretty confusing but pat yourself on the
back<00:04:42.879> because<00:04:43.180> we're<00:04:43.539> done<00:04:43.689> with<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:43.900> for<00:04:44.259> now

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
back because we're done with it for now

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.110 
back because we're done with it for now
we're<00:04:44.800> gonna<00:04:44.860> move<00:04:45.069> on<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.490> something<00:04:45.729> you

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
we're gonna move on to something you

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.999 
we're gonna move on to something you
know<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.270> little<00:04:46.689> more<00:04:46.810> easier<00:04:47.349> to<00:04:47.560> understand

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
know a little more easier to understand

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.309 
know a little more easier to understand
something<00:04:48.729> you<00:04:48.789> guys<00:04:48.849> for<00:04:49.090> watching<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.659> by

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
something you guys for watching and by

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.839 
something you guys for watching and by
the<00:04:50.379> way<00:04:50.530> before<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.889> let<00:04:51.039> you<00:04:51.159> go<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.520> want<00:04:51.759> to

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
the way before I let you go I want to

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.490 
the way before I let you go I want to
mention<00:04:51.969> that<00:04:52.180> if<00:04:52.449> you<00:04:52.659> don't<00:04:52.960> really

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
mention that if you don't really

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.429 
mention that if you don't really
understand<00:04:54.189> DNA<00:04:54.849> polymerase<00:04:55.599> and<00:04:55.719> exactly

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 
understand DNA polymerase and exactly

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.600 
understand DNA polymerase and exactly
what<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.770> talked<00:04:57.009> about<00:04:57.099> in<00:04:57.340> this<00:04:57.430> tutorial

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
what I talked about in this tutorial

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.790 
what I talked about in this tutorial
don't<00:04:58.509> really<00:04:58.840> worry<00:04:59.020> about<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.379> because<00:04:59.500> you

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
don't really worry about it because you

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.350 
don't really worry about it because you
can<00:04:59.830> understand<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.460> rest<00:05:00.639> of<00:05:00.759> cell<00:05:00.939> division

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
can understand the rest of cell division

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.629 
can understand the rest of cell division
perfectly<00:05:02.199> without<00:05:02.319> it<00:05:02.680> this<00:05:02.800> gets<00:05:03.099> into<00:05:03.490> more

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
perfectly without it this gets into more

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.939 
perfectly without it this gets into more
the<00:05:04.090> more<00:05:04.270> advanced<00:05:04.569> stuff<00:05:04.870> we<00:05:05.409> really<00:05:05.710> didn't

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
the more advanced stuff we really didn't

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.740 
the more advanced stuff we really didn't
need<00:05:06.069> to<00:05:06.129> make<00:05:06.310> this<00:05:06.430> tutorial<00:05:06.610> but<00:05:07.090> now<00:05:07.330> you

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
need to make this tutorial but now you

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.200 
need to make this tutorial but now you
have<00:05:07.930> extra<00:05:08.409> knowledge<00:05:09.060> congratulations

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
have extra knowledge congratulations

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.360 
have extra knowledge congratulations
