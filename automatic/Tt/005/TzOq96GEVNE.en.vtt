00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 today we had times that a flash 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.950
 drive off that's one 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.359
 memory expansion for the iphone sees 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.620
 like a little usb stick on the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.940
 a page in the usb connection on the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.130
 other side in laichingen contact 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.170
 There are still two small protection plugs 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.289
 I've already deducted that and the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.060
 Serves as the store of the iphone 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.310
 device-going spot to expand 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.240
 already relatively early you can here 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.070
 media content is on the practical 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.920
 whole story below and then have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.689
 more space to do more things 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.289
 take along a nice idea 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.850
 but suffers from 33 properties and 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.820
 definitely not recommended 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.140
 from us for one thing and forget that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.329
 many people if you have something like that here now 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.260
 may look in the electronics department store 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.329
 his choice that these accessories on 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.039
 your application are calibrated you can 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.300
 not just the thing down here 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.070
 stuck and then say 'oh now for 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.750
 you have extra photos and the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.280
 Now open with the app around 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.820
 edit the video I open with the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.890
 app, etc 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.350
 that is not possible but you have everything 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.570
 control over this flash drive application 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.829
 what to do with this external memory 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.600
 has and the application is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.979
 Grottenschlecht you can even short 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.500
 demonstrate when I'm here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.659
 tuck low is indeed such a 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.010
 smaller is info pop up and ask me 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.450
 If I want to start the application I 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 that could also be quite conventional 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.409
 but I just type ok 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.970
 then starts the application can only 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.140
 up times and you see it 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.000
 Here is a small overview you can 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.830
 say with internal memory external 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.150
 store and down special dropbox 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.040
 connections i dont know why anyone 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.200
 we really do not need it in there 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.490
 and now I can show that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.640
 camera's a bit darker 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.439
 has become what really bothers me doll 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 this memory extension and if 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.900
 I now on the external memory 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.119
 I got here in the video 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.079
 Hang up 1080p to look like the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.490
 whole thing works 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.200
 you have to introduce yourself now 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.759
 because of me in the tent vacation in the evening 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.899
 is watching bedroom another video 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.000
 a bit dark outside 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.530
 as soon as I the anmache here begins here 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.270
 to bring down the led 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.740
 and the flashes almost every 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.450
 interaction with the video so i know 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.820
 to scroll me in there a bit 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.380
 somehow a position search one sees 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.170
 yes, that lives one by one 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.250
 crisis always this flashing led can do it 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.649
 provoke again and no human who 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.420
 such an LED have the alm in the eye 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.489
 be surveyed and therefore the movie looks 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.140
 has ever let completely he has 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.040
 somebody did not think and it 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.870
 really a pity 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.790
 The next thing is the application 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.810
 This is incredibly complicated 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.090
 designed as I think 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.739
 it does not just look stale and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.600
 behaves a bit sluggish summer 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.890
 is it then here so I want the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.480
 have a button where I mean all now 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.700
 can save pictures on this sticker 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.260
 yes why is not that I have to go now 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.390
 go here to the external memory and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.360
 then say okay I want from the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.739
 library my my films secure 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.810
 because of me here then I have to all 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.269
 select then I say finished that is 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.640
 now a video and he needs one here 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.330
 whole corner around this on this stick up 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.220
 to copy 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.040
 a little movie on the device 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.630
 saved we let him do it 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.299
 or breaks the whole 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.690
 history so times from ok works 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.670
 works after all in the big and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.769
 All of them are my mine 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.690
 Criticisms already in detail 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.890
 carried forward so watch the video 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.500
 So you do not use one always has the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.329
 led the one disturbs and the fast 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.250
 backup offers that too 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.380
 not because you because the photos with the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.060
 finger each individual picture to select 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.310
 has virtually instead of here as a 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.140
 button on it and you're on 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.340
 this application here means the same 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.780
 even if I now say in here 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.640
 I also want the internal memory 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.380
 have access up here in the video that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.810
 I had recopied myself earlier 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.640
 mark that and do it now 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.920
 happy to open other application 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.420
 here it can only move here can 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.820
 I can then again copy because 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 and send it via e mail 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.420
 the break off is of this once here 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.060
 covered or what such words 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.130
 and it works front and back 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.720
 Not for this are these sticks unbelievable 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.910
 expensive so the 8 gigabyte variant 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.670
 It costs about 80 euros 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.510
 a 16 a 64er i believe even if 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.310
 I'm right 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.330
 but we do not even have that 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.980
 trouble again after the prices 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.950
 to look because it was really wet 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.590
 the shopping can not recommend the 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.220
 flash drive thought nice bad 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.599
 made 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.599
 thank you for watching
