00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.450
 good morning friends 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:18.369
 in this tutorial today we're going to see how 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.950
 open the samsung galaxy s 4 let's see 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.890
 how to remove the back cover of this 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.160
 cell phone we see that a super cell 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.610
 thin for many, it is very difficult 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.579
 or can not imagine how to disassemble it from 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.610
 back cover for a change process 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.520
 display or a touch change process 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.590
 then the first thing we started to 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.650
 doing is removing everything we have 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.680
 inserted in it like the micro sim the 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.490
 microsd card and the battery release it 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.490
 of all these pieces 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.350
 then we move on to the next step that is 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.720
 remove all the screws that you have 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.720
 this cell phone and that are approximately 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.479
 about eight screws then you have to have 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.479
 patience to remove these screws 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.280
 while I'm telling you that in this 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.159
 tutorial we're just going to see the part of 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.590
 how far we remove the back cover the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.330
 part where we dismantled all the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:34.180
 pieces or components of the cell phone as 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:37.479
 are the card the vibrator the plus where 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.850
 the charging pin is connected to the handset 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:46.360
 in the front camera the rear camera 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.090
 the sensor all this then remained for a 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.210
 second tutorial and all this with the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.390
 for that purpose this video is not 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.060
 did so long then you know 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.009
 finishing watching this this video do 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.259
 click on the link that I will leave in the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.170
 description so why start at 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.630
 see the rest to dismantle the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.690
 components remember that if it serves you 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.170
 this video of the link manita above me 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.170
 like 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.050
 and then we have already removed all the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.540
 cell phone screws now we are going to 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.500
 place a cordless screwdriver or 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.540
 you some use the piece for 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.650
 play guitar that I do not know what is the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.540
 name and we search we started looking for the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.900
 weakest part where we're going to 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.230
 start opening the cell phone first 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.880
 that we can remove from him then in the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.730
 side we saw that you can not remove anything 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.540
 but look at this part below 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.360
 we can remove what is the box from the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.980
 horn if we want to change the horn 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.570
 we just have to remove the two 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.910
 screws on the bottom that the 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.040
 hold and remove it in the way that 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.930
 they saw in the video and there's no need to do 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.450
 more nothing you do not have to uncover all the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.450
 cellular that's just to change the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.290
 then horn as the goal of 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.160
 To dismantle it is to remove the back cover 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.470
 we follow 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.540
 and we seek to know what is the most 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.859
 You must as I told them 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.170
 and so from experience we see that it is 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.840
 the bottom of the bottom 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.319
 where the cell phone is charged 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.319
 we started opening 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.010
 we got to the top in this 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.360
 point is better that we do not keep opening 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.030
 as I am doing in the video 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.010
 we stop there because then there is very 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.680
 well grabbed the cell then what 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.020
 let's do we go on the other side 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.590
 that the cell phone is still 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.590
 sealed 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.530
 and we started to open it 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.530
 until you reach the top 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.170
 we are raising here there are no tapes of 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.810
 volume of rise and fall these the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.550
 volume is handled with keys pasted to 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.190
 card so no problem 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.859
 leave nothing and as you see here we dismantle 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.199
 the cell phone back cover then look 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.100
 always from the bottom up as they 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.100
 I just showed 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.070
 Then, gentlemen , I told you to see the 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.370
 second part of this video to see 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.460
 how all the pieces are removed now 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.660
 of the card that we need to disassemble 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.530
 to change the screen and the touch 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.880
 then until our 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.880
 tutorial thank you very much
