let's<00:00:25.109> start<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> big<00:00:26.670> deal

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
let's start with you this is a big deal

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.839 
let's start with you this is a big deal
because<00:00:27.410> it<00:00:28.410> would<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:29.010> take<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.490> hotel

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
because it would actually take the hotel

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.009 
because it would actually take the hotel
which<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.150> little<00:00:30.359> bit<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.599> distance<00:00:30.779> away

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
which is a little bit of a distance away

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.560 
which is a little bit of a distance away
right<00:00:31.380> now<00:00:31.430> move<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> same<00:00:33.149> side<00:00:33.540> of

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
right now move it to the same side of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.270 
right now move it to the same side of
the<00:00:33.719> street<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:34.260> Graceland<00:00:34.980> which<00:00:35.100> would

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the street as Graceland which would

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.010 
the street as Graceland which would
change<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> whole<00:00:35.820> experience<00:00:36.270> correct<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
change the whole experience correct and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.840 
change the whole experience correct and
the<00:00:37.079> key<00:00:37.290> word<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.680> proposed<00:00:38.309> the

but<00:00:57.270> also<00:00:57.420> those<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.719> want<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.079> host<00:00:58.559> events

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
but also those that want to host events

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.110 
but also those that want to host events
here<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.219> Memphis<00:00:59.609> they'll<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.000> an

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
here in Memphis they'll have an

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.580 
here in Memphis they'll have an
additional<00:01:00.480> option<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.930> terms<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.410> host

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
additional option in terms of a host

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
additional option in terms of a host
hotel<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.879> theory<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.329> we're<00:01:03.449> talking

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
hotel so in theory what we're talking

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.690 
hotel so in theory what we're talking
about<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.890> you're<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.369> close

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
about is really you're going to be close

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.340 
about is really you're going to be close
enough<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> same<00:01:06.450> side<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.170> would

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
enough on the same side right this would

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
enough on the same side right this would
be<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:07.619> impact<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.310> would<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.549> walk

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
be an impact because you would just walk

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.219 
be an impact because you would just walk
over<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.390> Graceland<00:01:09.750> instead<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.020> having<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
over to Graceland instead of having to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
over to Graceland instead of having to
cross<00:01:10.439> right<00:01:10.710> i<00:01:10.740> mean<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.310> reduce<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
cross right i mean you can reduce the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.580 
cross right i mean you can reduce the
carbon<00:01:12.150> footprint<00:01:12.659> by<00:01:12.780> bringing<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.380> on

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
carbon footprint by bringing things on

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.510 
carbon footprint by bringing things on
the<00:01:13.650> same<00:01:13.860> side<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> street<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the same side of the street as the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
the same side of the street as the
mansion<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.840> are<00:01:15.930> lots<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
mansion as well so there are lots of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
mansion as well so there are lots of
benefits<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.729> excited<00:01:18.030> about<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
