00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
they're supposed to be small so I kind

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.800 
they're supposed to be small so I kind
of<00:00:22.650> measure<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.980> little<00:00:23.279> bit<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.670> comb<00:00:23.910> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
of measure a little bit with my comb and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.400 
of measure a little bit with my comb and
then<00:00:24.960> try<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.380> about<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.740> same<00:00:25.769> size<00:00:27.410> on

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
then try to get about the same size on

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.589 
then try to get about the same size on
each<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.760> range<00:00:29.939> get<00:00:30.150> thicker<00:00:30.420> as

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
each one and the range get thicker as

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.209 
each one and the range get thicker as
you<00:00:30.810> go<00:00:30.929> farther<00:00:31.109> down<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.890> kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> have

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
you go farther down so you kind of have

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.889 
you go farther down so you kind of have
to<00:00:32.309> make<00:00:32.520> them<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.850> them<00:00:32.969> smaller<00:00:33.270> tomorrow<00:00:33.660> I

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to make them get them smaller tomorrow I

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.840 
to make them get them smaller tomorrow I
use<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> small<00:00:34.559> comb<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> clip<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
use a small comb and then I clip it I

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.900 
use a small comb and then I clip it I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
self operator so then I try to braid it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.510 
self operator so then I try to braid it
all<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> way<00:01:20.640> down<00:01:21.710> again<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.950> where<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> last

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
all the way down again to where the last

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.919 
all the way down again to where the last
braid<00:01:23.909> was

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.719 

how<00:01:27.929> far<00:01:28.229> down<00:01:28.469> d<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.189> make<00:01:29.549> sure

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
how far down d you just make sure

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
how far down d you just make sure
they're<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.899> leave<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> tail<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
they're all I like to leave a tail and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580 
they're all I like to leave a tail and
then<00:01:31.979> when<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.219> pull<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.789> I<00:01:32.969> cut<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> off<00:01:33.780> okay

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
then when I pull it up I cut it off okay

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.359 
then when I pull it up I cut it off okay
um<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> don't<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:36.840> necessary<00:01:37.500> babe<00:01:37.799> all

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
um so I don't really necessary babe all

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.980 
um so I don't really necessary babe all
the<00:01:38.549> way<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.819> very<00:01:38.850> end<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.569> I<00:01:39.659> always

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the way to the very end and I always

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.469 
the way to the very end and I always
leave<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.649> 2g<00:01:41.250> Arnold<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.789> the<00:01:42.030> same<00:01:42.240> side

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
leave it the 2g Arnold on the same side

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.469 
leave it the 2g Arnold on the same side
let's<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.469> flip<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> chew<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.069> notch

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
let's just flip it up and chew one notch

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.980 
let's just flip it up and chew one notch
and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.490> know<00:01:50.569> how<00:01:51.569> long<00:01:51.750> they're<00:01:51.899> gonna

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and I do to know how long they're gonna

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.190 
and I do to know how long they're gonna
have<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.319> in<00:01:52.439> four<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.959> have<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
have to be in four and then I have a
