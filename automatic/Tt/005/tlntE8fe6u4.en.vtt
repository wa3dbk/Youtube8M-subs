00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.569 
probably using Linux or a Mac but we're
going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> use<00:00:29.550> Windows<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.150> because<00:00:31.579> things

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
going to use Windows just because things

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.639 
going to use Windows just because things
run<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> little<00:00:33.180> different<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.350> some

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
run a little different and I know some

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.520 
run a little different and I know some
of<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.860> might<00:00:35.550> not<00:00:35.760> know<00:00:36.050> might<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.079> use

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
of you might not know might not use

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.700 
of you might not know might not use
Linux<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.520> Mac<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.260> we're<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> install

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
Linux or Mac so we're going to install

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.630 
Linux or Mac so we're going to install
nodejs<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.149> first<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.570> want<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.840> install<00:00:43.640> get

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
nodejs but first I want to install get

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.709 
nodejs but first I want to install get
for<00:00:45.059> Windows<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:47.059> there's<00:00:48.059> two<00:00:48.300> reasons<00:00:48.450> I

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
for Windows and there's two reasons I

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.959 
for Windows and there's two reasons I
want<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> install<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.920> obviously<00:00:50.370> is

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
want to install this one obviously is

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.330 
want to install this one obviously is
for<00:00:51.210> version<00:00:51.600> control<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
for version control so we have that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.450 
for version control so we have that
accessible<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.329> our<00:00:54.510> Windows<00:00:54.899> machine<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
accessible on our Windows machine and I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
accessible on our Windows machine and I
also<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> terminal<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.530> gives<00:00:58.800> us

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
also like the terminal that it gives us

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.330 
also like the terminal that it gives us
it<00:00:59.550> allows<00:00:59.670> us<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.300> Linux<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.340> commands

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
it allows us to do Linux like commands

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.990 
it allows us to do Linux like commands
and<00:01:02.629> just<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.930> different<00:01:04.199> things<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.000> that's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and just just different things so that's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.820 
and just just different things so that's
what<00:01:06.210> we'll<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.360> using<00:01:06.479> basically<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.619> our

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
what we'll be using basically as our

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.940 
what we'll be using basically as our
terminal<00:01:08.369> when<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.000> use<00:01:09.180> node<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.740> want<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
terminal when we use node so you want to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.240 
terminal when we use node so you want to
go<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.400> -<00:01:11.820> SCM<00:01:12.810> comm<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.650> click<00:01:13.979> download

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
go to get - SCM comm and click download

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.969 
go to get - SCM comm and click download

alert<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.830> just<00:02:34.070> want<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.460> allow<00:02:35.090> access

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.240 

that's<00:02:39.260> just<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> windows<00:02:40.040> firewall

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.500 

I<00:02:45.300> apologize<00:02:46.300> if<00:02:47.490> anything<00:02:48.490> runs<00:02:48.760> slow<00:02:49.210> this

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
I apologize if anything runs slow this

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.230 
I apologize if anything runs slow this
is<00:02:49.660> actually<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.610> virtual<00:02:51.610> machine<00:02:51.760> that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
is actually a virtual machine that

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.960 
is actually a virtual machine that
doesn't<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.840> much<00:02:52.990> power<00:02:53.290> so

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.880 

all<00:02:59.480> right<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.460> that's<00:03:01.460> finished<00:03:02.110> now<00:03:03.110> you

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
all right so that's finished now you

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.220 
all right so that's finished now you
usually<00:03:04.070> would<00:03:04.400> get<00:03:04.550> an<00:03:04.700> icon<00:03:05.120> here<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:05.900> I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
usually would get an icon here but I

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.710 
usually would get an icon here but I
guess<00:03:06.530> we<00:03:06.680> didn't<00:03:07.010> now<00:03:07.520> this<00:03:07.910> program<00:03:08.240> comes

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
guess we didn't now this program comes

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.200 
guess we didn't now this program comes
with<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.930> GUI<00:03:09.230> as<00:03:09.530> well<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:10.040> get<00:03:10.280> GUI<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:11.150> you

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
with a GUI as well the get GUI so you

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.720 
with a GUI as well the get GUI so you
can<00:03:11.420> actually<00:03:11.600> have<00:03:11.960> an<00:03:12.230> interface<00:03:13.010> with

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
can actually have an interface with

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.570 
can actually have an interface with
icons<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.600> stuff<00:03:15.050> I<00:03:15.440> have<00:03:15.830> actually<00:03:16.220> never

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
icons and stuff I have actually never

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.720 
icons and stuff I have actually never
used<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:17.240> I<00:03:17.590> basically<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:18.710> want<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:19.490> for

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
used it I basically just want this for

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.180 
used it I basically just want this for
the<00:03:19.760> command<00:03:20.180> line<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.720> can<00:03:21.590> check<00:03:21.860> out<00:03:22.040> the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
the command line you can check out the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.370 
the command line you can check out the
GUI<00:03:22.340> if<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:22.730> want<00:03:22.970> but<00:03:23.330> I'm<00:03:23.540> going<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.720> take

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
GUI if you want but I'm going to take

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.540 
GUI if you want but I'm going to take
this<00:03:24.560> git<00:03:24.890> bash<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.670> send<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.510> my<00:03:26.690> desktop

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
this git bash and send it to my desktop

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.390 
this git bash and send it to my desktop
that<00:03:28.550> way<00:03:28.670> we<00:03:28.820> can<00:03:29.000> easily<00:03:29.230> access<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.800> all

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
that way we can easily access that all

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.770 
that way we can easily access that all
right<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:31.820> if<00:03:31.880> we<00:03:31.910> open<00:03:32.270> that<00:03:32.300> up<00:03:32.570> it's

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
right and if we open that up it's

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.260 
right and if we open that up it's
basically<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.560> command<00:03:33.890> prompt<00:03:34.370> all

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
basically just a command prompt all

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.880 
basically just a command prompt all
right<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.810> now<00:03:36.050> what<00:03:36.200> we<00:03:36.320> want<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.620> do<00:03:36.710> is

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
right so now what we want to do is

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.580 
right so now what we want to do is
install<00:03:37.280> node<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.480> want<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.750> go<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.900> node<00:03:39.440> J

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
install node so you want to go to node J

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.120 
install node so you want to go to node J
s<00:03:39.920> org<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:40.880> click<00:03:41.390> install<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.980> should

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130

automatically<00:03:43.730> give<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.720> right<00:03:45.260> file<00:03:46.010> to

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
automatically give you the right file to

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.150 
automatically give you the right file to
install<00:03:46.630> depending<00:03:47.630> on<00:03:47.750> your<00:03:47.840> system

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:04.440 

all<00:03:52.700> right<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.060> we<00:03:53.210> want<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:53.510> open<00:03:53.570> that

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.970

and<00:04:34.830> if<00:04:35.430> we<00:04:35.520> go<00:04:35.670> to<00:04:35.700> all<00:04:36.000> programs

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.790 

no<00:04:40.510> js'<00:04:41.080> we<00:04:41.320> can<00:04:41.470> send<00:04:41.770> this<00:04:41.890> to<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.310> desktop

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
no js' we can send this to the desktop

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.610 
no js' we can send this to the desktop
all<00:04:44.800> right<00:04:44.920> now<00:04:45.130> if<00:04:45.220> we<00:04:45.340> click<00:04:45.520> on<00:04:45.730> nodejs<00:04:46.620> we

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
all right now if we click on nodejs we

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.460 
all right now if we click on nodejs we
get<00:04:47.830> this<00:04:48.040> coming<00:04:48.790> in<00:04:48.880> line<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.930> what<00:04:50.140> this<00:04:50.260> is

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
get this coming in line and what this is

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.980 
get this coming in line and what this is
is<00:04:50.740> it's<00:04:50.980> called<00:04:51.340> repl<00:04:52.090> which<00:04:52.540> stands<00:04:52.840> for

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
is it's called repl which stands for

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.830 
is it's called repl which stands for
read<00:04:53.410> eval<00:04:53.680> print<00:04:53.950> loop<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.850> it's<00:04:55.420> basically

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
read eval print loop and it's basically

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.080 
read eval print loop and it's basically
the<00:04:56.200> command-line<00:04:56.710> interface<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.640> we<00:04:57.880> can

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
the command-line interface that we can

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.840 
the command-line interface that we can
use<00:04:58.420> to<00:04:58.860> interact<00:04:59.860> with<00:04:59.980> node<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.610> we<00:05:00.700> can

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
use to interact with node and we can

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.780 
use to interact with node and we can
write<00:05:01.030> JavaScript<00:05:01.890> and<00:05:02.890> among<00:05:03.490> other<00:05:03.700> things

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
write JavaScript and among other things

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.060 
write JavaScript and among other things
but<00:05:04.750> we're<00:05:04.990> not<00:05:05.080> going<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:05.290> be<00:05:05.350> using<00:05:05.710> this<00:05:05.860> too

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
but we're not going to be using this too

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.130 
but we're not going to be using this too
much<00:05:06.250> because<00:05:06.700> we<00:05:06.940> can<00:05:07.090> actually<00:05:07.240> just<00:05:07.600> access

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
much because we can actually just access

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.130 
much because we can actually just access
it<00:05:08.320> from<00:05:08.770> our<00:05:09.450> command<00:05:10.450> line<00:05:10.510> we<00:05:10.840> could<00:05:10.960> access

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
it from our command line we could access

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.960 
it from our command line we could access
it<00:05:11.410> from<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.710> standard<00:05:12.130> Windows<00:05:12.610> command

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
it from the standard Windows command

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.320 
it from the standard Windows command
line<00:05:13.240> as<00:05:13.510> well<00:05:14.140> as<00:05:14.350> this<00:05:14.620> get<00:05:15.010> bash<00:05:15.310> all<00:05:16.150> right

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
line as well as this get bash all right

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.900 
line as well as this get bash all right
in<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.900> all<00:05:17.080> we<00:05:17.230> have<00:05:17.350> to<00:05:17.470> do<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.920> access<00:05:18.280> it<00:05:18.670> is

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
in the all we have to do to access it is

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.420 
in the all we have to do to access it is
just<00:05:19.360> type<00:05:19.570> in<00:05:19.750> node<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:20.320> then<00:05:20.950> it<00:05:21.070> gives<00:05:21.190> us

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
just type in node and then it gives us

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.140 
just type in node and then it gives us
that<00:05:21.640> same<00:05:22.590> greater<00:05:23.590> than<00:05:23.830> sign<00:05:24.190> and<00:05:24.580> we<00:05:25.000> can

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
that same greater than sign and we can

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.170 
that same greater than sign and we can
do<00:05:25.930> some<00:05:26.170> stuff<00:05:26.560> here<00:05:26.980> all<00:05:27.190> right<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:27.760> let's

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
do some stuff here all right so let's

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.630 
do some stuff here all right so let's
just<00:05:28.360> do<00:05:28.510> a<00:05:28.540> couple<00:05:28.840> simple<00:05:29.380> things<00:05:29.650> we<00:05:30.610> can

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
just do a couple simple things we can

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.970 
just do a couple simple things we can
basically<00:05:30.940> run<00:05:31.420> JavaScript<00:05:32.230> in<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.620> command

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
basically run JavaScript in the command

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.070 
basically run JavaScript in the command
line<00:05:33.070> all<00:05:33.880> right<00:05:33.940> so<00:05:34.390> we<00:05:34.600> can<00:05:34.630> assign

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
line all right so we can assign

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.400 
line all right so we can assign
variables<00:05:35.860> we'll<00:05:36.250> say<00:05:36.460> variable<00:05:37.060> Y<00:05:37.420> which

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
variables we'll say variable Y which

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.540 
variables we'll say variable Y which
gives<00:05:38.980> us<00:05:39.660> it<00:05:40.660> instantiates<00:05:41.620> a<00:05:41.860> variable<00:05:42.280> for

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
gives us it instantiates a variable for

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.350 
gives us it instantiates a variable for
us<00:05:44.160> we<00:05:45.160> can<00:05:45.310> say<00:05:45.550> y<00:05:46.560> equals<00:05:47.560> 4<00:05:48.070> and<00:05:48.340> it'll<00:05:49.150> give

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
us we can say y equals 4 and it'll give

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.480 
us we can say y equals 4 and it'll give
us<00:05:49.390> 4<00:05:50.140> back<00:05:51.060> if<00:05:52.060> we<00:05:52.120> say<00:05:52.630> variable<00:05:53.380> x<00:05:54.370> equals<00:05:55.360> 5

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
us 4 back if we say variable x equals 5

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.550 
us 4 back if we say variable x equals 5
we<00:05:57.490> get<00:05:57.640> undefined<00:05:58.000> and<00:05:58.570> it's<00:05:59.170> just<00:05:59.410> not

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
we get undefined and it's just not

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.810 
we get undefined and it's just not
returning<00:06:00.070> us<00:06:00.190> anything<00:06:00.430> it's<00:06:00.760> just

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
returning us anything it's just

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.050 
returning us anything it's just
assigning<00:06:01.390> the<00:06:01.600> variable<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:03.220> this<00:06:03.640> happens

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
assigning the variable and this happens

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.660 
assigning the variable and this happens
if<00:06:04.270> we<00:06:04.480> use<00:06:04.510> the<00:06:04.960> VAR<00:06:05.200> keyword<00:06:05.230> and<00:06:06.010> I'm<00:06:06.490> not

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
if we use the VAR keyword and I'm not

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.910 
if we use the VAR keyword and I'm not
I'm<00:06:07.060> not<00:06:07.090> a<00:06:07.270> hundred<00:06:07.510> percent<00:06:07.630> sure<00:06:07.990> why<00:06:08.530> it

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
I'm not a hundred percent sure why it

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.730 
I'm not a hundred percent sure why it
does<00:06:09.520> that<00:06:09.820> but<00:06:10.330> it<00:06:10.570> just<00:06:10.630> does<00:06:11.050> but<00:06:11.500> either

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
does that but it just does but either

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.850 
does that but it just does but either
way<00:06:12.070> you're<00:06:12.280> still<00:06:12.460> assigning<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.330> variable

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
way you're still assigning the variable

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.780 
way you're still assigning the variable
we<00:06:14.860> can<00:06:15.010> do<00:06:15.630> basic<00:06:16.630> math<00:06:16.810> so<00:06:17.320> we<00:06:17.590> can<00:06:17.740> say<00:06:17.980> X

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
we can do basic math so we can say X

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.530 
we can do basic math so we can say X
plus<00:06:19.270> y<00:06:19.960> which<00:06:20.920> will<00:06:21.130> give<00:06:21.310> us<00:06:21.340> nine<00:06:21.670> we<00:06:22.210> can

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
plus y which will give us nine we can

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.590 
plus y which will give us nine we can
increment

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
increment

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.880 
increment
so<00:06:25.600> X<00:06:26.560> is<00:06:26.830> now<00:06:26.980> six<00:06:28.260> we<00:06:29.260> can<00:06:29.290> do<00:06:29.530> stuff<00:06:29.830> with

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
so X is now six we can do stuff with

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.650 
so X is now six we can do stuff with
strings<00:06:30.460> will<00:06:31.000> say<00:06:31.240> variable<00:06:31.810> color<00:06:32.530> is<00:06:33.660> equal

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
strings will say variable color is equal

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.820 
strings will say variable color is equal
to<00:06:34.930> red<00:06:35.620> and<00:06:36.370> you<00:06:36.820> want<00:06:36.970> to<00:06:37.030> make<00:06:37.150> sure<00:06:37.180> you<00:06:37.510> use

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
to red and you want to make sure you use

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.340 
to red and you want to make sure you use
quotes<00:06:38.830> just<00:06:39.220> like<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.520> would<00:06:39.700> in<00:06:39.880> any

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
quotes just like you would in any

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.200 
quotes just like you would in any
JavaScript<00:06:42.060> alright<00:06:43.060> and<00:06:43.420> we<00:06:43.690> can<00:06:43.870> do<00:06:44.110> strings

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
JavaScript alright and we can do strings

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.660 
JavaScript alright and we can do strings
we<00:06:46.210> can<00:06:46.360> print<00:06:46.690> stuff<00:06:46.930> out<00:06:47.170> with<00:06:47.500> console<00:06:48.280> dot

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
we can print stuff out with console dot

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.630 
we can print stuff out with console dot
log<00:06:49.890> alright<00:06:50.890> so<00:06:51.160> in<00:06:51.310> here<00:06:51.580> we'll<00:06:51.820> say<00:06:53.640> my

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640 
log alright so in here we'll say my

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.660 
log alright so in here we'll say my
favorite<00:06:55.330> color<00:06:56.140> is<00:06:56.560> and<00:06:57.280> then<00:06:57.400> we<00:06:57.490> can

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
favorite color is and then we can

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.790 
favorite color is and then we can
concatenate<00:06:58.120> on<00:06:58.720> our<00:06:59.620> variable<00:07:01.380> okay<00:07:02.380> so<00:07:02.680> it

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
concatenate on our variable okay so it

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.060 
concatenate on our variable okay so it
says<00:07:02.950> my<00:07:03.160> favorite<00:07:03.550> color<00:07:03.760> is<00:07:03.940> red<00:07:03.970> and<00:07:05.070> this

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
says my favorite color is red and this

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.890 
says my favorite color is red and this
console<00:07:06.550> dot<00:07:06.730> log<00:07:06.790> you<00:07:07.240> may<00:07:07.360> have<00:07:07.480> seen<00:07:07.720> before

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
console dot log you may have seen before

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.360 
console dot log you may have seen before
you<00:07:08.350> may<00:07:08.500> have<00:07:08.620> used<00:07:08.890> it<00:07:09.130> in<00:07:09.370> chrome<00:07:10.030> tools

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370

nodejs

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.210 
nodejs
actually<00:07:13.150> runs<00:07:13.510> on<00:07:13.990> the<00:07:14.470> same<00:07:14.740> JavaScript

actually runs on the same JavaScript

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.240 
actually runs on the same JavaScript
engine<00:07:16.030> that<00:07:16.510> Chrome<00:07:16.900> runs<00:07:17.200> on<00:07:17.410> which<00:07:17.740> is<00:07:17.950> the

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
the v8 JavaScript engine and that's it's

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.140 
the v8 JavaScript engine and that's it's
really<00:07:23.560> fast<00:07:24.160> and<00:07:24.550> that's<00:07:24.790> one<00:07:24.970> of<00:07:25.090> the

really fast and that's one of the

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
really fast and that's one of the
reasons<00:07:25.510> why<00:07:25.960> note<00:07:26.410> is<00:07:26.590> so<00:07:26.770> quick<00:07:27.660> so<00:07:28.660> that's<00:07:29.080> a

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.170 
reasons why note is so quick so that's a

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.850 
reasons why note is so quick so that's a
basic<00:07:29.350> installation<00:07:31.260> like<00:07:32.260> I<00:07:32.380> said<00:07:32.650> I'm<00:07:32.830> just

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.860 
basic installation like I said I'm just

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.550 
basic installation like I said I'm just
kind<00:07:33.280> of<00:07:33.400> winging<00:07:33.640> it<00:07:33.850> for<00:07:34.120> this<00:07:34.240> series<00:07:34.750> so<00:07:35.230> I

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 
kind of winging it for this series so I

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.890 
kind of winging it for this series so I
know<00:07:35.980> in<00:07:36.280> the<00:07:36.400> next<00:07:36.670> video<00:07:37.000> I<00:07:37.060> want<00:07:37.570> to<00:07:37.690> start

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:37.900 
know in the next video I want to start

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.340 
know in the next video I want to start
getting<00:07:37.990> into<00:07:39.300> writing<00:07:40.300> scripts<00:07:40.750> that<00:07:40.870> we<00:07:41.170> can

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.350 
getting into writing scripts that we can

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.560 
getting into writing scripts that we can
access<00:07:41.530> in<00:07:41.890> the<00:07:41.980> browser<00:07:42.330> we'll<00:07:43.330> write<00:07:43.540> a

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:43.570 
access in the browser we'll write a

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.880 
access in the browser we'll write a
small<00:07:44.490> web<00:07:45.490> server<00:07:45.790> program<00:07:46.390> with<00:07:47.290> node<00:07:47.560> you

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:47.890 
small web server program with node you

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.100 
small web server program with node you
actually<00:07:48.310> have<00:07:48.490> to<00:07:48.700> write<00:07:49.030> the<00:07:49.270> web<00:07:49.840> server

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.110 
actually have to write the web server

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.830 
actually have to write the web server
yourself<00:07:51.090> you<00:07:52.090> have<00:07:52.240> to<00:07:52.360> send<00:07:52.540> out<00:07:52.690> the

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 
yourself you have to send out the

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.670 
yourself you have to send out the
request<00:07:53.200> and<00:07:53.410> response<00:07:54.000> it's<00:07:55.000> not<00:07:55.180> like

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 
request and response it's not like
