00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
file actionscript to point of I don't

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.109 
file actionscript to point of I don't
know<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.160> difference<00:00:23.279> between<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.789> 2<00:00:23.939> point

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119

know the difference between the 2 point
0<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> frequent<00:00:24.779> oh<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.199> think<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:26.010> kind<00:00:26.250> of

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
0 and a frequent oh I think it's kind of

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.790 
0 and a frequent oh I think it's kind of
like<00:00:26.490> an<00:00:26.670> 8-bit<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.420> 16-bit<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.320> Photoshop

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
like an 8-bit in a 16-bit in Photoshop

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
like an 8-bit in a 16-bit in Photoshop
with<00:00:29.189> an<00:00:29.340> 8-bit<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.060> do<00:00:30.179> more<00:00:30.390> um<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:31.590> as

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
with an 8-bit you can do more um like as

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.979 
with an 8-bit you can do more um like as
a<00:00:31.740> special<00:00:32.160> effects<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.579> crap<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.600> guess<00:00:33.660> it

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
a special effects on crap so I guess it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.880 
a special effects on crap so I guess it
kind<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:37.010> go<00:00:38.010> down<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> size<00:00:38.760> and

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
make the dip in 640 by 480 frame right

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.100 
make the dip in 640 by 480 frame right
15<00:00:49.050> frames<00:00:49.350> per<00:00:49.559> second<00:00:50.750> background<00:00:51.750> color

you know get a shape going or something

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.100 
you know get a shape going or something
just<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:15.900> brush<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.439> brush

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
sizes and shapes are down here so I'm

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.289 
sizes and shapes are down here so I'm
just<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> lower<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.520> brush<00:01:23.700> size<00:01:23.970> down

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299

smoothing<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.409> I'm<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> set<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
smoothing so I'm going to set the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.490 
smoothing so I'm going to set the
smoothing<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.299> time<00:01:36.600> 0<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.259> show<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
smoothing at first time 0 to show you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.569 
smoothing at first time 0 to show you
what<00:01:37.890> smoothing<00:01:38.400> does<00:01:39.290> zero<00:01:40.290> smoothing<00:01:40.799> just

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
what smoothing does zero smoothing just

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.730 
what smoothing does zero smoothing just
cleans<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.000> those<00:01:42.240> edges<00:01:42.420> slightly<00:01:42.990> see

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
cleans up those edges slightly see

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.469 
cleans up those edges slightly see
that's<00:01:43.860> extremely<00:01:44.310> picture<00:01:44.640> right<00:01:44.790> there<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that's extremely picture right there it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.160 
that's extremely picture right there it
has<00:01:45.659> an<00:01:45.869> anti<00:01:46.409> any<00:01:47.299> alia<00:01:48.299> swim<00:01:48.720> over<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
has an anti any alia swim over you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.010 
has an anti any alia swim over you
pronounce<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.649> pretty<00:01:50.130> much<00:01:50.689> bait<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
pronounce that pretty much bait out the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.200 
pronounce that pretty much bait out the
edges<00:01:52.579> if<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.759> had<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.909> fader<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.659> mean<00:01:55.110> Jesus

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
edges if you had the fader I mean Jesus

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.289 
edges if you had the fader I mean Jesus
smoothing<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> hundred<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:02.149> looks<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
smoothing up to a hundred it looks a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.600 
smoothing up to a hundred it looks a
little<00:02:03.450> weird<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:05.100> smooths<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.520> out

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
little weird but it smooths it out

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.459 
little weird but it smooths it out
relatively<00:02:05.969> good<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.290> between

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
relatively good and then in between

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.300 
relatively good and then in between
which<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.099> about<00:02:08.729> 50

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
which is about 50

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.880 
which is about 50
gives<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.550> effect<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.989> think<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.680> good

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
gives you that effect so I think a good

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.830 
gives you that effect so I think a good
setting<00:02:14.250> would<00:02:14.340> actually<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.760> more<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> 35

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
setting would actually be more like a 35

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.809 
setting would actually be more like a 35
in<00:02:16.739> here<00:02:20.209> or<00:02:21.209> even<00:02:21.690> lower<00:02:22.010> but<00:02:23.010> that's<00:02:23.610> that

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
in here or even lower but that's that

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.630 
in here or even lower but that's that
baseball<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.480> ctrl<00:02:24.989> alt<00:02:25.200> Z<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.890> mean<00:02:26.720> control<00:02:27.720> Z

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
baseball so ctrl alt Z I mean control Z

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.940 
baseball so ctrl alt Z I mean control Z
to<00:02:29.640> go<00:02:29.760> back<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.720> why<00:02:31.410> don't<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.620> start<00:02:31.799> making

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
to go back so why don't we start making

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.640 
to go back so why don't we start making
our<00:02:32.129> first<00:02:32.250> animation<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.599> first<00:02:34.379> thing<00:02:34.500> we

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
our first animation so first thing we

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.320 
our first animation so first thing we
should<00:02:34.709> do<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:34.920> draw<00:02:35.519> any<00:02:35.790> shape<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.150> you

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
should do is draw any shape that you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.670 
should do is draw any shape that you
want<00:02:36.420> even<00:02:36.989> just<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.260> line<00:02:38.930> now<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.230> think<00:02:42.530> f7<00:02:43.530> is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
want even just a line now I think f7 is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.970 
want even just a line now I think f7 is
tense<00:02:43.890> or<00:02:44.069> new<00:02:44.190> keyframe<00:02:44.519> yeah<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.650> can't

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
tense or new keyframe yeah so you can't

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.819 
tense or new keyframe yeah so you can't
see<00:02:47.220> where<00:02:47.610> your<00:02:47.849> last<00:02:48.090> line<00:02:48.390> was<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:49.019> you're

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
see where your last line was if you're

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.009 
see where your last line was if you're
on<00:02:49.980> your<00:02:50.220> second<00:02:50.549> frame<00:02:50.760> now<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.510> red<00:02:51.780> box

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
so now let's kind of make this line move

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.280 
so now let's kind of make this line move
a<00:03:14.430> little<00:03:14.549> bit<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.940> now<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.150> shifted<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.840> down

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
a little bit so now we shifted it down

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.129 
a little bit so now we shifted it down
forward<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.690> press<00:03:19.819> f7<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:21.120> apologize<00:03:21.780> to

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
forward and press f7 I apologize to

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.870 
forward and press f7 I apologize to
create<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.799> new<00:03:23.810> frame<00:03:24.810> keyframing<00:03:25.709> f7<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.639> guess

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
create a new frame keyframing f7 I guess

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.910 
create a new frame keyframing f7 I guess
for<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:28.459> um<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:30.420> now<00:03:30.569> you<00:03:31.139> can<00:03:31.349> see<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> past

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
for that um so now you can see the past

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.379 
for that um so now you can see the past
two<00:03:32.099> layers<00:03:32.310> which<00:03:32.579> we<00:03:32.760> don't<00:03:32.880> want<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.269> only

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
two layers which we don't want you only

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.539 
two layers which we don't want you only
want<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> past<00:03:33.989> one<00:03:34.349> layer<00:03:34.590> now<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.310> can<00:03:35.430> do

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
want the past one layer now you can do

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.740 
want the past one layer now you can do
justice<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.819> how<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.060> like<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.269> but<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.569> only

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
justice to how you like it but I only

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.920 
justice to how you like it but I only
like<00:03:36.959> show<00:03:37.139> you<00:03:37.260> past<00:03:37.530> 11<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.389> drag<00:03:39.660> this

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
like show you past 11 so you drag this

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.379 
like show you past 11 so you drag this
start<00:03:40.560> running<00:03:40.859> skiing<00:03:41.130> over<00:03:41.639> so<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.239> only

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
start running skiing over so it only

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.720 
start running skiing over so it only
covers<00:03:42.690> two<00:03:42.959> frames<00:03:43.260> carping<00:03:44.190> one<00:03:44.310> frame<00:03:44.549> I

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
covers two frames carping one frame I

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.129 
covers two frames carping one frame I
don't<00:03:44.880> even<00:03:44.940> understand<00:03:45.510> why<00:03:45.690> they<00:03:45.900> allow

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
don't even understand why they allow

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.740 
don't even understand why they allow
that<00:03:46.200> but<00:03:47.160> two<00:03:47.400> frames<00:03:47.700> interstate<00:03:48.419> like<00:03:48.540> that

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
that but two frames interstate like that

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.300 
that but two frames interstate like that
so<00:03:49.440> I'm<00:03:49.919> going<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.130> draw<00:03:50.400> another<00:03:50.669> line<00:03:51.209> moving

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
so I'm going to draw another line moving

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.120 
so I'm going to draw another line moving
f7<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.840> keep<00:03:55.530> kind<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.829> changing<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.310> area<00:03:56.730> of

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
f7 and keep kind of changing the area of

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.720 
f7 and keep kind of changing the area of
where<00:03:59.130> your<00:03:59.340> line<00:03:59.579> is<00:03:59.609> now<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:02.280> always<00:04:02.489> gonna

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
where your line is now it's always gonna

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:29.360 
where your line is now it's always gonna
look<00:04:02.970> extremely<00:04:03.720> rough

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.219 

okay<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.870> added<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.139> bunch<00:04:31.290> crap<00:04:31.560> yep<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:33.229> so

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
okay so added a bunch crap yep and so

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.710 
okay so added a bunch crap yep and so
not<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.380> preview<00:04:34.830> animation<00:04:35.360> just<00:04:36.360> press<00:04:36.570> enter

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
not a preview animation just press enter

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.180 
not a preview animation just press enter
I<00:04:39.290> think<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.380> looks<00:04:40.530> pretty<00:04:40.620> good<00:04:42.650> well<00:04:43.650> I'm

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
I think it looks pretty good well I'm

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.320 
I think it looks pretty good well I'm
not<00:04:44.310> going<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.520> get<00:04:44.669> into<00:04:44.880> really<00:04:45.060> advanced

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
not going to get into really advanced

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.100 
not going to get into really advanced
stuff<00:04:45.600> up<00:04:45.720> but<00:04:46.500> it's<00:04:46.949> a<00:04:47.040> really<00:04:47.280> basic<00:04:47.550> um

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
stuff up but it's a really basic um

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.890 
stuff up but it's a really basic um
sorta<00:04:49.110> how<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.290> make<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.680> decent<00:04:50.639> animation<00:04:51.270> now

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
sorta how to make a decent animation now

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.150 
sorta how to make a decent animation now
you<00:04:51.960> could<00:04:52.229> also<00:04:52.380> do<00:04:52.800> long<00:04:53.040> shapes<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:56.010> then

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
you could also do long shapes and then

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.870 
you could also do long shapes and then
new<00:04:57.060> frame<00:04:58.160> chinky<00:05:01.280> but<00:05:02.280> there's<00:05:02.460> no<00:05:02.550> point<00:05:02.820> in

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
new frame chinky but there's no point in

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.010 
new frame chinky but there's no point in
doing<00:05:03.030> that<00:05:03.330> because<00:05:03.539> you<00:05:03.780> can<00:05:03.900> do<00:05:03.990> something

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
doing that because you can do something

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.110 
doing that because you can do something
called<00:05:04.470> motion<00:05:04.889> tween<00:05:05.220> which<00:05:05.639> I'm<00:05:05.940> going<00:05:06.060> to

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
called motion tween which I'm going to

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.330 
called motion tween which I'm going to
explain<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.690> next<00:05:07.020> toil

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.080 

so<00:05:15.000> now<00:05:15.120> if<00:05:15.210> you<00:05:15.300> want<00:05:15.419> to<00:05:15.449> watch<00:05:15.600> it<00:05:15.630> again<00:05:17.090> now

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
so now if you want to watch it again now
