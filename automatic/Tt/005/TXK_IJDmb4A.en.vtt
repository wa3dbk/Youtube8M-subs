00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.820
 what is needed to succeed 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.160
 in the crowded market segment of the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.870
 compact cars but certainly one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.970
 attractive line and features 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.109
 high level electronic but also of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.960
 an engine that knows how to match 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.720
 brilliance good performance and consumption 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.279
 no excessive fuel ford and test 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 to bring all this together with the new one 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.500
 focus equipped with the brand new 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.460
 1500 pd engine is available 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.620
 in the variants from 95 105 to 120 horses 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.030
 just the most powerful version should 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.770
 also be the most 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.899
 interesting for the Italian public 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.610
 because of its perfect balance 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.610
 between performance and consumption 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.789
 already approved according to the euro regulation 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.710
 6 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.659
 the small diesel unit of the oval 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 blue looks perfect for needs 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.220
 of the clientele of the beautiful country with one 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 maximum speed that touches the 195 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.580
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.310
 180 in the case of the wagon e 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.979
 an acceleration from 0 to 100 completed 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.840
 in about 10 and a half seconds while the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.000
 average distances declared yes 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.420
 stand at over 26 kilometers with a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.789
 liter 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.890
 but the third generation of the focus has 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.750
 also other arrows to his bow as a 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.000
 more driving pleasure thanks to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.429
 greater torsional rigidity and to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.860
 news on suspension and shock absorbers 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.899
 new electronic systems in addition to one 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 modification of electric power steering 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.530
 in fact the ford engineers also have 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.350
 worked on the control system 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.350
 electronic stability by introducing 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.299
 the eps function can anticipate 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.520
 any slippage of the car e 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.159
 to act to prevent the loss of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.840
 control 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.759
 fun technology and low consumption 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.920
 these are therefore the three 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.110
 winning features of the new 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.700
 focus that will soon renew the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.700
 successes of previous versions
