00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.139
 so hello to all this slightly 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.880
 non-standard video for my channel in 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.799
 this video I want to teach you to put 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.830
 self- shutdown timer for your computer 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.619
 in my case on windows 7 I donâ€™t know 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.420
 it works on this other windows but on 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 windows 7 runs one hundred percent 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.769
 we will not need any applets 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.689
 nothing this is all directly related to 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.970
 windows commands so here I have 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.070
 such a notebook and so that I do not forget 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.759
 In general, our first action is open 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.100

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.530

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.329

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.850
