00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hey today i'm gonna show you what you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.890
 can do with these essence super heroes 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.000
 effect nails and those are small pots 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.250
 with glitter 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.290
 I'll show you this for a while 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.630
 first is a holographic glitter 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.670
 like powder and that is a number 0 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.350
 a super mine 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.689
 the second that there are the wybertjes 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.590
 triangles in different pink 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.939
 colors and that is called fantastic earle and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.590
 third are a bit of that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.610
 octagonal 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.809
 glitters in blue green and that is the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 incredible 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.739
 today no number 0 a super one 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.989
 use holographic glitter 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.469
 and I will do that about my nails 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:49.739
 I now have and I wear superman 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.980
 from the super heroes too 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.370
 you have holographic glitter in this 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.840
 but not so bad that I say so wow 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.520
 that's why I have the powder one more time 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.320
 about next 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.119
 I use the super essence for that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.159
 heroes effect new bridge at that is one 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.740
 tassel specially made to the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.020
 glitter and later on 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 and look how beautiful the handle of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.549
 This tassel is only for that reason you would like him 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.180
 although I still want to go a layer now 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.430
 applying superman 'the varnish and the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.430
 super heroes collection of essence 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.880
 it is indeed a beautiful silver 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.890
 varnishes with some holographic 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.900
 glitter but like me in my 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.439
 review as done 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.840
 I don't think it's fantastic at all 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.970
 then I grab the sparkles and they are 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.820
 put such a sprinkle in that jar 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.820
 scatter you and everything 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.270
 it is best to put it above a container or something 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.869
 and then I pick up my brush and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.479
 with that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.479
 I wipe away the surplus 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.480
 and it looks a bit like how you get the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.040
 yes of those crystal powders 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.140
 it is actually the same idea only 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.590
 then with a whole gift 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.570
 holographic glitter and if you are now 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.690
 looks in proportion to my other 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.280
 how many more hello they are now 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.530
 here you see my needle 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.709
 closer you should see what one 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.620
 difference, these glitter flavors really want 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.330
 unwise beautiful I'm going to give him another name 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.200
 Finish on Sunday and then you see 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.200
 that so the end result 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.010
 and so we see after 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.770
 ultimately really unwise beautiful 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 and I have another undergrowth 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.130
 bit glittery late because i do 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.080
 liked neon festive effect but that 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.380
 Normally you can do it that way 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.900
 pour it back into the container 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.300
 this is how they became you can here 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.680
 apply another topcoat 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.840
 but make sure you are real 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.970
 brush your nails well with it 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.640
 tassel because of course you don't want that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.430
 these glitters come in your good top coat 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.250
 which also gives you even more your other nails 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.989
 you make other money job you can do this 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.060
 holographic powder of course too 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.630
 use to coat a holographic top 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.060
 to make 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.590
 I will leave that in another video 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.269
 because that is also quite natural 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.120
 very nice to make 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.360
 and yes I really like the super 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.120
 you pink glitter powders in the box 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.890
 of course not very necessary but me 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.140

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.030

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.410
