00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.739
 yes what should the second time scatter environment that was otherwise cloudy Order were 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.019
 also two 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.579
 namely, I'll show you a little video on the mode head 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.180
 The framework of this mode is that process serves two teams 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.410
 the small team are the hunters the other team are ideal 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:31.390
 around 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.550
 Why talk about the hunted team? 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.530
 their job, of course, is in there 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.250
 to hide 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.920
 and to stay as unrecognized by the hunters as the hunters 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.440
 Name says they simply hunt into the finish 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.150
 that the identify 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.820
 and turn off course 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.320
 since you see it right here I finally made it that way 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.550
 cult-rocker satisfied with the education lists 17 to you also like the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.550
 so be the ECJ of the colors of the clothes and so very cool 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.260
 Why 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.320
 it's true that every one percent in both teams is the same for you 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.720
 Tehran cadres, that is, new targets whose characteristics have been selected 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.130
 as leader of the team 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.060
 Hardts percent each has these natural resources and the opposing team 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.810
 Percent selected the work and that means the whole team is 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.950
 know the hall 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.850
 So the whole frame somehow I find the cholesterol level 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.640
 because you really lead as a group as a unit around yes and just 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.980
 try the other one 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.980
 the one-sided times here to make room 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.160
 Euro 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.690
 Do not be surprised that samples are not just one percent 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.590
 Donations name stands but around 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.640
 who from the other percent that is so 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.720
 that the video has not been taken from my press at home 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.680
 Haberson bathing and Opel 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.690
 for the respective country 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.690
 but of course played itself 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.590
 he has a whole for that too, of course, he is again 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.899
 Rate but again it is stated 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.229
 not so easy because it's about 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.459
 and then again for Buchholz canceled good 200 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.529
 optimistic again 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.529
 not always close to him 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.419
 We'll take a look at Trier 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:28.970
 the opposing team 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.970
 As said before, Halter has to hide, that means they can 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.369
 but you can also become the 1 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.599
 Berger put on trial the other born 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.389
 Percent has the 1 on the round so to speak that finds Wolf programs 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.349
 Rail track lead customers 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.370
 so if the educational and capable and alican t 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.970
 In other words, he has the time to race and percent is then okay immediately 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.709
 I'm his pursuer what then as a percentage respectful of MÃ¼ller 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.800
 is displayed to him as if I pass him by 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.890
 as of immediately I am not for substantive reasons z 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.799
 said, "That was a very nice killed for your chair of waiting 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.089
 Have devoured the euro and the dollar 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:18.629
 despite connection with the 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.819
 Of course you have to have a Super Bowl Bochum's percent here as well 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:22.289
 both 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:23.079
 then normal 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.079
 one percent of just-in-a-row modes 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:31.049
 Unity with her as you can see we are displayed everywhere, of course 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.889
 where they are currently that means significant solo as well as straight 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.889
 just look for your goal or he really makes it in the group 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.579
 yes, but then the next one 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.759
 Arthur Schneider 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.819
 one goal per tree also comes directly back 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.269
 if that was right for him 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.429
 Salo 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:55.709
 until then 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.909
 No nothing not very far Muslims be inhabited 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.019
 just treat retirees 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.199
 I have to have you in the first one 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.520
 Did you see that where he hid? 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.520
 the government wanted in English 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.629
 and what for him 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:16.930
 Prader haptic 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.930
 Wine Tasting We have just seen a great career box 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.939
 yes that was the wrong one 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.939
 Let's not look at the 19 Red 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.020
 is one of the three and that's the way it is 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.249
 three types of which it is 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:38.990
 sometimes the golden mean was wrong 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.389
 50 50-chance now right or left, I do not want that first 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.240
 Truman 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.290
 Let's take it, I'm actually going to take the left 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.879
 Timo Glock from Wersau will not fail 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.430
 which means me and of course runs away now 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.029
 After one of us is already in the fall 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:03.490
 per MEMORIA gets 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.909
 March looks as though 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.469
 or the next one again 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.469
 yes, APA has also hidden well 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.960
 So I have to say the whole game makes me 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.490
 that he is fun because 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.029
 I stand in it generally 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:21.629
 now demolished 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.349
 Arbon made the AKN lines for example with pensioners of liquids 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.289
 However, it is a bit and Saturday 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.089
 to lead the pros 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.080
 That is also the case 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.960
 there it is from the side by the advice then of course the whole easier 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.300
 why does he really have to go to the movements 18 you've just seen 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.389
 Countries three types were victims 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.409
 an appointment the 11th 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.639
 very comfortable 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.639
 "We have to be fast as I do now 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.229
 yes it will come back again 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.330
 with the compensation 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.020
 two bags is required 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.369
 finished at 2:30 pm 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:08.189
 although IT still 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:10.680
 because the other can credit 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.680
 You also have good cards if you are the hunted 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.580
 as a hunted one gets the remaining percentage points for it when you look around 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.580
 percent 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.360
 for example, sitting on the bench for a long time or staking out interior spaces 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.629
 he always drinks points at certain intervals 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.029
 and as soon as you do 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.869
 For example, percent from the bank in Schwedt or from the opera house 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:35.379
 but Facebook wrote this 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.650
 that means she can not just wait in there and wait for one 

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:42.300
 Sanli kills at some point I remembered there again 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.300
 is 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:54.249
 yes and there is the round already over 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.680
 as you can see percent 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.259
 finally become 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.349
 First place went really well now that makes the most kills 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.719
 very cool 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:07.779
 Unfortunately I did not make any video for the second game anymore 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:11.449
 Hunted because I thought that was enough fear that she sees how it is 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:13.129
 because the fence is 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:16.179
 and of course I would be happy if he left comments percent more 

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:19.639
 namely also complains and of course all the thumbs up 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.810
 and I think I would say that Nexus look
