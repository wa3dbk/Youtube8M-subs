00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
a lot of questions about how I'm getting

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.730 
a lot of questions about how I'm getting
4k<00:00:04.740> video<00:00:05.100> out<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.759> sony<00:00:06.750> a7s<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.680> i'm

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
4k video out of the sony a7s and i'm

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.140 
4k video out of the sony a7s and i'm
going<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.950> show<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.099> right<00:00:08.309> now<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.790> was<00:00:08.820> not

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
going to show you right now it was not

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.299 
going to show you right now it was not
cheap<00:00:09.450> fun<00:00:09.750> or<00:00:09.900> easy<00:00:10.050> sometimes<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:11.130> doesn't

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
cheap fun or easy sometimes it doesn't

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.180 
cheap fun or easy sometimes it doesn't
always<00:00:11.490> work<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.179> results<00:00:12.540> are<00:00:12.630> sporadic

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
always work the results are sporadic

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.770 
always work the results are sporadic
essentially<00:00:14.190> we're<00:00:14.340> feeding<00:00:14.490> HDMI<00:00:15.089> out<00:00:15.360> of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
essentially we're feeding HDMI out of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.439 
essentially we're feeding HDMI out of
the<00:00:16.500> sony<00:00:16.830> a7s<00:00:17.449> into<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> Blackmagic<00:00:19.760> HDMI<00:00:20.760> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the sony a7s into a Blackmagic HDMI to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.939 
the sony a7s into a Blackmagic HDMI to
SDI<00:00:21.869> 4k<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:23.220> actually<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> 6g<00:00:24.390> converter<00:00:25.170> so

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
SDI 4k it's actually a 6g converter so

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.870 
SDI 4k it's actually a 6g converter so
this<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.220> sending<00:00:26.519> SDI<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:28.380> 6g<00:00:28.949> through<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
this is sending SDI out at 6g through a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.200 
this is sending SDI out at 6g through a
single<00:00:30.179> SDI<00:00:30.539> cable<00:00:30.859> that<00:00:31.859> comes<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.520> another

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
single SDI cable that comes to another

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.240 
single SDI cable that comes to another
black<00:00:33.510> magic<00:00:33.960> card<00:00:34.200> which<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.920> mini

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
black magic card which is a mini

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
black magic card which is a mini
converter<00:00:35.700> SDI<00:00:36.510> multiplex<00:00:37.260> 4k<00:00:37.850> that<00:00:38.850> splits

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
converter SDI multiplex 4k that splits

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.650 
converter SDI multiplex 4k that splits
it<00:00:39.450> into<00:00:39.570> four<00:00:40.200> SDI<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.670> quarter<00:00:42.329> signal

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it into four SDI so it's quarter signal

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
it into four SDI so it's quarter signal
each<00:00:42.860> into<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.270> jack<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.750> recorder<00:00:46.309> as<00:00:47.309> far

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
each into the a jack I recorder as far

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.560 
each into the a jack I recorder as far
as<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.700> know<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.420> only

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
as I know this is one of the only

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.690 
as I know this is one of the only
recorders<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.530> record<00:00:49.829> 4k<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.640> now

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
recorders that will record 4k and now

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.959 
recorders that will record 4k and now
everybody's<00:00:51.149> waiting<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.969> Shogun

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
everybody's waiting for the the Shogun

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.619 
everybody's waiting for the the Shogun
to<00:00:54.660> come<00:00:54.840> out<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.170> September<00:00:56.360> prices<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.480> these

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to come out in September prices on these

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.630 
to come out in September prices on these
components<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.859> order<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.129> make<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.370> work

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
components in order to make this work

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.420 
components in order to make this work
this<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.149> 280<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:01.710> 5<00:01:02.070> no

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
this is about 280 this is about 5 no

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.240 
this is about 280 this is about 5 no
this<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.640> about<00:01:02.789> 480<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.199> right<00:01:04.650> now<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> think

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
this is about 480 and right now I think

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.539 
this is about 480 and right now I think
the<00:01:05.369> cost<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.240> about<00:01:06.570> 3500<00:01:07.400> plus<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the cost on this is about 3500 plus you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.330 
the cost on this is about 3500 plus you
need<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.150> card<00:01:09.630> which<00:01:10.290> depends<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
need to get a card which depends on the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.730 
need to get a card which depends on the
size<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.909> you're<00:01:12.060> getting<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:13.590> about

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
size that you're getting it's about

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.410 
size that you're getting it's about
another<00:01:13.920> five<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.310> six<00:01:14.640> hundred<00:01:14.700> dollars<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
another five or six hundred dollars and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.590 
another five or six hundred dollars and
then<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> card<00:01:15.840> reader<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.580> it's<00:01:17.580> obviously<00:01:18.330> not

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
then a card reader so it's obviously not

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.780 
then a card reader so it's obviously not
very<00:01:18.710> affordable<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.310> way<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.549> I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
very affordable to do it this way but I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
very affordable to do it this way but I
wanted<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.330> some<00:01:21.479> good<00:01:21.630> tests<00:01:21.990> off<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
wanted to get some good tests off of the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
wanted to get some good tests off of the
a7<00:01:23.520> s<00:01:23.670> we're<00:01:23.850> doing<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> crash<00:01:24.330> course<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.990> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
about the gh4 and how to get 10 bit

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.469 
about the gh4 and how to get 10 bit
footage<00:01:37.229> off<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.700> I<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:39.060> some<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> the

footage off that I know some of the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.789 
footage off that I know some of the
questions<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.530> can

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
questions are going to be you know can

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.370 
questions are going to be you know can
you<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.479> can<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.570> feed<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.840> into<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> gh4

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you get can you feed this into the gh4

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.649 
you get can you feed this into the gh4
and<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.829> 10<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.220> out<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.939> short<00:01:45.210> answer<00:01:45.540> on

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and get 10 bit out the short answer on

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.069 
and get 10 bit out the short answer on
this<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.640> consistently<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.149> get<00:01:48.329> 5<00:01:48.930> or

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
this is not consistently we can get 5 or

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.630 
this is not consistently we can get 5 or
10<00:01:49.229> seconds<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> time<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> then<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> drops

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
10 seconds at a time and then it drops

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.999 
10 seconds at a time and then it drops
out<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.750> been<00:01:51.869> really<00:01:52.110> frustrating<00:01:52.829> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
out and it's been really frustrating so
