00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.150
 hello how about youtube people I am 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.760
 12 bloomberg and this time we are in a 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.940
 new video for the channel we are in a 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.500
 very close and special video and full of 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:20.380
 terror with bad night at fredys 4 this 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.439
 new game that has gone wrong does nothing 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.779
 and that with those who know me they know that 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.340
 I love this franchise and what 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.510
 let's do today is not going to be 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.150
 typical of playing night by night 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.100
 because more than anything it would be very typical and 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.840
 it's something they're going to do almost all of 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.410
 the youtubers and what I want to do 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.290
 is to do a tutorial on the techniques 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.820
 basic to know what the game is already 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.739
 that is a game that has changed 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.250
 very much the mechanics regarding the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.660
 films at trade salter previous and that 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.980
 well I hope you like many 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.690
 Sometimes you want to support with our long 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.250
 those comments that make a lot of happy 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.860
 to the channel and if you're new here 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.050
 subscribe and welcome to the family the 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.670
 tutorial I'll advance it at night 3 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.740
 which is more or less where they start 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.350
 appear all things and then 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.190
 I would like 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.360
 from night 6 and night 5 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.360
 this let's start 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.300
 guys let's give this not what 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.960
 let's basically do is teach them 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.210
 This is how to retain each 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.790
 animatronic and what tactics to use ok 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.400
 let's start first we're going to 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.970
 check left the game consists 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.650
 in listening first in a door if not 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.840
 you hear any kind of noise you can 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.750
 light but if you hear a noise 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.220
 breath above all you have to close 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.890
 the door and wait for the anime to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.080
 code that is there will go worth in 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.210
 main of that see the door of the 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.160
 left the door on the right the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.979
 back bed in which they accumulate 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.930
 mini freddy and if those mini frei 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.530
 accumulate many accumulate as 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.100
 four I think they are already appears then the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.200
 Freddy of the giant fridge, so to speak 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.510
 the original fraud is worth 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.360
 is the closet the closet we have 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.239
 in front of this, you have to check it when you 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.010
 move because while the door is not 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.530
 move there's nobody there so no 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.750
 let's waste time to go there to go 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.890
 there for now then it will already get foxy and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.650
 will be one more place to review total 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.069
 it's the same is to repeat all the time not 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.010
 strong left hear 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.180
 something has been heard because we closed 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.640
 basically if we wait for him to leave 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.109
 and we already return and continue with 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.800
 our sides 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:50.430
 there I was wrong a bit but good 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.200
 the closet door and there is fox and 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.000
 here changes everything good does not change much 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.160
 the technique is just that you have to review it 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.740
 foxx and you have to go closing and opening the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.090
 closet until it moves away I do it 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.920
 normally until it becomes a 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.720
 doll can also leave it up 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.860
 to see the hook is no problem 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.090
 OK 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.310
 right door ok 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.780
 the bed we had many walls and 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.010
 now we go with the order in door 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.010
 left we listen 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.120
 there is no one ok now next door 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.120
 right we listen 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.260
 there is no one either ok camera 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.300
 we scare the freddys and wardrobe for 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.650
 go putting fox and little by little that's 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.800
 simply what we have to go 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.450
 repeating during the night with some 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.750
 exceptions that you go crazy a 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.540
 little but can be easily fixed 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.250
 no but if another thing I want to comment 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.960
 is that this gameplay I could not 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.060
 comment live this I am 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.530
 commenting above is not just 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.530
 listen to a technical anima but let's 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.300
 close the door in the whole mouth and I have not 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.040
 could comment the gameplay sent more 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.050
 that nothing because it is a game that requires 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.760
 of a lot of concentration and that 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.090
 listen then if you're talking no 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.490
 you hear what is happening in your 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.080
 no, so I said 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.690
 above all more than anything this is a 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.700
 small tutorial like to teach you of 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.070
 what's the game what technique is still 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.780
 and what theme goes night 5 the game 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.780
 changes completely and is a video that 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.110
 I will separate 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.730
 and as you can see or is that going 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.120
 repeating each play 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.360
 that is 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.970
 Each place is like the modus operandi for 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.120
 so saying we are going to try to pass the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.340
 pull night so you can see that the 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.040
 technique does work at least in 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.750
 the night this is the most leveled so 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.010
 say it 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.010
 and have bone 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.630
 I can even notice that on this night 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.569
 the animatronics were very, very 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.849
 that very aggressive 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.119
 but equally we have been able 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.120
 retain with the technique or I think that 

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:05.520
 It is quite 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.110
 it's quite useful there will not be other people that 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.260
 do it in another way with another order 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.400
 but for me personally this is the 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.050
 definitive mechanics not 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.389
 this 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.900
 And then I'll do more videos of finsat 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:27.190
 reid 4 that the truth is that I love 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.660
 for nothing because basically what that is yes 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.030
 because he has seen a lot of people 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.410
 scott cause to change the system of 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.850
 I play a little bit, well, there's a lot 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.889
 people who stay a little crazy and do not 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.800
 I knew how the subject was the same and even 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.960
 I did not like it at first and now 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.720
 when I was beginning to understand how it was 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.050
 I said that he is cool and 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.840
 I'm going to make a video and everything to see 4 of 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.220
 the morning we will see if we step 5 and 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.500
 we finished spending this night 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.060
 we sing the mini predis the fox and that 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.280
 sometimes it gets a bit tramline and not 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.099
 you want to go but little by little like that 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.569
 that is moving away not what is said or in 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.060
 the moment when he sees the gaff 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.800
 you can go quietly but for 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.099
 be more sure of yourself and your 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.789
 life is better to put a doll 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.789
 kawaii 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.330
 man give it to me 5 m and come 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.070
 and that is that animatronics are very 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.140
 thrown from time to time are in the 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.690
 god door 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.860
 the mini paris come 5 in the morning and 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.640
 we have arrived or easily 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.410
 repeating each zone or is it 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.930
 practically as if we had the child 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.910
 everywhere and then to be fast 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.800
 because having incredible reflexes 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:49.000
 for this game both auditory and 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.740
 as of your fingers to be able to pass it 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.490
 and it is already must be about to 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.300
 finish let's go 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:59.050
 and so if you put this into practice 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.050
 very simple 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.270
 so good without more guys I hope that 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.180
 you liked this little tutorial 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.630
 basic to know how the new game is going 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.979
 of scott caused a disaster this 4 what if 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.479
 it is like this to support with your like and 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.770

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.639
 super simple technique and then I will do 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.680
 video of night 5 and night 6 that are 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:32.410
 totally different and they are a little 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.870
 crazy but they're possible, so without 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.479
