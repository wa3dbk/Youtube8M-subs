as<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.940> slide<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:44.480> so<00:01:44.990> I'm<00:01:45.080> going<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.230> throw

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
as you slide it in so I'm going to throw

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.340 
as you slide it in so I'm going to throw
a<00:01:45.440> few<00:01:45.740> generic<00:01:46.340> things<00:01:46.640> in<00:01:46.910> here<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.480> that

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
a few generic things in here and that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.840 
a few generic things in here and that
you<00:01:48.410> might<00:01:48.590> want<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:48.890> see<00:01:49.100> how<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:49.400> fits<00:01:49.610> in

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
you might want to see how it fits in

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.120 
you might want to see how it fits in
there<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:50.480> here's<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.810> iphone<00:01:51.230> you<00:01:51.710> can<00:01:51.770> see

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
there so here's the iphone you can see

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.760 
there so here's the iphone you can see
it<00:01:52.310> just<00:01:52.340> goes<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.210> there<00:01:53.360> tight<00:01:53.720> because<00:01:54.590> it's

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
it just goes in there tight because it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.590 
it just goes in there tight because it's
already<00:01:54.950> pushing<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.580> edges<00:01:55.910> but<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:56.510> you

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
already pushing on the edges but if you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.590 
already pushing on the edges but if you
just<00:01:56.780> clamp<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:58.220> then<00:01:58.490> holds<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:58.940> in<00:01:59.090> one

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
just clamp it in it then holds it in one

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.020 
just clamp it in it then holds it in one
fall<00:01:59.840> out<00:02:00.050> you<00:02:00.530> can<00:02:00.710> see<00:02:00.980> it<00:02:01.190> does<00:02:01.580> come<00:02:02.000> up

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
fall out you can see it does come up

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.940 
fall out you can see it does come up
higher<00:02:02.450> than<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.170> back<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.530> cradle<00:02:03.740> which

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
higher than the back of the cradle which

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.190 
higher than the back of the cradle which
is<00:02:04.100> fine<00:02:04.370> but<00:02:05.060> it's<00:02:05.210> then<00:02:05.510> resting<00:02:06.020> on<00:02:06.110> the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
is fine but it's then resting on the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.619 
is fine but it's then resting on the
bottom<00:02:06.230> feet<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.370> then<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.730> release<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.420> just

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
bottom feet so then to release you just

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.440 
bottom feet so then to release you just
hit<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.869> button<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:10.220> then<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:10.910> can<00:02:11.060> slide<00:02:11.270> it

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
out on the side of these arms here as

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.010 
out on the side of these arms here as
well<00:02:13.790> you'll<00:02:14.000> see<00:02:14.270> this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
well you'll see this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.880 
well you'll see this
foam<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.160> there<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:17.390> that's<00:02:17.690> how<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.110> will<00:02:18.290> hold

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
foam in there so that's how it will hold

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.200 
foam in there so that's how it will hold
the<00:02:19.040> device<00:02:19.160> in<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.550> will<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:19.790> clamp<00:02:20.060> around

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
the device in it will just clamp around

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.280 
the device in it will just clamp around
it<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:21.290> they<00:02:21.470> have<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.280> RAM<00:02:22.520> dash<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.600> 20

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
it but they have it the RAM dash a 20

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.710 
it but they have it the RAM dash a 20
des<00:02:24.890> un<00:02:25.160> one<00:02:25.690> universal<00:02:26.690> cycling<00:02:27.350> cradle
