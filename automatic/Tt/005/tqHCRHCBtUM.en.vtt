really nicely nicely placed and you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.380 
really nicely nicely placed and you
don't<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> complete<00:01:11.280> straight<00:01:11.790> run<00:01:12.030> here

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
don't have a complete straight run here

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.719 
don't have a complete straight run here
but<00:01:12.540> rather<00:01:12.689> you've<00:01:12.990> got<00:01:13.200> an<00:01:13.320> opening<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
mic<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.159> speaker<00:01:20.490> over<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.820> obviously

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
mic the speaker over here obviously

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630 
mic the speaker over here obviously
inside<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.310> there's<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
inside what you see is that there's this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.480 
inside what you see is that there's this
honeycomb<00:01:24.060> design<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> face<00:01:25.830> logo<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
honeycomb design and the I face logo and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
honeycomb design and the I face logo and
this<00:01:27.000> gives<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> nice<00:01:27.900> bit<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.140> protection

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this gives it a nice bit of protection

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.870 
this gives it a nice bit of protection
because<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.159> gives<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> some<00:01:29.640> shock

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
because it gives it some shock

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.109 
because it gives it some shock
absorbency<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.689> let's<00:01:30.869> take<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> dump

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
absorbency so let's take a dump

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.390 
absorbency so let's take a dump
iPhone<00:01:33.119> 5c<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.290> exactly<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> same<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.280> not
