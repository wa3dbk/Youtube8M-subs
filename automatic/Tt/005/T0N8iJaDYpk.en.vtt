00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 countries 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.760
 a geometric colored pattern 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.890

 coronation of his parents and the name of 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.090
 the Galician designer was written in 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.090
 all the newspapers in the world 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.290
 media revolution yes but not one 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.660
 surprise those who know pili race 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.180
 they understand it, few ideas are 50 years old 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.710
 half the world has already surrendered to his 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.320
 extraordinary ability to create 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.730
 adaptation to the times and strict 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.730
 sense of attention here 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.590
 as wild side 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.280
 These hands are the main 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.250
 responsible for your success as a businesswoman 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.140
 and as a generator of trends hands 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.930
 that are part of a chain that she 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.750
 started in 1963 when his daughter was born 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.210
 Salome starts designing for her and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.620
 almost inadvertently founds his own brand of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.400
 children's clothing at the end of 63 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.890
 I remember that it is a year is very 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.980
 me very significant because it was the year 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.040
 that we got married 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.810
 that we undertook this new stage and for 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.280
 supposedly the Kennedy murder that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.950
 we were in bed of that there was no 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.840
 television or newspaper when yes what 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.240
 they knew we did not buy it because 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.370
 we had no budget for that and what 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.220
 that there was radio and you know how to be 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.680
 so at night in bed and he said they killed 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.780
 Kennedy in Dallas 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.730
 we knew it was dallas now I think that 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.730
 soon they have two hundred dallas 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.480
 his name is Pilar RodrÃ­guez took the 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.760
 She names her husband 's career never 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.099
 he paints his nails he laughs thinking about his 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.769
 high school notes says it was very bad 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.659
 student wanted to be a doctor in a time 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.700
 in which all women had to 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:37.280
 be dressmakers so he had no choice 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.280
 to hang the scalpel and take the needles 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.920
 the first thing you get if you 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.350
 armies a few little ones that I to me 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.500
 I was always very good at sewing but in 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.260
 woven a fabric not knitted did not know 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.060
 nor sew the needles but like my mother-in-law 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.739
 He gave me a machine because I learned here 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:03.690
 to knit and make josecito and if I 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.690
 I agree a very tiny army 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.910
 then look at designs from the 60s but 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.390
 all these years are in your head the 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.940
 ideas are here 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.780
 and the new collections always drink 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.780
 of the previous 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.930
 everything is made in this factory that 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.970
 molds and seats tissues like chocolate 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.950
 that of charly in a ship the 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.780
 town hall of Pontevedra de mos stuck to 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.980
 the city of vigo where a 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.200
 hundreds of people almost all neighbors 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.629
 miami peru china russia japan moscow 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.609
 mexico and very soon caracas the plan of 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.210
 expansion of the firm started in 2007 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.250
 it seems that it has paid off 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.220
 the turnover of the fiscal year 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.080
 2013 amounted to almost 8 million 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.040
 euros, which meant an increase in 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.900
 almost 2% compared to 2012 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.750
 in Spain sales of career pili 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.129
 They fell almost 4% but outside 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.129
 they went up a 16 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.250
 getting so far does not cause vertigo to 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.440
 pili career your company has been surpassing 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.400
 stages gradually reaching 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.400
 small goals 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.980
 i 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.530
 this is every day train as 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.840
 the elite athletes every day 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.270
 come to the racket as I say face to 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.120
 rafa swim not one day lower the guard 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.770
 because you do not win the game if you do not 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.640
 you train every day but hard and 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.670
 of hard you have to do it very well or 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.550
 be the best you can strive in 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:51.500
 that the garments go perfectly in 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.500
 quality in service and in price 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.180
 Amsterdam the capital of the Netherlands 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.110
 will most likely be the destination of the 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.110
 next franchise 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.580
 this image of the princess alexia and 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.569
 catalina fired interest in pili in 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.960
 Holland 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:13.129
 there was a revolution exactly 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.860
 Bone in the press theme because good

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.689
 we knew that this was going to happen then 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.990
 as soon as the agency found out 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:28.139
 because it is a very well informed agency 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.089
 they started seeing calls from all 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.429
 parts of all the televisions and all 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.770
 the story and good to them it came out 

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:36.659

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.060
 or geometric and the combination of 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.180
 pastel colors will fill the wardrobes 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.010

 we did not have real clients 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:30.220
 that are all those that enter our 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.220
 stores we would not be here 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.460
