though I know that you didn't if you're
curious<00:03:09.400> there<00:03:10.000> are<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.240> number<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.750> things

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
curious there are a number of things

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.600 
curious there are a number of things
that<00:03:11.140> I've<00:03:11.350> shot<00:03:11.620> over<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.070> years<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.550> I

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
that I've shot over the years that I

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.770 
that I've shot over the years that I
just<00:03:12.910> haven't<00:03:13.180> gotten<00:03:13.330> around<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.600> editing

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
just haven't gotten around to editing

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.080 
just haven't gotten around to editing
and<00:03:14.200> don't<00:03:14.470> really<00:03:14.710> think<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.100> ever<00:03:15.220> will<00:03:15.460> for

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
and don't really think I ever will for

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.030 
and don't really think I ever will for
most<00:03:16.240> of<00:03:16.390> them<00:03:16.590> because<00:03:17.590> they're<00:03:17.740> just<00:03:17.920> not

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
most of them because they're just not

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.460 
most of them because they're just not
that<00:03:18.160> good<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:19.540> here<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.320> screen

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that good but here on the screen

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.310 
that good but here on the screen
somewhere<00:03:20.860> are<00:03:21.250> another<00:03:21.550> couple<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.320> videos

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
somewhere are another couple of videos

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.530 
somewhere are another couple of videos
that<00:03:23.350> SAT<00:03:24.280> around<00:03:24.550> on<00:03:24.790> my<00:03:24.910> computer<00:03:24.970> for<00:03:25.450> a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
that SAT around on my computer for a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.120 
that SAT around on my computer for a
long<00:03:25.720> time<00:03:25.960> before<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.410> ever<00:03:26.560> got<00:03:26.680> around<00:03:26.890> to

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
long time before I ever got around to

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.680 
long time before I ever got around to
cutting<00:03:27.370> them<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:27.700> putting<00:03:28.210> them<00:03:28.300> up<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.630> think

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
cutting them and putting them up I think

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.990 
cutting them and putting them up I think
always<00:03:29.440> on<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.590> second<00:03:30.010> channel<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.880> if

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
always on the second channel so if

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.610 
always on the second channel so if
you're<00:03:31.120> curious<00:03:31.330> about<00:03:31.570> whatever<00:03:31.960> whatever

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
you're curious about whatever whatever

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.160 
you're curious about whatever whatever
