you<00:02:28.330> can<00:02:28.510> play<00:02:28.750> music<00:02:29.140> off<00:02:29.620> your<00:02:29.860> iPod<00:02:30.220> if<00:02:30.459> you

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
you can play music off your iPod if you

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.120 
you can play music off your iPod if you
have<00:02:30.880> an<00:02:31.000> auxiliary<00:02:31.420> port<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.620> can<00:02:32.739> even<00:02:32.980> play

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
have an auxiliary port you can even play

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.210 
have an auxiliary port you can even play
something<00:02:33.459> off<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.819> USB<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.650> effect<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.160> think

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
something off a USB so in effect I think

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.580 
something off a USB so in effect I think
this<00:02:36.850> is<00:02:37.150> currently<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.720> play<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.230> most

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
this is currently the play of the most

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.070 
this is currently the play of the most
media<00:02:39.489> options<00:02:39.819> right<00:02:40.000> now<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:43.870> just

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
media options right now and we just

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.839 
media options right now and we just
don't<00:02:44.200> end<00:02:44.410> there<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.250> look<00:02:45.430> below<00:02:45.640> the

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
don't end there if you look below the

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.180 
don't end there if you look below the
audio<00:02:46.239> system<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.959> also<00:02:47.170> see<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.680> climate

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
audio system you also see a climate

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.280 
audio system you also see a climate
control<00:02:48.580> system<00:02:48.940> they've<00:02:49.720> also<00:02:49.870> given<00:02:50.110> you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
control system they've also given you

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.839 
control system they've also given you
lots<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.769> lots<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.010> cubby<00:02:51.280> holes<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.670> car

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
lots and lots of cubby holes in the car

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.460 
lots and lots of cubby holes in the car
so<00:02:52.000> there<00:02:52.150> are<00:02:52.239> two<00:02:52.360> cupholders<00:02:52.569> here<00:02:53.170> there's

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
so there are two cupholders here there's

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.960 
so there are two cupholders here there's
a<00:02:53.530> recess<00:02:53.890> ahead<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.549> there's<00:02:54.880> another

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
a recess ahead of it there's another

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.390 
a recess ahead of it there's another
recess<00:02:55.720> below<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.110> handbrake<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.769> speaking

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
recess below the handbrake and speaking

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.520 
recess below the handbrake and speaking
of<00:02:57.489> which<00:02:57.640> here<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.239> can<00:02:58.390> see<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.720> quality<00:02:59.140> of

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
of which here you can see the quality of

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.810 
of which here you can see the quality of
the<00:02:59.980> leather<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.310> stitching<00:03:00.519> on<00:03:00.760> the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
the leather and stitching on the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.670 
the leather and stitching on the
handbrake<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.630> also<00:03:01.780> get<00:03:02.019> no<00:03:02.049> pockets<00:03:02.500> at<00:03:02.590> the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
handbrake you also get no pockets at the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.319 
handbrake you also get no pockets at the
rear<00:03:02.859> which<00:03:03.100> some<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.519> competition<00:03:04.030> still

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
rear which some of the competition still

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.470 
rear which some of the competition still
don't<00:03:04.630> have<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:05.109> think<00:03:05.950> at<00:03:06.280> its<00:03:06.430> price<00:03:06.730> it's

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
don't have I think at its price it's

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.270 
don't have I think at its price it's
it's<00:03:07.870> not<00:03:08.079> just<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.290> bad<00:03:08.470> deal<00:03:08.709> after<00:03:08.859> all<00:03:09.069> in

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
it's not just a bad deal after all in

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.190 
it's not just a bad deal after all in
fact<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.910> starts<00:03:10.180> looking<00:03:10.269> like<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.900> lot<00:03:11.170> of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
fact it starts looking like a lot of

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:22.650 
fact it starts looking like a lot of
value<00:03:11.680> for<00:03:11.859> your<00:03:12.040> money

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.960 

the<00:03:23.660> Polo<00:03:23.900> has<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.620> very<00:03:25.069> different<00:03:25.550> engine

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
the Polo has a very different engine

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.570 
the Polo has a very different engine
from<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.450> rest<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> Polo<00:03:27.050> variants<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:28.400> is

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
from the rest of the Polo variants it is

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.870 
from the rest of the Polo variants it is
a<00:03:28.610> 1.2<00:03:29.240> liter<00:03:29.510> petrol<00:03:29.990> engine<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.730> is

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
a 1.2 liter petrol engine but it is

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.570 
a 1.2 liter petrol engine but it is
turbocharged<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:33.680> has<00:03:33.800> direct<00:03:34.100> injection

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
turbocharged and it has direct injection

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.910 
turbocharged and it has direct injection
now<00:03:35.180> what<00:03:35.420> these<00:03:35.900> two<00:03:36.140> things<00:03:36.410> mean

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
now what these two things mean

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.580 
now what these two things mean
is<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.520> it<00:03:37.760> extracts<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.420> lot<00:03:38.810> more<00:03:39.080> power<00:03:39.290> and

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
is that it extracts a lot more power and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.640 
is that it extracts a lot more power and
torque<00:03:39.650> from<00:03:40.520> a<00:03:40.610> very<00:03:40.790> small<00:03:41.270> displacement<00:03:41.650> so

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
torque from a very small displacement so

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.710 
torque from a very small displacement so
in<00:03:42.890> effect<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.550> numbers<00:03:43.880> are<00:03:44.060> 103<00:03:44.870> horses<00:03:45.470> and

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
in effect the numbers are 103 horses and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.570 
in effect the numbers are 103 horses and
175<00:03:47.720> Newton<00:03:48.110> meters<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.410> torque<00:03:48.530> now<00:03:49.400> many

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
175 Newton meters of torque now many

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.630 
175 Newton meters of torque now many
times<00:03:49.760> we<00:03:50.060> use<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.540> phrase<00:03:50.739> diesel<00:03:51.739> like<00:03:52.010> talk

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
times we use the phrase diesel like talk

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.310 
times we use the phrase diesel like talk
for<00:03:53.150> petrol<00:03:53.450> engines<00:03:53.810> that<00:03:53.930> are<00:03:53.989> really

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
for petrol engines that are really

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.680 
for petrol engines that are really
talking<00:03:54.530> but<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:55.760> engine<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:56.239> particular

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
talking but this engine in particular

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.620 
talking but this engine in particular
this<00:03:56.870> 1.2<00:03:57.530> liter<00:03:57.739> TSI<00:03:58.130> engine<00:03:58.670> it's<00:03:59.030> actually

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
this 1.2 liter TSI engine it's actually

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.800 
this 1.2 liter TSI engine it's actually
like<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.840> diesel<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.950> gets<00:04:01.220> its<00:04:01.459> 175<00:04:02.360> Newton

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
like a diesel it gets its 175 Newton

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.770 
like a diesel it gets its 175 Newton
meter<00:04:02.959> torque<00:04:03.019> peak<00:04:03.530> at<00:04:03.800> only<00:04:04.250> 1500<00:04:05.150> rpm<00:04:05.540> now

meter torque peak at only 1500 rpm now

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.530 
meter torque peak at only 1500 rpm now
what<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.500> means<00:04:06.560> is<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.550> unlike<00:04:08.150> any<00:04:08.360> of

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
what this means is that unlike any of

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.720 
what this means is that unlike any of
the<00:04:08.570> other<00:04:08.690> hot<00:04:08.989> hatches<00:04:09.290> we<00:04:09.410> had<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:09.800> far<00:04:10.100> you

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
the other hot hatches we had so far you

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.920 
the other hot hatches we had so far you
can<00:04:10.760> just<00:04:11.030> put<00:04:11.180> your<00:04:11.209> foot<00:04:11.480> down<00:04:11.660> and

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
can just put your foot down and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.170 
can just put your foot down and
sometimes<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:13.130> gearbox<00:04:13.519> is<00:04:13.670> refuses<00:04:14.120> to

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
sometimes the gearbox is refuses to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.090 
sometimes the gearbox is refuses to
downshift<00:04:14.390> because<00:04:14.930> there<00:04:15.440> is<00:04:15.620> enough<00:04:15.890> talk

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
downshift because there is enough talk

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.039 
downshift because there is enough talk
it<00:04:16.370> just<00:04:16.640> pulls<00:04:16.940> away<00:04:17.060> cleanly<00:04:17.419> it's

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
it just pulls away cleanly it's

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:30.450 
it just pulls away cleanly it's
brilliant

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460
