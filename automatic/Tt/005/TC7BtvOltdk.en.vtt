00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
power to your battery from your

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.730 
power to your battery from your
alternator<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.750> way<00:00:18.900> if<00:00:19.199> you're<00:00:19.470> running

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
alternator so that way if you're running

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
an aftermarket alarm system and you're

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.660 
an aftermarket alarm system and you're
running<00:00:22.109> aftermarket<00:00:22.769> sound<00:00:23.010> system<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.609> all

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
running aftermarket sound system and all

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.179 
running aftermarket sound system and all
your<00:00:23.850> aftermarket<00:00:24.330> stuff<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.529> can<00:00:25.920> actually

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
your aftermarket stuff it can actually

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.310 
your aftermarket stuff it can actually
put<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.029> power<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.660> taking<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> power

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
put up the power and taking the power

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.009 
put up the power and taking the power
that<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> needs<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.160> run<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.029> now<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.420> some

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that it needs to run it now in some

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.240 
that it needs to run it now in some
cases<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.500> will<00:00:31.619> need<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.890> upgrade<00:00:32.040> your

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

alternator and upgrade your battery

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.220 
alternator and upgrade your battery

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
because you have so much draw that's

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.610 
because you have so much draw that's
happening<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:37.950> your<00:00:38.160> sound<00:00:38.399> system<00:00:38.520> um<00:00:39.620> I'd

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
happening from your sound system um I'd

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920 
happening from your sound system um I'd
say<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.010> need<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.550> anything<00:00:42.090> 1500<00:00:42.809> and

say you need that anything 1500 and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.310 
say you need that anything 1500 and
above<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.100> 1500<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.600> 1500

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
above if you have 1500 you know 1500

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.560 
above if you have 1500 you know 1500
watt<00:00:46.680> system<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.430> car<00:00:47.610> then<00:00:48.270> you

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
watt system in your car then you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.850 
watt system in your car then you
definitely<00:00:48.899> want<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.260> start<00:00:49.469> thinking<00:00:49.680> about

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
definitely want to start thinking about

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
definitely want to start thinking about
maybe<00:00:50.190> new<00:00:50.399> alternator<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.629> will<00:00:51.780> be

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
maybe new alternator as it will be

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.560 
maybe new alternator as it will be
sucking<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.620> lot<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> power<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.420> see

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
sucking a lot of power as you can see

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.240 
sucking a lot of power as you can see
I've<00:00:54.660> already<00:00:54.780> updated<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> battery<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.219> my

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
to need is you'll need to run a negative

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
to need is you'll need to run a negative
from<00:01:21.570> there<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.350> I've<00:01:22.470> ran<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
from there as you can see I've ran it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.090 
from there as you can see I've ran it
from<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.770> back<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> engine

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
from there and on the back of the engine

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.210 
from there and on the back of the engine
which<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:27.380> there<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> lift

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
which is right here there is a lift

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.819 
which is right here there is a lift
point<00:01:29.750> where<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> bolt<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> that's

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
point where there was a bolt and that's

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.700 
point where there was a bolt and that's
where<00:01:32.040> I've<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.180> put<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.900> new<00:01:34.049> ground<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
where I've the put my new ground and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.210 
where I've the put my new ground and
then<00:01:35.100> over<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:36.049> I've<00:01:37.049> grounded<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> chassis

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
then over here I've grounded to chassis

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.270 
then over here I've grounded to chassis
with<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> new<00:01:38.759> ground<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.689> then<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.920> course<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
with a new ground and then of course a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.600 
with a new ground and then of course a
third<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:42.150> power<00:01:42.299> wire

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
third is your power wire

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.870 
third is your power wire
so<00:01:44.600> if<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.470> have<00:01:45.560> any<00:01:45.740> questions<00:01:46.250> at<00:01:46.400> all<00:01:46.430> I'm
