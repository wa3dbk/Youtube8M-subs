00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.049
 This video is also possible 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.049
 by microsoft mobile devices 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.610
 quickly destined from biko and biko is one 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.269
 French manufacturers where we are not yet 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.400
 earlier 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.199
 but we also visited 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.340
 Your request now is they have here 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.320
 two at the mobile world congress 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.119
 planes announced to the highway 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.920
 pure 4g and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.599
 another device that in other and son 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.029
 will discuss in this his son discuss 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.700
 I the who can he weighs pure 4g is one 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.730
 phone which especially year gun is 5.1 mm 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.050
 and has 4.18 sharp and yes I will 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.340
 this and without of course anything left 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.020
 is going to tell 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.910
 design of that more beauty spirit 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.140
 very very thin with looks also nice 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.969
 I have a urinary bladder on the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.190
 back and front 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.649
 the edge is made of metal one more 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.800
 plastic edge between the metal and the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.390
 glass and yes in itself just feels solid 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.649
 it also feels fairly high-quality 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.449
 and looks nice 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.520
 I find the plastic edge that in between 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.320
 is itself not very beautiful but good 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.890
 it is not something that bothers or hurts very much 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.629
 so 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.610
 what we just put on and I'd rather not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.409
 had seen what he is concerned 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 nothing further wrong with it and when she is 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.640
 so 4.8 inch screen and therefore has one 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.650
 reilly handy format to the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 bessel and bottom is a small one 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.009
 bit of a big chance for the buttons 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.500
 those on the screen think that's a shame 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.119
 but yes well that is not a bad thing 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.710
 big problem and design about it 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.939
 overall it's just very pretty 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.830
 I think it's a pity that the battery is the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.400
 can't go out and because the device is so thin 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.720
 is 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000
 battery is also not very small 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 capacity but yes or that will be enough 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.880
 are for daily use that will 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.799
 to show 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.380
 device has a 4.8 inch screen like 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.150
 said its amoled panel and with one 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.400
 17p resolution and it just looks good 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.049
 from the colors are beautiful 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.960
 the contrasts are of course super high 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.070
 not extremely high in brightness, but 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.020
 enough at first glance 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.939
 and it's up to you the sharpness of the screen 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.829
 of course also just good device 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.820
 runs on smart rings 410 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.189
 Processor 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.960
 that is a 64-bit processor, unfortunately 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.000
 not yet on lollipop so in that sense you can 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.399
 not make full use of it 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.200
 but he is fast enough on it 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.630
 at first sight he just drives fast 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.070
 fill in few problems with that 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.690
 and her and are of course very many 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.190
 devices in this segment 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.110
 that work with that processor and over it 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.520
 in general that is just fine 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.200
 The memory of the phone is 2 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.370
 gigabyte and has 16 gigabytes internally 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.319
 memory 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.920
 so that is also just enough and 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.599
 neat and yes in itself and in terms of performance 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.700
 so fine at first glance 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.959
 yes the interface is fairly close 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.340
 Android stayed a bit 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.930
 custom wiko 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.269
 especially the icons are different 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.880
 round icons are quite colorful 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.110
 icons I might prefer the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.310
 stock android goes but this looks on 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.160
 also look good 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.510
 and yes from the skins about android find this 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.540
 at first glance one of the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.670
 nicer and phone is running on android 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.540
 4 point four kitkat not on impression 500 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.220
 lollipop 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.049
 but yes otherwise of course just one 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.430
 complete android phone 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.080
 then an 8 megapixel camera said to the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.950
 back and a 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.840
 the frontside 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.209
 it's an 8 megapixel camera because of that 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.079
 did fit within the 15 mm profile 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.880
 according to pico 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.349
 a 13 megapixel camera is not working properly 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.299
 can accommodate an 8 megapixel camera 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.280
 of course are going to be great or that for 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.900
 This also money that finds too early to 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.519
 say here at the fair that will be tricky 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.100
 test here the front is a 5 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.750
 megapixel camera the phone name is in 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.400
 singles in variant not like many 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.290
 other devices from that cold dual sim 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.510
 do you have 4g unfortunately he has none 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.220
 expandable memory is that 16 gigabytes 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.870
 that is when you have to participate that is 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.310
 a disadvantage of the device 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.980
 we get very nice thin device 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.290
 for back the device will be on May 18 in 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.700
 The Netherlands in the shops come via below 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.950
 other coolblue sales week as one 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.420
 appliances they are now in the Netherlands and you 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.829
 somewhat more extensive department 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.350
 set up to appliances 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.000
 yes with more jobs but now so 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.510
 with coolblue this light is poor 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.650
 the show shop 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.040
 but then this one probably won't 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.630
 the device goes around 300 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.910
 cost exactly what the price will be 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.040
 Don't say his comfy cone yet 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.680
 and for that money it seems yes especially 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.329
 just a very nice thin phone 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.340
 pity that memory is not expandable 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.829
 and further yes just runs smoothly and 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.359
 fast and seems little wrong with you 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.730
 should do that primarily for the design 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.110
 this week oh highway 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.220
 color 4g and 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.410
 he is in different colors 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.610
 available this but also a black and 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.040
 black with golden 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.680
 and black with who is the color of 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.700
 see that code behind me so that is 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.700
 also all of available
