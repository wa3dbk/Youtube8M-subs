00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
talked about and cut it a little bit

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.650 
talked about and cut it a little bit
little<00:05:23.560> square<00:05:23.949> and<00:05:24.340> put<00:05:24.820> it<00:05:24.940> right<00:05:24.970> onto<00:05:25.389> the

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
little square and put it right onto the

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.650 
little square and put it right onto the
servo<00:05:25.990> itself<00:05:26.729> next<00:05:27.729> we<00:05:27.820> mix<00:05:28.000> up<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.270> little<00:05:28.509> bit

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
servo itself next we mix up a little bit

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.540 
servo itself next we mix up a little bit
a<00:05:28.770> 15<00:05:29.770> minute<00:05:29.949> epoxy<00:05:30.310> just<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.150> little<00:05:31.300> bit<00:05:32.550> dab

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
a 15 minute epoxy just a little bit dab

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.540 
a 15 minute epoxy just a little bit dab
it<00:05:33.729> right<00:05:33.910> there<00:05:34.860> right<00:05:35.860> where<00:05:35.889> we<00:05:36.220> want<00:05:36.430> our

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
it right there right where we want our

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.330 
it right there right where we want our
servo<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.360> doesn't<00:05:37.570> take<00:05:37.750> a<00:05:37.930> whole<00:05:38.199> lot

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
servo and it doesn't take a whole lot

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.060 
servo and it doesn't take a whole lot
and<00:05:39.340> then<00:05:39.550> take<00:05:39.580> some<00:05:39.970> of<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.150> poly<00:05:41.070> material

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
and then take some of that poly material

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.770 
and then take some of that poly material
from<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.460> poly<00:05:42.669> back<00:05:44.849> and<00:05:45.849> then<00:05:46.330> spread<00:05:46.720> it

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
from the poly back and then spread it

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.250 
from the poly back and then spread it
out

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.280 

so<00:05:51.260> once<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.950> epoxy<00:05:52.490> is<00:05:52.670> cured<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:53.900> remove

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
so once the epoxy is cured you remove

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.350 
so once the epoxy is cured you remove
the<00:05:54.500> clear<00:05:55.010> plastic<00:05:56.200> from<00:05:57.200> the<00:05:57.350> top<00:05:58.360> leaves

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
the clear plastic from the top leaves

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.830 
the clear plastic from the top leaves
you<00:05:59.480> a<00:05:59.510> nice<00:05:59.780> smooth<00:06:00.410> surface<00:06:00.980> right<00:06:01.190> here

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
you a nice smooth surface right here

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.900 
you a nice smooth surface right here
then<00:06:02.840> you<00:06:02.990> take<00:06:03.200> the<00:06:03.470> release<00:06:04.250> tape<00:06:04.520> here

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
then you take the release tape here

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.720 
then you take the release tape here
we'll<00:06:05.300> remove<00:06:05.690> the<00:06:05.990> safety<00:06:06.460> layer<00:06:07.460> right

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
we'll remove the safety layer right

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.690 
we'll remove the safety layer right
there<00:06:08.030> get<00:06:08.600> rid<00:06:08.780> of<00:06:08.870> that<00:06:09.100> position<00:06:10.100> your

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
there get rid of that position your

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.180 
there get rid of that position your
servo<00:06:11.270> right<00:06:11.720> over<00:06:12.110> the<00:06:12.320> area<00:06:12.500> that<00:06:12.830> you<00:06:13.010> need

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190
