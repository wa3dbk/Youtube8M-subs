and I have tongs here but I actually

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.790 
and I have tongs here but I actually
found<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.100> easier<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.760> use<00:00:44.940> pork<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
found that it was easier to use pork and

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.860 
found that it was easier to use pork and
just<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> bunch<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.100> sprinkles<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.300> right<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.480> i

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
just a bunch of sprinkles so right now i

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.529 
just a bunch of sprinkles so right now i
just<00:00:48.899> took<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.850> chocolate<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> stove

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
just took my chocolate off of the stove

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
just took my chocolate off of the stove
so<00:00:51.870> that's<00:00:52.020> why<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.199> still<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> pot<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.010> I

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so that's why I'm still in the pot and I

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.279 
so that's why I'm still in the pot and I
just<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.000> keep<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> pot<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
just like to keep it in the pot so that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.250 
just like to keep it in the pot so that
it<00:00:55.379> stays<00:00:55.680> warm<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:57.270> used<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.719> double<00:00:57.899> boiler

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it stays warm and I used a double boiler

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
it stays warm and I used a double boiler
so<00:00:58.649> basically<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.370> filled<00:00:59.640> my<00:00:59.789> pot<00:01:00.030> with

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
so basically I just filled my pot with

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.330 
so basically I just filled my pot with
some<00:01:00.449> water<00:01:00.510> boil<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> water<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.129> put<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
some water boil the water and then put a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.709 
some water boil the water and then put a
glass<00:01:02.579> bowl<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.390> put<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> chocolate

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
glass bowl in and put the chocolate

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.440 
glass bowl in and put the chocolate
inside<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.250> melt<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.150> these<00:01:06.390> are

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
inside so that it can melt so these are

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
inside so that it can melt so these are
these<00:01:06.780> little<00:01:06.930> silicone<00:01:07.500> cups<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.220> think

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
these little silicone cups and I think

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.890 
these little silicone cups and I think
that<00:01:08.700> they're<00:01:09.150> easy<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.840> because

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that they're easy to you just because

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.899 
that they're easy to you just because
your<00:01:10.170> cupcakes<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.979> pop<00:01:11.189> out<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.549> them<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
your cupcakes can pop out of them and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.490 
your cupcakes can pop out of them and
they<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.240> reusable<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.200> won't<00:01:13.350> be

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
they are reusable so you won't be

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
they are reusable so you won't be
wasting<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> paper<00:01:14.580> once<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.090> take<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.390> off

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
wasting the paper once you take it off

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
wasting the paper once you take it off
of<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> cupcakes<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> don't<00:01:16.830> have

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
of the cupcakes but if you don't have

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.800 
of the cupcakes but if you don't have
these<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> course<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.390> take<00:01:18.630> your

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
these you can of course just take your

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.990 
these you can of course just take your
paper<00:01:18.960> off<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.650> cupcake<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:20.820> I'm

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
paper off of your cupcake so now I'm

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.670

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
just taking my fork and putting it into

just taking my fork and putting it into
my<00:01:22.860> cupcake<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.390> begin<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
my cupcake and now we can just begin to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
my cupcake and now we can just begin to
roll<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> bottom<00:01:26.430> part<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.850> our

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.859 

you<00:01:40.670> don't<00:01:40.820> want<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.030> chocolate<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.450> be<00:01:41.600> too

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
not really for Valentine's Day but just

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.820 
not really for Valentine's Day but just
because<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.840> thought<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.230> they<00:02:42.320> were<00:02:42.380> cute

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
because I thought that they were cute

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.860 
because I thought that they were cute
and<00:02:42.980> for<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:43.670> one<00:02:43.850> I'm<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:44.210> going<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.510> dip

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and for this one I'm just going to dip

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.110 
and for this one I'm just going to dip
the<00:02:45.050> whole<00:02:45.290> cupcake<00:02:45.590> into<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:46.970> actually

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
the whole cupcake into it and I actually

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.330 
the whole cupcake into it and I actually
think<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.750> doing<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.380> way<00:02:48.440> made<00:02:49.220> it

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
think that doing it this way made it

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.600 
think that doing it this way made it
come<00:02:49.490> out<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.640> lot<00:02:50.000> better<00:02:50.210> than<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:51.260> other<00:02:51.410> way

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
come out a lot better than the other way

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.590 
come out a lot better than the other way
so<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.760> what<00:02:53.000> they<00:02:53.090> look<00:02:53.330> like<00:02:53.360> when

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
so this is what they look like when

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.200 
so this is what they look like when
they're<00:02:53.960> all<00:02:54.110> done<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.850> hope<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.060> guys
