00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
was we used for people with flamer not

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.920 
was we used for people with flamer not
for<00:00:47.430> people<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.820> flamer<00:00:48.090> three<00:00:48.570> people

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
for people with flamer three people

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.990 
for people with flamer three people
would<00:00:49.079> flamer<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:50.730> guests

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
would flamer and that was two guests

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.750 
would flamer and that was two guests
troopers<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:52.440> borgeous<00:00:52.980> Sentinel<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.840 
troopers and one borgeous Sentinel and
then<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.570> played<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> detonator<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.920> I

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
then I played the detonator and I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.779 
then I played the detonator and I
actually<00:00:57.059> played<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.930> end<00:00:58.140> 7<00:00:58.620> Slayer<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
actually played at the end 7 Slayer the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.560 
actually played at the end 7 Slayer the
Slayer<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.649> extremely<00:01:01.649> good<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.309> am<00:01:03.300> really

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
Slayer is extremely good I am really

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.590 
Slayer is extremely good I am really
digging<00:01:03.960> him<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.500> um<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.640> he's<00:01:06.299> really

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
digging him now um and he's really

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.660 
digging him now um and he's really
amazing<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.350> detonating<00:01:07.799> explosions

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
amazing for detonating explosions

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.940 
amazing for detonating explosions
because<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.689> shoot<00:01:09.990> 5<00:01:10.320> phase

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
because now you can shoot 5 phase

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.149 
because now you can shoot 5 phase
disruptor<00:01:11.670> switch<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.140> detonate<00:01:13.380> most

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
disruptor switch that can detonate most

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
disruptor switch that can detonate most
explosions<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.600> he<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.619> charge<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.810> pretty

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
explosions and he can charge so pretty

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.780 
explosions and he can charge so pretty
much<00:01:18.990> he<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.350> detonate<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.890> six<00:01:20.189> explosions

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
much he can detonate like six explosions

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.940 
much he can detonate like six explosions
potentially<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.659> he's<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.590> really

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
potentially so he's really really really

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.850 
potentially so he's really really really
good<00:01:23.810> another<00:01:24.810> thing<00:01:25.049> too<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> wanted<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> bring

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
good another thing too I wanted to bring

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
good another thing too I wanted to bring
up<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.310> video<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.900> about

up in this video I was think about

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.980 
up in this video I was think about

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
he was telling me is that one great

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.580 
he was telling me is that one great
thing<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.640> reckoning<00:01:51.090> DLC<00:01:51.570> has<00:01:51.810> done<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
thing that the reckoning DLC has done is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.429 
thing that the reckoning DLC has done is
to<00:01:53.549> actually<00:01:53.759> include<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.840> Batarian

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
to actually include that Batarian

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.609 
to actually include that Batarian
gauntlet<00:01:56.090> he<00:01:57.090> loves<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> Slayer<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
gauntlet he loves it for the Slayer and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.139 
gauntlet he loves it for the Slayer and
when<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.070> about<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.670> makes<00:01:59.700> a<00:02:00.000> lot

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
when you think about it it makes a lot

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.590 
when you think about it it makes a lot
of<00:02:00.180> sense<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:01.049> Batarian<00:02:01.619> gauntlet<00:02:02.159> is

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
of sense the Batarian gauntlet is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.870 
of sense the Batarian gauntlet is
fantastic<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.320> Slayer<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.340> reason<00:02:05.729> why

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
fantastic for the Slayer the reason why

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
fantastic for the Slayer the reason why
is<00:02:05.939> because<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.540> Slayers<00:02:06.869> heavy<00:02:07.200> melee<00:02:07.590> was

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
is because the Slayers heavy melee was

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.160 
is because the Slayers heavy melee was
always<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.550> tricky<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.509> actually<00:02:09.929> pull

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
always really tricky to actually pull

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.660 
always really tricky to actually pull
off

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670

would ever have to do is charge in do a
heavy<00:02:23.660> melee<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.349> if<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.650> can<00:02:24.830> get<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> kill

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
heavy melee and if you can get a kill

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.699 
heavy melee and if you can get a kill
then<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.660> can<00:02:26.780> start<00:02:26.959> doing<00:02:27.170> your<00:02:27.410> light

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
then you can start doing your light

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.040 
then you can start doing your light
melee<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.819> would<00:02:28.970> get<00:02:29.030> all<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.450> bonus

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
melee and you would get all that bonus

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.710 
melee and you would get all that bonus
melee<00:02:30.410> damage<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.819> think<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.209> hope<00:02:32.420> at<00:02:32.600> this

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
melee damage and I think I hope at this

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.449 
melee damage and I think I hope at this
point<00:02:32.840> everybody<00:02:33.319> knows<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.980> Slayers

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
point everybody knows that the Slayers

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.990 
point everybody knows that the Slayers
light<00:02:35.060> melee<00:02:35.480> makes<00:02:35.810> him<00:02:36.020> almost<00:02:36.440> invincible

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
light melee makes him almost invincible

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.120 
light melee makes him almost invincible
so<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.390> was<00:02:38.870> thinking<00:02:39.019> about<00:02:39.230> making<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.739> build

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
so I was thinking about making it build

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.370 
so I was thinking about making it build
with<00:02:40.430> him<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.940> showing<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.870> off<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.319> you

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380
