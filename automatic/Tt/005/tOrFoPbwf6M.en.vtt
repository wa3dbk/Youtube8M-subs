00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.560
 Of course this case has to do with a 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.900
 aesthetic treatment not even a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.730
 cosmetic surgery where he 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.530
 the treatment is much riskier 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.809
 still because when one goes to a 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.309
 clear operating room there are other risks 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.530
 that are run like anesthesia by 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.720
 example there if you have to do studies 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.430
 previous but for this treatment that 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.800
 Did this woman also have to have 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.779
 done previous studies to know the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.689
 physical conditions before receiving 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.060
 this substance apparently not admitted 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.310
 not authorized in our country how many 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.320
 cases we have had in recent years 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.810
 of women who have died after 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.480
 be in an operating room to practice 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.420
 surgery well for the surgery itself and well 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.760
 for anesthesia, good for malpractice 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.170
 you have to be more and more careful and if 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.990
 well the patients are not specialists 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.960
 you have to take advice a lot before taking 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.300
 a decision like this the surgeries 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.570
 aesthetics are the passport to the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.079
 happiness to look better to transform the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.019
 own body in which they always dreamed 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.149
 I am a number of surgeries you have done to 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.250
 throughout your good life actually 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.520
 I had to marry the account and I do not even remember 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.619
 you already lost it at the party 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.159
 but the dark side of surgeries 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.200
 aesthetics are the complications there 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.200
 a sort of ranking of operations 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.439
 more risky headed by the post 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.270
 bariatric or abdominal surgery that is the 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.299
 that obese people who have 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.149
 lost many kilos to extract the 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.689
 body mass that surpasses surgeries 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.479
 bariatric patients who have lost 70 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.939
 80 and more kilos of your body weight 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.700
 has an excess of skin tissue 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.009
 very important skin that you wear when you 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.539
 it resects it to an increase of 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.489
 complications such as the 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.130
 age increase of zero more than 

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:57.399
 retained liquid angel of documents 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.950
 of the tissues greater bleeding hematoma and 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.599
 greater infections we have to think 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.780
 that although they are cosmetic surgeries 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:08.049
 they are also operations and even a 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.569
 simple facelift may not have the 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:13.030
 results that we expected for example to 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.579
 level of a lifting or stretching 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.960
 facial of the possibility of having some 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.270
 nerve injury 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.050
 it is very difficult to execute and although it is not 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.540
 frequent thanks to God when it happens 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.100
 generates a lot of stress and problem both at 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.430
 patient as the surgeon 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.410
 / no templates until the nose 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.410
 it remains chords and we have to wait for 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.900
 times 13 6 months and it's at that time 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.580
 sometimes does not involve the patient of the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.650
 same way in general also a 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.260
 little bit of anxiety another of the factors 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.060
 to keep in mind is the state of mind 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.790
 with which the patient arrives at the operation 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.310
 and if you have any previous illness 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.380
 like diabetes or for example if the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.600
 person is a chronic smoker 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.970
 increase the risks as in the case 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.010
 of breast reduction 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.590
 Sometimes we operate gigantomastia moms 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.160
 They have up to 3 kilos of weight each of 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.110
 them the greater the weight and the 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.080
 elongation that has generated in the skin 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.650
 more chances of tissue loss 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.450
 that would be sense there will be infection 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.510
 Eroga bruises can hardly 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.760
 have a cause after that mood 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.320
 mortal that except the own of any 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.810
 surgery anyone facing 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.910
 a surgery has to know that the 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.070
 assistance lexicology has its 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.610
 complications and that surgery also 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.610
 it entails them 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.420
 one of the surgeries that most became of 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.110
 fashion is liposuction that also 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.030
 can have its complications the 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.040
 Liposuction the dermolipectomy has 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.440
 a described complication that is the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.570
 Embolism embolism is that part of the fat 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.000
 of fat goes through the torrent 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.760
 blood to a vein and can impact on 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.380
 the pulmonary that is serious luckily to 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.210
 little is not frequent we are talking 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.460
 a casuistry below 1000 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.780
 therefore you do not have to wait 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.470
 often but you have to warn 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.330
 lion be attentive to the same thing another step 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.970
 important is the choice of the surgeon 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.460
 many plastic ones are tempted by 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.650
 doctors that are offered online that 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.560
 promise miracles but not always 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.700
 are trained operated we operate 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.050
 all any surgeon has been 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.720
 also destabilized to make a 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.860
 plastic surgery but really one 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.410
 have to look for the trained person 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.840
 As we look for it, look for people who 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.120
 have a scientific endorsement that they have 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.700
 loss a society that that society to 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.510
 his control is that person for his 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.150
 previous training and continuous training 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.730
 the complications in these surgeries do not 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.160
 exceed 5 percent but the 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.350
 patients should know that if they submit 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.330
 to a surgical intervention can 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.400
 have complications 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.830
 this is a surgery and therefore 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.080
 when you take care of them you know that 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.819
 there are complications that you can expect more 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.620
 the percentages are small we have already 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.879
 said but you have to know and here has 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.569
 remarked on the patient when he 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.569
 in front of the procedure 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.610
 A) Yes
