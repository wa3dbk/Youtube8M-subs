so in picture tube this is marking
around<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:27.950> central<00:00:28.369> area<00:00:28.730> of<00:00:28.759> the<00:00:28.939> CD<00:00:29.360> lid

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
around the central area of the CD lid

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.350 
around the central area of the CD lid
and<00:00:30.009> this<00:00:31.009> is<00:00:31.220> just<00:00:31.400> so<00:00:31.579> you<00:00:31.610> know<00:00:31.820> which<00:00:32.000> area

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
and this is just so you know which area

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.130 
and this is just so you know which area
you<00:00:32.540> need<00:00:32.660> cuts<00:00:33.050> from<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:33.710> center<00:00:34.870> now<00:00:35.870> using

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
you need cuts from the center now using

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.920 
you need cuts from the center now using
the<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.770> smaller<00:00:37.100> drill<00:00:37.600> drill<00:00:38.600> through<00:00:38.840> the

the the smaller drill drill through the
very<00:00:39.109> center<00:00:39.620> of<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:40.100> lid<00:00:40.460> this<00:00:41.149> is<00:00:41.329> so<00:00:41.510> that

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
very center of the lid this is so that

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.599 
very center of the lid this is so that
when<00:00:41.899> you<00:00:42.019> use<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.260> circular<00:00:42.530> blade<00:00:42.920> it

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
when you use the circular blade it

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.270 
when you use the circular blade it
actually<00:00:44.090> doesn't<00:00:44.449> move<00:00:44.840> around<00:00:45.109> it's<00:00:45.620> locked

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
actually doesn't move around it's locked

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.160 
actually doesn't move around it's locked
into<00:00:46.489> this<00:00:46.640> position<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.329> then<00:00:47.510> cuts<00:00:47.809> the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
into this position and then cuts the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.660 
into this position and then cuts the
very<00:00:48.440> center<00:00:48.829> of<00:00:48.890> V<00:00:49.100> then<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.910> lid<00:00:50.090> out

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
very center of V then the lid out

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.610 
very center of V then the lid out
picture<00:00:52.670> for<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.269> the<00:00:53.539> circular<00:00:53.960> blade<00:00:54.170> and

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
picture for and the circular blade and

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.200 
picture for and the circular blade and
just<00:00:55.070> about<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.489> go<00:00:55.670> through<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.600> lid<00:00:57.050> and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
just about to go through the lid and

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.779 
just about to go through the lid and
then<00:00:59.210> moving<00:00:59.510> on<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.660> picture<00:01:00.140> 5<00:01:00.789> obviously

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
then moving on to picture 5 obviously

then moving on to picture 5 obviously
they're<00:01:01.999> the<00:01:02.329> blades<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:02.780> then<00:01:02.870> cut<00:01:03.079> through

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
they're the blades and then cut through

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.259 
they're the blades and then cut through
the<00:01:03.440> little<00:01:03.710> as<00:01:04.550> you<00:01:04.670> can<00:01:04.790> see<00:01:05.030> they're<00:01:05.239> the

marker area on the top it's is because

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.710 
marker area on the top it's is because
inside<00:01:10.460> that<00:01:10.760> circular<00:01:11.180> area<00:01:11.450> but<00:01:11.600> that's

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
inside that circular area but that's

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.820 
inside that circular area but that's
okay<00:01:11.990> because<00:01:12.020> that's<00:01:12.200> what<00:01:12.380> we<00:01:12.440> wanted<00:01:12.620> to<00:01:12.680> do

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830

pair of pliers or a clamp if you're

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.350 
pair of pliers or a clamp if you're
going<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.790> do<00:02:07.940> this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
going to do this

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.070 
going to do this
picture<00:02:10.360> 10<00:02:10.600> showing<00:02:11.380> it's<00:02:12.070> a<00:02:12.160> 13<00:02:12.580> millimeter

picture 10 showing it's a 13 millimeter

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.420 
picture 10 showing it's a 13 millimeter
would<00:02:14.080> tap<00:02:14.320> that<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.530> was<00:02:14.650> using<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.280> so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
would tap that I was using on that so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.210 
would tap that I was using on that so
it's<00:02:15.580> 30<00:02:15.850> milk<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:17.470> shows<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.860> cutting

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
it's 30 milk and that shows it cutting

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.330 
it's 30 milk and that shows it cutting
through<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.270> center<00:02:20.190> through<00:02:21.190> the

through to the the center through the
center<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.210> circle<00:02:22.450> we've<00:02:22.750> created<00:02:22.930> and

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
center of the circle we've created and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.820 
center of the circle we've created and
that's<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.230> final<00:02:26.230> product<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.650> you're

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
that's the final product that you're

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.740 
that's the final product that you're
going<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.070> end<00:02:27.220> up<00:02:27.340> with<00:02:27.520> there<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.850> nice<00:02:28.360> circle

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
going to end up with there a nice circle

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.020 
going to end up with there a nice circle
through<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.930> center<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.730> reasonably<00:02:30.730> smooth

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
through the center and reasonably smooth

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.670 
through the center and reasonably smooth
air<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:31.420> if<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.930> want<00:02:32.050> perfection

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.880 

I<00:02:34.709> think<00:02:35.250> it's<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.489> manicurist<00:02:36.349> so<00:02:37.349> now<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
I think it's my manicurist so now it's a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.610 
I think it's my manicurist so now it's a
picture<00:02:38.099> 12<00:02:38.540> using<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.629> marker<00:02:39.930> pen<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.530> know

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
picture 12 using the marker pen you know

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.050 
picture 12 using the marker pen you know
Margaret<00:02:40.830> v-shape<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> edge<00:02:41.849> of<00:02:41.970> that

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
Margaret v-shape on the edge of that

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.830 
Margaret v-shape on the edge of that
plastic<00:02:42.930> ring<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:44.299> because<00:02:45.299> of<00:02:45.330> v-shape

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
plastic ring and because of v-shape

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.059 
plastic ring and because of v-shape
because<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.470> saves<00:02:47.330> makes<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.450> easier<00:02:48.780> to

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
because it saves makes it easier to

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.500 
because it saves makes it easier to
place<00:02:50.069> your<00:02:50.220> any<00:02:50.340> interest<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.970> central

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
place your any interest to central

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.960 
place your any interest to central
column<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.140> makes<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.099> less<00:02:53.340> chance<00:02:53.760> of

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
column and makes it less chance of

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.050 
column and makes it less chance of
actually<00:02:54.690> breaking<00:02:55.819> so<00:02:56.819> picture<00:02:57.540> 13<00:02:59.060> shows

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
actually breaking so picture 13 shows

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.069 
actually breaking so picture 13 shows
the<00:03:00.659> scissors<00:03:01.260> cutting<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.739> v-shape<00:03:02.190> aides

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
the scissors cutting the v-shape aides

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.809 
the scissors cutting the v-shape aides
picture<00:03:04.079> 14<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:04.860> shows<00:03:05.129> what<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.579> should

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
picture 14 then shows what you should

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.550 
picture 14 then shows what you should
end<00:03:05.849> up<00:03:06.120> with<00:03:06.180> after<00:03:06.989> you've<00:03:07.170> cut<00:03:07.410> that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
end up with after you've cut that

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.650 
end up with after you've cut that
v-shape<00:03:08.220> on<00:03:09.319> picture<00:03:10.319> 15<00:03:10.709> if<00:03:11.459> you're<00:03:11.819> creating

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
v-shape on picture 15 if you're creating

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
v-shape on picture 15 if you're creating
or<00:03:13.049> if<00:03:13.260> you've<00:03:13.379> already<00:03:13.530> made<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.670> initial

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
or if you've already made the initial

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.410 
or if you've already made the initial
washer<00:03:16.680> with<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.010> raised<00:03:17.340> rim<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:18.269> can

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
washer with the raised rim you can

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.800 
washer with the raised rim you can
actually<00:03:18.540> add<00:03:18.810> extra<00:03:19.290> washes<00:03:19.950> underneath<00:03:20.459> it

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
actually add extra washes underneath it

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.539 
actually add extra washes underneath it
just<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.900> increase<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.290> strength<00:03:22.530> or<00:03:22.709> spring

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
just to increase the strength or spring

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.460 
just to increase the strength or spring
even<00:03:23.849> more<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.900> do<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.109> you'll<00:03:25.319> need

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
even more and but to do this you'll need

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.319 
even more and but to do this you'll need
to<00:03:25.590> remove<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:26.010> raised<00:03:26.250> section<00:03:26.819> so<00:03:27.030> use<00:03:27.209> the

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
to remove that raised section so use the

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.170 
to remove that raised section so use the
scissors<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.720> remove<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.470> raised<00:03:28.620> section

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
scissors to remove the raised section

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.089 
scissors to remove the raised section
only<00:03:30.180> after<00:03:30.810> you've<00:03:30.989> created<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.680> first

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
only after you've created the first

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.080 
only after you've created the first
washer<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.659> this<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.230> picture<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.650> says<00:03:35.090> do

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
washer so this is a picture that says do

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.030 
washer so this is a picture that says do
this<00:03:36.269> after<00:03:37.019> you've<00:03:37.319> created<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.799> first

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
this after you've created the first

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.860 
this after you've created the first
washer<00:03:38.310> don't<00:03:38.609> cut<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.090> central<00:03:39.480> ring<00:03:39.660> off

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
washer don't cut that central ring off

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.670 
washer don't cut that central ring off
it<00:03:40.230> just<00:03:40.440> gives<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.769> true<00:03:40.919> support<00:03:41.340> a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
it just gives you a true support a
