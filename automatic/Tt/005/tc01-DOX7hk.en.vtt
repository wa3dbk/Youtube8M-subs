00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.740
 because he is male 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:23.320
 they can not all be at the angle 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:27.070
 some easy salt is easy 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.380
 but being half rafelito for example 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.939
 with respect to women and football this 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.210
 which is almost in the world always 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.910
 the theme does not repeat itself and let's say 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.380
 it bothers us so much in some way the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.340
 wine is already my wife telling me what 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.340
 cute is the Iranian goalkeeper 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.040
 let's say at a time when it was not coming 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.980
 some Argentine arrived a moment that 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.320
 they gave to nobody of my house but thus all 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.840
 they are serious good but that marked a 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.120
 limit to your the passion with which you look 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.770
 the party because he was so passionate 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.030
 so passionate that I realized that the 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.030
 I had then when we made the bowl 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.820
 Hahaha 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.820
 and he does not stop talking like an Iranian 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.540
 and what this guy said is awesome 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.400
 English comic about the power of 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.830
 fifa not that makes it look like the 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.450
 Vulture backgrounds are caritas I'm going to look 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.010
 arrogant but in the world called of 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.840
 beer 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.000
 I'm going to make a son of a bitch and I do not 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.880
 it matters nothing extraordinary and speaking 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.590
 seriously the violence that can be 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.900
 get to give has a lot to do with the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.820
 alcohol consumption a friend of mine who was 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.240
 to maracana as you told me that 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.310
 they threw full beer bottles and 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.070
 they give the plastic cups and they do not give 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.350
 Plastic cup bottle looks like 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.090
 he had also taken are are glasses 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.410
 tourists because they are of memory this but 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.410
 in a moment that memory matters 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.120
 little remains with the glass of course but 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.820
 alright let's go now arrived came the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.820
 camera records and I already feel like the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.310
 shell 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.040
 on the horizon at this moment we are going to 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.650
 see what happened moments ago so 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.650
 says the goalie does not matter let's see it
