00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.540
 he 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.379
 hello to all and welcome I you 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.560
 proposes that we look today 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.849
 an effect called a compressor the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.220
 principle of a compressor in fact this is 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.110
 very simple is that if you already have 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.419
 recorded in sound software 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.309
 kind of cubase pro tools reaper etc 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.149
 you 've already seen that a sound wave in 

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:30.430
 does it look like a species 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.660
 of electrocardiogram like that a 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.500
 compressor in fact will take everything 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.510
 which is above all that is in 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.770
 Valtat below and is so 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.300
 that your sound waves they are 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.370
 many more compact then 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.230
 obviously you can always set to 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.150
 from where we are not up and down 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.370
 but the idea is that it's still 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.470
 that's it and it's going to make that sudden 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.329
 all the notes you play are going 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.739
 be more balanced in terms of volume 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.710
 and dynamic that is to say that they will 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.660
 sound all about the same with the 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.550
 same power 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.530
 so it's very much used on 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 clear sounds in the funk for example 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.190
 when I make a casserole 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.250
 it may be that the notes are not 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.990
 all really at the same volume while 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.970
 if I put if I start compressor in 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.620
 does he go his lessons and so the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.600
 ours we did not hear are going to be 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.409
 brought back to the same volume as the others and 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.990
 the one that was stronger 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.909
 we are enough to be to not exceed 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.909
 tell it the threshold we set 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.720
 so that's really the use the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.040
 more common on clear sounds it's 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.479
 very very useful on rhythmic in 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.159
 its clear funky stuff it's some 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.150
 something that works very, very often 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.710
 we also put on guitars 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.640
 acoustic 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.470
 when we transplant an acoustic guitar 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.049
 often there is too much you end 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.030
 with variations of attac times 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.110
 that they are very very strong and so the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.869
 being able to use this type of effect 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.860
 is very very useful we also use it 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.610
 on saturated sounds like a booster 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.689
 a little bit like a pedal 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.729
 of overdrive actually is we're going 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.830
 take the saturated sound of the amp and we 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.869
 will attack the input of the amp with a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.470
 compressor which will allow us to 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.930
 mount a little signal 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.220
 and therefore to attack the lan who with a 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.680
 electrical signal a little louder a 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.420
 little like one as if we had a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.420
 active electronics in the guitar and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.520
 so we will get more playability 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.440
 interesting and in addition to that you 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.960
 know that saturation that we 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.520
 press the sound we will accentuate the effect 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.180
 so is we gonna have a game that's going to be 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.340
 easier to play so voila my are 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.340
 just saturated the sound of the amp 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.620
 I start the compressor 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.490
 so it's subtle but actually the grain 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.250
 finds himself a little tight and 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.900
 especially if I make sentences I the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.370
 meaning that the notes they last 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.780
 longer and they are more equal 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.530
 between them while if I do the same 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.530
 phase we will die faster 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.379
 while I will be feeding while there 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 and 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.010
 we 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.470
 1 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.140
 that's the principle so there are a lot of 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.629
 guitarists that they really use 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.150
 like booster it's an interesting effect 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.230
 I played a long time without because 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.730
 I started from the principle that compressed 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.459
 lesson it was not necessarily very musical 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.750
 and is actually it's really an effect 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.189
 very interesting with which one needs 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.450
 really do without the time experienced 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.970
 because it's an effect that there is 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.939
 many more possibilities than this 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.909
 we can believe at the beginning so past 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.140
 time really trying things 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.470
 whether it's on clear sounds or 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.760
 saturated sounds and especially my pedal on 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.639
 always find a compressor 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.669
 somewhere it's an effect that's 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.500
 really very very useful so 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:26.139
 experienced with with compressors 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.139
 and see you soon on goal.com
