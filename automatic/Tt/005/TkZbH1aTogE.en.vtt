fossils and the stone tools and of
course<00:00:52.379> when<00:00:53.280> those<00:00:53.579> objects<00:00:54.210> cannot<00:00:54.539> leave

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
course when those objects cannot leave

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.299 
course when those objects cannot leave
those<00:00:54.989> countries<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
those countries because we have a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.360 
those countries because we have a
long-term<00:00:56.969> exhibit<00:00:57.719> here<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.800> are<00:00:58.920> able<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
long-term exhibit here they are able to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.119 
long-term exhibit here they are able to
provide<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.969> us<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.559> exact<00:01:01.559> replicas<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
provide to us the exact replicas of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.939 
provide to us the exact replicas of
those<00:01:02.430> objects<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.930> our<00:01:04.019> exhibit<00:01:04.470> does

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
those objects so what our exhibit does

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.580 
those objects so what our exhibit does
is<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.049> does<00:01:07.049> something<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.409> no<00:01:07.560> other

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
is that it does something that no other

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.460 
is that it does something that no other
exhibit<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> world<00:01:08.580> does<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.810> not<00:01:10.049> just

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
exhibit in the world does it's not just

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.170 
exhibit in the world does it's not just
about<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.979> discovery<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.790> particular

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
about the discovery of a particular

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.170 
about the discovery of a particular
fossil<00:01:12.689> human<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.580> about<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
fossil human it's not just about the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.649 
fossil human it's not just about the
debates<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.619> rage<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.670> scientific<00:01:18.450> circles

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
debates that rage in scientific circles

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.530 
debates that rage in scientific circles
about<00:01:19.110> our<00:01:19.290> family<00:01:19.740> tree<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.970> who<00:01:21.390> was

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
about our family tree and who was

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.039 
about our family tree and who was
related<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> whom<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> early<00:01:22.979> species<00:01:23.310> of

related to whom of the early species of
fossil<00:01:25.049> humans<00:01:25.439> rather<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.610> about<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
fossil humans rather it's about the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
fossil humans rather it's about the
emergence<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.170> human<00:01:28.530> characteristics<00:01:29.430> the

emergence of human characteristics the

emergence of human characteristics the
things<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.450> define<00:01:30.900> every<00:01:31.380> single<00:01:31.740> human

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
things that define every single human

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.399 
things that define every single human
being<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.400> earth<00:01:32.490> today<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.930> allows

being on earth today and it allows

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.289 
being on earth today and it allows
people<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.159> chance<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> explore<00:01:36.090> the

people the chance to explore the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.649 
people the chance to explore the
antiquity<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.990> walking<00:01:37.710> upright<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.490> legs

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
antiquity of walking upright on two legs

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
antiquity of walking upright on two legs
when<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.960> started<00:01:40.380> making<00:01:40.560> tools<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
when we started making tools and the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.120 
when we started making tools and the
changes<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.180> technology<00:01:42.869> over<00:01:42.899> time<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:44.100> our

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
changes in technology over time when our

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.270 
changes in technology over time when our
brains<00:01:44.549> became<00:01:45.090> large<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.290> origins<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> art

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
brains became large the origins of art

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.490 
brains became large the origins of art
and<00:01:47.579> our<00:01:47.670> ability<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.180> use<00:01:48.479> symbols<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
and our ability to use symbols and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.639 
and our ability to use symbols and
language<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.390> allows<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.020> visitor<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
language and so it allows the visitor to

language and so it allows the visitor to
explore<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.909> deep<00:01:54.240> antiquity<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.740> see

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
explore that deep antiquity and to see

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.520 
explore that deep antiquity and to see
that<00:01:56.299> everything<00:01:57.299> didn't<00:01:57.930> happen<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.469> at

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that everything didn't happen all at

that everything didn't happen all at
once<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:59.250> rather<00:01:59.430> things<00:01:59.790> occurred<00:02:00.119> over<00:02:00.390> a
