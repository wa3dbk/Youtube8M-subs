00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
by Hugh see and I kind of regret it at

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.810 
by Hugh see and I kind of regret it at
buying<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.620> stuff<00:02:51.800> for<00:02:52.010> my<00:02:52.160> Mirage<00:02:52.520> tokens

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
buying the stuff for my Mirage tokens

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.950 
buying the stuff for my Mirage tokens
they're<00:02:54.130> just<00:02:55.130> right<00:02:55.280> now<00:02:55.580> we<00:02:56.330> get<00:02:56.570> my

so<00:03:09.580> it's<00:03:09.790> kind<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.410> pointless<00:03:11.410> have<00:03:12.400> her<00:03:12.550> about

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
so it's kind of pointless have her about

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.740 
so it's kind of pointless have her about
all<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.210> stuff<00:03:13.240> last<00:03:13.720> time

I also get guilmon the outlets prostate

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.420 
I also get guilmon the outlets prostate
one<00:03:45.220> kind<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.340> pointless<00:03:46.610> because<00:03:48.430> there's

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
one kind of pointless because there's

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.510 
one kind of pointless because there's
stack<00:03:50.000> cups<00:03:50.270> at<00:03:50.480> 999<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:51.440> there's<00:03:52.270> evolutions

already a break that limit I mean reach
that<00:03:58.820> limit<00:04:00.100> but<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.160> suppose<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.700> gets<00:04:01.910> rid<00:04:02.090> of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
that limit but I suppose it gets rid of

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.050 
that limit but I suppose it gets rid of
their<00:04:02.480> confusion<00:04:03.050> effect<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:03.920> could<00:04:04.280> react

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
their confusion effect so I could react

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:16.620 
their confusion effect so I could react
with<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.660> multi-class

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.350

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
actually quite surprising yeah I didn't

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.689 
actually quite surprising yeah I didn't
remember<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:11.150> bayou<00:05:12.150> city<00:05:12.990> chick<00:05:13.520> being<00:05:14.520> that

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699

talk<00:05:14.970> but<00:05:15.270> he<00:05:15.360> actually<00:05:15.979> took<00:05:16.979> quite<00:05:17.490> a<00:05:17.550> long

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
talk but he actually took quite a long

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:24.670 
talk but he actually took quite a long
time<00:05:18.770> actually<00:05:19.770> think<00:05:20.250> well<00:05:20.610> as<00:05:21.800> long<00:05:22.800> as<00:05:22.949> it

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
time actually think well as long as it

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.840 
time actually think well as long as it
