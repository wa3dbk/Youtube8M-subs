00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.239
 My friends are going to spend the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.369

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.289
 morning then when we come the night 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.449
 He is with that neighbor hunger he is 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.559
 So let's go to the 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.600

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.140
 Sour sprinkles 50 grams of sweet potatoes

 the way the eipr yesterday it's optional cup 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.219
 If you want, I'll put it because 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.510
 I use it in my diet so if you 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.379
 you want to take it will not make a difference 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.269
 none 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.199
 Let's not mix everything first. I'll go. 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.199
 put the little boy 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:20.740
 the good potatoes that were already sharp 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:28.259
 the cottage I love contagion 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.259
 the agent clear 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.030
 the scope of wii 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.460
 the salt 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.060
 I'll leave the yeast to put it well in the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.380
 Last 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.380
 look, just mix 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.130
 I give a money mix with the spoon 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.369
 first and then I'll go with my hand 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.259
 Do you think your forest is not giving away? 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.050
 that chubby one put a little 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.100
 more of listening I think in our case 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.350
 today you will not need a secret anymore 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.750
 important when you or cook 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.290
 Washing has become more popular in China. 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.530
 very well chosen because if you leave 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.450
 she very wet that potato unit 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.510
 sweet will pass through your mafra 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.650
 It 's cool, it 's also your doing your 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.410
 and why you put it on a platter. 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.040
 it takes to freeze when ready 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.530
 already frozen you can for a 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.760
 You have to take up so much space 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.239
 in your freezer and only when you want 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.459
 I already wait and I already freeze roast 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.550
 because as I'm always running from 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.739
 morning does not have that time to be able to 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.100
 preparing my breakfast is always 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.950
 run then shot only puts a 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.360
 in the microwave or in the oven if 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.519
 I have a little more time just to 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.799
 thaw is ready there is thing of two 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.530
 single minute is perfect 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.079
 my goal was very hard then neither 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.350
 I'm going to take the fridge today and just do the 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:24.620
 balls that you put here in the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.660
 The girl that's already on is you. 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.579
 can join whatever you think is best 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.100
 can be with olive oil can be with oil of 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.440
 coconut in which he does not like the oil of 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.720
 coconut because he really is a sweet 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.040
 each in the things he contacts 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:44.640
 looks great with cottage jelly 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.770
 or with the cottage and flower of salt 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.530
 making a salty snack was very good 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.720
 have to see that I will not overdo the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.450
 because the normal it yielded 12 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.069
 is sometimes we exaggerate in the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.350
 ball gets colder too 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:07.170
 skinny eyes are now made 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:12.540
 now just take it in the preheated oven 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.200
 to 200 degrees provides for carrying cheese bread 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.200
 with oven 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.670
 let's take the oven cheese bread 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.590
 It was very beautiful. 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.010
 I put it in that shape he does not 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.920
 to spread with is already child once 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.020
 cheese bread in through the traditional 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.540
 just putting the balls clean 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.790
 normal cheese and he went to the band 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.240
 turning a pizza so I put on the 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.730
 that he looks perfect now is 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.690
 just take out the mold you can freeze 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.640
 so put a freezer bag 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.000
 Anytime you want to start taking out 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.600
 put a microwave two minutes 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.030
 It's perfect for you, how to serve with 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.260

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.840
 very good 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.190
 this is it girls is from the bread 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.130
