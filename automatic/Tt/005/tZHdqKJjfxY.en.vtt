you as during the twisting you can

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.189 
you as during the twisting you can
damage<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.859> parts<00:00:29.189> inside<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.849> joint<00:00:30.199> these

compression<00:00:32.099> tights<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.520> people<00:00:32.789> are<00:00:32.879> using

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:33.109 
compression tights that people are using

what's<00:00:34.109> different<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.859> opie<00:00:35.160> DEQ's

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
what's different about the opie DEQ's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.139 
what's different about the opie DEQ's
the<00:00:36.930> thing<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.649> I've<00:00:37.890> seen<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the thing that I've seen is that that

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.349 
the thing that I've seen is that that
people<00:00:39.600> tend<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> wear<00:00:41.519> them<00:00:41.699> the

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:42.359 
people tend to like to wear them the

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.959 
people tend to like to wear them the
hope<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.859> would<00:00:44.039> make<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
hope is that that it would make it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.110 
hope is that that it would make it
easier<00:00:45.269> to<00:00:45.539> avoid<00:00:46.019> injury<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.699> would<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
easier to avoid injury that would be the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.549 
easier to avoid injury that would be the
goal<00:00:53.149> one<00:00:54.149> thing<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.449> always<00:00:54.600> comes<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.199> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
goal one thing that always comes out is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.829 
goal one thing that always comes out is
that<00:00:55.829> patients<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.489> not<00:00:56.519> like<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.210> certain<00:00:57.629> type

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
that patients do not like a certain type

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.419 
that patients do not like a certain type
of<00:00:57.899> knee<00:00:58.170> support<00:00:58.350> because<00:00:59.039> it's

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
of knee support because it's

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.419 
of knee support because it's
uncomfortable<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.329> migrates<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.289> chafes<00:01:01.589> if

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
uncomfortable it migrates it chafes if

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.700 
uncomfortable it migrates it chafes if
we<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.879> actually<00:01:03.089> design<00:01:03.570> something<00:01:03.710> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
we can actually design something that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590 
we can actually design something that
can<00:01:04.829> be<00:01:04.949> built<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.309> into<00:01:05.640> either<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.210> pair<00:01:06.509> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
can be built right into either a pair of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.060 
can be built right into either a pair of
football<00:01:06.810> pants<00:01:07.229> that's<00:01:07.530> what<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.770> thought<00:01:07.950> at

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
football pants that's what we thought at

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.679 
football pants that's what we thought at
the<00:01:08.159> time<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.700> even<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.180> part<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the time or even that part of a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.749 
the time or even that part of a
compression<00:01:10.049> pants<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:11.100> could<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.549> have

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
compression pants we could actually have

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.399 
compression pants we could actually have
a<00:01:11.970> product<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.600> would<00:01:12.810> wouldn't

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
a product that would wouldn't

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.590 
a product that would wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.460> same<00:01:14.490> bulkiness<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
necessarily have the same bulkiness as a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.899 
necessarily have the same bulkiness as a
brace<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.320> could<00:01:16.829> offer<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
brace but could offer that that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.550 
brace but could offer that that
advantage<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.630> wearing<00:01:19.140> them<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.259> longer

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
advantage of wearing them for longer

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.960 
advantage of wearing them for longer
periods<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.950> time<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.490> first<00:01:20.670> thing<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
periods of time the first thing I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
periods of time the first thing I
noticed<00:01:21.299> was<00:01:21.450> how<00:01:21.630> nicely<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.290> my<00:01:22.470> new<00:01:22.740> cap

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
noticed was how nicely that my new cap

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.889 
noticed was how nicely that my new cap
kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.369> fits<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
kind of fits right in this it's this

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.109 
kind of fits right in this it's this
little<00:01:25.229> spot<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.100> freedom<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.640> Nutella<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
little spot the freedom of Nutella to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.420 
little spot the freedom of Nutella to
move<00:01:27.329> would<00:01:27.750> tell<00:01:27.990> us<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> kneecap<00:01:28.890> how<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
move would tell us the kneecap how it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
move would tell us the kneecap how it
allows<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.030> patella<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> float

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.780 

the<00:01:38.560> first<00:01:38.770> time<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:38.920> got<00:01:39.010> my<00:01:39.160> hands<00:01:39.370> on<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.580> pair

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
the first time I got my hands on a pair

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.490 
the first time I got my hands on a pair
of<00:01:39.820> LP<00:01:40.090> dicks<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.390> was<00:01:40.510> most<00:01:40.990> impressed<00:01:41.410> with

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
of LP dicks I was most impressed with

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.260 
of LP dicks I was most impressed with
the<00:01:41.680> combination<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.340> fabric<00:01:42.729> it's<00:01:42.850> all<00:01:43.000> about

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
the combination of fabric it's all about

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.900 
the combination of fabric it's all about
how<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:44.229> combination<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.890> fabrics<00:01:45.460> together

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
how the combination the fabrics together

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.210 
how the combination the fabrics together
perform<00:01:46.900> attention<00:01:47.470> in<00:01:47.620> this<00:01:47.740> specific

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
perform attention in this specific

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.000 
perform attention in this specific
direction<00:01:48.810> stretchiness<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.500> placement

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
direction stretchiness and the placement

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.310 
direction stretchiness and the placement
of<00:01:51.100> everything<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.910> way<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.479> Opie<00:01:53.110> Dex

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
of everything the way that the Opie Dex

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.560 
of everything the way that the Opie Dex
garments<00:01:53.920> reduced<00:01:54.550> stress<00:01:54.850> on<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.150> knees<00:01:55.330> is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
garments reduced stress on the knees is

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.710 
garments reduced stress on the knees is
by<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.070> pattern<00:01:57.070> of<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.520> elastic<00:01:58.240> fibers

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
by the pattern of the elastic fibers

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.700 
by the pattern of the elastic fibers
that<00:01:58.840> run<00:01:59.110> through<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.470> garment<00:02:01.710> we

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
that run through the garment we

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.190 
that run through the garment we
basically<00:02:03.130> developed<00:02:03.580> tensions<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.570> act<00:02:04.899> kind

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
basically developed tensions to act kind

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.690 
basically developed tensions to act kind
of<00:02:05.259> like<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.380> muscle<00:02:05.950> in<00:02:06.040> essence<00:02:06.369> where<00:02:06.550> it's

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
of like a muscle in essence where it's

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.999 
of like a muscle in essence where it's
stretchy<00:02:07.090> at<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.960> same<00:02:08.170> time<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.860> gets

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
stretchy at the same time as it gets

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.760 
stretchy at the same time as it gets
longer<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.489> starts<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:09.970> resist<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.540> motion

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
longer it starts to resist that motion

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.920 
longer it starts to resist that motion
like<00:02:11.770> an<00:02:11.920> exoskeleton<00:02:12.459> or<00:02:13.060> an<00:02:13.150> extra<00:02:13.540> skin

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
like an exoskeleton or an extra skin

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.110 
like an exoskeleton or an extra skin
yeah<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.440> had<00:02:14.590> my<00:02:14.739> doubts<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:15.489> didn't<00:02:15.730> believe<00:02:15.940> it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
yeah I had my doubts I didn't believe it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.110 
yeah I had my doubts I didn't believe it
but<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.570> works<00:02:19.950> what<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:20.980> noticed<00:02:21.430> when<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.640> skied

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
but it works what I noticed when I skied

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.900 
but it works what I noticed when I skied
in<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.930> first<00:02:23.230> time<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.520> know<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.790> was

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
in it the first time is you know it was

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.540 
in it the first time is you know it was
quite<00:02:25.209> warm<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.230> feels<00:02:26.500> very<00:02:26.890> supportive

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
quite warm and it feels very supportive

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.040 
quite warm and it feels very supportive
but<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.910> really<00:02:28.180> didn't<00:02:28.480> feel<00:02:28.630> like<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.930> was

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
but it really didn't feel like it was

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.420 
but it really didn't feel like it was
anything<00:02:29.260> dramatic<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.650> skied<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.250> for

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
anything dramatic and I skied in it for

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.759 
anything dramatic and I skied in it for
a<00:02:33.459> couple<00:02:33.640> days<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.690> next<00:02:34.900> time<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.350> skied<00:02:35.739> I

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
a couple days the next time I skied I

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.070 
a couple days the next time I skied I
used<00:02:36.070> my<00:02:36.220> regular<00:02:36.400> base<00:02:36.850> layer<00:02:37.150> which<00:02:37.450> was<00:02:37.630> you

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
used my regular base layer which was you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.560 
used my regular base layer which was you
know<00:02:38.110> not<00:02:38.440> supportive<00:02:39.010> at<00:02:39.100> all<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.610> that's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
know not supportive at all and that's

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.300 
know not supportive at all and that's
when<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.930> really<00:02:41.200> notice<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.590> difference<00:02:41.620> hi

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
almost 200 days a year this is the first

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.650 
almost 200 days a year this is the first

time I see eternal Pedic tights I'm

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.330 
time I see eternal Pedic tights I'm
really<00:02:53.170> impressed<00:02:53.440> it's<00:02:53.920> like<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.070> good

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
really impressed it's like a good

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.979 
really impressed it's like a good
footbed<00:02:54.760> in<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.940> ski<00:02:55.209> boot<00:02:55.390> if<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.690> don't<00:02:55.840> know

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
footbed in a ski boot if you don't know

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.240 
footbed in a ski boot if you don't know
what<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:56.140> said<00:02:56.290> that's<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.620> best<00:02:56.830> thing<00:02:57.100> but

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
what I said that's the best thing but

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.280 
what I said that's the best thing but
you<00:02:57.340> try<00:02:57.519> skiing<00:02:57.850> without<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.660> really

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
you try skiing without it and you really

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.560 
you try skiing without it and you really
realize<00:02:59.950> how<00:03:00.190> important<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.239> really

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
realize how important it is so I really

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.479 
realize how important it is so I really
noticed<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.110> quad<00:03:02.350> fatigue<00:03:02.829> is<00:03:03.130> really

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
noticed that the quad fatigue is really

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.850 
noticed that the quad fatigue is really
substantially<00:03:04.360> reduced<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.500> could<00:03:05.680> say

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
substantially reduced and I could say

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.530 
substantially reduced and I could say
really<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.220> couple<00:03:06.459> more<00:03:06.730> times<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.209> that

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
really a couple more times but that

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.270 
really a couple more times but that
probably<00:03:07.959> wouldn't<00:03:08.290> really<00:03:08.500> work<00:03:08.769> would<00:03:09.160> it

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
probably wouldn't really work would it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.090 
probably wouldn't really work would it
really<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:12.000> am<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.030> recreational<00:03:13.900> skier<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.680> I

else's I felt that my knees and hips

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.279 
else's I felt that my knees and hips
would<00:06:34.819> have<00:06:34.939> been<00:06:35.060> a<00:06:35.090> lot<00:06:35.419> better<00:06:35.449> protected

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
would have been a lot better protected
