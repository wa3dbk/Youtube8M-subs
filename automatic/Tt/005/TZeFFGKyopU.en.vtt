are several numbers that are interesting

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.749 
are several numbers that are interesting
to<00:01:37.890> us<00:01:38.090> first<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.659> voltage<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.380> usually

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
least important number is this one it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.719 
least important number is this one it
looks<00:02:03.780> pretty<00:02:04.079> confusing<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.189> stands<00:02:05.579> for

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
looks pretty confusing but it stands for

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.420 
looks pretty confusing but it stands for
the<00:02:05.969> dimension<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.570> your<00:02:06.810> battery

the first two digits are the thickness

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.210 
the first two digits are the thickness
in<00:02:09.710> one<00:02:10.070> tenth<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.759> millimeter<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.860> next

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
of horizontal dimensions but you have to

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.050 
of horizontal dimensions but you have to
keep<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.350> mind<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.770> thickness<00:02:34.160> thicker

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
more capacity one thing you'll need to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.610 
more capacity one thing you'll need to
make<00:02:56.150> sure<00:02:56.390> about<00:02:56.660> is<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:57.380> battery

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
make sure about is that this battery
