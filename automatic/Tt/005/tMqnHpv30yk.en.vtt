00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 now all welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.960
 where to practice installing the launcher 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.130
 of minecraft 1.6 for pirates both in 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.110
 linux like in windows 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.730
 The first thing you have to do is open 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.160
 the personal folder 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.160
 press control h to see 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.200
 where are minecraft ready first 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.260
 I'm going to explain installations in linux and 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.330
 then windows good then control hy 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.080
 you see the points and now you put point 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.080
 Minecraft 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.580
 what you have to do if you 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.070
 you have full is to make a copy of 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.239
 security and erase everything because the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.559
 new launcher will download files 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.900
 new ones that are what I have here 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.060
 then you can not have the ones from the 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.160
 old versions are worth it once done 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.170
 I had not done everything I had already done 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.790
 and the outstanding release of these new ones by 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.500
 That I will not do so again 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.420
 do not take too long 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.950
 once you all give right click 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.290
 to the launcher that left the link in the 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.470
 property description 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.489
 permits and brands allow to run 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 file as a program 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.100
 then you give right click to open with 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.770
 and choose the java version that you have 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.810
 I have the follow 7 installed but I'm going 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.050
 to choose the 7 because it has better 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.030
 performance 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.950
 we click 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.070
 and it opens 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.719
 the minecraft launcher to me not me 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.340
 they ask for no folder because I already have it 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.340
 installed but I would leave you 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.530
 to you, a dialogue would come to you 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.530
 like this first 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.350
 says choose where where you need to 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.720
 Minecraft well well before it comes out 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.390
 the launcher is going to come out then 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.470
 you have to go 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.710
 to this personal folder again 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.790
 control h again find point 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.420
 Minecraft 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.880
 and when I'm inside with you inside 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.770
 copies the address 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.770
 and paste it in the launcher 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.550
 of everything done 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.349
 after accepting and telling you that minecraft 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.460
 is going to install in the direction that you 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.270
 you told him he says accept 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.490
 and it is already 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.470
 and already start in your case to 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.460
 download and a bar here loading 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.800
 When you finish downloading it will leave you 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.500
 put the name here as well as people who 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.480
 it in this case I have later 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.640
 you give to play 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.569
 the launcher is recharged and here it puts play 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.790
 off line 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.200
 this works perfectly this is just 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.980
 a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.510
 a goal by the launcher is good if 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.030
 you want to install more version this would be 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.800
 as 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.709
 as a partner in windows you give a new 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.450
 profile put the name here the version 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.750
 choose the brand version you want 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.830
 put him 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.210
 1.5 point 1 etc and you make them profile already 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.060
 you would have all the versions that 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.500
 you want good because the fact you already have 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.500
 all installed they give to play off line 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.310
 minecraft opens 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.700
 and as we see it works perfectly and 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.400
 it also operates multiplayer 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.920
 well, this has been all for linux 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.569
 now let's go to the windows part I'm going 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.569
 to teach how to install it on windows 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.239
 good the installation in windows would be 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.500
 this has windows would be downloaded without 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.590
 properties or anything we double click 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.590
 directly 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:51.420
 and if you open a dialogue like this 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.570
 what you have to do is go and the 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.850
 beginnings in a windows 7 user or 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.480
 windows 8 would come here the bar to 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.319
 search and in xp execute you put % app 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.530
 data percent accept 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.440
 point minecraft and copy the route that 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.990
 leads to this folder 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.580
 you can close it so you have 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.580
 to delete the inside of the folder 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.620
 first of all 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.400
 then you stick it here where it puts the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.400
 name of the folder 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.570
 and tell him to open tells you that he is going to 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.360
 install in that folder ok now 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.860
 start downloading as always and 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.050
 then let them put them in the man 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.000
 you put youtube 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.000
 the name that you want logically you read 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.460
 a play reload launcher again and 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.130
 here he puts play off line the same 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.500
 good drawing then you give the button 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.510
 play me like this is a virtual machine 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.370
 I do not have the drivers installed and I do not 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.530
 I have 3d acceleration that's why he's going to give me 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.330
 an error and I will not be able to not go to 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.820
 can see it but it works already you have 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.670
 seen in linux look here is loading 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.620
 perfectly and this is when carl is 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.770
 because I do not have drivers 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.690
 it's a good virtual machine because that has 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.780
 been everything I hope it has served to 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.639
 something if you have doubts put it in the 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.270
 comments I will answer it with 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:22.210
 as fast as I can and nothing 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.210
 see you in the next video bye bye
