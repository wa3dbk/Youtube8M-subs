craziest function of all is the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.620 
craziest function of all is the
programming<00:02:32.840> mode<00:02:33.020> simply<00:02:34.270> hit<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.300> number

of times you want it to go to mode

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.170 
of times you want it to go to mode
there's<00:02:38.750> five<00:02:39.260> modes<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.800> our<00:02:40.280> program<00:02:40.700> mode<00:02:40.970> 1

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
there's five modes of our program mode 1

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.330 
there's five modes of our program mode 1
and<00:02:41.210> 2<00:02:41.660> i'll<00:02:42.290> go<00:02:42.740> through<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.880> right<00:02:44.150> now<00:02:45.340> ok

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
and 2 i'll go through to right now ok

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.130 
and 2 i'll go through to right now ok
i'm<00:02:46.670> in<00:02:46.820> i<00:02:47.090> set<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:47.330> from<00:02:47.510> 0<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.870> saw<00:02:48.020> them

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
i'm in i set it from 0 to you saw them

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.900 
i'm in i set it from 0 to you saw them
and<00:02:48.230> click<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.500> twice<00:02:49.330> pull<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.920> then

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
after I pull the right trigger it will

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.160 
after I pull the right trigger it will
flash<00:02:55.340> twice<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.970> mean<00:02:56.330> I<00:02:56.420> mean<00:02:56.600> motu<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.080> then

flash twice I mean I mean motu and then

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.290 
flash twice I mean I mean motu and then
we'll<00:02:57.290> go<00:02:57.440> solid<00:02:57.770> white<00:02:58.100> or<00:02:58.430> whatever<00:02:59.060> color

excited for this controller um and then
for<00:03:07.280> programming<00:03:07.790> mode<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:09.140> rather

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
for programming mode it's a rather

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.390 
for programming mode it's a rather
tricky<00:03:10.490> /<00:03:10.970> hard<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:12.410> explain<00:03:12.770> it's<00:03:13.070> because

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
tricky / hard to explain it's because

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
try my best to go to programming mode

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.490 
try my best to go to programming mode
you<00:03:20.390> hit<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:21.610> sync<00:03:22.610> button<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.200> hold<00:03:24.200> on<00:03:24.350> my

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
you'll basically enter program mode it

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.530 
you'll basically enter program mode it
will<00:03:29.090> flash<00:03:29.360> five<00:03:29.630> times<00:03:30.459> now<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:32.390> can

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
will flash five times now you can

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.430 
will flash five times now you can
program<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.870> for<00:03:33.110> fully<00:03:33.290> auto<00:03:33.500> or<00:03:33.709> bursts<00:03:35.440> will

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
program it for fully auto or bursts will

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.720 
program it for fully auto or bursts will
go<00:03:36.590> fully<00:03:37.310> auto<00:03:38.980> one<00:03:39.980> hand<00:03:40.190> it's<00:03:40.430> going<00:03:40.640> to

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
go fully auto one hand it's going to

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.340 
go fully auto one hand it's going to
flash<00:03:41.000> once<00:03:41.360> for<00:03:41.630> fully<00:03:41.810> auto<00:03:41.990> and<00:03:42.200> for

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
flash once for fully auto and for

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.320 
flash once for fully auto and for
personal<00:03:42.830> flash<00:03:42.980> however<00:03:43.400> many<00:03:43.520> times<00:03:43.700> and

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
personal flash however many times and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.240 
personal flash however many times and
now<00:03:44.540> we<00:03:44.600> can<00:03:44.780> program<00:03:45.200> for<00:03:45.590> however<00:03:45.920> many

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
now we can program for however many

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.750 
now we can program for however many

to<00:04:26.720> 22<00:04:27.470> shots<00:04:27.710> per<00:04:28.040> second<00:04:28.550> which<00:04:29.540> is<00:04:29.570> pretty

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
to 22 shots per second which is pretty

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.970 
to 22 shots per second which is pretty
much<00:04:30.350> modeling<00:04:30.770> for<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:31.040> style<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.490> right<00:04:31.670> now

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
much modeling for to style and right now

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:41.350 
much modeling for to style and right now
I'm<00:04:33.980> playing<00:04:34.250> black<00:04:34.550> cocks<00:04:35.650> but<00:04:39.400> yeah<00:04:40.400> that's

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
I'm playing black cocks but yeah that's

I'm playing black cocks but yeah that's
good<00:04:42.140> I<00:04:42.290> guess<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.830> if<00:04:42.890> you<00:04:42.980> want<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.220> turn<00:04:43.310> the

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
good I guess and if you want to turn the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.160 
good I guess and if you want to turn the
motor<00:04:43.550> off<00:04:43.670> just<00:04:44.000> hit<00:04:44.120> any<00:04:44.360> more<00:04:44.750> times<00:04:44.960> during

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
motor off just hit any more times during

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.080 
motor off just hit any more times during
in<00:04:45.380> 5i<00:04:45.620> just<00:04:45.770> click<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.220> all<00:04:46.400> but<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.730> just<00:04:46.910> pull

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
in 5i just click it all but I just pull

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.450 
in 5i just click it all but I just pull
the<00:04:47.180> right<00:04:47.330> trigger<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.530> does<00:04:48.710> work<00:04:48.920> those

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
the right trigger and it does work those
