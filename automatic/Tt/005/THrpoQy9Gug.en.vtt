00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.419
 let's wake up 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.419
 wake up wake up and wake up miami 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:19.410
 you do not know anything the majority of humanity is living a dream but 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.370
 it is not true 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.609
 from vido the dream 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.849
 is to live a drowsiness 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.039
 he is stubborn so papa has continually pointed out the things that weigh 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.110
 for the accounts that have to be paid for the relationships that do not end 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.520
 resolve 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.040
 the for the hopes yes that they are falling asleep by the hopes that 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.450
 they never become reality due to the sum of moments in which we have touched 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.600
 or because we simply achieved a small success there we stayed 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.260
 absolutely 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.840
 well-off 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.999
 when we look and concert of things 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.210
 we have not achieved anything 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.360
 what is it that we are achieving so powerful 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.620
 you know one thing is one of the hardest things 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.630
 of life is to see how human beings stay in the burladero 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.760
 I must confess you 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.490
 You do not even like bullfighting, I do not like it, I'm not going to discuss it here but I 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.770
 it seems interesting 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.880
 let's see if we give the example 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.680
 d on the floor 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 okey where it will be given that they deal with the bull 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.329
 There are some sort of barriers 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.810
 floodgates on the sides for what 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.040
 the staff can enter and exit 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.100
 without getting involved without fit bull to get into the bleachers 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.680
 okey said otherwise the big problem around robredo strap 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.850
 here most people are here like this 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.050
 A) Yes 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.619
 because in everyday life things only happen 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.930
 when we get bread rolls 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.729
 and most of humanity is asleep literally snoring 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.729
 and here 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.030
 half-time what happens around you absolutely ignoti Saturdays by 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.240
 bad news 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.039
 always expecting the worst 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.499
 the unemployment rate rose today delegates of 14% 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.919
 at this moment we believe that he comes from a strong recession for europe the 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.019
 situation of 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.209
 egÃºn will live his ill-fated avenue of greece 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:25.539
 all 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.089
 awake 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:32.659
 if you and I stay in neza ask for that drowsiness of the news 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.089
 we will not go out and do what is necessary 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:40.400
 I want to remember that something in this very moment that there are negative situations 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.619
 happening there are people triumphing 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:48.329
 there are people leaving in the morning doing their homework all day 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.969
 looking at opportunities doing their job hard with enthusiasm 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.760
 but you know something shelf and intel rosemary 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.290
 the reality only happens that in the ring 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.469
 not behind the burladero 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.650
 I make this comment because maybe you are one of the people who 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:06.869
 are the govern 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.869
 maybe you are currently thinking of pando 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.319
 I take off my hat, well, we do not have a hat, but 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.900
 and still shake issues shake issues and look to see what you can do and step 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.889
 drag two or three people 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.599
 so that they also get results, get results with you 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.449
 and if you and I are the ones who are there 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.439
 what will happen to us 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.859
 what is it that we are going to be yours 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.150
 When he asks us what's going on, we're going to suffer the rescue. It's not 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:50.049
 that the challenges are extremely place let me tell you I'm unemployed 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.669
 two or three years ago 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.659
 Look, I dedicate myself to what I do because about 30 years ago they left me 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.139
 unemployed 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.639
 God bless the person who voted for me from your company 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.879
 God bless you 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.270
 and I continue to bless him with my own name 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.009
 how amudio to this person 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.219
 you know why 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:14.939
 because simple pulled me out of my comfort zone pulled me out of my comfort 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:16.999
 and so 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:19.249
 I had to wake up 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.279
 as wife two children debts 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.419
 loneliness economic hardships because I was feeling very bad when one 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.749
 feels bad or not right 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:32.749
 the horrifying points of contact with others 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.979
 interest 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.620
 p finally 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.919
 and now my career 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.629
 that company the thing 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.790
 and other people 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.999
 to achieve results together 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.999
 but things happen facing reality 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.779
 facing the bull not behind dir 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.199
 mocked about it 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.409
 and for that you have to do two things wake up 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.139
 look at the opportunities 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.499
 look what is happening ineter is found and each fighter the situation as 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.330
 revenge 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.409
 fear with courage coming out knocking doors looking at what is there to be 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:16.220
 do what alternatives we have not looked at you and me to improve any 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.759
 thing that we have to improve in our life the economic part the 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.300
 affective that we do not lack to sculpting that we need to explore 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.380
 so my lesson today friend friend 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.759
 I do not know who will be watching this 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.399
 the hair said looking at you although I think there are your eyes 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:40.439
 We are together
