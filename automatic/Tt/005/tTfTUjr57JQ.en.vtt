00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.730 
just Wi-Fi and these are all sort of a
little<00:02:13.170> bit<00:02:13.290> more

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
little bit more

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.030 
little bit more
Tech<00:02:13.890> did<00:02:14.720> because<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.650> obviously

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
Tech did because the this is obviously

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.880 
Tech did because the this is obviously
going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> be<00:02:17.280> used<00:02:17.550> outside<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
going to be used outside and in the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.610 
going to be used outside and in the
elements<00:02:20.430> where<00:02:21.150> LC<00:02:21.450> electronics<00:02:22.350> don't

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
elements where LC electronics don't

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.980 
elements where LC electronics don't
generally<00:02:23.010> go<00:02:23.160> very<00:02:23.430> well<00:02:23.490> together<00:02:23.760> if<00:02:24.300> we

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
generally go very well together if we

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.820 
generally go very well together if we
then<00:02:25.610> open<00:02:26.610> up<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:27.060> packaging<00:02:27.600> here<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.620> is

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
then open up this packaging here this is

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.130 
then open up this packaging here this is
where<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.370> reveal<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.850> camera<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.990> it's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
where we can reveal the camera so it's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.260 
where we can reveal the camera so it's
quite<00:02:31.380> waiting<00:02:31.890> at<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.190> point<00:02:32.430> five<00:02:32.730> kilos

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
quite waiting at one point five kilos

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.090 
quite waiting at one point five kilos
but<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.660> needs<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.200> because<00:02:34.350> it's<00:02:34.650> housing

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
but it needs to be because it's housing

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.250 
but it needs to be because it's housing
a<00:02:35.220> lot<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.490> technology<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.240> it's<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> be

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
a lot of technology and it's going to be

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.940 
a lot of technology and it's going to be
protecting<00:02:38.210> your<00:02:39.210> property<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.410> we<00:02:40.500> peel<00:02:40.800> that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
protecting your property so we peel that

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.550 
protecting your property so we peel that
off<00:02:41.010> there<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> camera<00:02:42.870> inside<00:02:43.230> this

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
off there we have the camera inside this

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.610 
off there we have the camera inside this
sort<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:43.740> glass<00:02:44.240> dome<00:02:45.240> or<00:02:45.600> plastic<00:02:46.140> dome<00:02:46.320> just

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
sort of glass dome or plastic dome just

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.370 
sort of glass dome or plastic dome just
say<00:02:46.770> so<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:47.070> pan<00:02:47.400> tilt<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.060> rotate<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.660> there

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
say so a pan tilt and rotate in there

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.090 
say so a pan tilt and rotate in there
we've<00:02:50.040> got<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.430> secure<00:02:51.180> metal<00:02:51.890> bracket<00:02:52.890> and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
we've got this secure metal bracket and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.040 
we've got this secure metal bracket and
you<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:54.000> see<00:02:54.180> we've<00:02:54.360> got<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.660> various

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
you can see we've got the various

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.620 
you can see we've got the various
mounting<00:02:55.680> points<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.640> back<00:02:56.820> there<00:02:57.090> we've

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
mounting points on the back there we've

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.810 
mounting points on the back there we've
got<00:02:57.660> an<00:02:57.960> antenna<00:02:58.320> here<00:02:58.650> because<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.520> does

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
got an antenna here because this does

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.360 
got an antenna here because this does
run<00:03:00.090> over<00:03:00.390> Wi-Fi<00:03:00.600> if<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.650> choose<00:03:01.950> fairly

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
run over Wi-Fi if you choose fairly

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.210 
run over Wi-Fi if you choose fairly
substantial<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.330> then<00:03:03.960> we've<00:03:04.140> got<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.740> cord

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
substantial and then we've got the cord

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.670 
substantial and then we've got the cord
here<00:03:05.550> for<00:03:05.970> actually<00:03:06.750> powering<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.230> camera<00:03:07.530> so

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
here for actually powering the camera so

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.410 
here for actually powering the camera so
basically<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.220> can<00:03:08.400> run<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.790> cord<00:03:09.120> into<00:03:09.270> a

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
basically you can run this cord into a

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.940 
basically you can run this cord into a
dry<00:03:09.690> environment<00:03:09.750> where<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.560> connect<00:03:10.830> up

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
dry environment where you can connect up

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.260 
dry environment where you can connect up
to<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.160> power<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.730> don't<00:03:11.880> actually<00:03:12.030> have

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
to the power so you don't actually have

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
to the power so you don't actually have
to<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> power<00:03:12.900> socket<00:03:13.400> outside<00:03:15.290> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
to have the power socket outside and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.240 
to have the power socket outside and
that's<00:03:16.530> essentially<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:18.530> for<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.800> camera<00:03:20.070> at

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
that's essentially it for that camera at

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.070 
that's essentially it for that camera at
the<00:03:20.310> moment<00:03:20.370> now<00:03:21.090> we<00:03:21.150> will<00:03:21.450> be<00:03:21.600> carrying<00:03:21.930> out<00:03:22.050> a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
the moment now we will be carrying out a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.800 
the moment now we will be carrying out a
full<00:03:22.770> review<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.520> hands-on<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.630> this

the highs and lows and what we really
thought<00:03:33.660> about<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:34.050> camera<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.980> until<00:03:35.220> next

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
thought about this camera so until next

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.240 
thought about this camera so until next
time<00:03:35.490> thanks<00:03:36.090> for<00:03:36.150> watching
