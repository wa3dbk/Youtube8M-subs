 I give you the main components of this 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.730
 chocolate the three main ingredients 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.950
 that would be 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.470
 that's about I 'm not vague 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.900

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.790
 coconut oil that is cold-pressed coconut 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.850
 I've had a watercourse on this before 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.700
 water has heated and then liquefied 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.820
 we have about three full tablespoons here 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.729
 cara powder in raw food quality and here 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.460
 that's about five to six 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.530
 2 dates I have gutted and then 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.770

 in the water and nothing then me 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.600
 have the experience if then in 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.660
 this one because the peri water is more 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.119
 water as in these now these dates 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.530
 then the mingled me 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.509
 that the bad chocolate because oil 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.580
 and water the most needed emeghara 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.929
 so that the bonds well so have 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.619
 I usually only do that now 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.149

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.780
 already a wonderful chocolate itself 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.729
 produce 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.819
 I still like to add it 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:06.190
 a little vanilla and that's it 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.110
 mandl perry about nessler and so on 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.310
 filling, so to speak, I like to take 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.080
 grant the are right and thus are 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.550
 well-known and dried buckwheat because 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.830
 I sometimes make a video to be 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.620
 buckwheat I produce it myself 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.620
 and next to it are chopped almonds 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.230
 I have the chocolate now more often 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.400
 already done this is one 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.330
 a sugar made from deciduous trees 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.890
 won 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.690
 that's just not halt halt rohkost 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.220
 quality that is no twitch rohkost 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.990
 quality that is also a processed 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.870
 or sugar the advantage of these 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.220
 Sugar is totally and harmful 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.550
 for the teeth my account is sugar 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:49.170
 so brush your teeth and my youngest one 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.820
 Little light carius has got in 213 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.900
 I now often times are the chocolate 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.900
 made for him 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:00.660
 as can also eat sweet chocolate 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.720
 Furthermore, you need a silicone 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.450
 forums for the chocolate I have 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.390
 here are some typical thin chocolate 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.640
 that is really sown very thin and that 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.910
 are another kind of chocolates here 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.920
 you can do it wonderfully in parallel with it 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.720
 Ice Cube both are not only suitable 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.730
 because otherwise you will get that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.260
 chocolate out not so well the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.150
 here are very flexible because you can 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.190
 but really nice 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.530
 just take out the chocolate 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.750
 is wonderful for that then 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.380
 you also need a mixer 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.820
 blender 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.200
 So now does not have to be as 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.750
 So I have something with what he then 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.340
 mix this chocolate with the ingredients 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.150
 Could he be research just needed 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:49.410
 I also just mixed it up in it 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:55.020
 These countries are the first to pamper her 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.000
 earlier in the plan that was again 100 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.520
 to 120 milliliters then the three 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.720

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.720

 really really good by mixa 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.080
 so the chocolate will look remixed 

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:58.629
