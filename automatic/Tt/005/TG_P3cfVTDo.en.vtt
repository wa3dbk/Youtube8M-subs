here<00:02:24.830> take<00:02:25.830> these<00:02:26.010> straps<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.580> first<00:02:26.940> or<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
here take these straps on first or the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.620 
here take these straps on first or the
battery<00:02:27.990> buttons<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.610> we<00:02:32.790> basically<00:02:32.970> strap

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
battery buttons so we basically strap

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.140 
battery buttons so we basically strap
those<00:02:33.870> mounts<00:02:34.200> with<00:02:34.320> velcro<00:02:34.710> straps<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.760> to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
those mounts with velcro straps on to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.810 
those mounts with velcro straps on to
the<00:02:36.710> gopro<00:02:37.710> helmet<00:02:37.920> strap<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:40.670> sure<00:02:41.670> they

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
the gopro helmet strap and sure they

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.550 
the gopro helmet strap and sure they
bounce<00:02:42.000> around<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.330> little<00:02:42.480> bit<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:42.960> I'm

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
bounce around a little bit but I'm

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.370 
bounce around a little bit but I'm
basically<00:02:43.920> use<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:44.520> walking<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.960> snow

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
basically use it for walking and in snow

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.890 
basically use it for walking and in snow
and<00:02:46.620> cross-country<00:02:47.340> skiing<00:02:47.730> mostly<00:02:48.690> uphill

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
and cross-country skiing mostly uphill

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.500 
and cross-country skiing mostly uphill
at<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> ski<00:02:49.770> area<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.370> I'm<00:02:51.060> actually<00:02:51.270> looking

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
at a ski area and I'm actually looking

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.640 
at a ski area and I'm actually looking
forward<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.230> will<00:02:52.320> work<00:02:52.350> quite

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
forward to I think it will work quite

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.730 
forward to I think it will work quite
fine<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:55.640> be<00:02:56.640> plugging<00:02:56.910> these<00:02:57.060> batteries<00:02:57.480> here

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.680 

so<00:03:01.740> you<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:02.040> see

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.510 

to<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:10.420> cables<00:03:10.810> can<00:03:10.900> be<00:03:10.960> thread<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.470> the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
to the cables can be thread to the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.910 
to the cables can be thread to the
threaded<00:03:12.520> through<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.880> strap<00:03:13.150> in<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.390> back

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
threaded through the strap in the back

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.600 
threaded through the strap in the back
and<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.930> do<00:03:16.930> have<00:03:17.230> some<00:03:17.470> extension<00:03:18.040> cords<00:03:18.070> for

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
and I do have some extension cords for

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.440 
and I do have some extension cords for
these<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.770> battery<00:03:21.070> pack<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.150> what<00:03:22.330> you

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
these for the battery pack so what you

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.000 
these for the battery pack so what you
can<00:03:22.570> do<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:22.870> if<00:03:22.990> you<00:03:23.080> have<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> jacket<00:03:23.650> with<00:03:23.980> a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
can do is if you have a jacket with a

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.130 
can do is if you have a jacket with a
back<00:03:24.400> pocket<00:03:24.640> usually<00:03:25.240> some<00:03:25.480> sort<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.750> cycling

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
back pocket usually some sort of cycling

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.650 
back pocket usually some sort of cycling
oriented<00:03:26.560> jacket<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:28.000> can<00:03:28.030> put<00:03:28.330> them<00:03:28.450> in<00:03:28.570> the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
oriented jacket you can put them in the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.650 
oriented jacket you can put them in the
back<00:03:28.780> pocket<00:03:29.050> or<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:30.250> could<00:03:30.430> wear<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.850> cycling

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
back pocket or you could wear a cycling

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.270 
back pocket or you could wear a cycling
jersey<00:03:32.110> somewhere<00:03:32.530> underneath<00:03:32.830> all<00:03:33.100> your

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
jersey somewhere underneath all your

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.540 
jersey somewhere underneath all your
layers<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.820> then<00:03:34.360> thread<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.340> battery<00:03:36.340> and

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
layers and then thread the battery and

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.310 
layers and then thread the battery and
the<00:03:36.580> cables<00:03:37.000> underneath<00:03:37.570> your<00:03:37.840> jacket<00:03:38.290> and

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
the cables underneath your jacket and

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.710 
the cables underneath your jacket and
then<00:03:38.620> put<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.010> batteries<00:03:39.460> into<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.300> backpack

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
then put the batteries into the backpack

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.350 
then put the batteries into the backpack
so<00:03:41.620> actually<00:03:42.280> I'm<00:03:42.370> quite<00:03:42.490> happy<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:42.880> found<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
so actually I'm quite happy I found the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.550 
so actually I'm quite happy I found the
solution<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.960> I'm<00:03:44.020> really<00:03:44.200> looking<00:03:44.410> forward

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
solution and I'm really looking forward

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.000 
solution and I'm really looking forward
to<00:03:45.210> using<00:03:46.210> it<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.780> wintertime<00:03:49.770> so<00:03:50.770> there's

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
to using it in the wintertime so there's

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.870 
to using it in the wintertime so there's
a<00:03:51.300> not<00:03:52.300> quite<00:03:52.570> so<00:03:52.750> ingenious<00:03:53.260> use<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.880> the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
a not quite so ingenious use of the
