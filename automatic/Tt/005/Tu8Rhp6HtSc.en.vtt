about<00:01:59.899> this<00:02:00.229> robot<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.950> fact<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:01.280> it

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
about this robot is the fact that it

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.580 
about this robot is the fact that it
also<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.909> a<00:02:01.939> repeater<00:02:02.329> so<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:02.840> can<00:02:02.959> repeat<00:02:03.349> four

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
also is a repeater so it can repeat four

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.589 
also is a repeater so it can repeat four
times<00:02:03.619> from<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.640> farthest<00:02:04.970> point<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:05.390> one

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
times from the farthest point this one

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.960 
times from the farthest point this one
goes<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.289> can<00:02:06.439> have<00:02:06.470> one<00:02:06.979> robot<00:02:07.369> then

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
goes that so you can have one robot then

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.779 
goes that so you can have one robot then
the<00:02:08.030> second<00:02:08.360> robot<00:02:08.479> third<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.049> fourth<00:02:09.200> robot
