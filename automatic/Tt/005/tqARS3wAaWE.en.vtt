00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.450
 Well the company has long samsung 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.849
 fueled interest in his new 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.680
 product produced various teasers 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.800
 some pictures showed on the Internet 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.930
 And finally, at the exhibition mvc 2015 was 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.810
 Presented a new phone called 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.000
 samsung galaxy s6 or rather their 2 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.660
 This is a common model and there is also a model. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.180
 called galaxy s6 edge with curved 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.370
 I will tell you first about this because 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.010
 that they are not much different for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.000
 except for the difference in weight of 6 grams 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.700
 it is heavier and weighs 138 grams and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.309
 thickness of this model is less here 6.8 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.980
 millimeter and s6 edge 7 millimeters 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.219
 exactly and so what 's interesting here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.420
 here is a 5.1 inch display 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.180
 huge resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.769
 this is the highest density on 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.280
 today in mobile displays 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.850
 It is even denser than the galaxy laptop 4 on 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.150
 11 percent 557 points per square 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.310
 inch 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.439
 Naturally this is amoled technology from her 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.280
 virtually no problems with viewing angles 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.680
 where not look everything is perfectly visible for 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.290
 one exception if you look at 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.909
 it is visible from such an angle here 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.159
 used some kind of polarization 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.020
 layer that prevents the appearance of 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.820
 different highlights but i can say that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.400
 really images are very very 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.490
 worthily the device is built on the base 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.310
 what processor I won't say i don't know myself 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.200
 and no one here knows clearly just 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.210
 This is an eight-core processor in which 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.950
 four cores operate at 2 integer frequencies 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.790
 one tenth gigahertz and the other four 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.500
 cores at 1.3 gigahertz here 3 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.140
 GB of RAM and up to 128 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.150
 gigabytes of internal memory which 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.700
 they say more and become much faster 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.190
 as for communication with the outside world, 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.110
 there is naturally l i on 6 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.459
 categories support wi-fi up to 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.370
 father versions 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:15.989
 nfc bluetooth 40 and it seems that all but 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.480
 in fact there is still infrared 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.430
 control port here 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.830
 principle interesting both cameras but I'll start 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.770
 from the front it has a resolution of 5 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.670
 megapixels and medium force 1 and 9 say 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.920
 what's in the dark 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.840
 pictures are much better than 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.000
 iPhone has a main camera 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.890
 16 megapixels resolution it is pretty 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.840
 strongly protrudes from the millimeter case 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.610
 somewhere on 3 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.130
 luminance here is the same 1 and 9 and except 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.870
 LED flash 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.100
 and a special heart with which 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.170
 you can respond to different 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.850
 event example reject call when he 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.100
 comes just put a finger here 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.370
 while I wrote it all down I did it once 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.930
 almost dropped this phone here glass 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.569
 and both front and back 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.340
 but the girl who let me phone 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.799
 not particularly scared this gorilla is burning 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.900
 voice 4 to defend anything you want with 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.489
 it will not be strength contributes and 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.920
 metal frame she's all over 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.660
 perimeter and finally finally she 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.620
 done as me personally for example 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.140
 like it is not so not semi-circular 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.620
 something here is generally nice to keep in 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.299
 hands 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.549
 he became really less Korean 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.440
 the sooner if you understand what i mean 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.230
 there used to be dots here and now 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.410
 everything is very beautiful despite 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.079
 the flash protruding of course stayed on 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.060
 location and fingerprint scanner for 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.760
 to unlock 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.040
 phone make various purchases 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.989
 by the way about shopping samsung concluded 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.820
 agreements with various banks and 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.549
 payment systems such as a visa and 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.600
 mastercard and now with technology 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.140
 samsung pay 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.799
 you can attach this device 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.730
 or galaxy s6 edge to billing 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.069
 terminal but about 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.469
 pay 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.450
 personal purchases will this work for 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.780
 us in Russia but who knows from will 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.359
 to understand in any case the gadget will reach 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.609
 before our country are unknown when said 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.290
 that in 20 countries 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.889
 On April 10, this device will appear in 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.959
 selling 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.720
 but which countries are in this list 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.639
 nobody said about the price 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.889
 also no data 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.910
 but I think it will be very very costly 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.550
 expensive this model and even more expensive model with 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.169
 with rounded edges, I 'll show you what 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.030
 Well here and so she looks 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:36.740
 both ends rounded as you can see and the most 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.750
 the most interesting in my opinion here 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.210
 some amazing color i don't know 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.970
 noticeable to you or not but it is very green 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.259
 I like it yourself look harmonious 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.910
 in my diagonal here is also the density 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.320
 points too iron too 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.759
 the only thing I can show it 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.650
 some software chips that 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.110
 allow you to interact with these 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.710
 edges for example, you can pull the side 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.100
 contact list 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.040
 they are color coded blue green 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.630
 yellow purple and orange and when we 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.120
 will someone call first here 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.680
 such areas of the screen will occur 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.970
 appropriate color and when you 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.260
 put the phone on the table for example part 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.860
 1 of the screen will be seated 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.040
 about 5 in color 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.020
 contacts 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.030
 you can distinguish even if the phone 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.770
 lies face down but in general it seems 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.110
 samsung did not block work on their 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.410
 the interface did not like it all because 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.450
 was too confused there was a lot 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.130
 various icons a bunch of submenus now 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.950
 it all greatly simplified it seems 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.140
 they themselves believed it was necessary 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.900
 and now various 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:48.460
 circles first and color 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:53.400
 coding the blue blue region is responding 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:58.210
 for communication orange for screen yellow for 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:01.570
 setting personalization green for all 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.580
 the rest is obtained and what is the most mine 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.310
 look useful from the dialogs 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.520
 disappeared not always clear 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.810
 pictograms instead of them are now ordinary 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.660
 words are my only question 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.040
 There is how to be certified because 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.960
 which is often 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.730
 Russian words are much longer than 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.070
 English or there will be some 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:25.300
 ridiculous cuts or something else 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:28.390
 let's see i hope u get down with 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.560
 the localization of the spokes will cope well and in 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.710
 general about feelings 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.690
 This is of course something but it is real 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.230
 unusual look at him and 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.990
 and you see that there is nobody like that yet 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.480
 did i also looked at the laptop edge also 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.760
 and now look at the rounded from both 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.250
 parties 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.340
 galaxy s6 edge in my opinion very cool 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.920
 only of course it will be expensive but 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.600
 need to test and learn all the details 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.290
 which we haven't been told much 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.290
 in fact
