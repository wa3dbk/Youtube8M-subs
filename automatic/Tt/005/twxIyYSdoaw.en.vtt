00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.210
 Russian ballistic missile poplar 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.080
 last night successfully struck conditional 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 target 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.269
 I want to scream done 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.490
 remembering failures starting underwater 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.460
 mace only as the target in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.300
 Russian military as always miserable 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.810
 Kazakhstan 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.859
 For 20 years, in principle, Russia could already 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.510
 create a landfill somewhere in his 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.560
 territory especially since there is 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.600
 all possibilities 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.550
 it is clear that for the development of technology 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.280
 need polygons but I can not imagine 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.170
 what's the French over us 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.450
 fired conditions missiles earlier and the king for 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.210
 20 years of independence of Kazakhstan and 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.430
 remained only a test site until 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.860
 spacecraft launching pad 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.510
 for great Russia, Putin is so 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.000
 pays well in dollar terms 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.610
 that Nazarbayev is ready to close his eyes on 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.309
 health and tranquility of his people 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.530
 we are now going to the action around the embassy 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.990
 yes but actually these stocks need 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.030
 hold around the cord because here 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.909
 political will of our state 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.920
 our head of state and i think that 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.200
 if the political will of the Burda 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.509
 this question is solved very quickly 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.609
 repeatedly crash when launching missiles 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.659
 caused severe soil pollution 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.240
 and the atmosphere 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.819
 for every space crash elbasy 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.770
 receives compensation from Russia 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.259
 several tens of millions of dollars 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.750
 Kazakhstanis are still unsuccessfully fighting for 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.329
 his land coalition to close the military 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.789
 polygons led by national patriots 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.219
 Mukhtar that jean he more than once went to 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.409
 protests and demanded liquidation 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.539
 six Russian sites on the territory 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.399
 Kazakhstan who have long been 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.840
 turned into an ecological zone 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.090
 disasters 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.340
 here these all starts they pass nagib 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.340
 bodies fuel first of all need to post 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.780
 heptyl is six times more harmful than cyanide 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:58.959
 Russian empire is long gone 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.219
 the Soviet Union is long gone and we all here 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:06.390
 in such a colonial mode are 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:11.139
 ecologically all these polygons 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.329
 poison our land means by territory 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:15.010
 how polish are they if all the summations 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.840
 they pay us a symbolic price 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.700
 pennies say some that antero 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.400
 anti-Russian position we take a how 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.950
 don't talk about it like this 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.989
 speak too Che ittachi polygons who do not 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.489
 closes these polina our power 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.680
 it is my fault that she does not require 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.780
 here except this nuclear club in 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.419
 there is nothing else in Russia 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.669
 Nazarbayev perfectly understands one thing: 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.959
 as training targets and launch 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.510
 space ships 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.940
 his estates is very profitable for Russia 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.620
 the treasury of Kazakhstan will not harm at all 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.810
 5 billion rubles a year 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.150
 such is the operating fee only 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.669
 Baikonur Cosmodrome life and health 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.870
 nation compared to such capital 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.910
 a drop in the sea 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.090
 by the way the Russian military in March 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.510
 plans to hold two more starts 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.510
 test rockets
