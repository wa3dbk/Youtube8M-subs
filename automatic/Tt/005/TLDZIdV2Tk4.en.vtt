see<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.780> AC<00:00:38.149> adapter<00:00:39.149> plug<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:41.420> right

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
see with the AC adapter plug in right

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.810 
see with the AC adapter plug in right
here<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> fragile<00:00:44.100> sort<00:00:44.670> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
here you can see the fragile sort of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.490 
here you can see the fragile sort of
fractures<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:48.500> right<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:51.500> because

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
fractures up here right there because

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.920 
fractures up here right there because
every<00:00:53.070> time<00:00:53.340> keep<00:00:54.239> moving

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
every time keep moving

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.510 
every time keep moving
it's<00:00:55.649> very<00:00:56.010> flimsy<00:00:58.910> so<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:01.350> order<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
it's very flimsy so in order to get it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.250 
it's very flimsy so in order to get it
work<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.890> resolve<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.309> back

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
work you have to resolve this is back

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.920 
work you have to resolve this is back
it's<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.409> very<00:01:08.180> simple<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> sort<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> path

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it's a very simple to sort of path

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:20.740 
it's a very simple to sort of path
however<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.710> open<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:14.720> nabhi<00:01:16.250> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.990 

check<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.020 

the<00:01:26.000> skill<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:26.630> need<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.020> do<00:01:27.170> with<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:28.030> some

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
the skill you need to do with just some

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.650 
the skill you need to do with just some
little<00:01:29.210> assembly<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.320> soldering<00:01:30.910> and<00:01:31.910> two

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
little assembly and soldering and two

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.040 
little assembly and soldering and two
soldering<00:01:33.170> require<00:01:37.270> that's<00:01:38.270> all<00:01:38.510> you<00:01:38.690> need<00:01:38.840> to

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
soldering require that's all you need to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.560 
soldering require that's all you need to
do<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:39.979> sort<00:01:40.160> of<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.580> let's<00:01:40.790> see<00:01:40.970> how<00:01:41.150> it<00:01:41.180> go

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
do just sort of and let's see how it go

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.190 
do just sort of and let's see how it go
it<00:01:42.380> should<00:01:42.590> be<00:01:42.710> what<00:01:43.630> because<00:01:44.630> right<00:01:44.990> now<00:01:45.170> I

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
it should be what because right now I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.380 
it should be what because right now I
can<00:01:45.590> see<00:01:46.869> their<00:01:47.869> fractions<00:01:48.619> really<00:01:51.940> live<00:01:52.940> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
can see their fractions really live the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
can see their fractions really live the
pin<00:01:53.690> of<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.380> solder<00:01:54.860> pad<00:01:55.310> that's<00:01:56.149> what<00:01:56.960> caused

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
pin of the solder pad that's what caused

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.749 
pin of the solder pad that's what caused
a<00:01:57.440> problem<00:01:58.660> hello<00:01:59.660> this<00:02:00.259> is<00:02:00.290> an<00:02:00.740> app<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:01.460> cut<00:02:03.759> it

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
a problem hello this is an app of cut it

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.270 
a problem hello this is an app of cut it
open

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
open

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.910 
open
Mattie<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.610> tablet<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.420> how<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.080> problem<00:02:09.770> is

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
Mattie to tablet that how the problem is

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.949 
Mattie to tablet that how the problem is
charging<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.650> my<00:02:12.650> dad<00:02:12.890> had<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.130> cut<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.580> off

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
charging so my dad had to cut it off

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:24.640 
charging so my dad had to cut it off
open<00:02:14.959> on<00:02:15.320> time<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.830> then<00:02:22.220> that's<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.650> charges

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
open on time and then that's it charges

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.550 
open on time and then that's it charges
from<00:02:25.130> there<00:02:25.489> they<00:02:26.360> charge<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.020> connection

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
from there they charge you connection

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.720 
from there they charge you connection
and<00:02:30.970> they<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.299> solder<00:02:32.570> fragile<00:02:33.730> right

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
and they have to solder fragile right

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.410 
and they have to solder fragile right
here<00:02:35.150> sort<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.630> rocket<00:02:36.140> see<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.530> path<00:02:37.420> and

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
here sort of rocket see the path and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:47.080 
here sort of rocket see the path and
let's<00:02:38.690> zoom<00:02:39.049> it<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:42.700> clear<00:02:43.959> but<00:02:44.959> anyway<00:02:46.090> and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
let's zoom it in clear but anyway and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.030 
let's zoom it in clear but anyway and
see<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.799> this<00:02:48.799> order<00:02:49.340> lifts<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.239> up<00:02:50.769> off<00:02:51.769> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
see it this order lifts it up off the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.710 
see it this order lifts it up off the
pad<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.070> look<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.489> here<00:02:55.519> then<00:02:56.060> you've<00:02:56.239> won

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
pad if you look in here then you've won

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.690 
pad if you look in here then you've won
of<00:02:56.870> here<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:58.010> one<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.640> here<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.250> that's<00:03:01.549> the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
of here and one in here so that's the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.449 
of here and one in here so that's the
reason<00:03:01.970> why<00:03:03.580> see<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.820> see<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:10.280> and

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
reason why see that see this to one and

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.000 
reason why see that see this to one and
he<00:03:10.610> won<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.150> here<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.540> solder<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.470> press<00:03:12.799> on

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
he won in here the solder you press on

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.620 
he won in here the solder you press on
it<00:03:14.560> see<00:03:15.560> press<00:03:15.920> on<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.459> can<00:03:16.700> see<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.329> it

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
it see press on it you can see it it it

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.360 
it see press on it you can see it it it
moves

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.560 

anyway<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.430> have<00:03:22.579> a<00:03:22.730> sort<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.090> one<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.390> the
