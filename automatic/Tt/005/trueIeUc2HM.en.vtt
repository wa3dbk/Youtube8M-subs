00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.380 
now before taking the engine apart I
want<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:08.530> try<00:02:09.069> using<00:02:09.280> an<00:02:09.550> addict<00:02:09.910> tube<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.330> a

want to try using an addict tube that a

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.729 
want to try using an addict tube that a
couple<00:02:10.599> of<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.840> guys<00:02:11.050> have<00:02:11.349> actually

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
couple of you guys have actually

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.339 
couple of you guys have actually
recommended<00:02:12.340> i've<00:02:13.209> never<00:02:13.540> taken<00:02:13.810> an<00:02:14.050> engine

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
recommended i've never taken an engine

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.620 
recommended i've never taken an engine
apart<00:02:14.590> before<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.310> getting<00:02:15.580> spare<00:02:16.000> parts<00:02:16.420> for

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
apart before and getting spare parts for

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.170 
apart before and getting spare parts for
such<00:02:16.810> an<00:02:16.959> old<00:02:17.080> engine<00:02:17.410> can<00:02:17.680> be<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> real<00:02:18.069> pain<00:02:18.370> so

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
such an old engine can be a real pain so

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.449 
such an old engine can be a real pain so
it<00:02:19.270> seems<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.900> would<00:02:20.020> be<00:02:20.050> well<00:02:21.040> worth<00:02:21.069> the

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
it seems like it would be well worth the

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.550 
it seems like it would be well worth the
effort<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:22.150> give<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.720> addict<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.290> try

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
effort to just give the addict of a try

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.250 
effort to just give the addict of a try
the<00:02:24.190> second<00:02:24.610> item<00:02:24.760> on<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.209> list<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.569> much<00:02:25.959> much

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
the second item on the list is much much

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.620 
the second item on the list is much much
easier<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:27.400> putting<00:02:27.730> up<00:02:27.880> shelves<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
easier it's putting up shelves in the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.619 
easier it's putting up shelves in the
tiny<00:02:29.020> closet<00:02:29.849> having<00:02:30.849> shelves<00:02:31.330> in<00:02:31.480> there

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
tiny closet having shelves in there

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.510 
tiny closet having shelves in there
would<00:02:31.840> allow<00:02:32.050> me<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.230> utilize<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.010> space<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
would allow me to utilize the space in a

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.059 
would allow me to utilize the space in a
much<00:02:33.790> more<00:02:34.060> efficient<00:02:34.540> way<00:02:34.599> and<00:02:35.069> utilizing

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.740 
space about such a small sailboat is
very<00:02:38.590> important<00:02:39.069> of<00:02:39.370> course<00:02:40.209> I'd<00:02:40.360> have<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.569> be

absolutely insane while I have the mast
down<00:03:42.610> I<00:03:42.760> might<00:03:43.300> be<00:03:43.510> adding<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:44.050> must<00:03:44.470> had<00:03:44.709> the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
wind sensor item number six on the list

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.990 
wind sensor item number six on the list
and<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.709> think<00:03:47.740> this<00:03:48.070> one<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.459> last<00:03:48.670> one<00:03:48.820> I'm

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
and I think this one is the last one I'm

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.699 
and I think this one is the last one I'm
gonna<00:03:49.150> mention<00:03:49.420> now<00:03:49.720> not<00:03:50.200> enough<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.590> make

this video too long and boring well item
number<00:03:53.470> six<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.370> insulate<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:54.970> remainder

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
number six is to insulate the remainder

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.660 
number six is to insulate the remainder
of<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.959> hull<00:03:56.170> I<00:03:56.440> still<00:03:57.040> need<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.310> insulate

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
of the hull I still need to insulate

insightly tiny cupboard and behind the
head<00:04:00.310> also<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.450> think<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:02.050> want<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.230> add<00:04:02.380> some

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
head also I think I want to add some

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.410 
head also I think I want to add some
more<00:04:02.770> insulation<00:04:03.489> out<00:04:03.640> in<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.000> knee<00:04:04.180> birth

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
more insulation out in the knee birth

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.390 
more insulation out in the knee birth
right<00:04:04.989> now<00:04:05.140> there's<00:04:05.410> only<00:04:05.500> three<00:04:05.680> millimeters

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
right now there's only three millimeters

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.940 
right now there's only three millimeters
out<00:04:06.610> there<00:04:06.820> and<00:04:07.019> 15<00:04:08.019> millimeters<00:04:08.260> would<00:04:08.739> be

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
out there and 15 millimeters would be

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.600 
out there and 15 millimeters would be
much<00:04:09.340> better<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:11.050> was<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.350> first<00:04:11.590> six<00:04:12.190> items

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
much better that was the first six items
