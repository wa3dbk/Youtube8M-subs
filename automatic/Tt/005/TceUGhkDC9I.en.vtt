everyone<00:00:06.180> how<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.450> use<00:00:06.629> basic<00:00:07.319> logic<00:00:07.500> gates<00:00:07.859> in

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
everyone how to use basic logic gates in

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.070 
everyone how to use basic logic gates in
Minecraft<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:09.179> today<00:00:09.660> we're<00:00:09.809> going<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.990> be

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
Minecraft so today we're going to be

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.780 
Minecraft so today we're going to be
looking<00:00:10.170> at<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.530> gates<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> very

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
looking at and gates this is a very

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.900 
looking at and gates this is a very
basic<00:00:12.059> end<00:00:12.450> gate<00:00:12.690> design<00:00:13.019> here<00:00:13.370> and<00:00:14.370> gates

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
basic end gate design here and gates

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.040 
basic end gate design here and gates
work<00:00:15.299> off<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.929> basis<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.800> plus<00:00:17.760> B<00:00:17.789> equals<00:00:18.390> C

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
work off the basis of a plus B equals C

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.090 
work off the basis of a plus B equals C
so<00:00:20.660> we've<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> very<00:00:22.859> simple

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
so we've got a this is a very simple

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.839 
so we've got a this is a very simple
design<00:00:23.490> by<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.730> way<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.840> input<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:26.160> when<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.550> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
design by the way a input and when a is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.689 
design by the way a input and when a is
on<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.869> output<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.199> off<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:29.220> when<00:00:29.429> both

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
on the output is off but when both

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.860 
on the output is off but when both
inputs<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:31.050> output<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.750> it's<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
inputs on the output is on so it's a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.630 
inputs on the output is on so it's a
very<00:00:33.930> simple<00:00:34.469> explanation<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.489> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
very simple explanation of what it is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.000 
very simple explanation of what it is
now<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> build<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.770> many

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
now how to build them there are many

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
now how to build them there are many
different<00:00:38.370> designs<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.540> actually<00:00:39.750> kind

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
different designs you can actually kind

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.209 
different designs you can actually kind
of<00:00:40.379> freestyle<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.910> i'll<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.989> making<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.530> using

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
of freestyle so i'll be making one using

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.600 
of freestyle so i'll be making one using
pistons<00:00:44.719> now<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.620> an<00:00:46.739> input<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.280> also

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
pistons now and have an input here also

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.360 
pistons now and have an input here also
red<00:00:48.059> wall<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.510> inputs<00:00:49.230> blue<00:00:49.620> well<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.920> outputs

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
red wall is inputs blue well as outputs

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000 
red wall is inputs blue well as outputs
gray<00:00:50.760> well<00:00:50.969> as<00:00:51.180> everything<00:00:51.690> else<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.890> we're

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
gray well as everything else so we're

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
gray well as everything else so we're
going<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.280> an<00:00:53.370> input<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.809> can

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
going to have an input in here you can

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.130 
going to have an input in here you can
just<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> repeater<00:00:56.300> then<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.989> we're

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
just have a repeater then out here we're

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.160 
just have a repeater then out here we're
just<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:59.219> redstone<00:00:59.460> and

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
just going to have more redstone and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.729 
just going to have more redstone and
above<00:01:01.170> Lynch<00:01:01.410> actually<00:01:02.160> make<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.520> red<00:01:03.739> we

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
above Lynch actually make this red we

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.080 
above Lynch actually make this red we
will<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.610> piston<00:01:06.470> now<00:01:07.470> actually<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:08.939> I'll

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
will have a piston now actually now I'll

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.070 
will have a piston now actually now I'll
leave<00:01:09.630> piston<00:01:10.229> moving<00:01:10.650> blocks<00:01:10.860> gray<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.090> we'll

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
leave piston moving blocks gray so we'll

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
leave piston moving blocks gray so we'll
connect<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> piston<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.790> go

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
connect the piston up and here we go

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.570 
connect the piston up and here we go
this<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.509> basic<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.140> gate<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:17.430> if

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
this is a really basic and gate now if

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.170 
this is a really basic and gate now if
we<00:01:17.869> power<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.560> poke<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.920> nothing<00:01:20.700> happens

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
we power on and poke a nothing happens

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.830 
we power on and poke a nothing happens
but<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.930> power<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.530> both<00:01:23.310> inputs<00:01:23.820> I'll<00:01:24.659> just

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
but if we power on both inputs I'll just

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.740 
but if we power on both inputs I'll just
power<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.500> actually<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.450> output

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
power it like this actually the output

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.260 
power it like this actually the output
will<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> basic<00:01:29.549> example<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
will be on so it's a basic example of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.289 
will be on so it's a basic example of
what<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.020> how<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.979> works<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:32.850> come

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
what it is and how it works now come

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.830 
what it is and how it works now come
over<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.909> this<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.450> kind<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.750> an

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
over here and this this is kind of an

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
over here and this this is kind of an
example<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.520> these<00:01:39.030> n

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
example of what you can do with these n

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.179 
example of what you can do with these n
gates<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> very<00:01:40.920> basic

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
gates so this here is a very basic

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.499 
gates so this here is a very basic
combination<00:01:41.850> lock<00:01:42.030> when<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:44.090> get<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.299> them

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
combination lock when we get all them

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.499 
combination lock when we get all them
when<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> combination<00:01:46.740> right<00:01:47.509> door

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
when we get the combination right door

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.350 
when we get the combination right door
open<00:01:48.930> door<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.649> open<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.060> when<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.180> don't

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
open door will open that when we don't

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.700 
open door will open that when we don't
get<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> right<00:01:51.689> door<00:01:52.079> closed<00:01:52.430> this<00:01:53.430> works<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
get a right door closed this works and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.530 
get a right door closed this works and
basically<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> same<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
basically the same is this one with the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.039 
basically the same is this one with the
all<00:01:58.340> torches<00:01:59.340> leading<00:01:59.909> into<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> central

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
all torches leading into a central

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.990 
all torches leading into a central
output<00:02:01.680> wire<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.450> we've<00:02:03.450> got<00:02:03.689> no<00:02:04.729> torch<00:02:05.729> off

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
output wire and we've got no torch off

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.440 
output wire and we've got no torch off
the<00:02:06.329> switch<00:02:06.600> here<00:02:06.899> or<00:02:07.590> lever<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:09.119> their

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the switch here or lever and that their

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.639 
the switch here or lever and that their
means

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
means

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.610 
means
