00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.860
 hello everyone hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.830
 good look at this already raised with fixing the 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.530
 door because he already needed a 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.140
 little handyman of paint I've been trying for 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.010
 here with a gadget that there was no use 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.960
 never a heat pickling is like a 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.130
 hair dryer but it releases you heat 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.570
 at five hundred and a half degrees good fixing 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.490
 a little bit the door that then there 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.830
 stuck with then the winter with 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.260
 humidity 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.469
 and you see I think you can appreciate it here 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.970
 in this part as I was already eaten by 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.460
 him by the sun in the bottom like 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.390
 already by enough places because it was already 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.820
 eaten from spoils spoiled more than 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.239
 Eaten 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.210
 spoiled from the sun then when it was a 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.460
 little the the wind 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.300
 well, it's also acute, I think 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.960
 you can see if you can see it down here 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.200
 to see if I can put it so it looks 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.260
 we see here how the screaming 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.680
 paint is unloading and was a 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.690
 door that was perfectly 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.760
 I was destroying her 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.460
 well I'm testing with him with the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.979
 cappa doreste 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.540
 it's a wonder I have bedrich is a 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.470
 I'm going to make a test for you 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.470
 see the difference 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.569
 it ends now so yes 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.980
 but that you can appreciate the difference 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.520
 how he was wealthy 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.260
 or not 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.560
 three layers of two 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.640
 Stamina in the open 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.340
 does not crack as it puts in the little boat 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.340
 we'll see 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.570
 you can if you can see here 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.800
 Easy maintenance highlights the grain 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.770
 good weather resistance 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.330
 Water repellent is not cut or escapes 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.819
 and ideas 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.710
 satin 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.800
 good nothing more than that 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.190
 Now yes for another 4 or 5 years 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.190
 at least 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.269
