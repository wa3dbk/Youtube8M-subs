00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
something like a leaf or any source of

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.859 
something like a leaf or any source of
power<00:01:55.979> then<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.210> come<00:01:57.570> back<00:01:57.689> down

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
power then what you do is come back down

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.750 
power then what you do is come back down
here<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.200> connect<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:58.979> wrists<00:01:59.159> than<00:01:59.189> up

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.990 

yeah<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.510> race<00:02:02.660> that<00:02:02.780> up<00:02:03.640> let<00:02:04.640> me<00:02:04.730> hear<00:02:04.820> that

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
yeah the race that up let me hear that

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.360 
yeah the race that up let me hear that
as<00:02:05.150> flashing<00:02:05.720> like<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.050> that<00:02:06.950> means<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
as flashing like that that means the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.650 
as flashing like that that means the
time<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.850> everything<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.119> working<00:02:08.330> now<00:02:08.630> to

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
time and everything is working now to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.810 
time and everything is working now to
turn<00:02:08.930> this<00:02:09.050> off<00:02:09.260> like<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:10.280> is<00:02:10.369> pretty<00:02:10.580> clever

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
turn this off like this is pretty clever

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.430 
turn this off like this is pretty clever
but<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.180> flip<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.510> lever<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.290> causes

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
but you flip this lever and it causes

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.170 
but you flip this lever and it causes
the<00:02:12.680> press<00:02:12.800> weight<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.100> push<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.460> not

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
the press weight to push that not

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.330 
the press weight to push that not
participate<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> piston<00:02:15.200> which<00:02:15.920> breaks<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
participate a piston which breaks the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.820 
participate a piston which breaks the
signal<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:16.940> then<00:02:17.600> pick<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.260> down<00:02:18.500> again<00:02:18.800> and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
signal and then pick it down again and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.710 
signal and then pick it down again and
it<00:02:19.100> will<00:02:19.160> go<00:02:19.310> back<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.030> that's<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.420> pretty<00:02:20.540> good

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
it will go back so that's a pretty good

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.750 
it will go back so that's a pretty good
way<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.900> turning<00:02:21.140> off<00:02:21.410> your<00:02:21.440> redstone<00:02:21.800> okay<00:02:22.700> so

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
way of turning off your redstone okay so

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.920 
way of turning off your redstone okay so
now<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:23.180> want<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.390> do<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.600> fill<00:02:23.810> up<00:02:23.900> your

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
now we want to do is fill up your

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.570 
now we want to do is fill up your
dispensers<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.530> arrows<00:02:24.860> I've<00:02:25.070> already<00:02:25.340> done

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
dispensers of arrows I've already done

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.870 
dispensers of arrows I've already done
that<00:02:25.610> so<00:02:26.150> then<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.630> flip<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.900> lever<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.880> just

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that so then you flip the lever and just

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.370 
that so then you flip the lever and just
simply<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.240> firing<00:02:29.510> like<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.230> they

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
simply just firing like that and they

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.430 
simply just firing like that and they
have<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> automatic<00:02:31.610> arrow<00:02:32.270> turret<00:02:35.440> despite

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
have a automatic arrow turret despite

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.660 
have a automatic arrow turret despite
the<00:02:36.560> videos<00:02:36.830> for<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.130> more<00:02:37.310> advanced

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
the videos for the more advanced

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.330 
the videos for the more advanced
redstone<00:02:37.970> user<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.500> example<00:02:39.830> here<00:02:40.130> is

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
redstone user so this example here is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.700 
redstone user so this example here is
how<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.580> auto<00:02:41.000> refill<00:02:41.720> your<00:02:41.960> own<00:02:42.110> dispensers

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
how to auto refill your own dispensers

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.890 
how to auto refill your own dispensers
so<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:43.520> want<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.730> do<00:02:43.850> is<00:02:44.000> put<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.180> hopper<00:02:44.540> on<00:02:44.690> top

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
so we want to do is put a hopper on top

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.330 
so we want to do is put a hopper on top
of<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.020> dispenser<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.620> an<00:02:45.710> HS<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.100> top<00:02:46.220> of

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
of the dispenser and an HS on top of

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.370 
of the dispenser and an HS on top of
that<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.850> then<00:02:47.390> just<00:02:47.570> fill<00:02:47.750> up<00:02:47.900> your<00:02:47.930> chest

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
that and then just fill up your chest

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.590 
that and then just fill up your chest
which<00:02:49.280> will<00:02:49.430> go<00:02:49.550> through<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.880> hopper<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.420> go

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
which will go through the hopper and go

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.710 
which will go through the hopper and go
down<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.870> dispenser<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.400> have<00:02:52.580> a

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
down to the dispenser and you have a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.050 
down to the dispenser and you have a
nice<00:02:53.720> little<00:02:54.020> auto<00:02:54.350> system<00:02:54.980> here<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.340> then

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
nice little auto system here and then

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.670 
nice little auto system here and then
this<00:02:56.090> side<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.810> I'm<00:02:57.200> going<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.380> be<00:02:57.440> showing<00:02:57.560> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
this side is I'm going to be showing you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.949 
this side is I'm going to be showing you
how<00:02:57.740> to<00:02:57.770> change<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.040> speed<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:59.540> let's<00:02:59.810> just

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
how to change the speed so let's just

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.960 
how to change the speed so let's just
set<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.140> all<00:03:00.290> up<00:03:00.320> properly<00:03:00.860> like<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:03.970> that

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
set it all up properly like this that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.210 
set it all up properly like this that
fires<00:03:05.209> out<00:03:05.450> like<00:03:05.600> that<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.680> slowed<00:03:06.950> speech

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
fires out like that it slowed speech

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.890 
fires out like that it slowed speech
just<00:03:07.640> put<00:03:07.820> repeater<00:03:08.150> there<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.630> just<00:03:08.780> go

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
just put repeater there and just go

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.570 
just put repeater there and just go
slower<00:03:09.310> today<00:03:10.310> now<00:03:10.610> far<00:03:11.060> at<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.330> slower<00:03:11.660> rate

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
slower today now far at a slower rate

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.650 
slower today now far at a slower rate
okay<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:13.640> i<00:03:13.790> hope<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:13.970> video<00:03:14.360> helped<00:03:14.660> you
