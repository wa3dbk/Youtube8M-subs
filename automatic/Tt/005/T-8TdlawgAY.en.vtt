what I'm showing you there is some kind

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.949 
what I'm showing you there is some kind
of<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.179> recoil<00:01:41.749> and<00:01:42.039> of<00:01:43.039> the<00:01:43.459> m16<00:01:44.149> without<00:01:44.689> any

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
of the recoil and of the m16 without any

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.709 
of the recoil and of the m16 without any
proficiencies<00:01:45.889> or<00:01:46.100> anything<00:01:46.579> like<00:01:46.609> that<00:01:46.939> it

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
proficiencies or anything like that it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.789 
proficiencies or anything like that it
is<00:01:47.990> just<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.289> plain<00:01:48.590> gun<00:01:48.859> itself<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:51.020> slow

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
is just a plain gun itself and I slow

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.830 
is just a plain gun itself and I slow
down<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.189> video<00:01:52.310> for<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.909> in<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:53.479> couple<00:01:53.689> of

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
down the video for you in a couple of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.649 
down the video for you in a couple of
seconds<00:01:54.229> now<00:01:54.350> my<00:01:54.649> probably<00:01:55.009> right<00:01:55.159> now<00:01:55.310> and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
seconds now my probably right now and

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.029 
seconds now my probably right now and
you're<00:01:56.659> going<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.929> see<00:01:57.229> kind<00:01:57.469> of<00:01:57.590> well<00:01:57.889> the

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
you're going to see kind of well the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.730 
you're going to see kind of well the
recovery<00:01:58.579> X<00:01:58.819> it<00:01:59.149> tends<00:01:59.389> to<00:01:59.689> kind<00:01:59.959> of<00:02:00.049> kick<00:02:00.439> up

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
recovery X it tends to kind of kick up

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.959 
recovery X it tends to kind of kick up
of<00:02:01.099> course<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.119> an<00:02:02.270> m16<00:02:02.869> tends<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.380> do<00:02:03.590> that

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
of course but an m16 tends to do that

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.080 
of course but an m16 tends to do that
the<00:02:04.969> only<00:02:05.209> as<00:02:05.569> it<00:02:06.170> tends<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.709> kind<00:02:07.099> of<00:02:07.159> recall

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
the only as it tends to kind of recall

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.029 
the only as it tends to kind of recall
when<00:02:08.539> you're<00:02:08.690> aiming<00:02:09.050> down<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.229> sights<00:02:09.380> tends

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
when you're aiming down the sights tends

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.650 
when you're aiming down the sights tends
to<00:02:10.220> be<00:02:10.340> really<00:02:10.610> close<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:11.030> each<00:02:11.060> other<00:02:11.330> that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
to be really close to each other that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.960 
to be really close to each other that
can<00:02:11.840> be<00:02:11.930> really<00:02:12.230> good<00:02:12.470> at<00:02:13.459> times<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.880> could

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
can be really good at times that could

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.760 
can be really good at times that could
be<00:02:14.090> really<00:02:14.270> bad<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:14.930> most<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.319> time<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.620> really

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
be really bad but most of time is really

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.920 
be really bad but most of time is really
good<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.640> recoil<00:02:17.120> when<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.390> spreads

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
good and the recoil when it spreads

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.250 
good and the recoil when it spreads
tends<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.860> be<00:02:19.040> kind<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.550> off<00:02:20.240> really<00:02:21.110> all

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260

really i'm not even gonna lie tends to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.500 
really i'm not even gonna lie tends to
be<00:02:23.540> off

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.660

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
type 95 has is the reason why it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.110 
type 95 has is the reason why it
steadily<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:14.630> m16<00:04:15.260> only<00:04:15.769> tends<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.310> be<00:04:16.459> deadly

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
steadily the m16 only tends to be deadly

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.009 
steadily the m16 only tends to be deadly
when<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.200> um<00:04:18.500> actually<00:04:19.090> from<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.239> distance

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
when it is um actually from a distance

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.129 
when it is um actually from a distance
it's<00:04:21.320> kind<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.560> crazy<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:22.160> is<00:04:22.810> because<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
it's kind of crazy it is because of the

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.050 
it's kind of crazy it is because of the
recoil<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:24.830> tends<00:04:25.039> to<00:04:25.160> be<00:04:25.250> close<00:04:25.639> to<00:04:25.669> each

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
recoil that tends to be close to each

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.870 
recoil that tends to be close to each
other<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:27.500> type<00:04:27.710> 95<00:04:28.039> if<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.610> takes<00:04:28.789> a

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
other and the type 95 if it takes a

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.370 
other and the type 95 if it takes a
couple<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.180> more<00:04:29.360> bullets<00:04:29.780> if<00:04:29.930> you're<00:04:30.110> kind<00:04:30.320> of

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
couple of more bullets if you're kind of

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.810 
couple of more bullets if you're kind of
inaccurate<00:04:31.220> but<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:33.070> was<00:04:34.070> worth<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.610> gun

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
inaccurate but it was worth it the gun

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.029 
inaccurate but it was worth it the gun
is<00:04:34.940> really<00:04:35.180> good<00:04:35.390> you<00:04:35.690> know<00:04:36.169> with<00:04:36.380> rapid<00:04:36.800> fire

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
is really good you know with rapid fire

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.410 
is really good you know with rapid fire
it<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.490> better<00:04:37.789> and

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
it is better and

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.570 
it is better and
dots<00:04:38.660> on<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:38.900> can<00:04:39.140> be<00:04:39.260> peace<00:04:39.500> both<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.490> these

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
dots on it can be peace both of these

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.330 
dots on it can be peace both of these
guns<00:04:40.910> are<00:04:41.090> amazing<00:04:41.750> generally<00:04:42.470> but<00:04:43.220> the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
guns are amazing generally but the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.010 
guns are amazing generally but the
winner<00:04:43.550> in<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:43.880> end<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.330> has<00:04:44.480> to<00:04:44.630> be<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.840> type

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
winner in the end it has to be the type

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.860 
winner in the end it has to be the type
95<00:04:45.320> if<00:04:46.040> this<00:04:46.250> gun<00:04:46.490> was<00:04:46.700> just<00:04:46.940> beast<00:04:47.240> in<00:04:47.480> general

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
95 if this gun was just beast in general

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.890 
95 if this gun was just beast in general
I<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:49.490> wins<00:04:49.820> it<00:04:50.000> out<00:04:50.120> on<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.690> three<00:04:50.870> ball

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
I think it wins it out on the three ball

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.810 
I think it wins it out on the three ball
of<00:04:51.110> birds<00:04:51.290> go<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:51.710> I'm<00:04:51.770> 16<00:04:52.160> sorry<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:52.700> was
