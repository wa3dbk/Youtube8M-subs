00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
walkthrough I'm going to figure out

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.990 
walkthrough I'm going to figure out
where<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.259> culprit<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.400> get<00:00:08.700> inside

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
where the culprit is and get inside

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.480 
where the culprit is and get inside
trapper<00:00:09.269> Dan's<00:00:09.570> noodle<00:00:09.929> but<00:00:10.200> first<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.920> will

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
trapper Dan's noodle but first I will

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.580 
trapper Dan's noodle but first I will
not<00:00:11.730> throw<00:00:12.000> ice<00:00:12.240> balls<00:00:12.570> at<00:00:12.780> windows<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.410> will

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
not throw ice balls at windows I will

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.400 
not throw ice balls at windows I will
not<00:00:13.769> try<00:00:14.040> wise<00:00:14.309> call<00:00:14.610> them<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:16.109> wanted

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
not try wise call them in I just wanted

with<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> pig<00:01:00.420> token<00:01:00.930> cool<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.760> just

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
with the pig token cool so now we just

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.700 
with the pig token cool so now we just
need<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> wolf<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.080> flip<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
need to get the wolf to flip all of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.760 
need to get the wolf to flip all of
these<00:01:05.129> switches<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.750> switch<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
these switches we have one switch to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
these switches we have one switch to
switch<00:01:08.100> three<00:01:08.939> switches<00:01:09.210> three<00:01:09.600> switches<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
switch three switches three switches and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.170 
switch three switches three switches and
all<00:01:10.290> those<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.340> switches<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
all those are the switches to the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.590 
all those are the switches to the
keyholes<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.290> believe<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.850> key<00:01:15.060> bowls<00:01:15.299> which

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
keyholes I believe the key bowls which

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.399 
keyholes I believe the key bowls which
we<00:01:15.810> will<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> momentarily<00:01:16.970> far<00:01:17.970> way

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
we will see you momentarily far way

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.600 
we will see you momentarily far way
forward<00:01:19.409> forward

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
forward forward

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.749 
forward forward
Jim<00:01:21.509> ah<00:01:22.759> Isis<00:01:23.790> forward<00:01:24.630> forward<00:01:25.140> forward<00:01:26.009> jump

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
Jim ah Isis forward forward forward jump

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.950 
Jim ah Isis forward forward forward jump
ha

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
ha

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:39.730 
ha
Oh<00:01:30.500> already<00:01:31.500> pretty<00:01:31.979> simple

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.490 

so<00:01:40.740> she<00:01:40.799> goes<00:01:41.219> forward<00:01:41.899> forward<00:01:44.060> forward

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
so she goes forward forward forward

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.590 
so she goes forward forward forward
jumps<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:47.189> uses<00:01:47.579> her<00:01:47.729> paw<00:01:47.969> to<00:01:48.270> hit<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
jumps and then uses her paw to hit the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:06.050 
jumps and then uses her paw to hit the
switch<00:02:02.960> all<00:02:03.960> right<00:02:04.289> one<00:02:04.619> more<00:02:04.860> far<00:02:05.729> away

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
switch all right one more far away

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.680 
switch all right one more far away
actually<00:02:06.390> two<00:02:06.840> more<00:02:07.110> left<00:02:07.770> left<00:02:08.549> ha

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
actually two more left left ha

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.130 
actually two more left left ha
Isis<00:02:10.410> forward<00:02:11.310> left<00:02:11.880> left

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
Isis forward left left

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.890 
Isis forward left left
ha<00:02:13.440> oh<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.489> have<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:21.000> wonder<00:02:21.180> what<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.569> wolf

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
ha oh so I have to wonder what the wolf

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.380 
ha oh so I have to wonder what the wolf
is<00:02:22.079> walking<00:02:22.500> around<00:02:22.620> are<00:02:23.130> there<00:02:23.310> those<00:02:24.150> look

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
is walking around are there those look

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.850 
is walking around are there those look
like<00:02:24.569> mine<00:02:24.870> tracks

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
like mine tracks

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.860 
like mine tracks
you<00:02:26.069> know<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:28.430> guess<00:02:29.430> these<00:02:29.640> are<00:02:29.700> mines<00:02:30.120> okay

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
you know I guess these are mines okay

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.110 
you know I guess these are mines okay
maybe<00:02:31.140> those<00:02:31.380> were<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:32.130> mine<00:02:32.489> carts<00:02:32.970> or

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
maybe those were like mine carts or

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.559 
maybe those were like mine carts or
something<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:34.849> I'm<00:02:35.849> not<00:02:36.239> entirely

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
something like that I'm not entirely

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:47.330 
something like that I'm not entirely

have to put all four tokens and this
will<00:04:55.729> open<00:04:55.909> the<00:04:56.150> door<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.750> needle<00:04:58.810> yes<00:04:59.810> and

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
will open the door to the needle yes and

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.700 
will open the door to the needle yes and
inside<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.270> needle<00:05:02.569> we<00:05:02.900> will<00:05:03.050> learn<00:05:03.259> who<00:05:03.590> the

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
inside the needle we will learn who the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.100 
inside the needle we will learn who the
culprit<00:05:04.159> of<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.490> game<00:05:04.699> is<00:05:04.970> so<00:05:05.659> that's<00:05:05.870> going

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
culprit of the game is so that's going

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.759 
culprit of the game is so that's going
to<00:05:06.199> happen<00:05:06.349> in<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.919> next<00:05:07.220> video
