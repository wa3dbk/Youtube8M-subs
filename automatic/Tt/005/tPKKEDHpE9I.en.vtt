00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
skateboard which is not on ps2 that is

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.180 
skateboard which is not on ps2 that is
actually<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> newly<00:03:05.700> added<00:03:05.880> thing<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:07.190> 100

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
actually a newly added thing and 100

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.130 
actually a newly added thing and 100
kilometers<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> bike<00:03:09.180> which<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.450> also<00:03:09.989> on

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
kilometers on a bike which is also on

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.160 
kilometers on a bike which is also on
ps2<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:11.579> those<00:03:11.850> three<00:03:12.090> things<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:12.780> believe

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
ps2 so those three things I believe

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.699 
ps2 so those three things I believe
there<00:03:13.590> are<00:03:13.730> achievements<00:03:14.730> for<00:03:14.910> all<00:03:15.090> three

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
there are achievements for all three

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.259 
there are achievements for all three
because<00:03:16.709> they're<00:03:17.100> not<00:03:17.310> really<00:03:17.640> something

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
because they're not really something

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.800 
because they're not really something
like<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> mission<00:03:19.109> they're<00:03:19.350> just<00:03:19.590> extras<00:03:20.810> but

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
like a mission they're just extras but

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.349 
like a mission they're just extras but
