this eye I think it looks a little bit

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.360 
this eye I think it looks a little bit
more<00:03:52.140> complete<00:03:52.470> when<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.710> add<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:53.010> some<00:03:53.190> black

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
more complete when you add it some black

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.710 
more complete when you add it some black
eyeliner<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:53.970> makes<00:03:54.120> your<00:03:54.270> eyes<00:03:54.420> look<00:03:54.450> a

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
eyeliner and it makes your eyes look a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.940 
eyeliner and it makes your eyes look a
