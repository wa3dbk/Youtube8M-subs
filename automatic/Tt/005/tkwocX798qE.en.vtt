00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.040
 before you automaton that's how you see 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.120
 12 possible beverage choices 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 accordingly, now let's see what 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 is inside what technical 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:21.779
 the characteristics of his turning so immediately 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.650
 see pipes with cups there 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.560
 600 cups are placed on the order of 600 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:40.110
 Six hundred such stir here or 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:42.719
 we open the container for the grain 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.969
 coffee is placed on the order of 6 kilograms and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.200
 three soluble containers 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.559
 vanilla chocolate milk ingredients can 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.230
 to drive replace let's say tea 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.730
 accordingly, who wants to do against 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.800
 auto sailor is different from new only 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.770
 so that here in this compartment 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.159
 an additional container appears for 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.270
 soluble ingredient and it turns out 16 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.340
 drinks and not 12 as here in this machine 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:16.680
 growth is also possible to eliminate 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.909
 refrigeration module and monitor so models 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.450
 practically andy teach-in ethical look 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.409
 waste bucket accordingly this 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.810
 float two water canisters 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.619
 installed in each 19 liters then 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.040
 there is a capacity of about 38 liters of water 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.850
 allowing for quite a long time 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.850
 battery life 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.329
 so we look at the payment systems 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.750
 so here is a bill acceptor 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.560
 calculated on about 600 bills given 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.370
 payment that is connected to the modem 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.830
 we are standing here here is an opportunity 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.840
 connect the flash drive further 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.970
 programming so on 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.709
 coin acceptor accepts but 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.510
 accordingly, what is written here 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.950
 teeth corresponds to which denomination 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.900
 coin take fives tens and rubles 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.360
 that's all so to say when 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.709
 the coin acceptor is filling up like this 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.550
 see here he further sends coins 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:38.840
 here in such 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:45.010
 boxes we close the box further then 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:48.920
 management really see there here 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:54.920
 respectively, the antenna is an antenna 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.910
 modems that strengthen so to speak 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.090
 modem signal which is here 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.000
 SIM card inserted here so on 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.049
 let's see we see that 4 functional 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.420
 operator technician buttons washing test 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.630
 in case of eliminating any non 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.299
 oddities or changed porn prices 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.959
 grams and so on we use 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:26.480
 operators technique to enter the test 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:29.410
 mode to try and drink without 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.330
 making the sum we use the test and 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:38.840
 washing it for a functional test 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:44.450
 We use these prices here, it's just 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:50.560
 pictures that in any which in any 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:53.650
 the moment can be replaced just here 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:03.790
 replacing with other relevant yours 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:07.690
 price so automatic gives change here 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.420
 sugar in the choice of meme more less 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.360
 takes tens of 50 rubles 100 rubles 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.489
 it is possible to take 500 and 1000 but not 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.109
 advises for so how can the machine 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:25.030
 used just for exchange here 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.030
 in the delivery tray 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:32.570
 automatons highlighted in principle 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.660
 power consumption is not much because 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.919
 what is used 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.460
 not incandescent lamp 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:44.930
 just LEDs so when high 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:50.539
 load on the day of consumption of order 2 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:53.660
 kilowatt where there is not very much so 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:05:02.630
 what else to say so here is a container for 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:04.479
 sugars respectively also here 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.699
 used professional coffee grinder 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.639
 which the 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:14.060
 respectively, the streets are so real 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:20.780
 professional coffee beans 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:22.900
 okay equipment so we'll close 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.900
 him 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.440
 so says this machine makes 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.090
 meters eighty thousand pretty 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:47.780
 big by 70 centimeters and 80 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:54.259
 centimeters respectively weight about 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:58.660
 150 pounds so solid that 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.660
 seen immediately not to lose in the crowd 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.860
 actually all
