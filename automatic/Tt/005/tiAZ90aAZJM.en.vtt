this I want to show you it's more like a
real<00:01:54.060> wheel<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:55.259> it'll<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.310> one

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
real wheel see it'll go one

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
real wheel see it'll go one
you<00:01:59.450> see<00:01:59.900> that<00:02:03.790> see<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:05.180> will<00:02:05.390> do<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.600> whole<00:02:05.900> like

you see that see it will do a whole like

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.580 
you see that see it will do a whole like
900<00:02:07.280> rotation<00:02:08.119> instead<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.720> half<00:02:08.960> rotation

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
900 rotation instead of a half rotation

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.140 
900 rotation instead of a half rotation
like<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.800> real<00:02:10.070> car<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:13.100> has<00:02:13.340> these<00:02:13.730> quick

this<00:02:26.060> has<00:02:26.510> force<00:02:26.900> feedback<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.800> like<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.700> China

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
this has force feedback so like in China

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.210 
this has force feedback so like in China
like<00:02:29.690> oh<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.410> can't<00:02:30.500> get<00:02:30.920> around<00:02:31.100> that

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
like oh I can't get around that

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.960 
like oh I can't get around that

stiffness as is you know it's that's it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.050 
stiffness as is you know it's that's it
and<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:42.080> thing<00:02:42.380> it's<00:02:43.190> just<00:02:43.400> kind<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:43.910> on

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.980 
and the thing it's just kind of like on
a<00:02:44.090> bungee<00:02:44.600> cord<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.260> flips<00:02:45.650> around<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.840> I

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
a bungee cord so it flips around and I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.120 
a bungee cord so it flips around and I
see<00:02:48.230> this

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
see this

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:58.110 
see this
you<00:02:49.370> know<00:02:49.930> flimsy<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.610> this<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:54.020> hear<00:02:54.380> this

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.449 

there's<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.240> motor<00:02:59.630> so<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.620> there<00:03:01.190> and

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
there's a motor so like in there and

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.090 
there's a motor so like in there and
they<00:03:01.610> would<00:03:01.730> also<00:03:01.910> resent<00:03:02.720> her

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
they would also resent her

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.340 
they would also resent her
so<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.640> servo<00:03:05.180> rule<00:03:05.540> would<00:03:05.690> remember<00:03:06.080> the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
so the servo rule would remember the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.320 
so the servo rule would remember the
center<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:06.950> you'd<00:03:07.130> be<00:03:07.250> turning<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.180> would

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
center so you'd be turning and it would

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.300 
center so you'd be turning and it would
go<00:03:08.800> like<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:10.040> automatically<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.150> recenter

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
go like that automatically and recenter

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.960 
go like that automatically and recenter
it<00:03:13.310> was<00:03:13.459> pretty<00:03:13.730> awesome<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.780> miss<00:03:15.140> it

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
it was pretty awesome I miss it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.890 
it was pretty awesome I miss it
now<00:03:17.560> another<00:03:18.560> thing<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.489> cords<00:03:23.239> are<00:03:23.690> a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
now another thing is is the cords are a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.560 
now another thing is is the cords are a
little<00:03:24.769> bit<00:03:24.920> stiffer<00:03:25.370> which<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.940> maybe<00:03:26.209> good

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
little bit stiffer which is maybe good

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.199 
little bit stiffer which is maybe good
but<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.170> cord<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.830> a<00:03:27.860> little<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.820> foot

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
but the cord is a little like a foot

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.470 
but the cord is a little like a foot
shorter<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.530> it's<00:03:30.680> pretty<00:03:30.950> stretched<00:03:31.459> out<00:03:31.790> and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
shorter so it's pretty stretched out and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.840 
shorter so it's pretty stretched out and
this<00:03:33.019> being<00:03:33.440> shorter<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:33.920> guess<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.550> good

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
this being shorter I guess is good

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.120 
this being shorter I guess is good
because<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:35.570> only<00:03:35.810> goes<00:03:36.140> down<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.709> air<00:03:36.890> could

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
because it only goes down that air could

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:46.660 
because it only goes down that air could
be<00:03:37.190> even<00:03:37.640> shorter<00:03:40.480> anyway<00:03:41.510> oh<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:45.650> one<00:03:46.310> quick

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
be even shorter anyway oh and one quick

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.420 
be even shorter anyway oh and one quick
thing<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.330> want<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.230> show<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.500> how<00:03:48.769> to<00:03:48.799> set<00:03:49.250> this

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
thing I want to show you how to set this

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.210 
thing I want to show you how to set this
up<00:03:50.049> I'll<00:03:51.049> probably<00:03:51.290> have<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.530> edit<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:52.160> a

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
up I'll probably have to edit this a

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.330 
up I'll probably have to edit this a
little<00:03:52.459> bit<00:03:52.640> but<00:03:52.880> what<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.209> do<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.510> on

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
little bit but what you do is this is on

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:07.490 
little bit but what you do is this is on
how<00:03:58.340> can<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.700> do<00:03:58.760> this<00:03:59.120> one-handed

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.670 

Jericho<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.530> think<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.220> yes<00:04:09.970> see<00:04:10.210> there<00:04:11.200> there's

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
Jericho I think it yes see there there's

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.509 
Jericho I think it yes see there there's
low-medium<00:04:16.079> no<00:04:17.079> low<00:04:18.420> medium<00:04:19.420> high<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:21.130> orange

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
low-medium no low medium high the orange

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.300 
low-medium no low medium high the orange
looks<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:22.030> same<00:04:22.270> in<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.630> camera<00:04:23.110> but<00:04:23.920> this<00:04:24.100> is

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
looks the same in the camera but this is

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.020 
looks the same in the camera but this is
a<00:04:24.340> high<00:04:24.700> setting<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.570> Red's<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.680> lowest<00:04:27.130> but

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
a high setting and Red's the lowest but

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.600 
a high setting and Red's the lowest but
what<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.300> gotta<00:04:28.630> do<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:29.440> you<00:04:30.220> got<00:04:30.430> these

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
what you gotta do is you got these

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.460 
what you gotta do is you got these
shifters<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.330> gotta<00:04:31.540> make<00:04:31.780> sure<00:04:31.960> this<00:04:32.230> is

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
shifters you gotta make sure this is

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.640 
shifters you gotta make sure this is
down<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.160> didn't<00:04:34.230> simultaneously<00:04:35.230> you<00:04:35.410> hit

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
down and didn't simultaneously you hit

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.370 
down and didn't simultaneously you hit
any<00:04:35.950> direction<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:37.480> doesn't<00:04:37.690> matter<00:04:37.900> up-down

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
any direction it doesn't matter up-down

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.530 
any direction it doesn't matter up-down
enough<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.830> write<00:04:38.980> whatever<00:04:39.520> any<00:04:39.940> direction

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
enough to write whatever any direction

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.620 
enough to write whatever any direction
is<00:04:40.960> good

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
is good

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.980 
is good
okay<00:04:43.630> now<00:04:44.410> this<00:04:44.940> Gran<00:04:45.940> Turismo<00:04:46.300> doesn't

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
okay now this Gran Turismo doesn't

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.400 
okay now this Gran Turismo doesn't
really<00:04:47.110> support<00:04:47.470> this<00:04:48.040> wheel<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:49.419> there's<00:04:50.350> a

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
really support this wheel and there's a

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.590 
really support this wheel and there's a
frost<00:04:50.800> master<00:04:51.340> on<00:04:51.520> here<00:04:51.820> with<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.330> five

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
frost master on here with the five

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.380 
frost master on here with the five
hundred<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.560> said<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.950> eighty<00:04:54.190> so<00:04:55.030> you<00:04:55.090> have

hundred and said the eighty so you have

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.810 
hundred and said the eighty so you have
to<00:04:55.510> use<00:04:55.780> your<00:04:56.050> wireless<00:04:56.620> controller<00:04:57.130> settings

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
to use your wireless controller settings

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.470 
to use your wireless controller settings
so<00:04:58.590> here's<00:05:00.060> l2<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.480> that's<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:02.020> brake<00:05:02.320> pedal

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
so here's l2 and that's the brake pedal

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:13.920 
so here's l2 and that's the brake pedal
and<00:05:04.950> then<00:05:07.169> r2<00:05:08.169> is<00:05:09.240> accelerate<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:13.210> then<00:05:13.479> I<00:05:13.600> use

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
and then r2 is accelerate and then I use

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.800 
and then r2 is accelerate and then I use
this<00:05:14.860> for<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.430> e<00:05:15.460> brake<00:05:15.910> because<00:05:16.330> it's<00:05:16.540> kind

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
this for the e brake because it's kind

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.560 
this for the e brake because it's kind
of<00:05:16.900> awkward<00:05:17.530> when<00:05:17.860> you're<00:05:18.070> turning<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:19.030> then

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
of awkward when you're turning and then
