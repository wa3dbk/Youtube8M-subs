00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.029
 Hey people a rendezvous for the time traveler's wife 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.970
 a romantic Armani 2 1 fiction elements from the year 2009 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.710
 but also the VDS the husband 2007 decided 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.890
 Directed by Robert Schmidt thinks 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.989
 because of her all definable flightplan or Ernie knows the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.770
 the RSK is 12 each 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.080
 "We can all see, therefore, the GfK bottles are available 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.810
 why and does he have a term of 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.530
 Animal carcasses you pay attention 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.799
 the movie is about a stay 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.690
 played by Henry Berndt 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 which year through a genetic defect since early childhood 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.340
 Time leaps then makes that he can not control 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.530
 why yes 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.830
 He then travels both in the past and in the future 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.790
 And then I have to stop there for a while, he is conspicuous again 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.590
 back in his since 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770
 the Rhine is 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.420
 yes and around 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.650
 Cell phone while giving 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.490
 Recognize KrÃ¶ll 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.540
 exists and which is not serious 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.990
 and the two fall in love and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.870
 yes it's just about the looks together want to lead a relationship 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.869
 though life is like that 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.780
 the have so uncertain is the receipt time and again leaps in time 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.730
 the most impossible 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.510
 second full four hits adversely control when he travels in time 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.820
 and for how long 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.830
 and still try the stops 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.830
 Aachen somehow to master life 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.660
 Is that really true? 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.580
 Poor in this way 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.580
 The two worked together to imagine that you learn their own 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.569
 call the ideas lack sports 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.870
 Year and he now thinks that the movie as usual only sun oil of the Love Story 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.309
 he is close to falling in love with and 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.069
 because of the end 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.369
 happy 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:24.999
 he was wrong, it's not just a love story 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.969
 but in the movie come too 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.149
 many much Heinz Thieke fast people before 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.529
 of course, you can not put the time series on your own 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.799
 a shoot with the correctness of time travel and and 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.799
 if you get involved then the movie is really good 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:49.250
 and not just for which they love to watch romantic movies 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.169
 because that's not all 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:55.249
 You also see a lot of time jumps and what happens in the process and I think so 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:03:00.259
 really interesting for anyone looking at his skis and time travel 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.849
 at the knee are missing some time traveling France Fiction and Mainz SID 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:10.689
 simply terrific already alone the beginning scene of the missing first 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.899
 the beginning of their 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:18.999
 In it one sees Handy Arend as a child as a-ha his first time jump 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:21.809
 he lives 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:23.849
 in a dramatic way 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.819
 and also the analyst pretty much 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:27.990
 h good 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.969
 the idea is 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.630
 Arn I like the movie "Viking" they are best not only fun 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.789
 women 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.249
 I am nothing 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.089
 thoughtlessly 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.709
 I must say 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.069
 So I'm doing it 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.069
 I think that's not typical women 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.689
 and pretty much 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.689
 Year quite surprising in some places I think 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:58.029
 he is based on yes 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.309
 around 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.579
 hug because of the same name 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.579
 if I was already better 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.549
 yes I do not have the book I can not say anything now 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.449
 to what extent the 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.379
 Novel template 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.769
 was implemented well in the wide world 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.090
 I can only say that the film is important Schultes 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.400
 jumping all the time so close up stories with time travel and and and 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.550
 with pleasure 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.219
 and that needs a lease in this regard 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.219
 Steiner 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:35.770
 but not too intrusive 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.389
 I agree 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.199
 but one sees in four years his life tries mostly with Dr 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.800
 with this genetic defect 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.159
 and how they all try to build a life together 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.509
 and you can do that too or not you have to do it in the movie 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.639
 then when you see the movie 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.819
 see for yourself 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.819
 for not very good movie now the DVD itself 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.979
 not many 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.979
 spam most beautiful Mohr 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.509
 an indescribable love no idea what he is I just did not have 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:14.270
 seen 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.270
 and the cinema trailer not more 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:24.129
 Oh maybe what's funny to know is that even Stephen Spielberg and 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.879
 Dewert 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.589
 Fincher interest 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:28.960
 We preferred to watch the movie 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.800
 then lead it was the native Stuttgart Robert Schwentke 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.409
 why I do not know now 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.409
 In any case, the two also had interest in the movie next to it 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.749
 I think that's a very good movie 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:48.409
 really good and I got it when I looked at it 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.080
 on the White already gorgeous enthusiastic about the movie 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.659
 I can do that 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.279
 at the time no longer 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.629
 I think it's very good 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.770
 and percent I looked at it again three days later 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.219
 because I just remember exactly 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:10.219
 everything we wanted to see 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.699
 both in the security wanted to look at times 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.770
 Here are two men dating 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.499
 whom you also Schulze in many places 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.499
 not only 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.469
 someone who may not be as up to now as i can i do things 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:30.639
 anyway, have a look 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.389
 the light alarm clock 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.559
 how it is or how bad it is for somebody 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:38.559
 I connect I found that is not the type for it now 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:44.159
 the concession on the 8th 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.240
 it is in a drama 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.850
 with his victory in the race 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.059
 that fits 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.270
 I have to stop again and again I think that fits 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.119
 not really together 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.199
 a love drama with science fiction elements 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.199
 there one stands on it but since one can actually still hard 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:06.839
 but I think that fits 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.689
 yes its ever betrayed around 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:13.139
 around 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.139
 I've never seen this meeting before 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.800
 and that's why it's really good 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.490
 it is not recommended he has the best 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.189
 Lehmann 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:25.419
 at all 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.770
 but it is a really good movie 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.149
 I agree 

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.680
 yes, now I have those still 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.689
 how difficult office 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.689
 I think I've said everything so far 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.909
 otherwise there is nothing interesting to say 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:44.370
 OM Dr we can see you there 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.520
 or if you can 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.469
 Kant and has seen how much money remained 

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:50.360
 3000 children 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.060
 say thank you and see you next time
