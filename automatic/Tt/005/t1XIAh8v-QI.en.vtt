had and the fans the fact that fans

had and the fans the fact that fans
could<00:01:04.619> control<00:01:05.129> whatever<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:06.150> saw<00:01:06.450> using

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
could control whatever they saw using
their<00:01:07.290> own<00:01:07.320> cell<00:01:07.920> phones<00:01:08.159> okay<00:01:08.520> less<00:01:08.700> yes<00:01:08.939> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
their own cell phones okay less yes so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670 
their own cell phones okay less yes so
the<00:01:09.119> concept<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.990> you're<00:01:10.170> sitting<00:01:10.530> there

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the concept here is you're sitting there

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
the concept here is you're sitting there
watching<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.280> game<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.090> actions<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.780> at

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
watching the game and the actions all at

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.480 
watching the game and the actions all at
the<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.140> end<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> arena<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the other end of the arena right and I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
the other end of the arena right and I
can<00:01:14.729> barely<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.390> Jumbotron<00:01:15.990> Franklin

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
can barely see that Jumbotron Franklin

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.560 
can barely see that Jumbotron Franklin
and<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:17.970> how<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.360> really

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and so what do you do how do you really

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.910 
and so what do you do how do you really
get<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> middle<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> game<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
get in the middle of the game this is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.740 
get in the middle of the game this is
part<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> solution<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> take

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
part of the solution right so you take

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
part of the solution right so you take
your<00:01:21.900> Wi-Fi<00:01:22.259> cell<00:01:22.500> phone<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.580> have

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
send out a replay to you from all the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.100 
send out a replay to you from all the
different<00:01:44.850> angles<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> just

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
different angles so you can see it just

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.960 
different angles so you can see it just
as<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.100> seen<00:01:47.369> from<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
as you would have seen from all the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.999 
as you would have seen from all the
different<00:01:48.240> angles<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> arena<00:01:49.020> plus<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
different angles in the arena plus the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
different angles in the arena plus the
best<00:01:50.159> part<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.000> do<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:51.390> own<00:01:51.450> rewinds

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
best part is you can do your own rewinds

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
best part is you can do your own rewinds
so<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.100> TiVo<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:53.909> cell

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
so think it's like TiVo on your cell

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.539 
so think it's like TiVo on your cell
phone<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.990> rewind<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.710> see<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.219> replay

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
phone you can rewind and see a replay

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.850 
phone you can rewind and see a replay
just<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.420> would<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.600> liked

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
just as you would have liked

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.959 
just as you would have liked
unbelievable<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.219> don't<00:01:59.549> miss<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.909> I

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
unbelievable so you don't miss out I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.370 
unbelievable so you don't miss out I
mean<00:02:00.210> sometimes<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.600> saw<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.110> think<00:02:01.320> to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
mean sometimes you saw you think to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.959 
mean sometimes you saw you think to
yourself<00:02:01.439> well<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.799> could<00:02:02.009> I'd<00:02:02.369> rather<00:02:02.579> almost

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
yourself well I could I'd rather almost

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.580 
yourself well I could I'd rather almost
be<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.210> home<00:02:03.390> because<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.990> see<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.320> this

as well right and one of the reasons

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740 
as well right and one of the reasons
that<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.009> built<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.429> was<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.239> when<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.509> go

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that I built this was you know when I go

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.540 
that I built this was you know when I go
to<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.989> arena<00:02:10.200> when<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> go<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> games<00:02:11.220> you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
to the arena when I go to games you

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.770 
to the arena when I go to games you
always<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.180> know<00:02:12.239> there<00:02:12.629> are<00:02:12.660> people

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
always think you know there are people

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.610 
always think you know there are people
in<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.110> nosebleeds

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
in the nosebleeds

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.839 
in the nosebleeds
so<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.069> are<00:02:14.099> people<00:02:14.370> who<00:02:14.459> always<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
so there are people who always going to

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.460 
so there are people who always going to
be<00:02:14.909> taller<00:02:15.209> than<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.599> stand<00:02:15.930> up<00:02:16.019> in<00:02:16.140> front<00:02:16.170> of

that I'll put gadgets inside the
football<00:03:49.470> yes<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.069> we<00:03:50.190> built<00:03:50.310> smart<00:03:50.609> football

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
football yes so we built smart football

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.970 
football yes so we built smart football
so<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.239> put<00:03:51.419> a<00:03:51.449> little<00:03:51.750> chip<00:03:52.019> inside<00:03:52.799> the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
so we put a little chip inside the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.650 
so we put a little chip inside the
football<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:53.669> football<00:03:54.180> tells<00:03:54.449> you

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
football and the football tells you

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.930 
football and the football tells you
where<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.109> landed<00:03:55.500> even<00:03:56.370> if<00:03:56.489> there's<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.730> whole

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.059 
where it landed even if there's a whole
pile<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.329> players<00:03:57.569> on<00:03:57.810> top<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.199> it<00:03:58.319> so<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:58.829> can

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
pile of players on top of it so you can

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.830 
pile of players on top of it so you can
tell<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.310> game-changing<00:04:00.239> difference<00:04:00.569> so

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
so my dream would be to be on the

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:13.879 
so my dream would be to be on the
sidelines<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.079> a<00:04:13.169> Super<00:04:13.440> Bowl<00:04:13.470> when<00:04:13.769> it's

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
sidelines of a Super Bowl when it's

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.740 
sidelines of a Super Bowl when it's
being<00:04:14.040> kissed<00:04:14.280> yeah<00:04:14.699> it's<00:04:15.299> really<00:04:15.569> so

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
being kissed yeah it's really so

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.509 
being kissed yeah it's really so
something<00:04:15.989> you've<00:04:16.079> got<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.199> blast<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:17.190> being

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
something you've got a blast just being

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.610 
something you've got a blast just being
here<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.910> doing<00:04:18.599> this<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.169> having<00:04:19.560> the

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
here and doing this and having the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.199 
here and doing this and having the
opportunity<00:04:19.889> I<00:04:20.280> guess<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.699> get<00:04:20.849> a<00:04:20.880> team<00:04:21.090> like

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
opportunity I guess to get a team like

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.000 
opportunity I guess to get a team like
the<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.930> Penguins<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.349> open<00:04:22.590> their<00:04:22.710> doors<00:04:22.919> to

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
the the Penguins to open their doors to

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.070 
the the Penguins to open their doors to
this<00:04:23.219> seems<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.580> be<00:04:23.610> unusual<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:24.599> a<00:04:24.750> it's<00:04:24.780> a

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
this seems to be unusual it's a it's a
