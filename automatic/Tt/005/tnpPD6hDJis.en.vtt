00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.500
 how to find a hacker to have no way 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:20.570
 give you here list of advanced games 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.170
 and technical team 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.910
 is the first step and the jaqueses play 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.789
 a confirmed and good low domain 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.030
 let's hope we do not put a game if not 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:38.110
 they will not go out, although the game 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.860
 Well, it stands out that this may be 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.580
 touched domain in skirt 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.580
 and good 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.660
 good 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.660
 There is a migration left in progress 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.690
 well then we give it to look again not 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.769
 nothing happens and good 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.400
 now to see if our heavy departure 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.530
 we are in that the previous one to explain it 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.490
 how to find a better check now and 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.950
 I was starting this I do not like it that way 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.680
 as as zepa that I'm not heading 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.210
 started the good in the group you can go 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.830
 four because you that the maximum team 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.820
 of the group is 4 and good 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.910
 the game is over a maximum of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.290
 four groups in tactics team good yo 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.020
 I recommend that you pay to go there in 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.590
 maximum group 3 because it better for 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.609
 we are check 1 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:53.890
 good medium it's going to cost you more to find 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:57.460
 the 4 also 2 and 3 2 and 3 in the group is 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.149
 very easy it is very easy and good we are going to 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.719
 see anything to match starting through 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.719
 they always started always started 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.719
 go up 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.410
 h 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.000

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.080
 good and look again good is very 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.590
 difficult to find a hacker I recommend 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.900
 find it in the afternoon from 3 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.510
 until 9:30 and so on 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.700
 connected when check it look right now 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.329
 we are four then moderate to markers 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.480
 of room and good for example I go the 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:54.200
 first of sada markers with total 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.220
 Good points and check 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.220
 for example 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.739
 the hatch our eyes 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.200
 us here because I am the first and 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.780
 I'm because I found a lot of part left 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.040
 that nothing is prestige 11 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.690
 why yes so much prestige and good not 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.310
 nothing happens we left the same there 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.500
 and good 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.670
 we go there all day 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:33.800
 Well, come on, it's a long 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.800
 but it's 343 minus 4 and well 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.710
 Do not put in the same game that is me 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.710
 solid 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.050
 my mother 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.260
 we have eliminated the path of the wicket 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.260
 as you see 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.950
 until he does not want to find a 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.210
 split so that I do not care 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.210
 that for you to understand 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.209
 the other salty markers then 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:20.620
 issuing same limit on the same other 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:23.970
 time but chavez is green 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.970

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.360
 look 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.350

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.740
 practice team the first step second 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.520
 step when people have marked him 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.520

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.639
 I got in it again 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.220
 for me it is something serious 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:21.139
 good what I have done castilla team and 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:23.719

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.539

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:30.019
 that 's it's more than two million and 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:33.919
