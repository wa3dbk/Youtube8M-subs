 hello friends from the soybean corner in the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.279

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.680
 She makes this beautiful sewing and is known 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.500
 with the name of the one of cheto that is very 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.170
 easy to do and it looks really cute 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.869
 good to do this sewing first 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.239
 we have to do the staircase seam or 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.360
 porteÃ±a in the description of the video 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.530
 I leave the link to see how it is done 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.449
 and after we did what we're going to 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.790
 do we are going to add it in the second 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.520
 buttonhole 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.520
 from the side of fat a new time 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.460
 the reason for my ex 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.460
 and let's go left 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.770
 as long as the inclination of the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.680
 sewing of you be 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.970
 equal to mine that goes from right to 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.010
 left if you were inclined 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.610
 upside down instead of going left 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.940
 they have to go out to the right 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.750
 once we did this we started to 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.620
 do the sewing that is very simple 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.100
 hold the tail so you do not 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.100
 go out 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.630
 and we started doing 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.070
 above 1 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.070
 below 1 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.300
 above one and enters the room 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.570
 do and pass next to the hair next to 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.570
 the fat 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:06.990
 now of the fourth we retreated to the third 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.990
 and we go to the left of the seam 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.640
 I explain it to you once more from the side 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.690
 left will happen to the right side 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.920
 doing on one 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.920
 under 1 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.010
 new tone 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.849
 about one and it's going to happen 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.849
 next to the fat 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.900
 on the side of brown fat sewing a buttonhole 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.660
 and it will come out on the left 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.660
 of the seam 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.430
 and here it's going to start again, it's going to be 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.100
 about 1 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.090
 under 1 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.090
 about 1 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.580
 when we reach the end of the seam 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.010
 to top off what we do that is 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.190
 so we're going to take it out inside the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.190
 grease 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.930
 and this time we are going to take it out 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.930
 and we will make it happen again 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.930
 on 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.620
 the other time 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.750
 in this way the auction is more 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.160
 neatly the same thing we do with these 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.380
 we take them out from inside the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.350
 fat and ready there would be finished the 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.630
 sewing of this that is very nice 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.579
 because it gives relief to the seam 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.060
