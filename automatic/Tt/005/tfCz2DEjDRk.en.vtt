need to but if you do then you would

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.510 
need to but if you do then you would

the difference there between when we
finished<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.799> okay<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.829> we've<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.520> run

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
finished with it okay so we've got a run

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.740 
finished with it okay so we've got a run
of<00:01:59.880> around<00:02:00.750> 66<00:02:01.409> kilowatts<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.450> then<00:02:03.450> we've

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
of around 66 kilowatts and then we've

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.959 
of around 66 kilowatts and then we've
