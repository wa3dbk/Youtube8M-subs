00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.100
 welcome to the special the decision 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.649
 everyone is eager to know that 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.320
 decide here to have clicks and where will it end 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.110
 your future in the nba so we started 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.240
 cristian how about how are you okay something 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.640
 nervous the truth is that it is difficult to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.740
 knock down without knowing where it's going to end and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.230
 where will the career in the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.230
 fridge not and you feel to have 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.270
 been on everyone's lips this summer 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.890
 it is complicated to explain why it has been 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.109
 a long summer in which with many 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.900
 called lots of teams with very 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.910
 good deals it has been difficult to take the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.300
 decision but good between so much and so much 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.850
 try to distract me by relaxing training 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.570
 very hard to do the best I can 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.460
 in the coming season 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.450
 independently the equipment on which 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.330
 finish 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.810
 how would you summarize your first year as a rookie 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.810
 in the nba 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.810
 Well, quite positive has been a model 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.200
 quite positive it is true that at the 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.910
 of the team because the truth is that it was noticed 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.750
 who will shamelessly try to make a 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.700
 tanking to be able to aspire to a good 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.909
 draft a good position in the draft of the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.369
 nba this year 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.049
 but man on a personal level the truth 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.880
 which are very good because I have in 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.890
 mind that I started with a contract of 10 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.659
 days with sacrament and in the end I finished 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.719
 doing the full season with 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.520
 them and increases at a personal level 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.229
 for me it's been pretty good because I've 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.349
 managed to consecrate me as a player 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.830
 of the nba and what I hope to follow 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:34.720
 improving what they come 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.240
 There was a time when the press 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.190
 assured that halfway through mid 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.500
 season we are planning the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.840
 next taking for granted for granted 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.360
 that he was going to get out of the kings he has 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.180
 this is true 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.520
 is everything is all lies the truth is that 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.890
 many of the press is going through these 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.590
 topics with the rumors and others in this 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.720
 case then all false I was always 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.550
 try to be as focused as possible 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.200
 with sacrament the truth that you 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.320
 I appreciate very much all the support that I 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.360
 they gave the principle is that it was hard not 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.429
 enter the draft that does not choose me any 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.500
 team then sacrament gave me the option 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.740
 of well done before participating with 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.540
 them with that 10-day contract and you should 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.850
 meet the nba and good at the end you 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.510
 comes with them not and then by areas 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.060
 that I do not form it does not go with my style 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.610
 of life being planning the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.110
 season with another team and leave thrown 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.890
 the sacrament does not go with my style of 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.200
 life and I will see it disrespect 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.080
 so then they are lies 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.880
 in a moment that happened already once 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.920
 the season is over and the 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.739
 summer if it's when I'm already focused as 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.170
 agent and start talking about what offer 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.599
 and on the table and others 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.620
 and what was the main reason why 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:57.640
 you have taken your decision 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.739
 well you have clear that I wanted to leave 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.269
 a team that had aspirations to 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.930
 get championships get things 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.299
 important 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.120
 Well, as I said before, sacrament 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.760
 on a team that was very long term 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.730
 that is, as commented on what they wanted 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.680
 look for finished then the last ones 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.829
 league positions to look for a 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.689
 good draft but I wanted to go 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.750
 directly to a team that had 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.819
 aspirations to win everything and that has 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.810
 been my main reason why I've 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.690
 taken this decision 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.060
 Well, the time has come to respond 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.960
 the question that everyone is 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.990
 cristian what was your decision 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.450
 this fall now how hard to say but 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.790
 but this fall that another slow half to 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.580
 the city of the wind and sign for the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.410
 chicago bulls 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.380
 if everyone 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.670
 because the truth is that he has always 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.290
 been one of my favorite teams since 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.990
 small always has a special aura 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.030
 since Michael Jordan arrived and devastated 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.920
 the nba as hug 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.630
 so then always make a team that 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.000
 has given me a lot in which always 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.450
 It does a dream of finishing 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.040
 chips someday for them and good 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.100
 then I was with them and I 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.690
 they offered a good contract and you see that 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.209
 is a team that wants to 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.640
 get important things and that's why 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.260
 finish saying of chicago bulls 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.300
 in chicago bulls you know that you're going to 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.320
 find derrick rose as oliver 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.880
 team yes the truth is that good 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.440
 coincides that apart from that girl with 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.230
 one of my favorite cities my teams 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.960
 favorites of graus fear one of my 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.140
 preferred the truth is that a player 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.070
 very explosive an athlete who will see 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.690
 What are my bad luck with injuries? 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.550
 but now you see that it is already 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.220
 recovery for a hundred and I'm glad for 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.910
 it and you go to a place not being able to 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.250
 be with him on the track 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.760
 and also what will you decide with pau gasol and 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.280
 mirotic 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.600
 the truth is that he can not play with one 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.630
 of the best Spanish in history 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.850
 of the nba and good player like mirotic 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.010
 how good that is starting now 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.990
 and that he has that another one I'm going to prove his 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.480
 talent the truth is that I would like 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.580
 so much to be with them also on track and 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.530
 be able to help as much as possible to search 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.020
 the rings and the championships with 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.850
 chicago bulls as he would explain his 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.090
 decision 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.630
 to your fan of good sacrament the truth 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.040
 it's complicated 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.500
 I know they are very loyal fans that 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.260
 When I joined them they saw everything 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.600
 they really supported me the truth 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.370
 is that at all times both networks 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.440
 socially as personally before the 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.480
 parties has always shown its support 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.580
 since having the 10 day contract 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.440
 they started with me and something that is appreciated 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.180
 very much the truth is that it is difficult 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.040
 have made this decision and it hurts 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.480
 for that reason but always the fanes 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.410
 sacraments are going to have a very place 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.690

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.879
