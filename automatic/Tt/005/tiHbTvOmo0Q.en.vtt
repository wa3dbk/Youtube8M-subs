00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.490
 public that they will not handle anyone who 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.439
 let's use in single player voucher 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.570
 only to people who do not use 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.839
 in the online mode for now you know 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.220
 that the scratch fire that would be the pencil 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.780
 of mods that we use for 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.119
 all those that I am teaching you of gta 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.500
 5 is an app and that in online mode 

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:46.629
 it works what makes you crochet the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.250
 game when you go to enter the online 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.080
 with this app and therefore to be able 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.760
 play online would have to remove it 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.830
 etcetera etcetera etcetera is worth so that 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.059
 do not know how to install it, you know that 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.280
 decision I always leave a tutorial of 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.559
 how to install gta mods 5 I did it at 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.360
 beginning together with the internal trailer 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.939
 that also comes that brings a lot of 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.040
 things and good because the mode consists of 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.900
 mold today consists of a gun that 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.549
 throw cars you're going to see that it's a 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.560
 passed to be able to make it work 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.630
 first we will have to give it to f 11 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.550
 value moment and remove this hurts us at 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.370
 f 11 and as you see in the top 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.620
 left put vehicle 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.840
 activate good now you will see it we are going to 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.760
 less around here and I'll think about shooting 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.730
 with any gun or with any 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.700
 granada with anything that I fired at 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.060
 you're worth it guys so we chop 1 2 and 3 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.070
 we prick vale cha is you shoot and it goes out that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.510
 a car comes out and totally mistaking cree 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.000
 what to see is look at a police car in 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.380
 the released and we're all going to cheer up kiko 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.140
 butt is to be cast here 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.870
 all you see what pretty guy what else 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.550
 chula besides not in this case when 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.290
 we are in a vehicle yes that is a bit 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.510
 complicated because we go totally straight 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.220
 Regarding where the vehicle looks without 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.450
 However, we are looking in the form of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.860
 first person let's shoot 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.600
 exactly where we are 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.970
 looking at first to see see 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.620
 I'm going to go back up ok of 125 that I take 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.350
 I'm going to save the motorcycle because 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.750
 I want to lose I'm going to put it here and 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.770
 I'm going to use the trick 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.570
 comes the police and everything but good 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.340
 we have also suffered from it once 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.990
 so let's shoot the cars a 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.470
 some speed however if we go back 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.170
 to give to lepe 11 we will put on the track 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.599
 fast cars so look what 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.200
 look how we launch get look what 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.730
 most amazing thing is great them 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.349
 I wanted to love I love strange cars 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:43.440
 like to destroy everything good 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:45.600
 Clear care we no longer kill those who 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.370
 really good the things we can 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.450
 shoot are totally random with 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.970
 surely you have already noticed 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.030
 ok when we give it many times good 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.000
 and right now he just finished his carpi ok 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.730
 and we can do it with it ready or me 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.590
 what do I know with let's say a submachine gun or what 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.720
 be directly look we 're going 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.170
 firing we are launching 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.170
 cars and it's a real pass that is 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.030
 an authentic past how handsome the bad 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.709
 we can not throw them up if 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.290
 we have a helicopter for example as 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.150
 you see the cars do not go up but 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.549
 that remain on land is impossible 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.690
 throwing it up is a shame the 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.190
 true but good you can not get to 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.330
 to assert a momentum that I'm going to 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.590
