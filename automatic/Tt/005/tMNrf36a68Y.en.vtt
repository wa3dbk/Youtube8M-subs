and<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.410> said<00:00:37.530> gold<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> zillion

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
and I just said gold like a zillion

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970 
and I just said gold like a zillion
times<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.270> inside<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.020> packaging<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.559> nothing

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
times so inside the packaging is nothing

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
times so inside the packaging is nothing
other<00:00:41.129> than<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> case<00:00:41.640> itself<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
other than the case itself and a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.319 
other than the case itself and a
certificate<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.680> authenticity<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
certificate of authenticity so here is

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.790 
certificate of authenticity so here is
the<00:00:45.450> case<00:00:45.690> I'm<00:00:45.960> sure<00:00:46.170> you're<00:00:46.379> familiar<00:00:46.410> with

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
look since this is it this is a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
look since this is it this is a
traditional<00:01:19.770> snap<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.460> style<00:01:20.670> case
