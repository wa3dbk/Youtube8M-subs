day

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.529 

you<00:00:15.679> can<00:00:15.860> design<00:00:16.039> a<00:00:16.250> house<00:00:16.670> that<00:00:17.119> doesn't<00:00:17.360> have

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
you can design a house that doesn't have

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.470 
you can design a house that doesn't have
to<00:00:18.050> look<00:00:18.320> like<00:00:18.830> a<00:00:19.279> machine<00:00:19.939> for<00:00:20.180> energy

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
to look like a machine for energy

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.089 
to look like a machine for energy
efficiency<00:00:20.900> and<00:00:21.170> I'm<00:00:21.230> not<00:00:21.380> going<00:00:21.770> to<00:00:21.830> imply

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
efficiency and I'm not going to imply

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.380 
efficiency and I'm not going to imply
that<00:00:22.130> this<00:00:22.400> is<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:22.669> first<00:00:22.849> house<00:00:23.060> that's

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
that this is the first house that's

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.480 
that this is the first house that's
energy<00:00:23.990> efficient<00:00:24.740> that<00:00:24.919> doesn't<00:00:25.220> you<00:00:25.430> know

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
energy efficient that doesn't you know

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.600 
energy efficient that doesn't you know
look<00:00:25.789> like<00:00:25.970> a<00:00:26.590> German<00:00:27.590> box<00:00:27.919> or<00:00:28.189> something<00:00:28.369> like

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
look like a German box or something like

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.759 
look like a German box or something like
that<00:00:28.669> it<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:30.019> know<00:00:30.050> lots<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.439> people<00:00:30.560> have

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
that it you know lots of people have

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.049 
that it you know lots of people have
done<00:00:30.920> it<00:00:31.099> but<00:00:31.250> I<00:00:31.310> think<00:00:31.400> you<00:00:31.640> look<00:00:31.820> at<00:00:31.939> this

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
done it but I think you look at this

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.229 
done it but I think you look at this
house<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:32.629> your<00:00:33.320> first<00:00:34.030> instinct<00:00:35.030> upon

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
house and your first instinct upon

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.640 
house and your first instinct upon
walking<00:00:35.660> into<00:00:35.809> it<00:00:35.900> or<00:00:36.110> seen<00:00:36.290> it<00:00:36.320> from<00:00:36.500> the

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
walking into it or seen it from the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.470 
walking into it or seen it from the
street<00:00:36.860> was<00:00:37.100> that's<00:00:37.370> that's<00:00:38.150> a<00:00:38.300> nice-looking

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
street was that's that's a nice-looking

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.760 
street was that's that's a nice-looking
house

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.980 

I<00:00:46.920> would<00:00:47.370> describe<00:00:47.580> it<00:00:47.880> as<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.510> farmhouse

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
I would describe it as a farmhouse

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.290 
I would describe it as a farmhouse
appearance<00:00:49.560> what<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.460> tried<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.880> do<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.150> sort

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
appearance what we tried to do is sort

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.260 
appearance what we tried to do is sort
of<00:00:51.390> tweak<00:00:52.040> that<00:00:53.040> imagery<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.970> know<00:00:54.060> it's<00:00:54.150> not

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
of tweak that imagery you know it's not

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
of tweak that imagery you know it's not
a<00:00:54.300> literal<00:00:54.630> farmhouse<00:00:55.320> we've<00:00:55.620> been<00:00:55.800> we've

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
a literal farmhouse we've been we've

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.010 
a literal farmhouse we've been we've
exaggerated<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> scale<00:00:57.540> of<00:00:57.750> certain

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
exaggerated the scale of certain

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.420 
exaggerated the scale of certain
elements<00:00:58.110> like<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:58.680> large<00:00:58.860> Foursquare

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
elements like the large Foursquare

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.340 
elements like the large Foursquare
window<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> stair<00:01:00.239> tower<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.900> then

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
window and the stair tower and then

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
window and the stair tower and then
obviously<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.920> open<00:01:02.160> plan<00:01:02.400> a<00:01:02.430> traditional

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
obviously the open plan a traditional

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.520 
obviously the open plan a traditional
farmhouse<00:01:03.300> certainly<00:01:03.840> wouldn't<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.290> an

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
farmhouse certainly wouldn't have an

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.610 
farmhouse certainly wouldn't have an
open<00:01:04.800> plan<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> vaulted<00:01:05.700> ceiling<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.270> just

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
open plan and a vaulted ceiling it just

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.980 
open plan and a vaulted ceiling it just
wasn't<00:01:07.620> something<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.010> farmers<00:01:08.850> did<00:01:09.090> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
wasn't something that farmers did it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.850 
wasn't something that farmers did it
wouldn't<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.290> wouldn't<00:01:10.380> spend<00:01:10.620> a<00:01:10.710> lot<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
wouldn't they wouldn't spend a lot of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010 
wouldn't they wouldn't spend a lot of
money<00:01:11.010> vaulting<00:01:11.430> ceilings<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.900> know

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
money vaulting ceilings so you know

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.140 
money vaulting ceilings so you know
there's<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.800> a<00:01:13.950> modern<00:01:14.310> tweak<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> idea

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
there's it's a modern tweak on the idea

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:27.370 
there's it's a modern tweak on the idea
of<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.300> farmhouse

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.580 

it<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:29.369> important<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.299> us<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it was really important to us not to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.219 
it was really important to us not to
have<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.979> look<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.060> passive<00:01:33.810> house<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
have this look like a passive house you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.840 
have this look like a passive house you
know<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.439> wanted<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.830> design<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> building<00:01:35.399> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
know we wanted to design a building that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.460 
know we wanted to design a building that
the<00:01:36.000> client's<00:01:36.330> needs<00:01:36.360> met<00:01:36.869> their<00:01:37.080> their

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the client's needs met their their

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
the client's needs met their their
desires<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:37.979> how<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> house<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:38.759> look<00:01:38.790> was

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
desires for how the house would look was

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.480 
desires for how the house would look was
appropriate<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> site<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.920> appropriate

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
appropriate for the site was appropriate

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.430 
appropriate for the site was appropriate
for<00:01:41.520> Carmel<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.330> respectful<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.229> its

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
for Carmel and was respectful of its

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.570 
for Carmel and was respectful of its
neighbors<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.390> we<00:01:45.390> did<00:01:45.690> that<00:01:45.960> before<00:01:46.799> we

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
neighbors and we did that before we

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.820 
neighbors and we did that before we
really<00:01:48.180> got<00:01:48.360> into<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> energy<00:01:49.080> modeling<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
really got into the energy modeling and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.219 
really got into the energy modeling and
making<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.060> passive<00:01:51.570> house<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.899> wanted<00:01:52.140> to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
making it a passive house we wanted to

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.990 
making it a passive house we wanted to
make<00:01:52.350> sure<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.710> had<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.890> right<00:01:53.070> house<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
make sure we had the right house for the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
make sure we had the right house for the
site<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.539> then<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.409> overlaid<00:01:55.920> some<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.280> those

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
site and then we overlaid some of those

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.950 
site and then we overlaid some of those
passive<00:01:56.850> house<00:01:56.970> requirements<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> think<00:01:57.689> that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
passive house requirements I think that

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.120 
passive house requirements I think that
you<00:01:58.080> need<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.319> take<00:01:58.470> away<00:01:58.649> from<00:01:58.830> this<00:01:58.920> house

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you need to take away from this house

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.980 
you need to take away from this house
the<00:01:59.369> fact<00:01:59.580> that<00:01:59.729> it's<00:02:00.179> appropriate<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> that

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the fact that it's appropriate and that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.690 
the fact that it's appropriate and that
you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.179> build<00:02:03.179> in<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.569> manner<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.700> achieve

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
you can build in this manner and achieve

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.309 
you can build in this manner and achieve
a<00:02:05.729> pretty<00:02:06.060> high<00:02:06.210> level<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.630> energy<00:02:06.929> efficiency

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
a pretty high level of energy efficiency

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.150 
a pretty high level of energy efficiency
as<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.830> here

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160
