the landscape now shifting with the NFL
everything<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.500> does<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.100> change<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
everything going on does that change the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.520 
everything going on does that change the
way<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.810> players<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
way you are with players with the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.780 
way you are with players with the
importance<00:01:28.950> being<00:01:29.130> stressed<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.579> off<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
importance being stressed on off the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.580 
importance being stressed on off the
field<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.450> much<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> field

right now I think that is tough to to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
right now I think that is tough to to
coach<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.400> player<00:01:35.430> effectively<00:01:36.299> not<00:01:36.600> coaching
