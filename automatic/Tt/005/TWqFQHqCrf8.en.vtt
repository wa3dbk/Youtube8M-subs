00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.340 
it into the wall charger somewhere at a
distance<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.600> keep<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.899> charged<00:01:52.200> up

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.130 

believe<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.010> speed<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.640> i'm<00:03:08.300> using<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.720> cdma

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
believe the speed in i'm using a cdma

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.510 
believe the speed in i'm using a cdma
version<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.530> touch<00:03:09.680> pro2<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.220> believe<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
version of touch pro2 so I believe the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.550 
version of touch pro2 so I believe the
speed<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.850> about<00:03:10.970> roughly<00:03:11.750> around<00:03:11.840> 2.4

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
speed is about roughly around 2.4

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.300 
speed is about roughly around 2.4
megabits<00:03:13.250> or<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:14.710> that's<00:03:15.710> about<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.010> 3g

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
megabits or so so that's about the 3g

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.830 
megabits or so so that's about the 3g
speed<00:03:16.550> i<00:03:16.580> believe<00:03:16.910> on<00:03:17.150> verizon<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.600> might<00:03:17.690> be<00:03:17.810> a

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
speed i believe on verizon it might be a

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.410 
speed i believe on verizon it might be a
little<00:03:17.960> faster<00:03:18.380> now<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:18.980> i<00:03:19.520> think<00:03:20.180> it's

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
little faster now but i think it's
