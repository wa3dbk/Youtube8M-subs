00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.100 
we've seen some progress on some fronts
but<00:02:57.160> this<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.430> where<00:02:58.700> sometimes<00:02:59.300> traditions

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
but this is where sometimes traditions

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.050 
but this is where sometimes traditions
can<00:03:01.010> get<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.460> way<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:04.280> as<00:03:04.640> many<00:03:04.940> of

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
can get in the way and and as many of

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.960 
can get in the way and and as many of
you<00:03:05.150> know<00:03:05.270> my<00:03:05.450> father<00:03:05.480> was<00:03:05.900> from<00:03:06.050> Kenya<00:03:06.230> and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.010 

that's<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.150> Kenyan<00:03:11.540> contingent<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:13.750> but<00:03:14.750> but

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
that's the Kenyan contingent but but but

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.860 
that's the Kenyan contingent but but but
I<00:03:15.080> think<00:03:15.410> what<00:03:15.560> applies<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:16.100> Kenya<00:03:16.400> is<00:03:16.520> true

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
I think what applies to Kenya is true

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.110 
I think what applies to Kenya is true
and<00:03:17.870> applies<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.590> many<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.730> countries<00:03:20.090> in

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
and applies to many of the countries in

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.000 
and applies to many of the countries in
Africa<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.260> not<00:03:21.410> unique<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.920> Africa

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
Africa and this is not unique to Africa

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.080 
Africa and this is not unique to Africa
we<00:03:22.400> see<00:03:22.580> this<00:03:22.730> in<00:03:22.880> other<00:03:23.000> parts<00:03:23.300> of<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.480> world

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.570 

some<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.270> old<00:03:29.450> ways<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:30.170> gender<00:03:31.070> relations

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
some of the old ways of gender relations

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.100 
some of the old ways of gender relations
might<00:03:32.030> have<00:03:32.209> made<00:03:32.390> sense<00:03:33.610> in<00:03:34.610> a<00:03:35.480> particular

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
might have made sense in a particular

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.460 
might have made sense in a particular
setting<00:03:37.030> right<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:38.209> in<00:03:38.330> Kenya<00:03:38.630> for<00:03:38.660> example<00:03:38.870> if

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
setting right so in Kenya for example if

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.729 
setting right so in Kenya for example if
you<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.360> Luo<00:03:41.510> tribe<00:03:42.040> polygamy<00:03:43.040> existed<00:03:44.739> it

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
you in the Luo tribe polygamy existed it

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.650 
you in the Luo tribe polygamy existed it
was<00:03:45.890> based<00:03:46.130> on<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.610> idea<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:46.970> women<00:03:47.330> had

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
was based on the idea that women had

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.020 
was based on the idea that women had
their<00:03:47.870> own<00:03:48.020> compounds<00:03:48.800> they<00:03:49.310> had<00:03:49.489> their<00:03:50.000> own

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
their own compounds they had their own

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.199 
their own compounds they had their own
land<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:52.160> they<00:03:52.550> were<00:03:52.810> empowered<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:54.170> that

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
land and so they were empowered in that

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.160 
land and so they were empowered in that
area<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:57.410> be<00:03:57.440> self-sufficient<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:59.170> then

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
area to be self-sufficient and then

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.100 
area to be self-sufficient and then
urbanization<00:04:01.160> happens<00:04:01.550> suddenly<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.900> men

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
urbanization happens suddenly the men

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.280 
urbanization happens suddenly the men
may<00:04:03.860> be<00:04:03.890> traveling<00:04:04.520> to<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.150> city<00:04:05.560> and

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
may be traveling to the city and

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.410 
may be traveling to the city and
suddenly<00:04:09.290> there<00:04:09.620> was<00:04:10.100> another<00:04:10.400> family<00:04:10.700> in<00:04:11.209> the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
suddenly there was another family in the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.500 
suddenly there was another family in the
city<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:12.020> the<00:04:12.950> women<00:04:13.280> who<00:04:13.640> were<00:04:13.760> left<00:04:14.209> back<00:04:14.390> in

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
city and the women who were left back in

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.449 
city and the women who were left back in
the<00:04:14.540> villages<00:04:14.959> may<00:04:15.260> not<00:04:15.470> be<00:04:15.680> empowered<00:04:16.250> in<00:04:16.340> the

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
the villages may not be empowered in the

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.900 
the villages may not be empowered in the
same<00:04:16.669> way<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.950> so

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
same way and so

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.360 
same way and so
what<00:04:20.540> worked<00:04:20.780> then<00:04:21.019> might<00:04:21.290> not<00:04:21.470> work<00:04:21.620> today<00:04:22.010> in

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
what worked then might not work today in

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.970 
what worked then might not work today in
fact<00:04:22.760> does<00:04:22.970> not<00:04:23.000> work<00:04:23.390> today<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:24.200> if<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.710> seek

to if you try to duplicate traditions

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.620

they have to be adapted to a new age now
I<00:05:03.650> have<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.010> say<00:05:04.190> there's<00:05:04.550> some<00:05:04.790> traditions

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
I have to say there's some traditions

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.880 
I have to say there's some traditions
that<00:05:05.540> just<00:05:05.720> have<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.870> be<00:05:05.960> got<00:05:06.140> rid<00:05:06.320> of<00:05:06.380> and

that just have to be got rid of and

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.850 
that just have to be got rid of and
there's<00:05:07.760> no<00:05:07.910> excuse<00:05:08.510> for<00:05:08.540> them<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:09.770> know

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
there's no excuse for them you know

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.140 
there's no excuse for them you know
female<00:05:10.700> genital<00:05:11.120> mutilation<00:05:11.150> I'm<00:05:12.080> sorry<00:05:12.320> I

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
female genital mutilation I'm sorry I

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.940 
female genital mutilation I'm sorry I
don't<00:05:14.150> consider<00:05:14.570> that<00:05:14.690> a<00:05:15.080> tradition<00:05:15.740> of<00:05:15.770> worth

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
don't consider that a tradition of worth

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.720 
don't consider that a tradition of worth
hanging<00:05:16.160> on<00:05:16.460> to

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
hanging on to

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.790 
hanging on to
I<00:05:17.080> think<00:05:18.080> that's<00:05:18.260> a<00:05:18.380> tradition<00:05:18.920> that<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:20.800> think

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
I think that's a tradition that I think

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.360 
I think that's a tradition that I think
that's<00:05:21.890> a<00:05:22.040> tradition<00:05:22.520> that<00:05:22.730> is<00:05:22.960> barbaric<00:05:23.960> and

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
that's a tradition that is barbaric and

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.120 
that's a tradition that is barbaric and
should<00:05:25.370> be<00:05:25.490> eliminated<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:27.590> violence

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
should be eliminated the violence

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.980 
should be eliminated the violence
towards<00:05:28.880> women

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.900 

i-i-i-i<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.140> don't<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:33.950> don't<00:05:34.250> care<00:05:34.430> for<00:05:34.670> that
