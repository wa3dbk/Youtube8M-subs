showing you the difference between the
apex<00:00:06.629> 34<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.500> apex<00:00:07.919> 37<00:00:08.510> this<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.469> apex

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
apex 34 and the apex 37 this is the apex

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.570 
apex 34 and the apex 37 this is the apex
34<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:13.099> this<00:00:14.450> is<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.599> apex<00:00:15.960> 37<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.460> have

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
34 and this is the apex 37 and I have

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.700 
34 and this is the apex 37 and I have
two<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.940> these<00:00:18.090> apex<00:00:18.510> 37<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:19.199> one<00:00:19.380> does<00:00:19.560> not

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
two of these apex 37 this one does not

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.480 
two of these apex 37 this one does not
have<00:00:19.770> grip<00:00:20.070> tape<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> other<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:20.760> does<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:22.490> I'm

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
have grip tape the other one does so I'm

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.620 
have grip tape the other one does so I'm
going<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.910> giving<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> little

there's<00:00:46.120> kickflips<00:00:47.080> carving<00:00:47.950> anything

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
there's kickflips carving anything

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.270 
there's kickflips carving anything
that's<00:00:49.060> more<00:00:49.300> technical<00:00:49.930> that's<00:00:50.710> hard<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:50.950> do

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
that's more technical that's hard to do

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.520 
that's more technical that's hard to do
I<00:00:51.310> have<00:00:51.550> shared<00:00:51.760> that<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:53.020> I<00:00:53.050> don't<00:00:53.350> like

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
I have shared that what I don't like

I have shared that what I don't like
doing<00:00:53.890> on<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.340> board<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.910> a<00:00:56.610> dancing<00:00:57.610> dancing

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
doing on this board is a dancing dancing

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.900 
doing on this board is a dancing dancing
is<00:00:58.420> hard<00:00:58.600> on<00:00:58.690> this<00:00:58.840> board<00:00:59.140> because<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.489> the

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
is hard on this board because of the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.020 
is hard on this board because of the
small<00:01:01.750> deck<00:01:02.040> it's<00:01:03.040> good<00:01:03.190> for<00:01:03.370> sliding<00:01:03.850> it's

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
small deck it's good for sliding it's

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.719 
small deck it's good for sliding it's
very<00:01:04.210> compact<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:04.989> small<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.220> can<00:01:06.340> fit<00:01:06.610> it

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
very compact and small so you can fit it

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.840 
very compact and small so you can fit it
pretty<00:01:07.000> much<00:01:07.180> anywhere<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.770> carry<00:01:09.580> it<00:01:09.700> around

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
pretty much anywhere and carry it around

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.550 
pretty much anywhere and carry it around
with<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.180> everywhere<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:11.020> I<00:01:11.050> like<00:01:11.380> that

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
with you everywhere so I like that

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.390 
with you everywhere so I like that
aspect<00:01:11.800> of<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.619> great<00:01:14.890> board<00:01:15.160> I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
aspect of it and this is a great board I

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.980 
aspect of it and this is a great board I
really<00:01:15.729> like<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.119> but<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:19.090> like<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.540> clarity

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
really like it but I do like the clarity

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.190 
really like it but I do like the clarity
7<00:01:20.259> better<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.970> is<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.300> 30<00:01:22.509> 70<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.300> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
7 better this is the 30 70 here is the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.590 
7 better this is the 30 70 here is the
light<00:01:26.500> weight<00:01:26.740> or<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.100> flyweight<00:01:27.759> this<00:01:28.360> is<00:01:28.509> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
light weight or a flyweight this is the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.320 
light weight or a flyweight this is the
mid

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
mid

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.410 
mid
you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.050> see<00:01:31.400> flyweights<00:01:32.400> smaller<00:01:33.120> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you can see flyweights smaller and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.320 
you can see flyweights smaller and
skinnier<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:35.250> much<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.640> flexible<00:01:36.180> if

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
skinnier and it's much more flexible if

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.720 
skinnier and it's much more flexible if
you've<00:01:36.480> seen<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.960> my<00:01:37.080> videos<00:01:37.490> some<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
you've seen in my videos some of the

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.430 
you've seen in my videos some of the
things<00:01:38.970> I've<00:01:39.150> done<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.600> fly<00:01:39.810> wait<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.410> just

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
things I've done on the fly wait it just

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.620 
things I've done on the fly wait it just
goes<00:01:40.800> straight<00:01:41.010> down<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.730> very<00:01:41.970> flexible

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
goes straight down it's very flexible

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.670 
goes straight down it's very flexible
very<00:01:42.750> light<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.860> by<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.490> way<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.910> making

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.480 

it's<00:01:49.010> very<00:01:50.380> very<00:01:51.380> tough<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.800> find<00:01:52.010> skaters

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
it's very very tough to find skaters

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.730 
it's very very tough to find skaters
here<00:01:52.760> in<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.180> range<00:01:53.510> but<00:01:53.930> if<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.200> are<00:01:54.230> hey

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
here in that range but if you are hey

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.440 
here in that range but if you are hey
get<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> flyweight<00:01:55.580> it's<00:01:55.850> really<00:01:56.060> nice<00:01:56.210> and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
get a flyweight it's really nice and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.440 
get a flyweight it's really nice and
light<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.870> I<00:01:57.740> love<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.760> then<00:01:59.180> this<00:01:59.330> is

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
light and I love that and then this is

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.190 
light and I love that and then this is
the<00:01:59.480> Midway<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.320> got<00:02:00.470> some<00:02:00.650> grip<00:02:00.830> tape<00:02:01.040> on<00:02:01.220> it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
the Midway it's got some grip tape on it

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.040 
the Midway it's got some grip tape on it
these<00:02:03.200> have<00:02:03.440> retro<00:02:03.860> zigzags<00:02:04.540> switch<00:02:05.540> are<00:02:05.690> 70

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
these have retro zigzags switch are 70

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.290 
these have retro zigzags switch are 70
millimeters<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.830> love<00:02:07.340> these<00:02:07.490> wheels<00:02:07.790> I<00:02:08.149> like

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
millimeters I love these wheels I like

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.180 
millimeters I love these wheels I like
the<00:02:08.420> more<00:02:08.630> than<00:02:08.780> gumballs<00:02:09.200> they're<00:02:09.860> easy<00:02:10.009> to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
the more than gumballs they're easy to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.790 
the more than gumballs they're easy to
