00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
and I spent the last ten years playing

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.430 
and I spent the last ten years playing
chess<00:00:09.340> and<00:00:09.610> I<00:00:10.030> want<00:00:10.360> some<00:00:10.600> major<00:00:10.810> tournaments

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
chess and I want some major tournaments

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.549 
chess and I want some major tournaments
like<00:00:11.590> the<00:00:11.770> Canadian<00:00:12.280> Open

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.330 

along<00:00:14.980> the<00:00:15.190> way<00:00:15.309> a<00:00:15.840> chess<00:00:16.840> board<00:00:16.869> has<00:00:17.470> 64

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
along the way a chess board has 64

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.269 
along the way a chess board has 64
squares<00:00:18.670> on<00:00:18.880> an<00:00:19.110> 8x8<00:00:20.110> and<00:00:20.500> we<00:00:20.890> give<00:00:21.039> them<00:00:21.099> by

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
squares on an 8x8 and we give them by

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.130 
squares on an 8x8 and we give them by
ranks<00:00:21.700> and<00:00:21.820> files<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.810> ranks<00:00:23.320> are<00:00:23.560> 1<00:00:24.310> 2<00:00:24.730> 3<00:00:25.000> 4<00:00:25.720> 5

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140

6<00:00:26.710> 7<00:00:27.130> 8<00:00:27.610> and<00:00:28.000> the<00:00:28.630> files<00:00:28.930> are<00:00:29.230> a<00:00:29.500> b<00:00:30.400> c<00:00:30.700> d<00:00:31.180> e<00:00:31.630> f<00:00:32.079> g<00:00:32.250> h

and<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:35.050> that<00:00:35.590> will<00:00:35.739> give<00:00:35.950> us<00:00:35.980> a<00:00:36.309> grid<00:00:36.700> system<00:00:37.000> a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
and so that will give us a grid system a

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:47.729 
and so that will give us a grid system a

what<00:00:47.890> we<00:00:48.010> would<00:00:48.160> call<00:00:48.219> the<00:00:48.640> long<00:00:48.969> diagonal

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
what we would call the long diagonal

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.029 
what we would call the long diagonal
with<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.739> long<00:00:51.010> day

with the long day
the<00:00:54.039> bishop<00:00:54.399> likes<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.820> move<00:00:54.969> on<00:00:55.089> long

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
the bishop likes to move on long

the bishop likes to move on long
diagonals<00:00:55.929> the<00:00:57.989> rook<00:00:58.989> moves<00:00:59.019> and<00:00:59.559> straight

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
diagonals the rook moves and straight

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:06.960 
diagonals the rook moves and straight
files<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.579> second<00:01:03.999> is<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.320> Queen<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.700> like

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
files the second is the Queen it's like

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.390 
files the second is the Queen it's like
the<00:01:07.450> bishop<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:07.990> rook<00:01:08.470> combined<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.920> moves<00:01:12.280> in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
the bishop and rook combined it moves in

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:21.870 
the bishop and rook combined it moves in
straight<00:01:12.700> lines<00:01:12.970> and<00:01:15.900> dives

next is the plan on its first move it's

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.290 
next is the plan on its first move it's
allowed<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:25.720> go<00:01:26.260> up<00:01:26.380> twice<00:01:26.710> only<00:01:27.580> on<00:01:27.790> its<00:01:28.060> first

move<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:28.930> also<00:01:29.110> captures<00:01:30.100> by<00:01:30.550> diagnosed<00:01:31.180> only

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
move it also captures by diagnosed only

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.030 
move it also captures by diagnosed only
capturing<00:01:32.650> one<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:34.270> square<00:01:34.570> on<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.840> square<00:01:35.560> in

capturing one one square on a square in
any<00:01:36.250> direction

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.450 

next<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.280> night<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:44.470> likes<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:44.950> move<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.340> L

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
next is the night it likes to move in L

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.390 
next is the night it likes to move in L
shapes<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.660> hardest<00:01:46.990> one<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.170> master<00:01:47.710> but

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
shapes is the hardest one to master but

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.340 
shapes is the hardest one to master but
it<00:01:48.610> also<00:01:48.790> can<00:01:49.090> jump<00:01:49.270> over<00:01:49.420> its<00:01:49.660> enemy<00:01:49.960> pieces

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
it also can jump over its enemy pieces

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.620 
it also can jump over its enemy pieces
and<00:01:50.560> its<00:01:50.860> own<00:01:51.040> pieces<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.150> is<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.300> very

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
and its own pieces so it is a very

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.210 
and its own pieces so it is a very
useful<00:01:53.380> piece<00:01:54.509> check<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.810> when<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.500> King<00:01:56.860> gets

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
useful piece check is when the King gets

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.690 
useful piece check is when the King gets
attacked<00:01:57.670> by<00:01:58.060> an<00:01:58.690> opponent<00:01:59.259> piece<00:01:59.590> it's<00:02:00.550> very

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
attacked by an opponent piece it's very

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.150 
attacked by an opponent piece it's very
important<00:02:01.539> that<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.229> never<00:02:02.440> get<00:02:02.710> checked

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
important that you never get checked

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.120 
important that you never get checked
because<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.509> King<00:02:04.780> represents<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:06.009> the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
because the King represents you on the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.600 
because the King represents you on the
chessboard<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:07.030> if<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:08.380> get<00:02:08.590> attacked<00:02:09.009> you

chessboard and if you get attacked you

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.300 
chessboard and if you get attacked you
must<00:02:09.880> deal<00:02:10.090> with<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.450> right<00:02:10.810> away<00:02:11.190> there<00:02:12.190> are

must deal with it right away there are

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.860 
must deal with it right away there are
only<00:02:12.430> three<00:02:12.820> ways<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.180> deal<00:02:13.360> with<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.570> check

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
only three ways to deal with a check

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.320 
only three ways to deal with a check
move<00:02:14.470> out<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> way<00:02:14.890> put<00:02:15.820> something<00:02:16.209> in
