Jesus<00:04:56.660> sandstone<00:04:57.660> is<00:04:57.690> so<00:04:58.080> weird<00:04:58.849> it'll<00:04:59.849> take<00:05:00.000> a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
Jesus sandstone is so weird it'll take a

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.070 
Jesus sandstone is so weird it'll take a
little<00:05:00.210> bit<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.389> getting<00:05:00.570> used<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.810> but<00:05:00.900> it

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
little bit of getting used to but it

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.330 
little bit of getting used to but it
definitely<00:05:01.229> provides<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.740> lot<00:05:01.919> more<00:05:02.070> grip

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
definitely provides a lot more grip

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.339 
definitely provides a lot more grip
especially<00:05:02.849> your<00:05:03.000> finger<00:05:03.389> provides<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.200> lot

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
especially your finger provides a lot

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.050 
especially your finger provides a lot
more<00:05:04.500> grip<00:05:04.770> but<00:05:05.010> it's<00:05:05.220> just<00:05:06.229> so<00:05:07.229> so<00:05:08.099> so<00:05:08.700> weird

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
more grip but it's just so so so weird

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.990 
more grip but it's just so so so weird
and<00:05:10.010> hopefully<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.220> screen<00:05:11.550> does<00:05:11.700> not<00:05:11.820> so

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
and hopefully the screen does not so

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.820 
and hopefully the screen does not so
much<00:05:12.150> like<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:12.479> but<00:05:12.660> that<00:05:13.410> was<00:05:13.500> pretty<00:05:13.710> much
