00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.570
 but now everything 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:21.670
 myplace large format 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.789
 I do not see a single one very much 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.789
 beautiful 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.079
 halo fans of the dkb has the bundesliga 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.390
 We answer your questions today 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.050
 now it starts how do you train 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.050
 your train 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.839
 no, I have earlier than myself from the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.699
 youth came in the men's range 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.399
 I did a lot of weight training 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.109
 I think that's part of that 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.750
 I cast such a good and of course 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.890
 my body as well, so I think 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.869
 I have a little bit in the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.470
 get weighed why are you under the 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.940
 right eye a scar yes that was 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.390
 actually my first season as a senior 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:24.049
 I have players in geology in denmark 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.750
 my head against each other head 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.479
 bang and yes that was very 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.399
 painful but today that's magic 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.209
 Actually, I'm kind of like that 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.979
 a little harder who or what helps 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.750
 defeat yourself 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.429
 process if that happens then 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.429
 for me that's important it is 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.560
 to talk to myself a little 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.509
 Of course I'm talking to my family 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.640
 my wife also about it and exactly how 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.259
 which of course you also can mean 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.709
 own thoughts so now we at 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.140
 We experienced the final four again and we were 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.940
 I believe at half past eight at home but im 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.729
 bed or I was already in bed 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.920
 but I could sleep well too 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.989
 at half past two or two 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.440
 study both if your freedom from 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.599
 handball for example summer break so 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.709
 Of course, of course, with my vacation 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.970
 I am already looking forward to family there 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.209
 on it and therefore two weeks 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.400
 laze and a week I will still 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.340
 I started marrying my buddy 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.420
 This summer, I have so much 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:36.240
 make plan and also with vacation 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.950
 with my girlfriend these four five 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.140
 weeks what will be here now in this 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.270
 summer you have to enjoy that I think 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.239
 maybe two weeks are many 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.690
 nothing to do but a week 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.569
 already where you notice where you do not notice anything 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.190
 I definitely need that 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.410
 who knows you best from the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.270
 team and with whom he also spends 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.290
 outside of the workout most of the time 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:07.470
 So I have so much time with me 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.880
 We used really much 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.069
 made together we have we play 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.489
 also gold together and when I come here 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.790
 I came with them almost every day 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.040
 his girlfriend ate that was so 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.370
 three four five times a week or something 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.610
 that suits me well because I want to be myself 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.350
 do not like to eat and now 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.900
 he has got to know we have to look 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.010
 how much time, by the way, worth to me 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.380
 I also have some players with me 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.430
 it depends a bit and me 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.720
 also find it very good in us 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.420
 flensburg that we also have a lot in common 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.670
 because there are many families here 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.010
 and there are often times with dates 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.630
 with the whole children and with 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.820
 The women and I think that's just fine 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.390
 solved here in flensburg with whom shares 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:56.310
 look at your room for outward journeys 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.859
 and why exactly this person is me 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.209
 I'm clear in the room with Holger 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.950
 a very good combination because I too 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.780
 for a long time with the national team 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 time with him in the room and that 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.590
 just fits 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.150
 We look the same series as we do 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.780
 have a lot by so room 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.660
 degree it was coming as well 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.450
 I'm sharing with in the room 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.130
 and yes that's actually one 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.350
 a bit the same story as with 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.770
 you 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.680
 that is actually the same tempo on the 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.600
 room so we really like it 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.950
 like to just lie on the bed 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:38.100
 I'm just finished with homeland yes 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.480
 that is very comfortable in the room 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:45.660
 we can talk a little bit too 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:47.520
 But Schneider is a bit wise 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.550
 actually quite good that I get 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.550
 have
