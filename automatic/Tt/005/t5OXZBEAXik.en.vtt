00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello my dear subscribers ii skv and 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.780
 tv and today I will for you the m41 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 rbs and the m41 if they are the beast 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.110
 to compare 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.179
 I will start with the design 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.270
 the two weapons start to deal with 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.550
 I'll be a beast with the mk 1 that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.800
 design you pretty robot let yourself 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.019
 out with all these flashlights and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.359
 These are pretty much ingrained 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.630
 So a robot comes from the name 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.610
 Iron so iron pretty close to the so 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.309
 title of the weapon meets the design 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.280
 every case so i find the design up 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.260
 first of all appeal by 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.090
 the black design and the red 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.820
 the lights will hit you soon though 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.510
 with the design as well as a beast 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.460
 completely in the black 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.559
 So as far as design is concerned, I think so too 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.899
 that if you are the better choice 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.809
 So it's one to zero for if you have the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.030
 The dams are advised absolutely 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.280
 the same is the wonder that regulates me 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.409
 day everything is the same so there there 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.049
 there are no differences between the ubs 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.100
 and the obsidian did not say so 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.299
 noteworthy 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.950
 the costs are the same both costs 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.200
 125000 eg but with which weapon gets 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.420
 one more for his money so the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.299
 Clear answer just had to be if you 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.759
 be the beast as they have more specials ngp 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.860
 shows off special features as the gentlemen reads 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.960
 but you have to say that too 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.119
 this special all alone only 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.369
 zombie fashion players bring something we 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.950
 there's just zombie mode critical attack 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.079
 It's all in one you just have to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.810
 say that they are a beast and they are 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.850
 in the near future, the best weapons will be separated 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.189
 in crossfire there is no way 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.409
 stronger weapons than these two too 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.450
 if they are more than unfair and more 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.909
 to be rescued are the ones 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.500
 strongest that is fact even if I 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.670
 find out if they're up to the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.290
 better choice is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.049
 both weapons actually complete 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.030
 the same with the yield and and and and 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.890
 And it's just the design 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.500
 the me whether they had the more 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.070
 looks like the one but reads that 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.350
 is a matter of taste 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.660
 So be happy if you beast one 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.840
 or if you have the one with it 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.270
 joy and yes that 's it from gaming brown 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.270
 tv and i still say
