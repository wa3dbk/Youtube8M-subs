00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.880 

and<00:00:02.610> then<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:02.909> need<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.419> get<00:00:04.290> more<00:00:04.589> out<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.770> my

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
and then I need to get more out of my

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:39.680 
and then I need to get more out of my
inventory<00:00:19.580> no<00:00:24.980> I'll<00:00:25.980> go<00:00:26.160> get<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.490> piece<00:00:38.690> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
inventory no I'll go get that piece so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:55.889 
inventory no I'll go get that piece so
boat<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.320> where<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.590> lands

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.710 

so<00:00:56.899> that<00:00:57.020> should<00:00:57.260> hit<00:00:57.410> a<00:00:57.440> slope<00:00:57.800> there<00:00:58.129> and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
so that should hit a slope there and

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:38.430 
so that should hit a slope there and
then<00:01:01.090> just<00:01:02.090> get<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:02.480> piece<00:01:02.719> of<00:01:02.870> wood<00:01:02.899> back<00:01:24.580> so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.600 

now<00:01:39.440> if<00:01:39.619> I<00:01:39.740> put<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:40.039> there<00:01:40.070> it's<00:01:40.399> going<00:01:40.550> to

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
now if I put it there it's going to

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:50.380 
now if I put it there it's going to
intercept<00:01:48.460> now<00:01:49.460> hopefully<00:01:49.909> they<00:01:50.060> shouldn't

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
intercept now hopefully they shouldn't

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.500 
intercept now hopefully they shouldn't
touch<00:01:50.539> each<00:01:50.750> other

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.720 

and<00:01:58.440> then<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> need<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.920> take<00:01:59.070> some<00:01:59.280> dirt<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
and then I need to take some dirt and

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:43.809 
and then I need to take some dirt and
fix<00:02:00.510> this

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.880 

hope<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.569> don't<00:02:44.629> need<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.019> put<00:02:45.170> another<00:02:45.379> booster

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
hope I don't need to put another booster

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.020 
hope I don't need to put another booster
in<00:02:46.010> here<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.980> need<00:02:52.189> to<00:02:52.310> though<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.700> track

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
part but at some point when i do another

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.780 
part but at some point when i do another
building<00:03:45.829> episode<00:03:46.159> I'm<00:03:46.280> going<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.459> build<00:03:46.669> a

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
building episode I'm going to build a

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.149 
building episode I'm going to build a
water<00:03:47.120> elevator<00:03:47.599> and<00:03:48.049> then<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:48.739> want<00:03:48.979> to<00:03:49.040> show

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
water elevator and then I want to show

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.619 
water elevator and then I want to show
that<00:03:49.189> so<00:03:49.609> people<00:03:49.970> who<00:03:50.180> don't<00:03:50.389> know<00:03:50.479> how<00:03:50.599> to

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
that so people who don't know how to

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.619 
that so people who don't know how to
build<00:03:50.900> one<00:03:51.109> can<00:03:51.379> then<00:03:52.220> know<00:03:52.459> how<00:03:52.669> so<00:03:53.599> right

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
build one can then know how so right

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.879 
build one can then know how so right
here<00:03:53.900> i'm<00:03:54.019> probably<00:03:54.199> going<00:03:54.409> to<00:03:54.500> build<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.739> water

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
here i'm probably going to build a water

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.159 
here i'm probably going to build a water
elevator<00:03:55.340> at<00:03:55.519> some<00:03:55.729> point<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.509> by<00:03:56.870> water

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
elevator at some point and by water

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.499 
elevator at some point and by water
elevator<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.949> mean<00:03:58.250> like<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.489> boat<00:03:58.759> elevator<00:03:59.209> so

00:03:59.499 --> 00:03:59.509 
elevator I mean like a boat elevator so

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.179 
elevator I mean like a boat elevator so
that<00:03:59.659> it's<00:03:59.780> like<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.109> when<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.680> boat<00:04:00.919> is

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
that it's like you when a boat is

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.729 
that it's like you when a boat is
underwater<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.599> wants<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.079> rush<00:04:03.259> to<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.530> top

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
underwater it wants to rush to the top

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.379 
underwater it wants to rush to the top
so<00:04:03.979> if<00:04:04.099> you<00:04:04.189> design<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.519> just<00:04:04.879> right<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.090> boda

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
so if you design it just right a boda

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.300 
so if you design it just right a boda
like<00:04:05.720> just<00:04:05.989> rock<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.319> right<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.799> top<00:04:07.040> and

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
like just rock it right to the top and

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.729 
like just rock it right to the top and
then<00:04:07.819> if<00:04:07.970> you<00:04:08.120> set<00:04:08.509> it<00:04:08.629> up<00:04:08.720> it'll<00:04:08.930> actually<00:04:09.259> you

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
then if you set it up it'll actually you

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.379 
then if you set it up it'll actually you
can<00:04:09.919> push<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.280> boat<00:04:10.430> using<00:04:10.759> current<00:04:11.120> down

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
can push the boat using current down

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.119 
can push the boat using current down
again<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:11.750> it'll<00:04:11.989> just<00:04:12.109> keep<00:04:12.349> cycling<00:04:12.769> over

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
again and it'll just keep cycling over

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.069 
again and it'll just keep cycling over
and<00:04:13.250> over<00:04:13.340> again<00:04:13.489> so<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.389> can<00:04:14.449> get<00:04:14.720> in<00:04:14.870> and

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
and over again so you can get in and

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.560 
and over again so you can get in and
just<00:04:15.229> pop<00:04:15.709> right<00:04:15.919> up<00:04:16.039> here<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:16.909> I<00:04:16.940> need<00:04:17.269> and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
just pop right up here so I need and

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.729 
just pop right up here so I need and
I'll<00:04:17.690> build<00:04:18.109> one<00:04:18.229> of<00:04:18.259> those<00:04:18.349> because<00:04:18.590> it's

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
I'll build one of those because it's

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.020 
I'll build one of those because it's
hard<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.039> keep<00:04:19.190> going<00:04:19.459> up<00:04:19.549> here<00:04:19.669> anyways

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
hard to keep going up here anyways

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
want to show you guys what I think is

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.760 
want to show you guys what I think is
really<00:05:27.350> awesome<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.920> that<00:05:28.640> is<00:05:32.440> try<00:05:33.440> and<00:05:33.470> get

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
really awesome and that is try and get

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.320 
really awesome and that is try and get
in<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:33.980> same<00:05:34.160> vantage<00:05:34.370> point<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.910> was<00:05:35.060> last

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
in the same vantage point I was last

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.750 
in the same vantage point I was last
time<00:05:35.450> when<00:05:35.720> I<00:05:35.750> explain<00:05:36.170> this<00:05:36.380> so<00:05:37.280> his<00:05:37.430> cable

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
time when I explain this so his cable

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.980 
time when I explain this so his cable
over<00:05:37.910> there<00:05:38.120> but<00:05:38.390> what's<00:05:38.540> really<00:05:38.720> cool<00:05:38.930> is

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
over there but what's really cool is

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.860 
over there but what's really cool is
this<00:05:39.260> see<00:05:39.590> how<00:05:39.710> this<00:05:39.860> corner<00:05:40.340> is<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.790> think<00:05:41.660> this

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
this see how this corner is I think this

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.630 
this see how this corner is I think this
would<00:05:42.080> be<00:05:42.110> really<00:05:42.380> cool<00:05:42.680> for<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:43.130> corner<00:05:43.490> of<00:05:43.520> a

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
would be really cool for the corner of a

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.150 
would be really cool for the corner of a
castle<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:44.840> you<00:05:44.960> sort<00:05:45.200> of<00:05:45.320> build<00:05:45.530> it<00:05:45.680> one<00:05:45.920> wall

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
castle so you sort of build it one wall

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.800 
castle so you sort of build it one wall
out<00:05:46.370> this<00:05:46.640> way<00:05:46.820> and<00:05:46.850> another<00:05:47.210> wall<00:05:47.450> in<00:05:47.630> that

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
out this way and another wall in that

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.470 
out this way and another wall in that
way<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:48.050> then<00:05:48.170> this<00:05:48.500> acts<00:05:48.950> as<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.310> wall<00:05:49.610> so<00:05:50.450> that

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
way and then this acts as a wall so that

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.470 
way and then this acts as a wall so that
I<00:05:50.630> only<00:05:50.780> have<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.080> build<00:05:51.260> like<00:05:51.650> sort<00:05:52.520> of<00:05:52.610> half

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
I only have to build like sort of half

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.570 
I only have to build like sort of half
the<00:05:53.720> walls<00:05:53.930> and<00:05:54.380> then<00:05:54.890> I<00:05:54.950> can<00:05:55.100> actually<00:05:55.400> build

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
the walls and then I can actually build

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.280 
the walls and then I can actually build
rooms<00:05:55.970> into<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:56.450> side<00:05:56.630> of<00:05:56.660> the<00:05:56.810> mountain<00:05:56.930> and

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
rooms into the side of the mountain and

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.440 
rooms into the side of the mountain and
then<00:05:57.830> like<00:05:58.040> have<00:05:58.220> corridors<00:05:58.730> that<00:05:59.030> like<00:05:59.210> lead

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
then like have corridors that like lead

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.940 
then like have corridors that like lead
out<00:05:59.600> here<00:05:59.900> maybe<00:06:00.140> this<00:06:00.290> becomes<00:06:00.680> like<00:06:00.830> an

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
out here maybe this becomes like an

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.800 
out here maybe this becomes like an
Outlook<00:06:01.280> or<00:06:01.430> something<00:06:01.850> I<00:06:02.030> don't<00:06:02.510> know<00:06:02.570> but<00:06:02.600> I

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
Outlook or something I don't know but I

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.290 
Outlook or something I don't know but I
think<00:06:02.900> making<00:06:03.680> this<00:06:03.950> whole<00:06:04.160> castle<00:06:04.760> into<00:06:05.030> part

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
think making this whole castle into part

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.060 
think making this whole castle into part
of<00:06:05.390> a<00:06:05.480> mountain<00:06:05.810> fort<00:06:06.080> would<00:06:06.590> be<00:06:06.770> pretty<00:06:07.010> cool

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
of a mountain fort would be pretty cool

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:15.910 
of a mountain fort would be pretty cool
