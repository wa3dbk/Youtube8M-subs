00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.270 
front grille surround and as you can see
I<00:00:11.370> went<00:00:11.790> ahead<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.090> removed<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:13.590> front

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
I went ahead and removed the front

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.670 
I went ahead and removed the front
Toyota<00:00:15.179> emblem<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.690> that's<00:00:15.929> two<00:00:16.199> coats<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.650> it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
Toyota emblem and that's two coats on it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.750 
Toyota emblem and that's two coats on it
right<00:00:16.920> now

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
right now

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.340 
right now
I<00:00:17.789> would<00:00:18.600> say<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.810> looks<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> lot<00:00:19.080> better<00:00:19.140> than

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
I would say it looks a lot better than

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.130 
I would say it looks a lot better than
when<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.650> did<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.890> black<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:21.140> originally

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
when I did the black on it originally

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.370 
when I did the black on it originally
and<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.820> decided<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.510> would<00:00:24.570> look<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.019> lot

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and so I decided it would look a lot

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.349 
and so I decided it would look a lot
better<00:00:25.439> because<00:00:25.800> once<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.910> newspaper

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
better because once I get this newspaper

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
better because once I get this newspaper
off<00:00:27.810> right<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.289> I'm<00:00:29.010> gonna<00:00:29.160> hit<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.310> with

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
off right there I'm gonna hit that with

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.770 
off right there I'm gonna hit that with
black<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.170> get<00:00:31.170> rid<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.439> gray<00:00:31.830> sort<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
black and get rid of that gray sort of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.020 
black and get rid of that gray sort of
hue<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.050> guess<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.440> could<00:00:34.559> say<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> went

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
hue I guess you could say and so I went

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.220 
hue I guess you could say and so I went
ahead<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.450> taped<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.530> around<00:00:37.890> there<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
ahead and taped up all around there and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.180 
ahead and taped up all around there and
hit<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.350> newspaper<00:00:41.239> covered<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.360> well

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
hit it with newspaper covered as well

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.350 
hit it with newspaper covered as well
that<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> real<00:00:44.460> pain<00:00:44.640> getting<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that was a real pain getting down in

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.350 
that was a real pain getting down in
between<00:00:45.539> these<00:00:45.809> things<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.360> go

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
between these things right there so go

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.330 
between these things right there so go
ahead<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.510> show<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.780> all<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> grille<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
ahead and show you all the grille or the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.689 
ahead and show you all the grille or the
hood<00:00:50.879> itself<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> hood<00:00:53.460> bulge

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
hood itself and so this is a hood bulge

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.920 
hood itself and so this is a hood bulge
that's<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:55.980> how<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> remove<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.930> it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that's I don't know how to remove it it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.110 
that's I don't know how to remove it it
looks<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.230> real<00:00:58.410> sob<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.489> remove<00:00:59.760> so

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
looks like a real sob to remove so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.280 
looks like a real sob to remove so
didn't<00:01:00.660> even<00:01:00.750> worry<00:01:00.960> about<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.920

mostly because I don't really find the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.660 
mostly because I don't really find the
point<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.590> tearing<00:03:40.590> up<00:03:40.680> my<00:03:40.709> truck<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.340> brand

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670

we go
so<00:03:46.650> here's<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.920> better

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.200 

so<00:03:50.470> just<00:03:51.280> thought<00:03:51.400> I'd<00:03:51.520> include<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:52.000> tree

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
so just thought I'd include that tree

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.380 
so just thought I'd include that tree
off<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:53.340> that's<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.490> only<00:03:54.610> mods<00:03:54.910> I've<00:03:55.120> done<00:03:55.270> in

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
off so that's the only mods I've done in

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
tundra sr5 emblems over there so

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.600 
tundra sr5 emblems over there so
