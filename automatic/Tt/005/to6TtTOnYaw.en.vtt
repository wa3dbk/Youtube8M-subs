00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.490
 the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.490
 well anyway 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.949
 You must always be able to count on one hundred percent while driving 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:12.879
 a run 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.800
 certainly in unexpected situations regular checks, there is no man yet 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.460
 thrown overboard 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.550
 What is it that one in three cars has bad brakes has more knowledge 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.560
 fight and strong 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.859
 amakem the sounds 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.859
 and then it is time to get out of pain and have it checked 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.930
 why check the braking system properly should first check the peyler 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.540
 be dismantled 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.950
 the rear wheels of a car are usually equipped with drum brakes 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 this therefore has a drum 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.750
 becomes brake shoes chip 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.830
 it was printed 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.240
 so you ds this drum 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.500
 slows down 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.790
 estimated 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.800
 attention again 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.850
 maaseik page is subject 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.790
 during the coagulation check extra attention is therefore paid to sufficient space 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.960
 someone screw it 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.140
 it is checked whether the brake drum has not been worn too far 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.200
 in this case the wrong drum brake is in good condition then it becomes the brake system 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.530
 only cleaned and used 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.780
 we also check 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.010
 brake cylinder 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.580
 for leaks 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.890
 and that is true 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.680
 of course brings a lot of dust into the system it remains closed 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.080
 system so leaks are wooden 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 just check on prevalence well that's fine too 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 we do not check the mechanism against standing up 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.490
 and what assemble all the rubbers neatly back 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 so that we can have no problem with that 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.450
 I go the brake discs 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.020
 check the right things 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.380
 to still be safe 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.950
 The previous extra braking power is provided with the benefits of the car 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.620
 disc brakes 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.620
 also these should be checked regularly whether the brake disc is a 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.399
 minimum thickness that the disc must meet 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.059
 in this case it appears that the disk only has to struggle for two millimeters and that 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.299
 there is too little to get back on the road safely because the blocks wear out 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.669
 Also it is advisable to also replace this directly 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.530
 that the brake discs wear it is no more than normal and the more often used 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:32.590
 the faster the wear on the right you can see the thickness of a new brake disc 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.079
 The brake disc on the left has deteriorated to such an extent that driving on would be irresponsible 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:43.989
 If you are unsure about the braking performance of true auto, you can do without mercury 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.930
 Appointment for a free brake test cycling are licensed 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.329
 inspected 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.920
 nothing wrong then you drive safely back on the road at any cost 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.760
 Other falls however professional advice on what is needed to the braking system 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.159
 make 100 percent work
