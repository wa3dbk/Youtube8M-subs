00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.629
 the creator of the original became 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:12.709
 just didn't reinvent the bicycle 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.259
 constitutional strategic 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.720
 first games but thanks to this they 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.730
 were able to do 23 year old 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.220
 newborn serials 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.840
 who soon got one of them 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.880
 soap and then the extension 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.429
 first and for the moment the only thing 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.220
 supplements do not make radical 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250
 gameplay formula changes without 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.870
 permutations nevertheless not cost 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.500
 for example, from now on 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.320
 and valuable items are charged only 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.320
 to perform armchair assignments and murder 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.530
 especially strong monsters somehow 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.520
 way they are longtime opponents are not appreciated 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.670
 not 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.089
 I can easily forget the toy 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.829
 forever character development 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.739
 moving along the old scheme but with 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.210
 one new rarity now their three fighting 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.370
 magical and innate skills 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.979
 lighter or more difficult 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.400
 has become 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.570
 but the world became aware, too, did not survive 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.340
 rebirth but turned out to be much more 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.780
 rich in various kinds of events 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.950
 besides the main plot tasks to 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.420
 unfortunately quite standard 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.140
 meet very interesting 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.010
 secondary many of them are related 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.120
 with various changes 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.230
 and it brings a fair amount of variety to 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.180
 gameplay meet and simple 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.050
 text puzzles and tasks that require 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.140
 guessing the tune won't be boring anyway 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.700
 classic missions which offered 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.240
 would first build a base 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.640
 This topic nashtampovat mighty army and already 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.610
 after that engage 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.259
 the extermination of the enemy is almost not 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.549
 left next this the creators wanted 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.680
 divert attention from the base which is pretty 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.990
 grew rapidly 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.180
 and soon covered indecently large 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.659
 the size of the territory in addition to tasks not 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.049
 become smaller and the camera still stores 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.850
 fixed perspective refusing 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.520
 approach or move away 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.640
 but in iran the eldest cranes actually 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.880
 consists of three nations as a whole they 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.810
 fit perfectly in traffic jam balance and neither 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.410
 there are no advantages over opponents 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.080
 the main characters are also neck kan to 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.760
 fate prepared for a glorious role 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.860
 the savior of the world protector of nations 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.310
 immigrants and guardians 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.560
 public order 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.979
 as usual to sort out 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.950
 problems and find a solution will be required 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.349
 participation third forces creators of the world 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.540
 follow the storyline not so 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.430
 so interesting most of the time 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.480
 you are guaranteed to be convened by 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.760
 Opinions optional 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.069
 kresov characters wanting to share with 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.709
 the hero of his troubles a lot but their problems 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.470
 never echoes and 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.579
 does not save a bit of originality 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.809
 the first addition to became force majeure not 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:34.809
 gives reasons for frustration well and not 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.909
 bold steps forward fans 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.359
 the series will surely find him 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.280
 fascinating 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.630
 largely due to surviving 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.979
 characters we have long known 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.389
 the rest will surely be interesting 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.639
 giant fire-breathing dragons 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.109
 take they serve justify stagnation 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.689
 but entertained for several evenings 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:51.329
 exactly
