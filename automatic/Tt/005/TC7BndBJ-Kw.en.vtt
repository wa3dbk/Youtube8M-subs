00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
the computer looks like so I guess now's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.460 
the computer looks like so I guess now's
gonna<00:00:22.640> be<00:00:22.790> a<00:00:22.820> good<00:00:23.030> chance<00:00:23.510> for<00:00:23.630> you<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.200> see

that so I'm gonna crack open the

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.070 
that so I'm gonna crack open the
computer<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:28.360> while<00:00:29.360> I'm<00:00:29.480> installing<00:00:29.780> this<00:00:29.900> I

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
the backside of this computer looks like

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.180 
the backside of this computer looks like
now<00:00:49.520> remember<00:00:49.940> mine<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:50.510> custom<00:00:51.170> mine<00:00:51.890> is

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
now remember mine is custom mine is

this<00:00:54.800> is<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.250> creative<00:00:55.850> x-fi<00:00:56.770> soundblaster

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
this is a creative x-fi soundblaster

this is a creative x-fi soundblaster
card<00:00:58.309> I<00:00:58.550> got<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.660> dual<00:00:59.870> monitor<00:01:00.500> system<00:01:01.370> that

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
card I got the dual monitor system that

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.359 
card I got the dual monitor system that
I<00:01:01.520> think<00:01:01.760> this<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.170> ATI<00:01:03.170> Radeon<00:01:03.369> something

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
I think this is a ATI Radeon something

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.109 
I think this is a ATI Radeon something
or<00:01:04.460> rather<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.509> standard<00:01:06.020> stock

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
or rather this is the standard stock

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.599 
or rather this is the standard stock
sound<00:01:08.119> card<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.569> came<00:01:08.689> along<00:01:08.899> with<00:01:09.139> it<00:01:09.609> one

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:10.609 
sound card that came along with it one

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:13.510 
sound card that came along with it one
two<00:01:10.969> three<00:01:11.389> four<00:01:11.840> USB<00:01:12.380> ports<00:01:12.679> I<00:01:13.219> believe

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
two three four USB ports I believe

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.249 
two three four USB ports I believe
they're<00:01:13.729> backwards<00:01:14.240> compatible

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
they're backwards compatible

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.359 
they're backwards compatible
they<00:01:15.950> both<00:01:16.280> obviously<00:01:17.060> do<00:01:17.240> USB<00:01:17.840> 2.0<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.590> 1.0

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
they both obviously do USB 2.0 and 1.0

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.129 
they both obviously do USB 2.0 and 1.0

know<00:01:26.689> hopefully<00:01:27.490> help<00:01:28.490> me<00:01:28.549> out<00:01:28.729> later<00:01:28.939> on<00:01:29.060> in

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
know hopefully help me out later on in

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.319 
know hopefully help me out later on in
life<00:01:29.359> and<00:01:29.600> an<00:01:29.959> optical<00:01:30.380> audio<00:01:30.770> out<00:01:31.219> I<00:01:31.850> believe

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
life and an optical audio out I believe

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.999 
life and an optical audio out I believe
this<00:01:32.630> has<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:32.990> go<00:01:33.079> with<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:33.499> sound<00:01:33.770> card

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
this has to go with this sound card

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.289 
this has to go with this sound card
because<00:01:34.279> this<00:01:34.639> one<00:01:34.939> has<00:01:35.149> their<00:01:35.359> own<00:01:36.039> optical

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
because this one has their own optical

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.089 
because this one has their own optical
in<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:38.479> out<00:01:38.569> so<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.349> is<00:01:39.409> what<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.679> backside

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
in and out so this is what the backside

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.859 
in and out so this is what the backside
here's<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.429> big<00:01:40.579> fan<00:01:40.880> right<00:01:41.119> here<00:01:41.389> obviously

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
with having that much RAM and it's it's

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.520 
with having that much RAM and it's it's
not<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:39.370> beneficial<00:02:40.090> especially<00:02:41.080> with<00:02:41.380> the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
because I have a USB 2.0 hub and I'm

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.360 
because I have a USB 2.0 hub and I'm
running<00:03:36.970> three<00:03:37.480> external<00:03:37.959> hard<00:03:38.380> drives<00:03:38.739> off

running three external hard drives off

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.479 
running three external hard drives off
of<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.570> can't<00:03:40.810> keep<00:03:40.959> up<00:03:41.019> as<00:03:41.859> much<00:03:42.160> as<00:03:42.340> it

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
of it and it can't keep up as much as it

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.970 
of it and it can't keep up as much as it
should<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.780> was<00:03:43.989> kind<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.230> hoping<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.560> PCI

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
should so I was kind of hoping the PCI

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.599 
should so I was kind of hoping the PCI
card<00:03:45.370> was<00:03:45.549> gonna<00:03:45.700> work<00:03:45.970> but<00:03:47.310> yes<00:03:48.310> I'm<00:03:48.489> looking

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
card was gonna work but yes I'm looking

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.039 
card was gonna work but yes I'm looking
like<00:03:48.850> it's<00:03:49.000> gonna<00:03:49.510> be<00:03:49.900> able<00:03:49.989> to<00:03:50.350> be<00:03:51.190> installed

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
like it's gonna be able to be installed

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.479 
like it's gonna be able to be installed
so<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.350> don't<00:03:53.590> know<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.980> don't<00:03:54.220> know<00:03:54.280> what<00:03:54.400> I'm

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
so I don't know I don't know what I'm

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.620 
so I don't know I don't know what I'm
gonna<00:03:54.579> do<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:54.970> don't<00:03:55.060> know<00:03:55.180> what<00:03:55.299> I'm<00:03:55.390> gonna<00:03:55.480> do

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630
