00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
this I wasn't using a cookie cutter

this I wasn't using a cookie cutter
setup<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:31.830> any<00:00:32.010> of<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.220> specs<00:00:32.460> every<00:00:33.330> spec

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
setup for any of the specs every spec

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.060 
setup for any of the specs every spec
was<00:00:33.750> set<00:00:33.900> up<00:00:33.989> specifically<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.830> get<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
was set up specifically just to get the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
was set up specifically just to get the
most<00:00:35.250> bursts<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.000> spec<00:00:36.330> now<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
most bursts out of that spec now the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.360 
most bursts out of that spec now the
question<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.260> which<00:00:37.500> specs<00:00:37.830> burst<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
question is which specs burst is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.310 
question is which specs burst is
currently<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> strongest<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.449> patch<00:00:39.690> 6.2
