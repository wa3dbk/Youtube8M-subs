find<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:27.849> so<00:03:28.849> let's<00:03:29.209> control<00:03:29.690> f<00:03:30.519> because

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
find it in it so let's control f because

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:50.000 
find it in it so let's control f because
we<00:03:31.700> are<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.910> PC<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:36.200> there's<00:03:36.440> nobody<00:03:36.769> in<00:03:36.890> here

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:04:03.500 

simony<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:55.170> let's<00:03:55.379> try<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.650> find<00:03:56.069> it<00:04:02.299> so<00:04:03.299> there

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
simony so let's try to find it so there

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.920 
simony so let's try to find it so there
was<00:04:03.659> no<00:04:05.659> there<00:04:06.659> was<00:04:06.810> no<00:04:08.120> price<00:04:09.120> for<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> common

was no there was no price for a common
to<00:04:10.049> most<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.970> we<00:04:18.090> found<00:04:18.329> an<00:04:18.449> yield<00:04:18.660> is<00:04:18.840> going<00:04:19.049> to

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
to most so we found an yield is going to

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:26.260 
to most so we found an yield is going to
win<00:04:21.800> so<00:04:22.800> let's<00:04:23.400> see<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.669> favorite<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.180> here
