00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
don't want to use it to talk up for that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.640 
don't want to use it to talk up for that
to<00:01:32.159> 0<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> suggest<00:01:34.020> using<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.409> cause

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
to 0 and but I suggest using it cause

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.480 
to 0 and but I suggest using it cause
it's<00:01:35.040> really<00:01:35.220> good

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
it's really good

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.660 
it's really good
anti-aliasing<00:01:36.240> solution<00:01:37.189> if<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> don't<00:01:38.460> use

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
anti-aliasing solution if you don't use

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.350 
anti-aliasing solution if you don't use
MSAA<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> quite<00:01:39.900> taxing<00:01:40.200> GTA<00:01:40.950> 5<00:01:41.360> so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
MSAA because it is quite taxing GTA 5 so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.219 
MSAA because it is quite taxing GTA 5 so
that's<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.079> show<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that's it and I'm going to show you a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.810 
that's it and I'm going to show you a
