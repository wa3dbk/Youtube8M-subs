the actual filter on my tank right now
the<00:00:46.559> flow<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:46.980> down<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:48.090> bit<00:00:48.440> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the flow is down just a little bit and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.400 
the flow is down just a little bit and
we<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> actually<00:00:50.100> take<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.410> see

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
we can actually take that up and see

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.770 
we can actually take that up and see
that<00:00:52.680> flow<00:00:53.010> flow<00:00:53.969> rate<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.600> better

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
