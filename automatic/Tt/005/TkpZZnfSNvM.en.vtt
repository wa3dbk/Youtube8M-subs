00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
video the optical image stabilization in

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
video the optical image stabilization in
the<00:00:52.320> video<00:00:52.560> recording<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.400> lot<00:00:53.640> better<00:00:53.760> on

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the video recording is a lot better on

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.600 
the video recording is a lot better on
the<00:00:54.090> 920<00:00:54.770> you<00:00:55.770> won't<00:00:55.950> get<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.220> much<00:00:56.370> movement

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
the 920 you won't get as much movement

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.319 
the 920 you won't get as much movement
and<00:00:57.060> the<00:00:57.900> low<00:00:58.050> light<00:00:58.290> is<00:00:58.880> fantastic<00:00:59.880> in<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and the low light is fantastic in the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.660 
and the low light is fantastic in the
video<00:01:00.570> recording<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:01.380> so<00:01:02.280> let's<00:01:02.520> take<00:01:02.610> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
video recording as well so let's take a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.660 
video recording as well so let's take a
look<00:01:02.880> at<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.060> size<00:01:03.240> difference<00:01:04.460> here<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.549> can

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
look at the size difference here you can

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.820 
look at the size difference here you can
see<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.050> move<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.170> phones<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.740> way

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
little bit more size right there they're

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
little bit more size right there they're
lined<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.570> left<00:01:42.870> and<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.530> 920<00:01:44.159> is

lined up on the left and the 920 is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.859 
lined up on the left and the 920 is
definitely<00:01:44.729> bigger<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.450> terms<00:01:48.659> of

definitely bigger and then in terms of

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
definitely bigger and then in terms of
thickness<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:51.570> 808<00:01:52.260> is<00:01:52.470> slightly<00:01:53.460> thicker

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
thickness the 808 is slightly thicker

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.660 
thickness the 808 is slightly thicker
it's<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.840> rounded<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:56.250> doesn't<00:01:56.520> slip

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it's not as rounded and it doesn't slip

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
the camera hump right there makes a big

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.649 
the camera hump right there makes a big
difference<00:02:01.790> at<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> top<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
difference at the top we have the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.210 
difference at the top we have the
headphone<00:02:04.439> jack<00:02:04.470> in<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> middle<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.189> the

look at the screen difference real quick
right<00:03:01.380> now<00:03:01.640> we<00:03:02.640> have<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:06.209> 920<00:03:06.810> at<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.700> middle

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
right now we have the 920 at the middle

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.780 
right now we have the 920 at the middle
level<00:03:09.450> for<00:03:09.660> brightness<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:11.100> 808<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.640> that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
level for brightness and the 808 is that

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.660 
level for brightness and the 808 is that
full<00:03:12.060> brightness<00:03:12.770> will<00:03:13.770> put<00:03:14.010> both<00:03:14.250> at<00:03:14.489> full

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
full brightness will put both at full

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.440 
full brightness will put both at full
brightness<00:03:16.280> go<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.459> settings<00:03:17.880> here

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.369 

and<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:24.489> way<00:03:24.610> we<00:03:24.790> could<00:03:24.910> compare<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.989> oops

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
and that way we could compare it oops

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.400 
and that way we could compare it oops
let's<00:03:26.800> see<00:03:27.010> turn<00:03:27.400> them<00:03:27.489> both<00:03:27.640> on<00:03:27.849> high<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.870> 808

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
let's see turn them both on high the 808

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.430 
let's see turn them both on high the 808
is<00:03:29.530> already<00:03:29.739> on<00:03:29.830> high<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.810> there<00:03:35.110> we<00:03:35.260> have<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
is already on high so there we have the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.140 
is already on high so there we have the
screen<00:03:35.800> difference<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:36.670> kind<00:03:36.879> of<00:03:36.910> hard<00:03:37.090> to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
screen difference it's kind of hard to

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.140 
screen difference it's kind of hard to
tell<00:03:37.239> unless<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> similar<00:03:38.349> screen

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
tell unless you have a similar screen

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.240 
tell unless you have a similar screen
background<00:03:41.160> will<00:03:42.160> go<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:43.890> yeah<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:44.980> have<00:03:45.099> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
background will go to yeah I have the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.400 
background will go to yeah I have the
hardware<00:03:45.519> off<00:03:45.819> I<00:03:46.120> mean<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.480> Wi-Fi<00:03:46.930> off<00:03:47.170> right

now so this phone is offline there you
have<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.209> phone<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.690> photo<00:03:53.019> different<00:03:53.530> I

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
mean they have screen difference we'll

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.640 
mean they have screen difference we'll
go<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.319> photo<00:03:57.690> take<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.720> look<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:59.049> photo<00:03:59.319> here

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650

go to a photo take a look a photo here
they're<00:04:00.069> not<00:04:00.220> going<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.400> be<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.549> same<00:04:00.790> photo

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
they're not going to be the same photo

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.920 
they're not going to be the same photo
but

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.520 

see<00:04:07.530> if<00:04:07.620> we<00:04:07.709> could<00:04:07.859> find<00:04:08.040> one<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:08.549> similar

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.940 

so<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.310> terms<00:04:14.490> of<00:04:14.640> screen<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:16.320> 920<00:04:16.769> has<00:04:16.920> a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
so in terms of screen the 920 has a

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.180 
so in terms of screen the 920 has a
higher<00:04:17.190> resolution<00:04:17.459> screen<00:04:18.620> in<00:04:19.620> person<00:04:20.070> it

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
higher resolution screen in person it

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.909 
higher resolution screen in person it
looks<00:04:20.220> better<00:04:20.609> in<00:04:20.959> daylight<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.590> looks<00:04:22.620> better

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
looks better in daylight it looks better

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.850 
looks better in daylight it looks better
in<00:04:23.370> almost<00:04:24.150> every<00:04:24.570> situation<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.139> 920<00:04:25.590> screen

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
in almost every situation the 920 screen

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.430 
in almost every situation the 920 screen
is<00:04:25.980> going<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.250> be<00:04:26.340> much<00:04:26.610> better<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.600> has<00:04:27.840> LCD

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440
