00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
let's fly around a bit let's see by the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.960 
let's fly around a bit let's see by the
way<00:02:40.250> when<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:40.850> downloaded<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:41.840> game<00:02:41.959> on<00:02:42.380> my

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
way when I downloaded this game on my

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.500 
way when I downloaded this game on my
Nexus<00:02:43.970> 7<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.989> was<00:02:45.200> lugging<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.830> lot<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.880> actually

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
Nexus 7 it was lugging a lot it actually

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.590 
Nexus 7 it was lugging a lot it actually
took<00:02:47.780> some<00:02:47.840> time<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.739> settle<00:02:48.980> down<00:02:49.450> before<00:02:50.450> it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
took some time to settle down before it

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.680 
took some time to settle down before it
actually<00:02:51.440> ran<00:02:51.680> smooth<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.549> I<00:02:52.790> think<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.420> took

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
actually ran smooth I I think it took

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.289 
actually ran smooth I I think it took
around<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:54.170> day<00:02:54.440> or<00:02:54.620> two<00:02:54.860> before<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.970> ran<00:02:56.269> the

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
around a day or two before it ran the
