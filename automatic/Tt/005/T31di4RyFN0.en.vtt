00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.490
 silence 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.070

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:38.630

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.060
 and I was listening to you guys so 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.900
 So much energy does not have much to do 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.900
 to lower the volume of game 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.380
 executing is that what I'm listening to is 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.060
 the good 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.270
 it is as if he knew at all times where 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.270
 is 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.439
 stretching in a helicopter 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.550
 is a grenade and what motivated the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.140
 generation 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.470
 but with nothing this which is going to end 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.310
 already 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.610

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.210

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.069

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.959
 I think it would last a few 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.560
 episodes without dying so I do not expect anything 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.280
