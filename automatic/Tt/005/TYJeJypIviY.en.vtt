00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 Then it's Star Wars and it's still 25 minutes 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:12.879
 I will explain from people who do not see that first Star Wars 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:16.930
 Kedomo it's difficult to explain and great for people who have not seen it Star Wars 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:22.930
 First, it's there in Hano Marvel Avengers series so-called 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:26.140
 We are making by adding the 8 What Do Iron Man and the passer mighty saw Toka kind of 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:31.330
 The Avengers Series There are those Avengers Series 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:36.920
 That and after Harry Potter, including Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Hobbit 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:41.390
 Three I bet that you, as divided by the three added to 2 out of 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.170
 It wasn't divided by 3 and it's better to add 3 to each one 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.990
 Say 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:50.940
 A first appeal to the character from the Avengers this is of 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:56.340
 It is this Star Wars newspaper that I tried to show you in the middle, and what is great in the middle 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:01.320
 Can be a real Kedomo've got there is the Tteyuu that person character correlation diagram lucky in 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.170
 In'm Teru character here is a list of so-called episode 1 to 6 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.980
 It is already very easy to understand, but 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.000
 This is Star Wars on the other side 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.850
 Say Datte 101 characters 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.720
 This understanding correlation diagram is an extremely accurate Kedomo I thought I really wonder if 101 also are you 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.030
 Easy 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.720
 So there is only 350 yen, but this is a bad sound New chapter is better than something else, and it is information 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.220
 There to 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.990
 Repeatedly because I still sell at the convenience store I forgot I actually have my own too today 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.290
 Because there was but went Nearby circle k Sunkus 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.290
 At least Circle k Sunkus of Inari town still some remaining 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.140
 Yes 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.040
 In a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.090
 Such a character's negative power is great. This 110 characters have a great presence. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.270
 I have it, but it is also 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.800
 The characters are more attractive than the Avengers series 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.960
 Sense of scale to do than the Lord of the Rings that do Kano that Peter Jackson movie 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.490
 What's the difference between Star Warson's first heard Star Wars and other sfa 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.130
 Heel I first 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.140
 Ennis 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.619
 The place where there is a pail can or dignity is also different, so Abrams is this time 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:10.649
 I'm doing Star Wars-like things in Starboard trailers 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.610
 In it is to say that the dignity to hey Mostly who will bring to the shooting director 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.569
 It is decided 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.129
 In other words after exposure 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:23.900
 How much under-provisioning the so-called French pros are botfathers 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:29.150
 Because it does not have to be reflected in the film when I made it 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:33.769
 When the tray and And then the entire film has a tint of Park color Tteyuu Golden amber 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.560
 So I advocate that the whole film shifts to a slightly yellowish color. 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.670
 Follow 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.800
 It's taken it brought the most famous was the riot somehow Tteko's time in Choi 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.980
 Abrams and how to get this falcon flying with cg x 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.630
 Such cinematographer specific originally because 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.250
 Are made with properly Kedomo'm hard to make great to give some of that what I mean Kana dignity 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.550
 From 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.860
 I know I am Abrams 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.780
 Yeah'm thought 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.190
 I Harry than I think there is a sense of scale when there is a depth to the meeting to defend the kind of Labor ring 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.800
 After all potter 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:11.700
 There 's a lot of good and bad news about it, but I'll explain this later 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.850
 It is said that the fun of Star Wars is not open 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.200
 The whole thing is not open, but the system is up in front of the Jedi 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.890
 It's not anything, but there are two conflicting things, what are they 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.750
 Or 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.680
 I think that I'm the closest to this in Japan it and split's hit the last round of the Five squadron die Ranger 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.400
 I'm 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.720
 What is coming out at the climax ? 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.840
 Say and what is there justice Tteyuu die ranger at anything in saying that accession Tteyuu arrogance 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.580
 It is said that 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.330
 But simply because there is justice Kedomo What claims in the same way as The Dark Knight of the Batman 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.800
 There is evil 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:50.750
 It is a story that because there is evil there is no one without each other if you do justice 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:55.860
 In the final round of the five-star squadron di-ranger the di-ranger waits for a bribe to destroy the enemy organization 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:04:01.980
 Then everyone is not transformed and suddenly the TV for that program 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:06.700
 The last one minute of the last episode of the TV series will be talked about 30 years later and after 30 years the dome will be 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:12.099
 Former spokesman who became a grandfather's old lady When you say resurrected did in the forward-inclusive 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:17.470
 It is the last scene that everyone, such as atypical Madame spy girls, turns and fights 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.889
 It was not good for peace to come, but because the world is visiting peace, neither justice nor evil will be lost. 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.960
 The 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:26.720
 Dubbo star squadron die do exciting day-to-day begins to fight or Toka justice and up the future 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.510
 Tteyuu I look ninja squadron Kakurenja from the next Ranger is that Tsu end 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.280
 Hmm 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:35.470
 It was gay but it was 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.889
 Since Yappa seen with me Dairenji of time and daughters of Well it was harder to Okada die Ranger 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.840
 The 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:46.790
 I 've already looked at it really since I was 6 years old . 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.010
 And it's better than Harry Potter and it 's not like that in the pod, it's really bad overall 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:54.440
 I I'm to believe the author himself say 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:05:00.350
 It is also because it belongs to Halipota Nude, the correct answer is before and Volde mode is 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.740
 The world is caught because there are myself think is simply the British to Fu that it is wickedness in 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.910
 After all the place where it is finished 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.020
 I think that there is no depth I think that character from such Avengers 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.000
 Attractive 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:16.199
 There is a dignity from scale in the meeting than that of the Lord of the Rings and more than Harry Potter 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.319
 This should be held as a beginner if there is a deep story 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.319
 I think these three points are interesting in Star Wars
