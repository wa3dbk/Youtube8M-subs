00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700

than<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.240> regular<00:01:24.960> Wolverine<00:01:25.380> mask<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.939> eyes

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
than a regular Wolverine mask the eyes

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.200 
than a regular Wolverine mask the eyes
and<00:01:27.509> teeth<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.960> been<00:01:27.990> painted<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> gloss

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
and teeth have been painted with a gloss

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.640 
and teeth have been painted with a gloss
so<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.750> mean<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> other<00:01:31.259> parts<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so the I mean the other parts of the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.670 
so the I mean the other parts of the
mouth<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.640> way<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:33.530> give<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
mouth as well that way they give it a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560 
mouth as well that way they give it a
little<00:01:34.829> bit<00:01:34.979> more<00:01:35.159> realism<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:36.210> actually

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
little bit more realism that actually

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.460 
little bit more realism that actually
looks<00:01:36.810> wet<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.750> shiny<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.110> rest<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
looks wet and shiny the rest of the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.160 
looks wet and shiny the rest of the
figure<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.920> relatively<00:01:41.579> matte<00:01:41.990> their<00:01:42.990> lights

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
figure is relatively matte their lights

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.469 
figure is relatively matte their lights
making<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> look<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.820> brown<00:01:45.030> parts<00:01:45.360> are

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
making it look like the brown parts are

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.850 
making it look like the brown parts are
a<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:45.659> shiny<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.320> they're<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.590> really

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
a little shiny but they're not really

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.620 
a little shiny but they're not really
it's<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.430> texture<00:01:47.970> reflecting<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it's just the texture reflecting the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.170 
it's just the texture reflecting the
light<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> wraps<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> super

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
light and then the wraps are a super

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.749 
light and then the wraps are a super
flat<00:01:51.479> paint<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.740> they<00:01:53.280> look<00:01:53.520> actually

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
flat paint so that they look actually

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.380 
flat paint so that they look actually
like<00:01:54.799> rock<00:01:55.799> wraps<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.430> don't<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.729> any<00:01:56.880> Sheen

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.480 
to them at all the claws do have a
little<00:02:00.600> bit<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.990> gloss<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.530> them<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.369> a

little bit of a gloss to them just a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
little bit of a gloss to them just a
little<00:02:02.729> bit<00:02:02.939> because<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.600> wanted<00:02:03.840> them<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> look

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
little bit because I wanted them to look

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.389 
little bit because I wanted them to look
like<00:02:04.439> bone<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.460> bones<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:07.069> don't<00:02:08.069> know<00:02:08.310> I've

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
like bone and bones I don't know I've

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.160 
like bone and bones I don't know I've
never<00:02:08.610> seen<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.119> bone<00:02:09.300> claws<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.750> person

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
never seen really bone claws in person

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.979 
never seen really bone claws in person
maybe<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.470> guys<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.870> would<00:02:12.870> be

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
maybe you guys have that would be

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.820 
maybe you guys have that would be
interesting<00:02:13.410> if<00:02:13.500> that's

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
interesting if that's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.220 
interesting if that's
the<00:02:13.890> case<00:02:14.100> but<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.760> think<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.720> looks<00:02:15.750> cool<00:02:16.110> like

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
the case but I think it looks cool like

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.530 
the case but I think it looks cool like
that<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.590> gives<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.860> little<00:02:17.010> contrast<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.910> those

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that it gives a little contrast so those

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.750 
that it gives a little contrast so those
are<00:02:18.690> mostly<00:02:18.960> gloss<00:02:19.230> white<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.100> little<00:02:20.670> bit

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
are mostly gloss white with a little bit

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.420 
are mostly gloss white with a little bit
of<00:02:20.850> shading<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:21.330> them<00:02:21.950> then<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.070> whole<00:02:23.220> body

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
of shading on them then the whole body

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.950 
of shading on them then the whole body
was<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:23.700> painted<00:02:24.150> black<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.630> couple

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
was just painted black with a couple

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.810 
was just painted black with a couple

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
layers of brown dry brushing to get the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.310 
layers of brown dry brushing to get the
texture<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:30.270> feet<00:02:30.510> were<00:02:30.630> sculpted<00:02:31.140> with

texture and the feet were sculpted with

necessary<00:03:17.430> anyways<00:03:17.730> these<00:03:18.000> ankle<00:03:18.330> joints

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
necessary anyways these ankle joints

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.600 
necessary anyways these ankle joints
have<00:03:18.750> tons<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.170> motion<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:19.830> them<00:03:20.070> range<00:03:20.459> of

have tons of motion in them range of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.210 
have tons of motion in them range of
motion<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.440> having<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.680> toe<00:03:22.860> joint<00:03:23.100> in

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.620 
motion so having the toe joint in
there's<00:03:23.370> not<00:03:23.519> really<00:03:23.760> necessary<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.480> my

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
there's not really necessary in my

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.699 
there's not really necessary in my
opinion<00:03:25.880> but<00:03:26.880> uh<00:03:27.110> he's<00:03:28.110> got<00:03:28.320> lots<00:03:28.530> of

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
opinion but uh he's got lots of

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.509 
opinion but uh he's got lots of
poseability

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
poseability

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.820 
poseability
this<00:03:29.850> figure<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.510> really<00:03:31.140> cool<00:03:31.290> figured<00:03:31.620> have

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
this figure so really cool figured have

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.949 
this figure so really cool figured have
even<00:03:32.190> if<00:03:32.280> you're<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.489> big<00:03:32.700> Dakin<00:03:33.150> fan<00:03:33.450> this

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
even if you're not a big Dakin fan this

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.660 
even if you're not a big Dakin fan this
is<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.230> nice<00:03:34.739> one<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.070> add<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.489> collection

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
is a nice one to add to the collection

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.740 
is a nice one to add to the collection
because<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:37.290> poses<00:03:37.769> really<00:03:38.130> well<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.750> is

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
because it just poses really well and is

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.350 
because it just poses really well and is
becoming<00:03:40.080> more<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.500> popular<00:03:40.920> character<00:03:41.400> so

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
becoming more of a popular character so

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.640 
becoming more of a popular character so
I<00:03:42.390> assume<00:03:42.840> that's<00:03:43.019> why<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.230> keep<00:03:43.500> getting

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
I assume that's why I keep getting

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.710
