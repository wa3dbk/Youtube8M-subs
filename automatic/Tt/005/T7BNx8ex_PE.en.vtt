00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.980 

so<00:00:08.820> while<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.120> just<00:00:09.300> do<00:00:09.390> this<00:00:09.510> early<00:00:09.840> game

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
so while we just do this early game

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.890 
so while we just do this early game
basically<00:00:10.470> the<00:00:11.250> idea<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.850> a<00:00:12.210> probe

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
basically the idea is that a probe

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.690 
basically the idea is that a probe
setting<00:00:13.320> up<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.500> pile<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:13.920> being<00:00:14.280> able<00:00:14.430> to<00:00:14.490> warp

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
setting up a pile on being able to warp

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.850 
setting up a pile on being able to warp
in<00:00:14.850> units<00:00:15.180> near<00:00:15.389> your<00:00:15.540> base<00:00:15.690> spells<00:00:16.290> your<00:00:16.620> doom

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
in units near your base spells your doom

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.450 
in units near your base spells your doom
as<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.160> zerg<00:00:17.490> player<00:00:18.560> especially<00:00:19.560> when<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.430> are

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
as a zerg player especially when you are

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.370 
as a zerg player especially when you are
relying<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.270> zergling<00:00:21.630> speed<00:00:21.870> because<00:00:22.110> guess

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
relying on zergling speed because guess

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.740 
relying on zergling speed because guess
what<00:00:22.650> having<00:00:23.369> wings<00:00:23.610> on<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.940> circling<00:00:24.420> doesn't

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
what having wings on a circling doesn't

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.270 
what having wings on a circling doesn't
make<00:00:24.870> that<00:00:25.050> clause<00:00:25.350> any<00:00:25.650> tougher<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.070> doesn't

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
make that clause any tougher it doesn't

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.550 
make that clause any tougher it doesn't
make<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.520> are<00:00:26.760> more<00:00:27.030> in<00:00:27.120> each<00:00:27.270> offer<00:00:27.560> they

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
make that are more in each offer they

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.320 
make that are more in each offer they
can<00:00:28.740> run<00:00:28.950> around<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.370> lot<00:00:29.520> faster<00:00:29.940> that's<00:00:30.120> nice

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
can run around a lot faster that's nice

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.569 
can run around a lot faster that's nice
they<00:00:30.600> look<00:00:30.630> pretty<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.530> they<00:00:31.680> actually<00:00:32.430> don't

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

especially around your third base area

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:00.919 
especially around your third base area
is<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.819> the<00:00:59.940> real<00:01:00.089> point<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.510> contention

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
is that's the real point of contention

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.989 
is that's the real point of contention
in<00:01:01.260> zvp<00:01:01.589> reacts<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> third<00:01:02.460> base<00:01:02.729> and<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
on on overgrowth because overgrowth is a

new<00:01:15.689> maps<00:01:15.930> command<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.380> very<00:01:16.560> important<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
new maps command is very important to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
new maps command is very important to
find<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.729> only<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.119> keep<00:01:18.299> Highland

can always figure out where the key ones

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.249 
can always figure out where the key ones
are<00:01:21.960> right<00:01:22.259> well<00:01:23.009> there's<00:01:23.399> you<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.579> there's

can I and get towards our third base
normally<00:01:33.180> one's<00:01:33.630> Oakland<00:01:34.079> goes<00:01:34.259> straight<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
normally one's Oakland goes straight to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.590 
normally one's Oakland goes straight to
outside<00:01:35.070> their<00:01:35.280> natural<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:36.090> goes<00:01:36.270> straight

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
outside their natural one goes straight

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.999 
outside their natural one goes straight
to<00:01:36.719> their<00:01:36.899> third<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.619> other<00:01:37.649> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to their third and then the other to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.450 
to their third and then the other to
scout<00:01:38.880> our<00:01:39.180> side<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.689> map<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:41.009> idea<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
scout our side of the map the idea is to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.099 
scout our side of the map the idea is to
set<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:41.789> safety<00:01:42.030> zones<00:01:42.390> right<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:42.960> you've

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
set up safety zones right so if you've

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:44.810 
set up safety zones right so if you've
got<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.409> left<00:01:43.590> hand<00:01:43.770> side<00:01:43.859> watchtower<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
got the left hand side watchtower and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
got the left hand side watchtower and
you've<00:01:45.659> got<00:01:45.869> there

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you've got there

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.429 
you've got there
third<00:01:46.860> base<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.520> ogling<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:49.110> only

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
third base is ogling down there the only

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.200 
third base is ogling down there the only
path<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.280> along<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> left-hand<00:01:51.030> side

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
path is right along the left-hand side

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.240 
path is right along the left-hand side
they<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.659> actually<00:01:51.780> sneak<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.920> without

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
they can actually sneak out and without

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.679 
they can actually sneak out and without
entering<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:53.850> watched<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.180> version<00:01:54.570> just

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
entering your watched I version just

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.719 
entering your watched I version just
they<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.530> directly<00:01:56.040> along<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> left

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
they can go directly along the left

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.460 
they can go directly along the left
behind<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.299> minerals<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.350> get

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
behind that minerals and they can get

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.870 
behind that minerals and they can get
right<00:01:58.830> down<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.159> left-hand<00:01:59.490> side<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.850> just

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
right down the left-hand side so just

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.490 
right down the left-hand side so just
ones<00:02:00.240> oh<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.659> anywhere<00:02:01.170> along<00:02:01.409> that

left-hand<00:02:02.009> side<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.430> map<00:02:02.579> will<00:02:02.729> cut<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
left-hand side of the map will cut that

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.279 
left-hand side of the map will cut that
off<00:02:03.119> okay<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:05.520> your<00:02:06.210> Zhuge<00:02:06.509> llings<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:06.990> just

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
off okay so your Zhuge llings have just

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.900 
off okay so your Zhuge llings have just
popped<00:02:07.439> out<00:02:07.679> for<00:02:08.009> zerglings<00:02:08.519> have<00:02:08.729> just

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
popped out for zerglings have just

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.790 
popped out for zerglings have just
popped<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.209> for<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.630> you're<00:02:10.380> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.619> send

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
popped out for you you're going to send

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400 
popped out for you you're going to send
you<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:11.099> some<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.300> scout<00:02:13.050> out<00:02:13.200> these

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
you know some of them to scout out these

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.860 
you know some of them to scout out these
up<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:14.160> bit<00:02:14.670> obviously<00:02:14.940> those<00:02:15.150> three<00:02:15.450> spots<00:02:15.720> are

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
up a bit obviously those three spots are

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.900 
up a bit obviously those three spots are
quite<00:02:16.019> important<00:02:16.349> but<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.099> other<00:02:17.280> three<00:02:17.550> big

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
quite important but the other three big

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.910 
quite important but the other three big
ones<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.450> map<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.650> high

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
ones on this map just on that high

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.809 
ones on this map just on that high
ground<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:21.150> behind<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.510> gold<00:02:21.690> base<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.819> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
ground just behind the gold base and the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.820 
ground just behind the gold base and the
nastiest<00:02:24.299> of<00:02:24.540> all<00:02:24.600> which<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.350> actually<00:02:25.470> forgot

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
nastiest of all which I actually forgot

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.660 
nastiest of all which I actually forgot
yesterday<00:02:27.049> when<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.080> was<00:02:28.230> playing<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.590> game<00:02:28.799> it's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
yesterday when I was playing a game it's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:39.150 
yesterday when I was playing a game it's
down<00:02:29.880> there<00:02:30.060> behind<00:02:30.330> those<00:02:30.540> rocks

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.100 

so<00:02:40.160> realistically<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.570> spot<00:02:41.780> on<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.930> right

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
so realistically the spot on the right

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.170 
so realistically the spot on the right
hand<00:02:42.320> side<00:02:42.440> not<00:02:42.860> as<00:02:42.980> important<00:02:43.490> because<00:02:43.700> it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
hand side not as important because it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.610 
hand side not as important because it
only<00:02:44.390> gives<00:02:44.570> them<00:02:44.750> access<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.140> your<00:02:45.350> natural

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
only gives them access to your natural

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.240 
only gives them access to your natural
which<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.340> kind<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.760> natural<00:02:47.180> strong<00:02:47.540> point

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
which is kind of a natural strong point

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.200 
which is kind of a natural strong point
because<00:02:49.250> you've<00:02:49.400> got<00:02:49.520> all<00:02:49.610> your<00:02:49.640> production

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
because you've got all your production

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.420 
because you've got all your production
kind<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.510> sent<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.870> around<00:02:50.960> that<00:02:51.230> location<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
kind of sent it around that location the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.550 
kind of sent it around that location the
third<00:02:52.700> base<00:02:52.940> is<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.270> real<00:02:53.450> sort<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.900> isolated

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
third base is the real sort of isolated

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.890 
third base is the real sort of isolated
one<00:02:54.920> which<00:02:55.130> can<00:02:55.340> get<00:02:55.490> picked<00:02:55.700> off<00:02:55.850> more<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:56.720> one

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
one which can get picked off more so one

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.900 
one which can get picked off more so one
of<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.050> big<00:02:57.200> issues<00:02:57.230> with<00:02:57.770> doing<00:02:57.950> any<00:02:58.550> sort<00:02:58.820> of

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
of the big issues with doing any sort of

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.970 
of the big issues with doing any sort of
scouting<00:02:59.209> at<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.450> start<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.750> zvp<00:03:00.050> is<00:03:00.290> you've

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
scouting at the start of zvp is you've

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.710 
scouting at the start of zvp is you've
got<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.220> search<00:03:01.459> for<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.060> pylons<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:02.600> we've

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
got a search for the pylons but we've

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.330 
got a search for the pylons but we've
also<00:03:02.900> got<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.200> get<00:03:03.320> zerglings<00:03:03.770> across<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.160> map

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
also got to get zerglings across the map

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.900 
also got to get zerglings across the map
very<00:03:04.640> quickly<00:03:05.350> because<00:03:06.490> otherwise<00:03:07.490> they<00:03:07.760> can

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
very quickly because otherwise they can

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.640 
very quickly because otherwise they can
just<00:03:08.060> send<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.270> probe<00:03:08.480> out<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.810> front<00:03:09.080> if<00:03:09.230> you

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
just send a probe out the front if you

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.900 
just send a probe out the front if you
know<00:03:09.800> if<00:03:09.920> we're<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.220> busy<00:03:10.340> searching<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
know if we're so busy searching the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.400 
know if we're so busy searching the
corners<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.510> then<00:03:11.660> like<00:03:11.810> by<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:11.989> time<00:03:12.110> we<00:03:12.350> get

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
corners and then like by the time we get

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.840 
corners and then like by the time we get
across<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.800> map<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.100> probes<00:03:13.340> actually<00:03:13.670> just

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
across the map the probes actually just

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.760 
across the map the probes actually just
snuck<00:03:14.090> past<00:03:14.120> through<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.050> front<00:03:15.320> it's

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
snuck past through like the front it's

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.350 
snuck past through like the front it's
literally<00:03:16.160> just<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.430> walked<00:03:16.730> up<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.150> set<00:03:17.270> up

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
literally just like walked up and set up

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.110 
literally just like walked up and set up
a<00:03:17.450> pylon<00:03:17.890> that<00:03:18.890> can<00:03:19.040> be<00:03:19.160> a<00:03:19.190> big<00:03:19.340> problem<00:03:19.459> so

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
a pylon that can be a big problem so

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.520 
a pylon that can be a big problem so
let's<00:03:20.300> imagine<00:03:20.420> you've<00:03:20.840> just<00:03:21.050> started<00:03:21.260> our

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
let's imagine you've just started our

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.590 
let's imagine you've just started our
first<00:03:21.830> thing<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:22.850> want<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.030> do<00:03:23.150> like<00:03:23.300> I<00:03:23.360> said<00:03:23.570> I

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
first thing you want to do like I said I

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.030 
first thing you want to do like I said I
send<00:03:23.840> one<00:03:23.870> zergling<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.530> outside<00:03:24.860> their

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
send one zergling to outside their

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.860 
send one zergling to outside their
natural<00:03:25.220> ones<00:03:25.850> opening<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.360> outside<00:03:26.690> their

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
natural ones opening to outside their

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.460 
natural ones opening to outside their
third<00:03:27.080> using<00:03:27.500> just<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.830> D<00:03:27.980> selecting<00:03:28.489> and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
third using just that D selecting and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.990 
third using just that D selecting and
then<00:03:30.470> with<00:03:30.800> these<00:03:30.950> other<00:03:31.100> two<00:03:31.310> now<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:31.670> want<00:03:31.880> you

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
then with these other two now I want you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.880 
then with these other two now I want you
to<00:03:32.060> put<00:03:32.209> those<00:03:32.330> on<00:03:32.570> paths<00:03:32.840> where<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.650> search

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
to put those on paths where you search

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.400 
to put those on paths where you search
all<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.459> those<00:03:34.580> key<00:03:34.850> locations<00:03:35.480> just<00:03:36.140> give<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
all of those key locations just give the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.990 
all of those key locations just give the
command<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.800> both<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:37.520> we're<00:03:37.640> going<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.820> give

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
command to both so we're going to give

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.900 
command to both so we're going to give
this<00:03:38.120> big<00:03:38.420> long<00:03:39.130> rambling<00:03:40.130> queued<00:03:40.489> up<00:03:40.580> attack

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
this big long rambling queued up attack

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.520 
this big long rambling queued up attack
move<00:03:41.150> command<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:42.140> then<00:03:42.260> we're<00:03:42.380> going<00:03:42.470> to

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
move command but then we're going to

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.900 
move command but then we're going to
deselect<00:03:42.920> one<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.489> we<00:03:43.549> going<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.730> give<00:03:43.820> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
deselect one and we going to give the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.820 
deselect one and we going to give the
other<00:03:44.030> one<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.209> different<00:03:44.570> path<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.530> as<00:03:45.650> long<00:03:45.769> as

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
other one a different path so as long as

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.800 
other one a different path so as long as
you've<00:03:46.070> got<00:03:46.100> both<00:03:46.700> guys<00:03:46.970> checking<00:03:47.330> different

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
you've got both guys checking different

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.090 
you've got both guys checking different
areas<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.290> then<00:03:48.410> going<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.830> kind<00:03:49.040> of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
areas and then going to the kind of

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.440 
areas and then going to the kind of
assay<00:03:49.310> of<00:03:49.340> certain<00:03:49.640> points<00:03:49.940> you've<00:03:50.090> got<00:03:50.269> like

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
assay of certain points you've got like

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.110 
assay of certain points you've got like
a<00:03:50.480> ninety<00:03:50.900> percent<00:03:51.019> well<00:03:51.980> 95%<00:03:52.910> plus

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
a ninety percent well 95% plus

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.970 
a ninety percent well 95% plus
probability<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.840> catching<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.410> do<00:03:54.890> you

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
probability of catching it do you

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.220 
probability of catching it do you
separate<00:03:55.760> them<00:03:55.910> I'd<00:03:56.360> separate<00:03:56.840> them<00:03:56.959> straight

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
separate them I'd separate them straight

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.900 
separate them I'd separate them straight
away<00:03:57.260> just<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.920> reason<00:03:58.459> you're<00:03:58.580> giving<00:03:58.820> the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
away just the reason you're giving the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.910 
away just the reason you're giving the
order<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.360> both<00:03:59.600> is<00:03:59.900> just<00:04:00.530> for<00:04:00.739> your

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
order to both is just for your

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.280 
order to both is just for your
efficiency

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
efficiency

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.369 
efficiency
so<00:04:02.950> at<00:04:03.219> the<00:04:03.430> end<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:03.939> you<00:04:04.840> want<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.079> have

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
so at the end of this you want to have

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.020 
so at the end of this you want to have
one's<00:04:05.709> own<00:04:05.920> I'm<00:04:06.099> sitting<00:04:06.400> on<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.549> watchtower

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
one's own I'm sitting on the watchtower

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.789 
one's own I'm sitting on the watchtower
and<00:04:07.120> one<00:04:07.450> on<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.629> left<00:04:07.840> hand<00:04:07.989> side<00:04:08.109> to<00:04:08.530> create

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
and one on the left hand side to create

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.309 
and one on the left hand side to create
that<00:04:08.950> safe<00:04:09.250> so<00:04:09.459> we're<00:04:09.730> talking<00:04:09.879> about<00:04:10.239> earlier

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
that safe so we're talking about earlier

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.420 
that safe so we're talking about earlier
so<00:04:11.319> this<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.620> where<00:04:11.769> you<00:04:11.859> start<00:04:12.069> to<00:04:12.280> actually

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
so this is where you start to actually

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.059 
so this is where you start to actually
plan<00:04:13.030> where<00:04:13.689> is<00:04:13.900> easily<00:04:14.530> going<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.709> end<00:04:14.920> up

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
plan where is easily going to end up

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.349 
plan where is easily going to end up
which<00:04:15.280> areas<00:04:15.640> they're<00:04:15.819> going<00:04:15.969> to<00:04:16.030> check<00:04:16.150> its

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
which areas they're going to check its

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.749 
which areas they're going to check its
it's<00:04:17.320> incredible<00:04:17.919> how<00:04:18.009> much<00:04:18.100> detail<00:04:18.370> can

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:18.759 
it's incredible how much detail can

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.189 
it's incredible how much detail can
going<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.060> this<00:04:19.209> but<00:04:19.389> this<00:04:19.479> is<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:19.870> is<00:04:20.019> like

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
going to this but this is this is like

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.020 
going to this but this is this is like
how<00:04:20.320> you<00:04:20.380> become<00:04:20.709> cheese<00:04:21.009> proof<00:04:21.310> first<00:04:21.579> photos

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
how you become cheese proof first photos

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.600 
how you become cheese proof first photos
the<00:04:22.930> real<00:04:23.110> challenge<00:04:23.139> with<00:04:23.830> this<00:04:23.949> is<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.460> both

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
the real challenge with this is to both

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.420 
the real challenge with this is to both
cover<00:04:25.030> as<00:04:25.240> many<00:04:25.419> spots<00:04:25.780> as<00:04:25.990> possible<00:04:26.500> be<00:04:27.070> very

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
cover as many spots as possible be very

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.400 
cover as many spots as possible be very
very<00:04:27.660> particular<00:04:28.660> about<00:04:28.690> your<00:04:29.050> scouting

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
very particular about your scouting

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.689 
very particular about your scouting
whilst<00:04:30.280> also<00:04:31.110> macaran<00:04:32.110> at<00:04:32.199> the<00:04:32.289> same<00:04:32.470> time<00:04:32.710> so

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
whilst also macaran at the same time so

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:34.920 
whilst also macaran at the same time so
this<00:04:33.850> is<00:04:33.880> why<00:04:34.120> we're<00:04:34.330> going<00:04:34.479> through<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.810> in

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
this is why we're going through it in

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.499 
this is why we're going through it in
isolation<00:04:35.410> first<00:04:35.860> so<00:04:36.580> then<00:04:36.849> on<00:04:37.120> our<00:04:37.240> next

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
isolation first so then on our next

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:38.790 
isolation first so then on our next
run-through<00:04:37.720> we<00:04:37.990> can<00:04:38.110> do<00:04:38.199> it<00:04:38.320> while<00:04:38.590> your

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
run-through we can do it while your

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.620 
run-through we can do it while your
macro<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:39.400> you're<00:04:39.580> going<00:04:39.699> to<00:04:39.789> do<00:04:40.330> make

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
macro and you're going to do make

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.990 
macro and you're going to do make
mistakes<00:04:40.780> it's<00:04:41.169> fine<00:04:41.470> you're<00:04:42.430> also<00:04:42.580> people

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
mistakes it's fine you're also people

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.249 
mistakes it's fine you're also people
get<00:04:43.120> lazy<00:04:43.360> because<00:04:43.599> they're<00:04:43.810> like<00:04:43.900> oh<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.080> think

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
get lazy because they're like oh I think

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.659 
get lazy because they're like oh I think
I<00:04:44.440> just<00:04:44.470> heard<00:04:44.680> an<00:04:44.830> inject<00:04:45.130> op<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:45.430> they<00:04:45.490> just

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
I just heard an inject op and they just

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.670 
I just heard an inject op and they just
start<00:04:45.880> like<00:04:46.000> doing<00:04:46.479> really<00:04:46.720> lazy<00:04:47.050> attack<00:04:47.440> move

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
start like doing really lazy attack move

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.990 
start like doing really lazy attack move
commands<00:04:48.009> and<00:04:48.220> not<00:04:48.310> really<00:04:48.460> searching<00:04:48.910> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
commands and not really searching the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.140 
commands and not really searching the
corners

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.210 

you
