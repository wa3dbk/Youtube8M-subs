 Ghost is the colleague he comes here 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.979
 nicely taken away behind me 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:10.409

 camouflage dragon and what me what me 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.830
 it is noticeable there are always spots where 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.819
 you can still find a spot here 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.170
 and here's a spot and everywhere 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.000
 also keeps clapping here 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.190
 instead of just such a long one 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.390

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.730

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.140
 Saying and clapping was there 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.880

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.850
 gossiping there again such a box and 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.500
 there's a case just like that 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:06.190
 looks nice, I have brought away nicely 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.959
 currently saving life and so the map 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:14.769
 potro my god i knew that me 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.720

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.910
 do you like this map if you like that 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.489
 just see so I do not think so 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.110
 bad the pod map the remaining maps 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.310
 they are not real either 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.030
 not so bad at all 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.590

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.950
 cleared away 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.680
 I would have weighed it even bigger 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.510
