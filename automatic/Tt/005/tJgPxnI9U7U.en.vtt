when<00:00:12.430> I<00:00:12.460> first<00:00:12.700> got<00:00:12.820> my<00:00:13.090> shop<00:00:13.360> set<00:00:13.690> up<00:00:13.840> I<00:00:14.050> had<00:00:14.290> a

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
when I first got my shop set up I had a

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.140 
when I first got my shop set up I had a
table<00:00:14.620> saw<00:00:14.980> but<00:00:15.370> I<00:00:15.459> didn't<00:00:15.670> have<00:00:15.730> a<00:00:15.790> miter<00:00:16.059> saw

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
table saw but I didn't have a miter saw

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.420 
table saw but I didn't have a miter saw
in<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.570> shop<00:00:16.780> so<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.440> had<00:00:17.680> to<00:00:17.740> do<00:00:17.860> all<00:00:18.010> my<00:00:18.039> cross

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
in the shop so I had to do all my cross

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.490 
in the shop so I had to do all my cross
cutting<00:00:18.820> on<00:00:18.940> the<00:00:19.090> table<00:00:19.450> saw<00:00:19.630> as<00:00:19.900> accurately

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
cutting on the table saw as accurately

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.140 
cutting on the table saw as accurately
as<00:00:20.680> I<00:00:20.830> possibly<00:00:21.280> could<00:00:21.460> everything<00:00:21.789> from

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
as I possibly could everything from

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.750 
as I possibly could everything from
chair<00:00:22.720> parts<00:00:23.109> to<00:00:23.260> table<00:00:23.619> parts<00:00:23.980> to<00:00:24.189> face<00:00:24.460> range

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
chair parts to table parts to face range

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.820 
chair parts to table parts to face range
for<00:00:25.029> cabinets<00:00:25.480> everything<00:00:26.289> got<00:00:26.470> done<00:00:26.650> on<00:00:26.679> the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
for cabinets everything got done on the

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.859 
for cabinets everything got done on the
saw<00:00:27.039> so<00:00:27.670> I<00:00:27.699> learned<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.119> lot<00:00:28.240> of<00:00:28.300> good

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
saw so I learned a lot of good

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.079 
saw so I learned a lot of good
techniques<00:00:29.410> and<00:00:29.650> tips<00:00:29.859> and<00:00:30.070> tricks<00:00:30.130> about<00:00:30.820> how

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
techniques and tips and tricks about how

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.640 
techniques and tips and tricks about how
I<00:00:31.119> could<00:00:31.390> do<00:00:31.480> that<00:00:31.509> cross<00:00:31.900> cutting<00:00:32.230> so<00:00:32.439> let<00:00:32.560> me

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
I could do that cross cutting so let me

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.640 
I could do that cross cutting so let me
show<00:00:32.830> you<00:00:32.860> one<00:00:33.280> one<00:00:34.210> case<00:00:34.510> what<00:00:35.200> I<00:00:35.230> needed<00:00:35.560> to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
show you one one case what I needed to

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.389 
show you one one case what I needed to
do<00:00:35.800> was<00:00:36.490> crosscut<00:00:37.060> lots<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.480> long<00:00:37.690> parts<00:00:38.399> so

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
do was crosscut lots of long parts so

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.389 
do was crosscut lots of long parts so
one<00:00:40.360> rule<00:00:40.629> in<00:00:40.899> woodworking<00:00:41.260> is<00:00:41.590> that<00:00:41.860> you

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
one rule in woodworking is that you

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.060 
one rule in woodworking is that you
don't<00:00:42.670> want<00:00:42.879> to<00:00:43.000> use<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.989> miter<00:00:44.320> gauge<00:00:44.680> and

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
don't want to use the miter gauge and

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.340 
don't want to use the miter gauge and
the<00:00:45.640> RIP<00:00:45.820> fence<00:00:46.090> together<00:00:46.420> because<00:00:47.110> you<00:00:47.230> can

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
the RIP fence together because you can

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.720 
the RIP fence together because you can
get<00:00:47.469> a<00:00:47.500> piece<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.829> wood<00:00:47.949> trapped<00:00:48.340> in<00:00:48.550> here

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
get a piece of wood trapped in here

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.760 
get a piece of wood trapped in here
between<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.570> two<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:50.050> that's<00:00:50.469> very

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
between the two and that's very

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.510 
between the two and that's very
dangerous

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
dangerous

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.990 
dangerous
however<00:00:52.059> we<00:00:52.780> can<00:00:53.109> use<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.559> fence<00:00:53.770> as<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.100> stop

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
however we can use the fence as a stop

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.889 
however we can use the fence as a stop
block<00:00:55.270> if<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:57.280> put<00:00:57.520> a<00:00:57.550> block<00:00:57.850> like<00:00:58.090> this<00:00:58.420> on<00:00:58.690> it

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
block if we put a block like this on it

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.410 
block if we put a block like this on it
so<00:00:59.079> that<00:00:59.890> we<00:01:00.010> stand<00:01:00.340> off<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:00.910> fence<00:01:01.149> once

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
so that we stand off of the fence once

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.299 
so that we stand off of the fence once
we<00:01:01.570> start<00:01:01.840> making<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.170> cut<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:03.010> this<00:01:03.160> is

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
we start making the cut so this is

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.369 
we start making the cut so this is
pretty<00:01:03.550> simple<00:01:03.850> what<00:01:04.120> I've<00:01:04.239> got<00:01:04.449> here<00:01:04.780> is<00:01:04.960> a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
pretty simple what I've got here is a

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.550 
pretty simple what I've got here is a
piece<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:05.890> wood<00:01:06.040> 1-inch<00:01:06.910> taplok<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.840> machined

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
piece of wood 1-inch taplok I machined

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.249 
piece of wood 1-inch taplok I machined
it<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.890> perfect<00:01:09.370> 1<00:01:09.580> inch<00:01:09.610> thickness<00:01:10.259> that

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
it to a perfect 1 inch thickness that

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.289 
it to a perfect 1 inch thickness that
makes<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.710> math<00:01:11.920> easy<00:01:12.250> because<00:01:12.549> I've<00:01:12.970> got<00:01:13.270> a

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
makes the math easy because I've got a

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.060 
makes the math easy because I've got a
cursor<00:01:13.780> I've<00:01:13.930> got<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.110> pointer<00:01:14.560> on<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.740> fence

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
cursor I've got a pointer on the fence

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.640 
cursor I've got a pointer on the fence
now<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:15.880> can<00:01:16.150> use<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.509> ruler<00:01:16.840> on<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.140> fence<00:01:17.409> to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
now I can use the ruler on the fence to

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.980 
now I can use the ruler on the fence to
set<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.009> fence<00:01:18.189> position<00:01:18.790> all<00:01:19.390> I<00:01:19.420> have<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.869> do

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
set the fence position all I have to do

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.380 
set the fence position all I have to do
is<00:01:20.140> set<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.560> fence<00:01:20.830> for<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.520> perfect<00:01:22.060> 1<00:01:22.360> inch

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
is set the fence for a perfect 1 inch

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.039 
is set the fence for a perfect 1 inch
more<00:01:22.930> than<00:01:23.619> what<00:01:23.860> I<00:01:23.890> need<00:01:24.189> so<00:01:25.030> I'll<00:01:25.509> clamp<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
more than what I need so I'll clamp the

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:36.480 
more than what I need so I'll clamp the
stop<00:01:26.290> block<00:01:26.500> on<00:01:26.829> that's<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.549> first<00:01:27.790> step<00:01:35.490> now

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
stop block on that's the first step now

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.999 
stop block on that's the first step now
notice<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:36.909> when<00:01:37.750> I<00:01:37.810> put<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.200> stop<00:01:38.470> block<00:01:38.649> on

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
notice that when I put the stop block on

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.800 
notice that when I put the stop block on
I<00:01:39.220> kept<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.610> up<00:01:39.729> off<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.119> bed<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.479> table

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
I kept it up off the bed of the table

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.020 
I kept it up off the bed of the table
saw<00:01:40.990> itself<00:01:41.320> that's<00:01:41.649> because<00:01:42.009> as<00:01:42.159> I<00:01:42.670> slide

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
saw itself that's because as I slide

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.179 
saw itself that's because as I slide
parts<00:01:43.509> over<00:01:43.689> one<00:01:44.110> thing<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:44.439> found<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.979> that

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
parts over one thing I found is that

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.130 
parts over one thing I found is that
you're<00:01:45.670> going<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:45.850> get<00:01:45.970> sawdust<00:01:46.479> on<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.780> table

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
you're going to get sawdust on the table

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.410 
you're going to get sawdust on the table
and<00:01:47.320> if<00:01:47.950> this<00:01:48.159> is<00:01:48.399> tight<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.000> table

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
and if this is tight to the table

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.630 
and if this is tight to the table
sawdust<00:01:50.380> is<00:01:50.530> going<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.740> get<00:01:50.890> trapped<00:01:51.219> between

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
sawdust is going to get trapped between

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.709 
sawdust is going to get trapped between
there<00:01:51.820> and<00:01:51.850> you're<00:01:52.000> going<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.149> get<00:01:52.299> tricked

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
there and you're going to get tricked

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.539 
there and you're going to get tricked
you're<00:01:53.229> going<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.439> be<00:01:53.560> up<00:01:53.680> against<00:01:53.979> sawdust

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
you're going to be up against sawdust

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.609 
you're going to be up against sawdust
not<00:01:54.820> up<00:01:54.939> against<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.360> stop<00:01:55.570> block<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.170> as<00:01:56.590> a

result<00:01:57.100> when<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.280> make<00:01:57.520> your<00:01:57.700> cut<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.090> going

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
result when you make your cut it's going

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.060 
result when you make your cut it's going
to<00:01:58.299> be<00:01:58.420> too<00:01:58.630> short<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.229> make<00:01:59.560> sure<00:01:59.860> you<00:01:59.950> hold

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
to be too short so make sure you hold

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.429 
to be too short so make sure you hold
the<00:02:00.250> stop<00:02:00.490> block<00:02:00.759> up<00:02:00.969> like<00:02:01.180> this<00:02:01.390> then<00:02:02.259> all<00:02:02.409> I

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
the stop block up like this then all I

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.749 
the stop block up like this then all I
have<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.799> do<00:02:02.890> is<00:02:03.039> set<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.280> fence<00:02:03.549> position

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
have to do is set the fence position

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.219 
have to do is set the fence position
don't<00:02:06.759> forget<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.360> add<00:02:07.570> an<00:02:07.780> inch<00:02:07.930> there

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
don't forget to add an inch there

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.160 
don't forget to add an inch there
because<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.920> our<00:02:09.039> one<00:02:09.220> inch<00:02:09.250> stop<00:02:09.670> block<00:02:09.970> now<00:02:10.750> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
because of our one inch stop block now I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.110 
because of our one inch stop block now I
can<00:02:11.410> slide<00:02:11.710> this<00:02:11.920> over<00:02:12.280> until<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.640> kisses<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
can slide this over until it kisses the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:29.460 
can slide this over until it kisses the
block<00:02:13.330> move<00:02:14.080> forward<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.590> make<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.770> cut

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.530 

with<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.620> simple<00:02:31.100> setup<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.700> could<00:02:32.030> cut<00:02:32.270> one

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
with this simple setup I could cut one

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.200 
with this simple setup I could cut one
part<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.110> could<00:02:33.200> cut<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> thousand<00:02:34.310> parts<00:02:34.520> the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
part I could cut a thousand parts the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.640 
part I could cut a thousand parts the
stop<00:02:35.510> block<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.050> fence<00:02:36.260> are<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.590> to

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
stop block and the fence are going to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.470 
stop block and the fence are going to
guarantee<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:37.190> every<00:02:37.790> one<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:37.970> them<00:02:38.210> exactly

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
guarantee that every one of them exactly

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.750 
guarantee that every one of them exactly
the<00:02:38.690> same<00:02:38.780> if<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.830> have<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.160> come<00:02:40.340> back<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
the same if I have to come back in the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.670 
the same if I have to come back in the
future<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.390> cut<00:02:41.660> more<00:02:41.870> parts<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.440> same

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
future and cut more parts to the same

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.890 
future and cut more parts to the same
length<00:02:42.950> very<00:02:43.700> very<00:02:43.940> easy<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.390> duplicate<00:02:44.870> that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
length very very easy to duplicate that

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.080 
length very very easy to duplicate that
setup<00:02:45.410> by<00:02:45.950> using<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.310> stop<00:02:46.520> block<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
setup by using the stop block in the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.120 
setup by using the stop block in the
fence<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:47.840> great<00:02:48.200> technique<00:02:48.650> for<00:02:48.890> cross

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
fence so great technique for cross

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.310 
fence so great technique for cross
cutting<00:02:49.460> many<00:02:50.180> many<00:02:50.390> parts<00:02:50.810> getting<00:02:51.050> them<00:02:51.200> all

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
cutting many many parts getting them all

00:02:51.320 --> 00:03:04.080 
cutting many many parts getting them all
perfectly<00:02:51.650> identical
