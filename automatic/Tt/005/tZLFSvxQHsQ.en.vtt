00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
you stretch an elastic out as far as it

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.760 
you stretch an elastic out as far as it
goes<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.750> let<00:01:49.899> it<00:01:50.020> come<00:01:50.140> back<00:01:50.349> it<00:01:50.590> never

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
goes and you let it come back it never

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.550 
goes and you let it come back it never
comes<00:01:51.039> back<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.459> exactly<00:01:51.910> where<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.300> is<00:01:52.420> was<00:01:52.780> so

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
comes back to exactly where it is was so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.930 
comes back to exactly where it is was so
each<00:01:53.709> time<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.009> stretch<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.610> goes<00:01:54.729> out<00:01:54.910> a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
each time you stretch it it goes out a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.639 
each time you stretch it it goes out a
little<00:01:55.119> bit<00:01:55.390> further<00:01:55.660> just<00:01:55.929> like<00:01:56.259> we<00:01:56.440> as

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
little bit further just like we as

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.889 
little bit further just like we as
humans<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.459> further<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.970> stretch<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.690> more

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
humans the further you stretch the more

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.469 
humans the further you stretch the more
you<00:01:59.050> accomplish<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.220> sometimes<00:02:00.879> we<00:02:01.119> got<00:02:01.300> to<00:02:01.390> go

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
you accomplish so sometimes we got to go

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.300 
you accomplish so sometimes we got to go
outside<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:01.869> comfort<00:02:02.440> zone<00:02:02.470> we<00:02:02.800> got<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.069> try

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
outside that comfort zone we got to try

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.100 
outside that comfort zone we got to try
just<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.729> little<00:02:03.759> bit<00:02:04.179> harder<00:02:04.390> we<00:02:04.690> got<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.959> take

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
just a little bit harder we got to take

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.290 
just a little bit harder we got to take
a<00:02:05.140> little<00:02:05.349> risk<00:02:05.619> because<00:02:06.310> in<00:02:06.459> life<00:02:06.670> there's<00:02:07.090> no

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
a little risk because in life there's no

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.220 
a little risk because in life there's no
return<00:02:07.750> if<00:02:08.020> there's<00:02:08.319> no<00:02:08.500> risk<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.780> are<00:02:10.810> what
