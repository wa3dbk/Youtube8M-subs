00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
we go and I'm just going to have this on

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.010 
we go and I'm just going to have this on
low<00:01:09.750> heat<00:01:10.850> because<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.940> just<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
low heat because I just really want to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 
low heat because I just really want to
melt<00:01:13.230> my<00:01:13.410> gelatin<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:14.760> using<00:01:14.970> sheet

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
melt my gelatin so I'm using sheet

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
melt my gelatin so I'm using sheet
gelatin<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.980> the<00:01:17.190> bronze<00:01:17.700> or<00:01:18.180> gold

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
gelatin and this is the bronze or gold

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.020 
gelatin and this is the bronze or gold
type<00:01:19.170> gelatin<00:01:19.620> there<00:01:19.830> silver<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.910> it's

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
type gelatin there silver also but it's

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.520 
type gelatin there silver also but it's
a<00:01:21.120> little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.360> thinner<00:01:21.690> so<00:01:22.230> if<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.440> use

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
a little bit thinner so if you use

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.710 
a little bit thinner so if you use
silver<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.160> twice<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.790> amount<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.600> have

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
silver use twice the amount so we have

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
silver use twice the amount so we have
two<00:01:24.930> sheets<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.190> basically<00:01:26.340> crap

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
two sheets and you just basically crap

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.970 
two sheets and you just basically crap
them<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.150> half<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.680> soak

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
them in half and then you want to soak

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.550 
them in half and then you want to soak
them<00:01:29.190> in<00:01:29.220> water<00:01:29.780> until<00:01:30.780> their<00:01:30.930> bloom<00:01:31.230> they<00:01:31.440> get

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
them in water until their bloom they get

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.140 
them in water until their bloom they get
kind<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.800> gummy<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.940> gonna
