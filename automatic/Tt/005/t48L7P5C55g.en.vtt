00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
good because you can just grab a handful

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.070 
good because you can just grab a handful
of<00:01:42.470> them<00:01:42.560> on<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.920> goalie<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:43.549> what's<00:01:43.939> this<00:01:44.090> so

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
of them on the goalie and what's this so

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.480 
of them on the goalie and what's this so
that's<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.380> Malayan<00:01:45.680> crystal<00:01:46.040> salt<00:01:46.250> which<00:01:46.460> is

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
that's the Malayan crystal salt which is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.730 
that's the Malayan crystal salt which is
one<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.119> my<00:01:47.330> favorite<00:01:47.930> Himalayan<00:01:48.439> crystal

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
one of my favorite Himalayan crystal

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.050 
one of my favorite Himalayan crystal
salt<00:01:48.770> I've<00:01:49.159> actually<00:01:49.369> has<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.640> really<00:01:49.850> high

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
salt I've actually has a really high

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.330 
salt I've actually has a really high
mineral<00:01:50.270> content<00:01:50.600> this<00:01:51.320> is<00:01:51.500> um<00:01:51.710> ground<00:01:52.009> but

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
mineral content this is um ground but

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.010 
mineral content this is um ground but
you<00:01:52.430> know<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:52.640> grind<00:01:52.970> it<00:01:53.119> into<00:01:53.299> them<00:01:53.540> bit<00:01:53.930> of

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
you know you grind it into them bit of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.280 
you know you grind it into them bit of
water<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:54.680> really

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
water and it's really

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.020 
water and it's really
way<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> keeping<00:01:56.370> electrolytes<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:59.030> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
way of keeping electrolytes up the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.480 
way of keeping electrolytes up the
spinach<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.680> particularly<00:02:02.190> high

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
spinach is really is particularly high

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.250 
spinach is really is particularly high
in<00:02:02.760> iron<00:02:03.000> compared<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.690> other<00:02:03.810> green<00:02:04.050> leaves

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
in iron compared to other green leaves

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.190 
in iron compared to other green leaves
and<00:02:04.610> for<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.670> purposes<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.120> exercise<00:02:06.690> more

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and for the purposes of exercise more

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
and for the purposes of exercise more
iron<00:02:07.620> in<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.950> body<00:02:08.220> means<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:09.270> red

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
iron in the body means that your red

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.720 
iron in the body means that your red
blood<00:02:09.540> cells<00:02:09.840> cancel<00:02:10.260> from<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.500> oxygen<00:02:11.070> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
blood cells cancel from it oxygen and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.100 
blood cells cancel from it oxygen and
it's<00:02:11.880> also<00:02:12.030> got<00:02:12.180> lots<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.420> B<00:02:12.600> vitamins<00:02:12.750> in

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
it's also got lots of B vitamins in

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.780 
it's also got lots of B vitamins in
there<00:02:13.230> too<00:02:13.410> which<00:02:13.620> are<00:02:13.800> good<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.400> releasing

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
there too which are good for releasing

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.970 
there too which are good for releasing
the<00:02:14.970> energy<00:02:15.090> from<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.630> cells<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.560> win-win

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the energy from the cells it's a win-win

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.250 
the energy from the cells it's a win-win
yeah<00:02:17.520> when<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.910> smoothies<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.750> can<00:02:18.780> use<00:02:19.110> in

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
yeah when in smoothies you can use in

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.950 
yeah when in smoothies you can use in
the<00:02:19.350> cellar<00:02:19.590> Deacon<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.450> another

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
the cellar Deacon this is another

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.730 
the cellar Deacon this is another
classic<00:02:22.320> superfood<00:02:22.980> yeah<00:02:24.200> chicken<00:02:25.200> hat<00:02:25.560> does

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
classic superfood yeah chicken hat does

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.590 
classic superfood yeah chicken hat does
have<00:02:25.980> higher<00:02:26.340> quality<00:02:26.550> minutes<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.300> know<00:02:27.360> it's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
have higher quality minutes I know it's

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.360 
have higher quality minutes I know it's
important<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.260> know<00:02:28.410> when<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.070> comes<00:02:29.220> to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
important you know when it comes to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.130 
important you know when it comes to
exercising<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:30.090> help<00:02:30.240> get<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.690> helps<00:02:30.900> release

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
exercising to help get it helps release

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.650 
exercising to help get it helps release
the<00:02:31.320> fat<00:02:31.560> from<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.160> fat<00:02:32.460> cells<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.240> get<00:02:33.480> used

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
the fat from the fat cells and get used

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.120 
the fat from the fat cells and get used
as<00:02:33.810> energy<00:02:33.960> but<00:02:34.350> it's<00:02:34.500> also<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.800> really<00:02:34.980> lean

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
as energy but it's also a really lean

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.190 
as energy but it's also a really lean
protein<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.940> get<00:02:36.120> all<00:02:36.240> your<00:02:36.330> amino<00:02:36.660> acids

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
protein so you get all your amino acids

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.690 
protein so you get all your amino acids
which<00:02:37.470> help<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.860> build<00:02:37.980> your<00:02:38.130> muscle<00:02:38.520> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
which help you build your muscle and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.990 
which help you build your muscle and
then<00:02:38.940> salmon<00:02:39.540> has<00:02:40.260> got<00:02:40.470> omega-3s<00:02:41.220> which<00:02:41.700> are

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
then salmon has got omega-3s which are

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.090 
then salmon has got omega-3s which are
really<00:02:42.360> good<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.570> information<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.770> also<00:02:44.040> I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
really good for information and also I

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.010 
really good for information and also I
think<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.340> foods<00:02:45.330> there<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.630> be<00:02:45.720> enjoyed

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
think that foods there to be enjoyed

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.890 
think that foods there to be enjoyed
so<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.490> do<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.850> piece<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.150> salmon<00:02:48.450> job

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
so if you do have a piece of salmon job

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.360 
so if you do have a piece of salmon job
a<00:02:48.930> piece<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.260> chicken<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.680> don't<00:02:49.830> literally

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
a piece of chicken you don't literally

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.980 
a piece of chicken you don't literally
need<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.910> grill<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:53.720> yeah<00:02:54.720> it's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
need to just grill it because yeah it's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.480 
need to just grill it because yeah it's
true<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.320> spices<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.740> herbs<00:02:55.920> actually<00:02:56.310> can

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
true and spices and herbs actually can

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.940 
true and spices and herbs actually can
it<00:02:56.580> add<00:02:56.760> nutrition<00:02:57.270> lead<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.600> two<00:02:58.470> dishes<00:02:58.800> if

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
it add nutrition lead to two dishes if

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.229 
it add nutrition lead to two dishes if
that's<00:02:59.160> what<00:02:59.310> you're<00:02:59.430> gonna<00:02:59.550> do<00:02:59.790> like<00:02:59.970> chili

that's what you're gonna do like chili

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.540 
that's what you're gonna do like chili
is<00:03:00.360> brilliant<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.230> keeping<00:03:01.709> your<00:03:01.920> metabolism

is brilliant for keeping your metabolism

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.449 
is brilliant for keeping your metabolism
going<00:03:03.120> after<00:03:03.510> you've<00:03:03.630> been<00:03:03.840> out<00:03:04.010> sizing<00:03:05.010> and

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
going after you've been out sizing and

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.580 
going after you've been out sizing and
you<00:03:06.000> want<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.420> simple<00:03:06.660> because<00:03:07.200> when<00:03:07.380> you

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
you want it simple because when you

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.890 
you want it simple because when you
finish<00:03:08.489> exercising<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.540> want<00:03:09.720> something

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
finish exercising and you want something

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.140 
finish exercising and you want something
quite<00:03:10.170> quick<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.800> instant<00:03:11.130> yeah<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.060> think

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
quite quick and instant yeah so I think

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.759 
quite quick and instant yeah so I think
this<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.480> quite<00:03:12.600> nice<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:12.959> after<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.440> trained

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
this is quite nice but after you trained

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.530 
this is quite nice but after you trained
you<00:03:14.280> could<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.610> grandma's<00:03:14.910> ready<00:03:15.180> cooked<00:03:15.420> in

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
you could have grandma's ready cooked in

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.630 
you could have grandma's ready cooked in
the<00:03:15.630> fridge<00:03:15.840> yes<00:03:16.320> when<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.709> get<00:03:16.860> back<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.430> get
