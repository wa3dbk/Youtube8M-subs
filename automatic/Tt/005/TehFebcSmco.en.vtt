00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.920 
didn't necessarily fold under all that
pressure<00:04:15.069> because<00:04:15.910> we<00:04:16.030> were<00:04:16.090> down<00:04:16.239> 15<00:04:16.690> with<00:04:16.720> a

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
pressure because we were down 15 with a

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.320 
pressure because we were down 15 with a
minute<00:04:17.260> 50<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.620> go<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.820> that's<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.120> know<00:04:19.209> it's

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
minute 50 to go and that's you know it's

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.880 
minute 50 to go and that's you know it's
a<00:04:19.390> lot<00:04:19.539> of<00:04:19.570> pressure<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:19.930> was<00:04:20.109> seen<00:04:20.260> knowing<00:04:20.680> i

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
a lot of pressure I was seen knowing i

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.830 
a lot of pressure I was seen knowing i
played<00:04:21.669> well<00:04:21.880> down<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.210> stretch<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.720> gave

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
played well down that stretch that gave

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.470 
played well down that stretch that gave
me<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.960> lot<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.140> confidence<00:04:23.530> and

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
me a lot of confidence and

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.880 
me a lot of confidence and
I took<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.810> into<00:04:24.960> my<00:04:25.080> senior<00:04:25.380> year<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.680> you

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
I took that into my senior year and you

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.590 
I took that into my senior year and you
know<00:04:25.980> had<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.160> successful<00:04:26.580> season<00:04:26.940> we<00:04:27.240> went<00:04:27.450> out

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
know had a successful season we went out

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.990 
know had a successful season we went out
in<00:04:27.750> 110<00:04:28.140> games<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.490> think<00:04:29.580> that's<00:04:29.850> when

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
in 110 games and so I think that's when

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.700 
in 110 games and so I think that's when
it<00:04:30.090> all<00:04:30.150> started<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.510> click<00:04:30.660> for<00:04:30.960> me<00:04:33.710> the

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
it all started to click for me the

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.050 
it all started to click for me the
biggest<00:04:34.890> thing<00:04:35.130> for<00:04:35.160> me<00:04:35.370> was<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.670> didn't<00:04:35.880> want

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
biggest thing for me was I didn't want

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.340 
biggest thing for me was I didn't want
to<00:04:36.120> turn<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.390> ball<00:04:36.540> over<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.900> know<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.170> I

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
to turn the ball over you know and I

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.570 
to turn the ball over you know and I
think<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.740> just<00:04:37.770> goes<00:04:38.040> back<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.370> knowing

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
think that just goes back to knowing

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.150 
think that just goes back to knowing
defenses<00:04:39.200> you<00:04:40.200> know<00:04:40.320> what<00:04:40.560> teams<00:04:40.800> are<00:04:40.920> trying

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
defenses you know what teams are trying

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.440 
defenses you know what teams are trying
to<00:04:41.250> know<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.520> what<00:04:41.640> teams<00:04:41.850> are<00:04:42.000> trying<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.300> do

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
to know and what teams are trying to do
