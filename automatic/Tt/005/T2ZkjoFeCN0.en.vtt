making one then okay absolutely
so<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.260> see<00:01:55.470> we've<00:01:55.860> already<00:01:56.070> chopped

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so as you can see we've already chopped

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.640 
so as you can see we've already chopped
down<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:57.060> our<00:01:57.090> pieces<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.870> let's<00:01:58.470> make<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
down all our pieces here let's make it

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.550 
down all our pieces here let's make it
quick<00:01:58.830> so<00:01:58.940> basically<00:01:59.940> this<00:02:00.150> will<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.410> very

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
quick so basically this will be the very

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.680 
quick so basically this will be the very
back<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.890> your<00:02:02.220> card<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.000> has<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.540> lot

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
back of your card so it has it's a lot

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.900 
back of your card so it has it's a lot
better<00:02:03.900> sitting<00:02:04.320> here<00:02:04.470> yes<00:02:05.370> I<00:02:05.580> think<00:02:05.760> we've

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
better sitting here yes I think we've

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.940 
better sitting here yes I think we've
seen<00:02:06.150> this<00:02:06.240> little<00:02:06.510> cottage<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:07.050> you'll<00:02:07.770> see

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
seen this little cottage and you'll see

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.050 
seen this little cottage and you'll see
that<00:02:08.100> there's<00:02:08.280> there's<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.610> much<00:02:08.790> going<00:02:09.030> on

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
that there's there's not much going on

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.010 
that there's there's not much going on
around<00:02:09.149> here<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.600> doesn't<00:02:09.780> matter

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
around here but it doesn't matter

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.120 
around here but it doesn't matter
because<00:02:10.170> if<00:02:10.500> we're<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.890> building

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
because if we're going to be building

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.490 
because if we're going to be building
this<00:02:11.550> up<00:02:11.790> there'll<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.240> lot<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.720> lot<00:02:12.960> detail

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
this up there'll be a lot a lot detail

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.430 
this up there'll be a lot a lot detail
going<00:02:13.710> on<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.520> basically<00:02:15.330> what<00:02:16.050> you'll<00:02:16.200> get

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
going on and basically what you'll get

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.730 
going on and basically what you'll get
as<00:02:16.650> well<00:02:16.860> are<00:02:17.160> sides<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:18.600> your<00:02:18.720> cars<00:02:19.020> now<00:02:19.470> they

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
as well are sides to your cars now they

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.280 
as well are sides to your cars now they
have<00:02:20.400> guides<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:21.030> them<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.870> school

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
have guides on them and if you school

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.080 
have guides on them and if you school
and<00:02:22.560> followed<00:02:22.920> them<00:02:23.100> they'll<00:02:23.280> basically<00:02:23.850> turn

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
and followed them they'll basically turn

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.290 
and followed them they'll basically turn
into<00:02:24.260> concertina<00:02:25.260> sides<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.520> if<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.820> just<00:02:27.090> do

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
into concertina sides so if I just do

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.170 
into concertina sides so if I just do
that<00:02:27.480> first<00:02:28.700> I'm<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:29.760> going<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.030> show<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
that first I'm just going to show you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.030 
that first I'm just going to show you
leave<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:30.600> you'll<00:02:31.290> see<00:02:31.470> there's<00:02:31.650> some<00:02:31.680> little

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
leave one you'll see there's some little

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.890 
leave one you'll see there's some little
guides<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.910> if<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.360> use<00:02:33.480> my<00:02:33.510> craft

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
guides here and if I just use my craft

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.830 
guides here and if I just use my craft
knife<00:02:37.489> so<00:02:38.489> when<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.790> score<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.420> don't<00:02:39.630> cut

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
knife so when you score you don't cut

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.390 
knife so when you score you don't cut
all<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.170> way<00:02:40.260> through<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.830> know<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.040> time

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
all the way through do you know to time

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.100 
all the way through do you know to time
if<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.120> must<00:02:42.300> leave<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.660> back<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.989> your

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
if you you must leave the back of your

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.040 
if you you must leave the back of your
craft<00:02:43.380> knife<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.980> then<00:02:46.980> basically<00:02:47.550> just

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
craft knife and then basically just

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.770 
craft knife and then basically just
glide<00:02:49.050> along<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:51.030> wherever<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.540> see<00:02:51.570> a

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
glide along and wherever you see a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.270 
glide along and wherever you see a
dotted<00:02:52.230> line<00:02:53.630> school<00:02:54.630> it's<00:02:55.530> very<00:02:55.680> very

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
dotted line school it's very very

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.010 
dotted line school it's very very
surprising<00:02:56.790> we've<00:02:56.940> made<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.330> really<00:02:57.660> really

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
surprising we've made this really really

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.040 
surprising we've made this really really
easy<00:02:58.320> because<00:02:59.160> we<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.209> how<00:03:00.450> expensive<00:03:00.690> these

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
easy because we know how expensive these

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.010 
easy because we know how expensive these
cars<00:03:01.320> be<00:03:01.530> be<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.890> obviously<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:03.000> know<00:03:03.150> there

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
cars be be and obviously you know there

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.449 
cars be be and obviously you know there
aren't<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.320> many<00:03:04.380> templates<00:03:04.950> out<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.280> show

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
aren't that many templates out to show

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.830 
aren't that many templates out to show
you<00:03:05.520> how<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.790> do<00:03:06.030> things<00:03:06.209> like<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.720> we

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
you how to do things like this so we

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840 
you how to do things like this so we
start<00:03:07.050> or<00:03:07.170> we<00:03:07.350> will<00:03:07.890> we've<00:03:08.400> done<00:03:08.550> all<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> hard

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
start or we will we've done all the hard

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.310 
start or we will we've done all the hard
work<00:03:09.090> basically<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.660> figured<00:03:09.959> out<00:03:10.050> how<00:03:10.200> all

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
work basically we figured out how all

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.050 
work basically we figured out how all
these<00:03:10.500> work<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.489> just<00:03:11.670> put<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:11.940> all

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
these work and we just put it all

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.460 
these work and we just put it all
together<00:03:12.180> we're<00:03:12.480> just<00:03:12.600> gonna<00:03:12.690> show<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.900> and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
today so we didn't want to do this step

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.120 
today so we didn't want to do this step
they<00:03:15.600> can<00:03:15.750> also<00:03:15.900> use<00:03:16.020> phone<00:03:16.380> cuts<00:03:16.680> can't<00:03:16.950> they

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
they can also use phone cuts can't they

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.010 
they can also use phone cuts can't they
Oh<00:03:17.280> easy<00:03:17.610> yeah<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.270> just<00:03:18.450> get<00:03:18.630> some<00:03:18.810> foam

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
lot of these you can get various

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.380 
lot of these you can get various
different<00:03:23.220> widths<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.790> can<00:03:23.940> build<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.300> up

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
different widths and you can build it up

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.210 
different widths and you can build it up
and<00:03:24.660> instead<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.140> popping<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.530> sides<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:25.980> you

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and instead of popping the sides on you

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.310 
and instead of popping the sides on you
just<00:03:26.430> throw<00:03:26.910> your<00:03:27.030> cut<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.390> together<00:03:27.510> exactly

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
just throw your cut it together exactly

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.630 
just throw your cut it together exactly
instead<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.860> some<00:03:29.070> like<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.519> know<00:03:29.610> a

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
instead of that some like you know a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.640 
instead of that some like you know a
foam<00:03:29.880> pad<00:03:30.150> instead<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:31.019> would<00:03:31.170> from<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
foam pad instead and it would from the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.290 
foam pad instead and it would from the
front<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.070> have<00:03:32.220> exactly<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.820> same

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
front in have exactly the same

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.390 
front in have exactly the same
it's<00:03:34.020> just<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.290> very<00:03:34.470> simple<00:03:34.830> way<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:34.950> doing<00:03:35.190> it

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
it's just a very simple way of doing it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.390 
it's just a very simple way of doing it
so<00:03:35.580> basically<00:03:36.240> all<00:03:36.450> I'm<00:03:36.600> going<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.810> do<00:03:36.960> now

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
so basically all I'm going to do now

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.650 
so basically all I'm going to do now
they<00:03:38.400> start<00:03:38.760> folding<00:03:39.060> my<00:03:39.420> concertina<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:42.420> one

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
they start folding my concertina so one

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.170 
they start folding my concertina so one
one<00:03:42.960> side<00:03:43.200> one<00:03:43.590> side<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.400> other<00:03:44.430> end<00:03:45.030> up

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
one side one side and the other end up

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.880 
one side one side and the other end up
with<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.330> zigzag<00:03:47.270> say<00:03:48.270> look<00:03:49.020> how<00:03:49.170> quick<00:03:49.470> it's

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
with a zigzag say look how quick it's

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.760 
with a zigzag say look how quick it's
taken<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:51.000> do<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.360> it's<00:03:51.660> really<00:03:52.230> really

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
taken to just do this it's really really

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.330 
taken to just do this it's really really
simple<00:03:53.570> so<00:03:54.570> I'm<00:03:55.530> assuming<00:03:55.740> to<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:55.950> your<00:03:56.130> size

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
simple so I'm assuming to be your size

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.860 
simple so I'm assuming to be your size
to<00:03:56.610> see<00:03:56.820> how<00:03:57.030> fast<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.510> was

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
to see how fast that was

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.160 
to see how fast that was
but<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.620> go<00:03:58.800> but<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.130> concertinas<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:01.050> the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
but to go but to concertinas that so the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.890 
but to go but to concertinas that so the
first<00:04:01.320> thing<00:04:01.500> I'm<00:04:01.590> going<00:04:01.710> to<00:04:01.950> do<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.600> I'm<00:04:03.600> gonna

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.410 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna
start<00:04:04.020> from<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.010> back<00:04:05.130> it's<00:04:05.670> an<00:04:05.940> easy<00:04:06.150> way<00:04:06.390> to

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
start from the back it's an easy way to

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.230 
start from the back it's an easy way to
start<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.020> you<00:04:07.170> have<00:04:07.380> your<00:04:07.620> piece<00:04:07.970> flat<00:04:08.970> here

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
start so you have your piece flat here

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.750 
start so you have your piece flat here
if<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.350> take<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.890> will<00:04:11.010> basically<00:04:11.190> say<00:04:11.490> left

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
if you take it will basically say left

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.080 
if you take it will basically say left
and<00:04:12.090> right<00:04:12.270> so<00:04:13.230> this<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:14.490> left-hand<00:04:14.910> side

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
and right so this is the left-hand side

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.440 
and right so this is the left-hand side
of<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.240> card<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:15.930> finally<00:04:17.000> basically<00:04:18.000> pop<00:04:18.270> a

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
of the card so finally basically pop a

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.320 
of the card so finally basically pop a
little<00:04:18.660> bit<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:19.110> sticky<00:04:19.560> tape<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.190> we<00:04:20.940> really

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
little bit of sticky tape and we really

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.880 
little bit of sticky tape and we really
using<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.600> double<00:04:21.840> sided<00:04:21.870> tape<00:04:22.230> here<00:04:22.590> but<00:04:22.770> you

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
using a double sided tape here but you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.560 
using a double sided tape here but you
can<00:04:23.040> show<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.400> glue<00:04:23.790> you<00:04:24.210> could<00:04:24.360> use<00:04:24.540> a

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
can show this glue you could use a

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.940 
can show this glue you could use a
repositionable<00:04:25.200> glue<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:25.530> can<00:04:25.590> use<00:04:25.830> whatever

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
repositionable glue you can use whatever

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:42.640 
repositionable glue you can use whatever
you<00:04:26.130> want<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.370> stick<00:04:26.580> it<00:04:26.700> down

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.740 

I'm<00:04:43.650> gonna<00:04:43.800> do<00:04:44.010> making<00:04:44.669> sure<00:04:44.970> that<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.300> patent

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
I'm gonna do making sure that the patent

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.490 
I'm gonna do making sure that the patent
is<00:04:46.050> on<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.160> outside<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.790> car<00:04:48.260> I'll<00:04:49.260> just

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
is on the outside of the car I'll just

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:59.870 
is on the outside of the car I'll just
stick<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.090> front<00:04:58.550> yeah

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
stick that to the front yeah

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.300 
stick that to the front yeah
so<00:05:00.780> you<00:05:00.840> already<00:05:01.230> started<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:01.980> build<00:05:02.010> up<00:05:02.280> your

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
so you already started to build up your

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.270 
so you already started to build up your
site<00:05:02.580> there<00:05:02.910> what<00:05:03.900> I'll<00:05:04.020> do<00:05:04.230> is<00:05:04.530> exactly<00:05:05.040> the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
site there what I'll do is exactly the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.920 
site there what I'll do is exactly the
same<00:05:05.490> thing<00:05:05.730> on<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.970> other<00:05:06.000> side<00:05:06.330> okay<00:05:06.870> so

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
same thing on the other side okay so

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.520 
same thing on the other side okay so
we've<00:05:07.410> got<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.650> two<00:05:07.800> sides<00:05:08.810> on<00:05:09.810> there<00:05:10.380> now

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
we've got the two sides on there now

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.490 
we've got the two sides on there now
easy<00:05:11.040> easy<00:05:11.389> now<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.450> next<00:05:12.780> thing<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:12.990> do<00:05:13.229> is

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
easy easy now the next thing to do is

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.400 
easy easy now the next thing to do is
the<00:05:14.100> next<00:05:14.310> layer<00:05:14.669> so<00:05:15.180> this<00:05:15.750> is<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.080> second

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
the next layer so this is the second

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
the next layer so this is the second
layer<00:05:16.500> that<00:05:16.560> we're<00:05:16.770> going<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.919> pop<00:05:17.100> on<00:05:17.250> there

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
layer that we're going to pop on there

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.330 
layer that we're going to pop on there
and<00:05:17.850> what<00:05:18.479> we're<00:05:18.600> going<00:05:18.690> to<00:05:18.750> do<00:05:18.930> is<00:05:19.350> you'll<00:05:20.040> see

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
and what we're going to do is you'll see

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.890 
and what we're going to do is you'll see
when<00:05:20.760> you're<00:05:20.910> start<00:05:21.180> constructing<00:05:21.510> this<00:05:21.720> that

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
when you're start constructing this that

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.350 
when you're start constructing this that
there<00:05:22.050> is<00:05:22.139> a<00:05:22.200> little<00:05:22.440> star<00:05:22.800> on<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:24.030> back<00:05:24.150> of

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
there is a little star on the back of

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.210 
there is a little star on the back of
this<00:05:24.510> pages<00:05:25.050> it's<00:05:25.320> really<00:05:25.680> small<00:05:25.860> so<00:05:25.979> you<00:05:26.100> will

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
this pages it's really small so you will

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.710 
this pages it's really small so you will
hardly<00:05:26.580> see<00:05:26.790> it<00:05:26.820> when<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.120> when<00:05:27.419> they<00:05:27.510> can't

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
hardly see it when the when they can't

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.719 
hardly see it when the when they can't
instructed<00:05:28.229> and<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.650> just<00:05:28.830> shows<00:05:29.100> you<00:05:29.130> that

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
instructed and it just shows you that

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.600 
instructed and it just shows you that
this<00:05:30.150> is<00:05:30.590> where<00:05:31.590> you<00:05:31.740> want<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.070> glue<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.310> go

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
this is where you want the glue to go

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.180 
this is where you want the glue to go
and<00:05:33.090> just<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.780> just<00:05:33.960> shows<00:05:34.139> you<00:05:34.169> so<00:05:34.620> simply<00:05:35.130> so

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
and just it just shows you so simply so

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.770 
and just it just shows you so simply so
you<00:05:35.310> don't<00:05:35.490> worry<00:05:35.910> about<00:05:36.150> which<00:05:36.300> layer<00:05:36.540> it

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
you don't worry about which layer it

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.250 
you don't worry about which layer it
goes<00:05:36.810> on<00:05:37.260> it<00:05:37.470> shows<00:05:37.770> you<00:05:38.010> see<00:05:38.220> what<00:05:38.820> I've<00:05:38.940> done

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
goes on it shows you see what I've done

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.230 
goes on it shows you see what I've done
Claudia<00:05:40.260> touched<00:05:40.500> my<00:05:40.740> piece<00:05:41.400> of<00:05:41.669> tape<00:05:41.880> this

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
Claudia touched my piece of tape this

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.800 
Claudia touched my piece of tape this
one<00:05:43.580> it's<00:05:44.580> basically<00:05:44.910> just<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.210> middle<00:05:45.539> fold

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
one it's basically just the middle fold
