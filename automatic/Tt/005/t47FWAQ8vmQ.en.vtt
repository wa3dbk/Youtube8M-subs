00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.779
 they presented the charros also from 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.910

 will be with one of your friends not with 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.809
 the holders but if presenting a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.060
 great show as it did 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.849
 I give flowers with the face of a horse that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.329
 to the base of 20 add 15 meters in three 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.759
 times to accumulate 11 of tip two of 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.579
 each of the sides one of each of 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:32.759
 the means for 37 good but with three 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.280
 of infringement to open with 34 units the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.019
 participation of ranch the biznaga 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.370
 while Miguel Zamora only 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.910
 is lucky on the second chance 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.949
 having base of 20 to be and to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.309
 swirl forward plus 1 tap 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.989
 dead for 21 points in the coleadero 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.719
 Fernando Sanchez opens strong with round 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.629
 right of 12 shot down between 50 and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.940
 60 meters as we can appreciate receives 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.710
 the bull pachón health is operated ea 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.480
 perfectly and in short terrain without 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.999
 However, it fits perfectly so as not to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.890
 fail the and gets rounds right of 12 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.450
 while the best of the team was 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.870
 Francisco Cerón have the second 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.200
 timely 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.090
 Dan managed a 14 and contributed 36 in his three 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.300
 opportunities being the driving force of the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.870
 queues since you get 36 of the 69 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.060
 accumulated pedro vega achieves 17 points in 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.480
 the bull jockey the terna they were 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.070
 live however in the manganas 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.230
 only franco serón shines with 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.670
 your first qualified opportunity of 30 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.150
 units mostly because of the way 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.070
 finish to stay with 220 of the place 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.220
 number 12 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.180
 also in the last competition 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.729
 the regionals of san participated 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.360
 Julian from the State of Jalisco 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.360
 this elite team and this time it was 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.700
 team b is different from the one 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.310
 I was competing there in cadereyta 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.680
 Querétaro starting with Alberto Herrera 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.810
 with the horse cove of 34 points already 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.690
 that the base 20 added 15 meters in a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.300
 only time for additional 13 2 of 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.500
 first side 3 of the second 1 of the first 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:11.520
 medium but with 39 had 5 of infraction and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.140
 opened with 34 chavita muñoz cuaja tweet in 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.540
 his first chance to paddle or 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.430
 in front of 20 but with 4 infringement 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.130
 to pass with one of the extremities 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.959
 of the horse the line of the four 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.120
 meters fails the second and in the third 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.010
 coincidentally it takes another four of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.989
 infraction but this time because 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.410
 the rope went to the railings to the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.390
 powerful mare accumulating 32 of her two 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.200
 opportunities in the coleadero are 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.260
 they wore with 94 points starting Alberto 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.730
 Herrera who after failing the first one 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.379
 looks at the third opportunity 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 with round right of 12 with 2 of 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.629
 distance for 14 points jorge lozano is 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.030
 the best of the team since it opens with 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.730
 round right of 12 with 2 away 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.700
 for 14 points while in the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.430
 second delays his movements a little 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.680
 however it looks one more time with 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.690
 round right of 12 with 1 away 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.299
 for 13 points and in the third 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.160
 opportunity returns to the old ways and 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.159
 takes the pool with round right of 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.970
 12 with 2 away for 14 coming to 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.739
 41 being the best of the 94 points that 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.650
 they got in queues but 2 and juan 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.950
 antonio muñoz closed with a half right 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.989
 10 and 2 away for 12 points and 30 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.810
 in its three ribes to close the 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.090
 I roll with 160 units the bull does not repair 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.000
 but the short list was of great manufacture and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.030
 that the salvador muñoz head tie 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.510
 he was the individual champion with 32 points 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.420
 as we can appreciate it gets to the base 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.579
 of 10 15 of flowering tops and curd only 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.319
 and exclusively the horns in their 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.420
 first chance and everything and horse 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.890
 running 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.690
 with two of time saved in the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.849
 completion of the task while 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.370
 Juan Antonio Muñoz also looks with 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.550
 extraordinary flowered and worn 33 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.950
 pial points of the ring being the best 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.040
 short of this great tournament since it was 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.830
 qualified with 65 points of the two 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.610
 ties in the manganas on foot Juan Antonio 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.190
 Muñoz achieves 25 units of his first 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.080
 opportunity curd of mask with base 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.200
 of 12 12 of flourish and 1 by knocking down the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.669
 cuadril in the second takes 13 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.650
 additional flourish but 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.530
 unfortunately he had 2 infraction 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:29.710
 so he brings 24 the team closes 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.710
 with 330 from place number 10 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.210
 and to close this great tournament it 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.700
 introduced the green bridge equipment of 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.010
 precisely the state of Zacatecas 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.620
 senator of the republic carlos puente 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.500
 rooms who came with everything to 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.419
 look for a place among the best without 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.790
 But luck did not help them but 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.370
 see the best of their competence as 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.990
 Miguel Angel Garcia starts from the 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.450
 partisan riding in this powerful 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.910
 horse ranch gival and base 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.430
 of 20 adds 15 meters in three times 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.979
 to take 11 tip the first side 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.600
 was 2 the second of 3 does not get 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.930
 additional by the media but reaches 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.210

 third chance with 2 infraction 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:22.130
 but it takes 18 good ones in the 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.050
 coleadero luís frausto was the best with 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.210
 this round right of 12 with 1 of 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.310
 distance to 13 points as we can 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.229
