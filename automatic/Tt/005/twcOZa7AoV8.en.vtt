00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.399
 be nice gentlemen 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.460
 de sensi box one 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.460
 Hi everyone, I'm a killer 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.000
 this is a video review where 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.980
 I will talk about my first impressions 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.530
 seeing this this direct where it is 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.660
 xbox one the new one was presented 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.420
 home console microsoft and without a 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.130
 pact we can say that the console like 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.110
 it can be said resembles a 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:19.650
 VCR is not as ugly as how 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.210
 design is beautiful anyway but i don't 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.500
 like the shape that is good thinking it is 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.110
 more beautiful than now, at least it is 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.300
 slightly rounded to those details 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.660
 which make it special though 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.230
 ignoring these things we move on to 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.980
 part software changes also to 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.030
 part fate we can immediately notice the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.210
 new boot screen 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.460
 the new ignition screen that is 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.440
 slightly different from the previous one 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.000
 then we note that the upload is 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.980
 greatly improved or it takes 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.380
 very little time for it to load 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.350
 new dashboard 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:08.010
 then we can see the multitasking that 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.090
 now it lacks much in the current ex box for 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.370
 who did not know multitasking 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.970
 that computer capacity of 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.000
 consul 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.760
 in short, of any device of 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.020
 run multiple games apps 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.459
 whatever at the same time and then 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.920
 we can see that has been added 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.770
 TV tuner that will allow us to 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.580
 watch tv on our xbox thing 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.260
 that all in all it is not is not really the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.989
 maximum utility, however, can be 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.180
 useful in cult ipo we are playing and being 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.330
 to take a program as we have 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.930
 our kinect and xbox watch tv and there 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:53.670
 the screen changes automatically 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.560
 another thing we notice and seeing that 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.630
 this this is what it was 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.360
 introduced skype 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.560
 which I think is one of the best things 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.540
 skype that is missing now on xbox ci 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.200
 will allow you to make calls e 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.660
 video calls using kinect with i 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.000
 our friends who are on Skype e 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.560
 obviously we can answer o 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.209
 however close a call only with 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.950
 the voice command very good then 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.660
 we can see that they have been added 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.550
 notifications and just like him windows 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.670
 8 in fact as we see above a 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.620
 left of the xbox screen stands 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.630
 coming a call on skype and the 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.940
 our life warns us now 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.880
 passing to the hardware part we can 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.640
 note significant changes in the 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.050
 structure of our xbox le 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.510
 hardware features really are 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.930
 improved we can see that at 8 gb of 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.480
 ram 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:57.080
 not bad and then we notice a processor from 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.370
 eight cores an internal hard drive not like 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:05.090
 the first is 360 the removable product 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:09.820
 quietly then we notice a a 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.820
 blu ray player that could not miss 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.150
 the network in the wireless network card e 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.100
 hdmi which obviously cannot be missing e 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.560
 usb 3.0 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.050
 why didn't you know usb 3.0 is 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.790
 the evolution of today's usb ports 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.060
 which allows a data exchange 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:32.810
 considerably more, however, the more news 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.930
 important we can include the new 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.880
 new controller joystick that will be 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.550
 similar to the previous one did not 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.010
 lousy like that of s4 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.780
 will be similar to the previous one after 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.430
 some modifications 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.940
 this controller 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.430
 practically there are very relevant 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.400
 concerning the position of the key of 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.320
 xbox help key and change of 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.930
 start and back keys 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.510
 for the rest we can say that it will remain 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.210
 similar except for the analogs that 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.370
 they will change some form more than 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.350
 shape will change the structure 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.740
 among the important innovations we can also 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.350
 include the new kinect that besides ad 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.540
 be completely redesigned there 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.850
 will also allow you to play up to 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.590
 four players 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.950
 at this point we can conclude 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.870
 this review at least in my opinion 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.580
 saying that during this event in 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.430
 direct call of was also presented 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.820
 duty ghost the new call of duty done 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.490
 from infinity ward the same creators who 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.880
 they did the modern warfare series 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.520
 this game was completely 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.100
 redone in the sense that the maps now 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.830
 they will be dynamic or destructible 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.550
 how to see battlefield will be 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:57.070
 redraw the textures and that is they will be 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.010
 in short, they have already been done and will be 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.800
 anyway I think it's a good game and me 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.440
 I had underestimated infinity ward then 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.690
 for this he sees everything if I review 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.950
 i'm forgotten something please 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.430
 write it in the comments maybe 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:15.430
 will reach second video and killer 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.960
 it is all thanks matteo who has me 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.280
 lent his computer since the 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.870
 mine has melted 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.780
 I put the new charger in there 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:26.410
 started smoking and told her to 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.420
 quit but said it was a vice e 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.430
 apart from these jokes in bad taste 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.440
 I greet you and see you next time 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.440
 on my channel from whoever had it was everything 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.710
 no
