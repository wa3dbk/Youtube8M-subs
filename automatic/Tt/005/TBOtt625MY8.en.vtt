good<00:02:40.270> but<00:02:40.600> why<00:02:40.720> take<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:40.990> chance<00:02:41.170> when<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.620> can

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
good but why take that chance when I can

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.680 
good but why take that chance when I can
cycle<00:02:42.130> through<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:43.030> know<00:02:43.120> when<00:02:43.270> you<00:02:43.360> think<00:02:43.570> of

cycle through you know when you think of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.750 
cycle through you know when you think of
spending<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.590> couple<00:02:44.710> thousand<00:02:45.250> dollars<00:02:45.280> every

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
butter it's hard to forget it's easy to

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.219 
butter it's hard to forget it's easy to
forget<00:04:31.150> things<00:04:31.419> like<00:04:31.570> butter<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:32.080> they're

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
usually hard to store if they don't last

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.550 
usually hard to store if they don't last
forever<00:04:33.790> but<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.720> canned<00:04:34.960> option<00:04:35.410> is<00:04:35.530> a

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
forever but this canned option is a

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.890
