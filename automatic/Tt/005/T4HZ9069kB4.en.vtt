about<00:00:06.330> AI<00:00:06.540> for<00:00:07.020> massive<00:00:07.350> destruction<00:00:07.740> last

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
about AI for massive destruction last

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.330 
about AI for massive destruction last
year<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.360> came<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.690> GDC<00:00:09.990> with<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> demonstration

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
year we came to GDC with a demonstration

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.120 
year we came to GDC with a demonstration
of<00:00:11.690> destructibility<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.200> how<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.830> could

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
of destructibility and how you could

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.709 
of destructibility and how you could
move<00:00:14.400> objects<00:00:14.910> around<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.269> physical

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
move objects around in physical

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.570 
move objects around in physical
environment<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:17.039> what<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.279> wanted<00:00:17.520> to

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
environment and really what we wanted to

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.939 
environment and really what we wanted to
show<00:00:17.760> off<00:00:17.789> was<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:19.199> an<00:00:19.289> awful<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.619> fun<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
show off was it's an awful lot of fun to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.170 
show off was it's an awful lot of fun to
be<00:00:19.980> able<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.250> blow<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.490> an<00:00:20.580> environment<00:00:21.060> and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
be able to blow up an environment and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.990 
be able to blow up an environment and
have<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> AI<00:00:21.660> react<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.580> so<00:00:23.580> here<00:00:23.850> you'll

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
have the AI react to that so here you'll

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.849 
have the AI react to that so here you'll
see<00:00:24.090> there's<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.510> demonstration<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.710> bunch

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
see there's a demonstration of a bunch

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.920 
see there's a demonstration of a bunch
of<00:00:25.980> ducks<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> background<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.750> do

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
of ducks in the background that do

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720 
of ducks in the background that do
exactly<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.740> react<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.250> dynamic

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
exactly that they react to a dynamic

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.299 
exactly that they react to a dynamic
environment<00:00:30.679> and<00:00:31.679> you'll<00:00:31.800> notice<00:00:31.949> while<00:00:32.189> I'm

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
environment and you'll notice while I'm

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130 
environment and you'll notice while I'm
playing<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> game<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.210> founder<00:00:33.600> destroy

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
playing the game that founder destroy

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.799 
playing the game that founder destroy
the<00:00:34.290> environment<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.880> Ducks<00:00:36.120> are<00:00:36.390> moving

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the environment the Ducks are moving

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.270 
the environment the Ducks are moving
around<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.110> background<00:00:37.559> their<00:00:37.829> goal<00:00:38.250> is

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
around of the background their goal is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.970 
around of the background their goal is
to<00:00:38.489> get<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> gun<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:40.440> they'll<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.800> is

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
to get to the gun and what they'll do is

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.380 
to get to the gun and what they'll do is
they'll<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.280> anything<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.760> everything<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.059> go

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
they'll do anything and everything to go

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.209 
they'll do anything and everything to go
to<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.899> by<00:00:43.140> moving<00:00:43.379> around<00:00:43.710> everything

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
to do that by moving around everything

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.360 
to do that by moving around everything
that's<00:00:44.399> moving<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> environment<00:00:46.370> now

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that's moving in the environment now

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.250 
that's moving in the environment now
really<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.300> least<00:00:48.510> attempt<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
really this is like least attempt to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.900 
really this is like least attempt to
deal<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.980> these<00:00:50.340> types<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.730> physical

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
deal with these types of physical

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.600 
deal with these types of physical
environments<00:00:51.949> it's<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.129> sophisticated

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
environments it's not that sophisticated

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.340 
environments it's not that sophisticated
but<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.390> did<00:00:54.510> realize<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.289> was

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
but we did realize that this was

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.840 
but we did realize that this was
important<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.280> wanted<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
important and we wanted to have to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.049 
important and we wanted to have to
continue<00:00:57.030> having<00:00:57.890> dynamic<00:00:58.890> cash<00:00:59.070> binding<00:01:02.059> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
continue having dynamic cash binding so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.729 
continue having dynamic cash binding so
here<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.510> at<00:01:03.539> GDC<00:01:03.930> we're<00:01:04.379> releasing

titles we really want to be able to have

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.910 
titles we really want to be able to have
an<00:01:47.880> open-ended<00:01:48.420> sandbox<00:01:49.079> type<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.560> feeling

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
an open-ended sandbox type of feeling

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.590 
an open-ended sandbox type of feeling
when<00:01:50.460> you're<00:01:50.610> playing<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:51.060> games<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.570> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
when you're playing your games so that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.230 
when you're playing your games so that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you can let your level designers have a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.300 
you can let your level designers have a
little<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.600> more<00:01:54.689> creativity<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:56.040> your

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
little bit more creativity for your

content creation now without further ado

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.910 
content creation now without further ado
let's<00:01:59.759> get<00:02:00.240> into<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.689> games<00:02:01.229> let<00:02:01.469> me<00:02:01.590> load

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
let's get into the games let me load

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.840 
let's get into the games let me load
that<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.369> our<00:02:05.520> demo

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
that up here so here we have our demo

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.249 
that up here so here we have our demo
I'll<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.270> grab<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> couple<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.780> weapons<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
I'll just grab a couple of weapons and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.669 
I'll just grab a couple of weapons and
get<00:02:07.560> through<00:02:07.680> this

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
get through this

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.069 
get through this
here<00:02:09.459> on<00:02:09.609> the<00:02:09.700> left<00:02:09.879> all<00:02:10.450> right<00:02:10.629> so<00:02:10.780> now<00:02:10.929> i<00:02:10.959> have

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
here on the left all right so now i have

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.990 
here on the left all right so now i have
a<00:02:11.260> few<00:02:11.799> weapons<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.400> what<00:02:12.549> we<00:02:12.640> want<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.849> talk

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
a few weapons and what we want to talk

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.369 
a few weapons and what we want to talk
about<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.450> difference<00:02:13.810> between<00:02:13.870> static

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
about is the difference between static

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.990 
about is the difference between static
versus<00:02:14.769> dynamic<00:02:14.799> so<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.549> see<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> first

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
versus dynamic so you see the first

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.729 
versus dynamic so you see the first
character<00:02:16.239> is<00:02:16.540> using<00:02:16.810> static<00:02:17.140> path<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.500> need<00:02:17.650> to

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
character is using static path I need to

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.979 
character is using static path I need to
get<00:02:17.859> to<00:02:17.920> me<00:02:18.129> now<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:19.000> course<00:02:19.030> when<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.599> static

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
get to me now of course when a static

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.809 
get to me now of course when a static
character<00:02:20.409> encounter<00:02:20.950> something<00:02:21.189> dynamic<00:02:21.430> in

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
character encounter something dynamic in

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.759 
character encounter something dynamic in
the<00:02:21.849> environment<00:02:22.390> they'll<00:02:23.230> actually<00:02:23.469> have

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
the environment they'll actually have

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.860 
the environment they'll actually have
difficulty<00:02:24.340> because<00:02:24.519> there's<00:02:24.909> no<00:02:25.150> pre<00:02:25.510> markup

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
difficulty because there's no pre markup

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.360 
difficulty because there's no pre markup
for<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.230> object<00:02:26.379> so<00:02:26.709> here<00:02:26.950> I'll<00:02:27.040> spawn<00:02:27.340> a

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
for that object so here I'll spawn a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.099 
for that object so here I'll spawn a
second<00:02:27.849> character<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.780> can<00:02:28.930> see<00:02:29.079> that

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
second character and you can see that

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.509 
second character and you can see that
they<00:02:29.379> get<00:02:29.560> stuck<00:02:29.889> behind<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:31.000> object<00:02:31.469> now

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
they get stuck behind that object now

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.849 
they get stuck behind that object now
our<00:02:33.519> system<00:02:33.969> is<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.230> different<00:02:35.230> type<00:02:35.379> of<00:02:35.409> system

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
our system is a different type of system

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.129 
our system is a different type of system
where<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.189> an<00:02:36.280> area<00:02:36.489> based<00:02:36.849> solution<00:02:37.329> where

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
where it's an area based solution where

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.440 
where it's an area based solution where
we<00:02:38.230> mark<00:02:38.469> up<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> objects<00:02:39.099> in<00:02:39.159> the<00:02:39.250> area<00:02:39.609> as

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
we mark up the objects in the area as

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.690 
we mark up the objects in the area as
opposed<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.470> using<00:02:41.889> something<00:02:42.220> like<00:02:42.370> path

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
opposed to using something like path

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.449 
opposed to using something like path
nodes<00:02:43.260> which<00:02:44.260> were<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.590> gray<00:02:44.919> lines<00:02:45.159> that<00:02:45.370> you

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
nodes which were the gray lines that you

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.789 
nodes which were the gray lines that you
were<00:02:45.549> just<00:02:45.760> seen<00:02:46.319> now<00:02:47.319> when<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.590> character

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
were just seen now when a character

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.319 
were just seen now when a character
moves<00:02:48.159> to<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> environment<00:02:48.609> in<00:02:48.879> our<00:02:48.970> system

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
moves to the environment in our system

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.339 
moves to the environment in our system
they<00:02:49.510> know<00:02:49.629> how<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.780> get<00:02:49.959> around<00:02:50.079> the

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
they know how to get around the

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.610 
they know how to get around the
obstacles<00:02:51.189> directly<00:02:52.090> as<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.079> can<00:02:53.230> see<00:02:53.409> there

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
obstacles directly as you can see there

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.949 
obstacles directly as you can see there
and<00:02:54.489> if<00:02:54.609> I<00:02:54.730> change<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.450> environment<00:02:55.540> to

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
and if I change the environment to

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.629 
and if I change the environment to
remove<00:02:56.200> things<00:02:56.500> around<00:02:56.769> you<00:02:57.280> can<00:02:57.430> see<00:02:57.609> that

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
remove things around you can see that

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.119 
remove things around you can see that
the<00:02:57.879> character<00:02:58.239> now<00:02:58.359> modifies<00:02:58.900> their<00:02:59.109> path<00:02:59.290> in

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
the character now modifies their path in

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.369 
the character now modifies their path in
order<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.519> get<00:03:00.669> to<00:03:00.819> me<00:03:00.939> now<00:03:01.659> here<00:03:01.989> on<00:03:02.079> the<00:03:02.169> Left

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
order to get to me now here on the Left

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.020 
order to get to me now here on the Left
what<00:03:02.650> we<00:03:02.739> have<00:03:02.919> is<00:03:03.099> we<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.280> an<00:03:03.549> area<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.879> is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
what we have is we have an area that is

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.830 
what we have is we have an area that is
blocked<00:03:04.389> off<00:03:04.739> so<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.980> character<00:03:06.549> as<00:03:07.480> soon<00:03:07.719> as

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
blocked off so the character as soon as

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.089 
blocked off so the character as soon as
they're<00:03:08.019> spawned<00:03:08.319> they'll<00:03:08.560> realize<00:03:08.889> that

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
they're spawned they'll realize that

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.860 
they're spawned they'll realize that
they<00:03:09.219> can't<00:03:09.459> get<00:03:09.760> down<00:03:09.969> the<00:03:10.329> railing<00:03:10.719> so

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
they can't get down the railing so

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.559 
they can't get down the railing so
they'll<00:03:10.989> come<00:03:11.139> around<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.500> long<00:03:11.680> way<00:03:11.940> now<00:03:12.940> if

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
they'll come around the long way now if

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.229 
they'll come around the long way now if
I<00:03:13.780> were<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.049> go<00:03:14.199> in<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:14.949> create<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.489> slightly

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
I were to go in and create a slightly

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.050 
I were to go in and create a slightly
bigger<00:03:16.449> hole<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:18.220> time<00:03:18.549> round<00:03:18.790> the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
bigger hole this time round the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.460 
bigger hole this time round the
character<00:03:19.449> will<00:03:19.599> be<00:03:19.629> smart<00:03:19.959> enough<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.349> know

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
character will be smart enough to know

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.050 
character will be smart enough to know
that<00:03:20.500> they<00:03:20.949> can<00:03:21.129> actually<00:03:21.159> get<00:03:21.609> down<00:03:21.849> by

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
that they can actually get down by

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.589 
that they can actually get down by
jumping<00:03:22.479> toward<00:03:22.750> me<00:03:23.849> so<00:03:24.849> get<00:03:25.060> rid<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.359> guy

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
jumping toward me so get rid of that guy

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.890 
jumping toward me so get rid of that guy
and<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:27.459> over<00:03:27.489> here<00:03:28.060> what<00:03:28.239> we<00:03:28.359> have<00:03:28.389> is<00:03:28.569> we<00:03:28.750> have

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
and so over here what we have is we have

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.420 
and so over here what we have is we have
a<00:03:29.109> character<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.739> able<00:03:29.949> to<00:03:30.010> walk<00:03:30.189> straight

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
a character is able to walk straight

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.420 
a character is able to walk straight
through<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.729> corridor<00:03:31.620> whereas<00:03:32.620> if<00:03:32.650> i<00:03:33.189> were

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
through the corridor whereas if i were

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.240 
through the corridor whereas if i were
to<00:03:33.609> modify<00:03:34.209> slightly<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:34.689> environment<00:03:35.319> this

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
to modify slightly the environment this

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.920 
to modify slightly the environment this
time<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.760> character<00:03:37.120> knows<00:03:37.269> how<00:03:37.449> to<00:03:37.509> vault

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
time the character knows how to vault

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.640 
time the character knows how to vault
over<00:03:38.079> top<00:03:38.409> of<00:03:38.439> objects<00:03:39.209> now<00:03:40.209> again<00:03:40.419> if<00:03:40.750> i<00:03:40.900> go<00:03:41.500> up

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
over top of objects now again if i go up

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.619 
over top of objects now again if i go up
to<00:03:41.799> that<00:03:41.949> object<00:03:42.099> a<00:03:42.699> little<00:03:43.120> bit<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.419> side

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
to that object a little bit to the side

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:44.879 
to that object a little bit to the side
you'll<00:03:43.930> see<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.290> they<00:03:44.470> know<00:03:44.650> how<00:03:44.859> to

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
you'll see that they know how to

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.330 
you'll see that they know how to
navigate<00:03:45.280> around<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:47.109> last<00:03:47.560> piece<00:03:47.919> here

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
navigate around the last piece here

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.909 
navigate around the last piece here
you'll<00:03:49.180> see<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.599> when<00:03:50.049> i<00:03:50.109> spawn<00:03:50.409> a<00:03:50.439> character

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
you'll see that when i spawn a character

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.189 
you'll see that when i spawn a character
they<00:03:51.009> come<00:03:51.220> straight<00:03:51.519> toward<00:03:51.819> me<00:03:51.959> well<00:03:52.959> that

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
they come straight toward me well that

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.899 
they come straight toward me well that
that's<00:03:53.349> interesting<00:03:53.859> in<00:03:54.009> moffat<00:03:54.370> most<00:03:54.669> path

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
that's interesting in moffat most path

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.780 
that's interesting in moffat most path
node<00:03:55.150> systems<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:56.409> that<00:03:56.590> will<00:03:56.739> happen<00:03:56.790> but

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
node systems that that will happen but

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.429 
node systems that that will happen but
it<00:03:57.879> will<00:03:58.000> be<00:03:58.030> very<00:03:58.209> robotic<00:03:58.689> they'll<00:03:58.989> stop<00:03:59.229> and

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
it will be very robotic they'll stop and

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.990 
it will be very robotic they'll stop and
I'll<00:03:59.530> turn<00:03:59.739> whereas<00:04:00.159> in<00:04:00.280> our<00:04:00.400> system<00:04:00.790> they'll

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
I'll turn whereas in our system they'll

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.569 
I'll turn whereas in our system they'll
move<00:04:01.239> straight<00:04:01.599> towards<00:04:02.109> you<00:04:02.229> if<00:04:03.129> I<00:04:03.310> modify

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
move straight towards you if I modify

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.249 
move straight towards you if I modify
the<00:04:03.879> environment<00:04:04.120> slightly<00:04:04.750> by<00:04:04.870> knocking

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:05.259 
the environment slightly by knocking

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:07.170 
the environment slightly by knocking
down<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.409> box<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:06.669> can<00:04:06.790> see<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:07.090> the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
down a box you can see that the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.210 
down a box you can see that the
character<00:04:07.509> was<00:04:07.540> able<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.870> get<00:04:07.989> around<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.560> if

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
character was able to get around and if

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.909 
character was able to get around and if
I<00:04:09.340> block<00:04:09.579> everything<00:04:09.879> off<00:04:10.209> then<00:04:10.870> when<00:04:11.439> I<00:04:11.470> spawn

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
I block everything off then when I spawn

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.039 
I block everything off then when I spawn
the<00:04:12.189> next<00:04:12.220> character<00:04:12.689> you'll<00:04:13.689> see<00:04:13.900> that

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
the next character you'll see that

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.330 
the next character you'll see that
they'll<00:04:14.229> be<00:04:14.439> smart<00:04:14.769> enough<00:04:14.859> that<00:04:15.009> they'll

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
they'll be smart enough that they'll

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.399 
they'll be smart enough that they'll
actually<00:04:15.370> be<00:04:15.699> able<00:04:15.849> to<00:04:15.970> get<00:04:16.120> around<00:04:16.409> taking

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
actually be able to get around taking

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.259 
actually be able to get around taking
the<00:04:17.560> long<00:04:17.739> route<00:04:17.979> jumping<00:04:18.400> down<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:19.029> getting

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
the long route jumping down and getting

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.440 
the long route jumping down and getting
to<00:04:19.479> me<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:19.930> way<00:04:20.880> now<00:04:21.880> final

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
to me that that way now final

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.960 
to me that that way now final
lean<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:23.800> far<00:04:24.040> you've<00:04:24.190> seen<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.430> bunch<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.670> rigid

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
lean so far you've seen a bunch of rigid

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.000 
lean so far you've seen a bunch of rigid
body<00:04:25.150> objects<00:04:25.690> but<00:04:26.440> what<00:04:26.590> we're<00:04:26.710> going<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.950> be

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
body objects but what we're going to be

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.740 
body objects but what we're going to be
dealing<00:04:27.130> with<00:04:27.430> is<00:04:27.670> dynamic<00:04:28.150> object<00:04:28.540> so<00:04:28.630> I'm

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
dealing with is dynamic object so I'm

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.000 
dealing with is dynamic object so I'm
going<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:28.990> go<00:04:29.110> in<00:04:29.230> here<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.560> I'm<00:04:29.740> going<00:04:29.920> to

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
going to go in here and I'm going to

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.370 
going to go in here and I'm going to
mess<00:04:30.310> up<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.580> environment<00:04:31.000> by<00:04:31.120> blowing<00:04:32.110> up

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
mess up the environment by blowing up

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.250 
mess up the environment by blowing up
some<00:04:32.800> destructible<00:04:33.280> objects<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:34.660> now<00:04:34.930> if<00:04:35.110> you

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
some destructible objects and now if you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.540 
some destructible objects and now if you
look<00:04:35.470> you'll<00:04:35.650> see<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.100> character<00:04:36.520> is

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
look you'll see that the character is

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.490 
look you'll see that the character is
able<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.150> react<00:04:37.420> well<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.840> get<00:04:37.930> around<00:04:38.140> all<00:04:38.350> of

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
able to react well and get around all of

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.200 
able to react well and get around all of
those<00:04:38.620> dynamic<00:04:39.220> objects<00:04:41.640> other<00:04:42.640> interesting

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
those dynamic objects other interesting

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.030 
those dynamic objects other interesting
aspect<00:04:43.630> of<00:04:43.750> our<00:04:43.840> software<00:04:44.200> is<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.680> we<00:04:44.800> can

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
aspect of our software is that we can

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.400 
aspect of our software is that we can
create<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.520> cash<00:04:45.850> so<00:04:46.690> whether<00:04:47.020> I'm<00:04:47.260> playing

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
create a cash so whether I'm playing

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.900 
create a cash so whether I'm playing
this<00:04:47.740> on<00:04:47.950> an<00:04:48.460> xbox<00:04:48.730> 360<00:04:50.190> what<00:04:51.190> i<00:04:51.220> can<00:04:51.430> do<00:04:51.580> is<00:04:51.610> i

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
this on an xbox 360 what i can do is i

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.780 
this on an xbox 360 what i can do is i
can<00:04:51.940> generate<00:04:52.780> an<00:04:53.440> acx<00:04:53.860> file<00:04:54.130> that<00:04:54.430> i<00:04:54.460> can<00:04:54.670> look

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
can generate an acx file that i can look

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.520 
can generate an acx file that i can look
at<00:04:54.940> afterwards<00:04:55.420> inside<00:04:55.840> of<00:04:55.960> our<00:04:56.080> debugging

see<00:05:02.410> here<00:05:02.860> I'm<00:05:03.130> looking<00:05:03.730> at<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.850> bunch<00:05:03.940> of<00:05:04.060> green

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
see here I'm looking at a bunch of green

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.440 
see here I'm looking at a bunch of green
lines<00:05:04.540> and<00:05:04.930> there's<00:05:06.150> visualization<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.300> can

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
lines and there's visualization that can

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.790 
lines and there's visualization that can
be<00:05:07.540> used<00:05:07.690> for<00:05:07.780> debugging<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.350> I<00:05:08.470> can<00:05:08.620> step

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
be used for debugging and I can step

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.950 
be used for debugging and I can step
through<00:05:08.920> and<00:05:09.100> say<00:05:09.250> AHA<00:05:10.090> you<00:05:10.420> see<00:05:10.600> that<00:05:10.750> point

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
through and say AHA you see that point
