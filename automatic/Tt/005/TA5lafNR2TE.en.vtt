think I don't like is my bottle does not
look<00:00:21.090> exactly<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.779> all<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.380> other<00:00:22.590> bottles

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
look exactly like all the other bottles

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
look exactly like all the other bottles
like<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:23.910> are<00:00:23.939> these<00:00:24.029> flowers<00:00:24.330> where<00:00:24.750> do

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
like what are these flowers where do

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.480 
like what are these flowers where do
these<00:00:24.900> come<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.010> like<00:00:26.220> what<00:00:26.369> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that I was looking at the ingredients in

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.040 
that I was looking at the ingredients in
there<00:00:29.070> not<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.760> same<00:00:30.000> exact<00:00:30.449> order<00:00:30.810> either

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
there not on the same exact order either

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.229 
there not on the same exact order either
so<00:00:31.710> I'm<00:00:31.890> wondering<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.579> are<00:00:32.790> there<00:00:32.910> two

is that all about so hopefully this is
the<00:00:56.070> same<00:00:56.340> exact<00:00:56.910> product<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.590> theory

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the same exact product I with the theory

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.150 
the same exact product I with the theory
dance<00:00:59.160> um<00:01:00.320> like<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.410> said<00:01:01.440> they're<00:01:01.770> mostly<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
dance um like I said they're mostly the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
dance um like I said they're mostly the
same<00:01:02.190> except<00:01:02.820> they're<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> same

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
same except they're just not in the same

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380 
same except they're just not in the same
order<00:01:04.439> meaning<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:06.240> those<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
order meaning that you know for those of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
order meaning that you know for those of
you<00:01:06.600> don't<00:01:06.630> know<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.560> lists<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you don't know when it lists the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.330 
you don't know when it lists the
ingredients<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> ones<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> top<00:01:10.280> are<00:01:11.280> the

ingredients the ones at the top are the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.980 
ingredients the ones at the top are the
ones<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.180> most<00:01:12.210> potent<00:01:12.780> that's<00:01:12.900> what

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
ones that are most potent that's what

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
they have the most of the ones all at

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.359 
they have the most of the ones all at
the<00:01:14.520> bottom<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:15.090> least<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.189> one<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.280> the

the bottom or at least up and one of the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.070 
the bottom or at least up and one of the
main<00:01:17.580> ingredients<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.570> supposed<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
main ingredients for that's supposed to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630 
main ingredients for that's supposed to
help<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> hair<00:01:19.770> growth<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.130> protein

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
help with the hair growth is the protein

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.080 
help with the hair growth is the protein
and<00:01:21.140> here<00:01:22.140> has<00:01:22.380> hydrolyzed<00:01:23.009> keratin<00:01:23.700> protein

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and here has hydrolyzed keratin protein

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.370 
and here has hydrolyzed keratin protein
but<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.259> further<00:01:25.590> down<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.159> list<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380

more fragrances I mean a few more
ingredients<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.299> don't<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:33.960> how<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
ingredients but I don't like how this

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.080 
ingredients but I don't like how this
how<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.890> protein<00:01:35.310> isn't<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.670> high<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
how the protein isn't as high up on the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.749 
how the protein isn't as high up on the
list<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> other<00:01:36.689> ones<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.470> anywho<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.189> got

I'm<00:04:05.400> not<00:04:05.459> here<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.670> get<00:04:05.879> thicker<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.239> think<00:04:06.629> I

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
I'm not here to get thicker I think I

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.960 
I'm not here to get thicker I think I
would<00:04:06.780> like<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:06.930> even<00:04:07.200> more<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.799> than<00:04:08.640> where

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
would like that even more so than where

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.330 
would like that even more so than where
to<00:04:09.090> get<00:04:09.209> longer<00:04:09.450> because<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.319> it<00:04:10.920> grows<00:04:11.069> out

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
to get longer because it it grows out

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.520 
to get longer because it it grows out
pretty<00:04:11.549> average<00:04:11.790> rate<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.180> what<00:04:12.540> half<00:04:13.140> an<00:04:13.349> inch

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
pretty average rate of what half an inch

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.650 
pretty average rate of what half an inch
per<00:04:13.799> month<00:04:14.040> all<00:04:14.879> you<00:04:15.030> have<00:04:15.180> them<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.480> measure

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
per month all you have them to measure

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.340 
per month all you have them to measure
my<00:04:15.870> hair<00:04:16.109> on<00:04:16.139> camera

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
my hair on camera

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.190 
my hair on camera
that's<00:04:18.220> okay<00:04:18.459> what<00:04:18.730> I'll<00:04:18.850> do<00:04:19.060> when<00:04:19.600> I<00:04:19.630> do<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:20.050> up

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
that's okay what I'll do when I do it up

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.070 
that's okay what I'll do when I do it up
I'm<00:04:20.740> update<00:04:21.160> but<00:04:21.370> I'll<00:04:21.880> just<00:04:22.300> measure<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.990> out

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
I'm update but I'll just measure it out

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.260 
I'm update but I'll just measure it out
but<00:04:23.350> I<00:04:23.530> video<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.310> that<00:04:24.700> should<00:04:24.850> be<00:04:24.940> enough<00:04:25.150> I

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
but I video so that should be enough I

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.120 
but I video so that should be enough I
should<00:04:25.450> need<00:04:25.600> all<00:04:25.780> these<00:04:26.050> other<00:04:26.350> measures<00:04:26.740> but

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
should need all these other measures but

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.350 
should need all these other measures but
people<00:04:27.400> are<00:04:27.490> say<00:04:27.610> anything<00:04:27.880> here<00:04:28.060> grow<00:04:28.210> an

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
people are say anything here grow an

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.500 
people are say anything here grow an
inch<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.810> month<00:04:28.960> which<00:04:29.320> it's<00:04:30.100> not<00:04:30.430> typical<00:04:30.850> so

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
inch a month which it's not typical so

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.200 
inch a month which it's not typical so
it<00:04:31.810> would<00:04:32.020> be<00:04:32.170> nice<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.500> see<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:33.370> actual<00:04:33.550> you

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
it would be nice to see the actual you

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.640 
it would be nice to see the actual you
know<00:04:34.240> how<00:04:34.420> many<00:04:34.600> inches<00:04:34.780> or<00:04:35.080> centimeters<00:04:35.230> or

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650
