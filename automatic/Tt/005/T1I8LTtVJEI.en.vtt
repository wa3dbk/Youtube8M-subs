00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I mean she's that offense is just very

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.560 
I mean she's that offense is just very
high-powered<00:00:34.890> man<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.969> every<00:00:36.360> position

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
high-powered man like at every position

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.459 
high-powered man like at every position
there's<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.399> very<00:00:38.690> skilled<00:00:39.690> playmaker<00:00:40.200> it

couple<00:02:23.269> passes<00:02:23.749> today<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.079> this<00:02:24.379> court<00:02:24.650> might

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
couple passes today so this court might

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.220 
couple passes today so this court might
have<00:02:24.920> been<00:02:25.249> I<00:02:25.689> mean<00:02:26.689> they<00:02:26.780> might<00:02:26.959> have<00:02:27.079> scored

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
have been I mean they might have scored

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.959

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
the defensive side I mean I mean they

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.390 
the defensive side I mean I mean they
locked<00:02:46.790> up<00:02:47.000> when<00:02:47.180> they<00:02:47.269> needed<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.950> but<00:02:48.950> I'm

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
locked up when they needed to but I'm

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.800 
locked up when they needed to but I'm
not<00:02:49.549> gonna<00:02:49.730> come<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.150> say<00:02:50.329> there<00:02:50.480> was<00:02:50.629> some

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
not gonna come and say there was some

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.770 
not gonna come and say there was some
dominant<00:02:51.319> defense<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.889> mean<00:02:51.919> they<00:02:52.760> gave<00:02:52.939> up<00:02:53.120> you

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
dominant defense I mean they gave up you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.000 
dominant defense I mean they gave up you
know<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> lot<00:02:54.169> of<00:02:54.260> points<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:56.180> mean<00:02:57.019> they

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
know a lot of points and I mean they

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.289 
know a lot of points and I mean they
needed<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.370> tighten<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.819> up<00:02:58.879> a<00:02:59.060> little<00:02:59.150> bit

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
needed to tighten that up a little bit

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.009 
needed to tighten that up a little bit
but<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.750> offense<00:03:00.639> I'm<00:03:01.639> probably<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.810> don't

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
but the offense I'm probably I don't

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.369 
but the offense I'm probably I don't
know<00:03:03.169> they're<00:03:03.379> definitely<00:03:04.280> top<00:03:04.819> three<00:03:05.120> if<00:03:05.750> not

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
know they're definitely top three if not

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.149 
know they're definitely top three if not
the<00:03:06.530> best<00:03:06.680> offense<00:03:07.159> right<00:03:07.370> now<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:08.180> my<00:03:08.480> opinion

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
the best offense right now in my opinion

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.569 
the best offense right now in my opinion
and<00:03:10.159> then<00:03:11.139> on<00:03:12.139> the<00:03:12.349> flipside<00:03:12.560> that

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
and then on the flipside that

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.659 
and then on the flipside that
the<00:03:14.299> Redskins<00:03:14.680> Kirk<00:03:15.680> Cousins<00:03:15.919> man<00:03:16.310> he<00:03:16.430> played

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
the Redskins Kirk Cousins man he played

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.399 
the Redskins Kirk Cousins man he played
well<00:03:17.000> he<00:03:17.269> threw<00:03:17.540> for<00:03:17.720> over<00:03:17.810> 400<00:03:18.620> yards<00:03:18.979> today

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
well he threw for over 400 yards today

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.189 
well he threw for over 400 yards today
he<00:03:21.409> had<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.799> bad<00:03:22.099> interception<00:03:22.879> I<00:03:23.120> think<00:03:24.109> he

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
he had that bad interception I think he

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.990 
he had that bad interception I think he
I<00:03:24.650> think<00:03:24.889> he<00:03:25.129> initially<00:03:25.489> thought<00:03:25.669> it<00:03:25.849> was

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
I think he initially thought it was

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.460 
I think he initially thought it was
going<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.180> be<00:03:26.269> incomplete<00:03:26.840> pass<00:03:27.049> that's<00:03:27.319> why

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
going to be incomplete pass that's why

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.420 
going to be incomplete pass that's why
he<00:03:27.620> threw<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:28.009> but<00:03:28.819> you<00:03:29.209> know<00:03:30.220> Malcolm<00:03:31.220> Jenkins

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
he threw it but you know Malcolm Jenkins

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.679 
he threw it but you know Malcolm Jenkins

which is great at no point did you ever
say<00:03:54.669> the<00:03:55.669> Eagles<00:03:56.000> this<00:03:56.359> has<00:03:56.540> become<00:03:56.959> a<00:03:57.169> blowout

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
say the Eagles this has become a blowout

say the Eagles this has become a blowout
you<00:03:57.799> know<00:03:57.949> it<00:03:58.189> was<00:03:58.340> competitive<00:03:58.909> throughout

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
you know it was competitive throughout

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.999 
you know it was competitive throughout
and<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:01.340> mean<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.269> was<00:04:02.359> that<00:04:02.569> and<00:04:03.379> then<00:04:03.620> lastly

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:04.009 
and I mean that was that and then lastly

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.280 
and I mean that was that and then lastly
DeSean<00:04:04.669> Jackson<00:04:05.209> he<00:04:05.359> caught<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.689> like<00:04:06.019> 80

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
DeSean Jackson he caught it like 80

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.379

something yard touchdown on the former
team<00:04:09.129> home<00:04:10.129> I<00:04:10.519> guess<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:11.000> was<00:04:11.090> his<00:04:11.180> little

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
team home I guess that was his little

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.939 
team home I guess that was his little
revenge<00:04:11.859> or<00:04:12.859> whatever<00:04:13.219> and<00:04:14.560> he<00:04:15.560> also<00:04:15.680> was

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
revenge or whatever and he also was

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
getting it in he was getting into it

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.330 
getting it in he was getting into it
with<00:04:17.359> like<00:04:17.630> Boykin<00:04:18.079> and<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.469> couple<00:04:19.190> other

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
tough game next week at the 49ers but

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.510 
tough game next week at the 49ers but
we'll<00:04:33.680> see<00:04:33.830> what<00:04:33.950> happens

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
we'll see what happens

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.659 
we'll see what happens
I<00:04:34.750> personally<00:04:35.750> think<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.860> 49ers<00:04:37.460> might

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
I personally think the 49ers might

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.210 
I personally think the 49ers might
actually<00:04:37.850> give<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.960> Eagles<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.650> first<00:04:39.980> loss

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
actually give the Eagles the first loss

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.220 
actually give the Eagles the first loss
but<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:41.050> mean<00:04:42.490> I'm<00:04:43.490> just<00:04:43.880> speculating<00:04:44.570> pretty

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
but I mean I'm just speculating pretty

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.710 
but I mean I'm just speculating pretty
much<00:04:45.910> there's<00:04:46.910> still<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.180> whole<00:04:47.330> another<00:04:47.450> week

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
much there's still a whole another week

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.200 
much there's still a whole another week
to<00:04:47.750> go<00:04:48.050> in<00:04:48.290> I<00:04:48.620> mean<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.550> Eagles<00:04:49.910> could<00:04:50.030> just

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
to go in I mean the Eagles could just

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.850 
to go in I mean the Eagles could just
get<00:04:50.360> better<00:04:50.510> from<00:04:50.720> here<00:04:50.810> on<00:04:50.990> out<00:04:51.230> so<00:04:51.560> who<00:04:51.710> knows

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
get better from here on out so who knows

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.700 
get better from here on out so who knows
