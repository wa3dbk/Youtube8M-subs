through<00:01:57.750> someone<00:01:58.079> shelf<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> boat<00:01:59.009> in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
through someone shelf to the boat in

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.600 
through someone shelf to the boat in
free<00:01:59.579> haunt<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.860> actually<00:02:01.860> decided<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> take

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
free haunt and actually decided to take

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.389 
free haunt and actually decided to take
a<00:02:02.640> little<00:02:02.850> alternative<00:02:04.009> grenade<00:02:05.009> jumping

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
a little alternative grenade jumping

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.249 
a little alternative grenade jumping
route<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> didn't<00:02:06.479> hit<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.780> very<00:02:06.840> well

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
route here but I didn't hit it very well

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.130 
route here but I didn't hit it very well
so<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.819> did<00:02:09.000> only<00:02:09.149> quit<00:02:09.420> my<00:02:09.509> grenade<00:02:09.810> mod<00:02:09.989> so

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
so and I did only quit my grenade mod so

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.940 
so and I did only quit my grenade mod so
that<00:02:10.259> would<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.500> been<00:02:10.590> good

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that would have been good

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
that would have been good
probably<00:02:11.640> would<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.849> been<00:02:12.030> easier<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.420> walk

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
probably would have been easier to walk

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.059 
probably would have been easier to walk
around<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.590> eventually<00:02:13.980> get<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:16.590> there

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
around but I eventually get it so there

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.510 
around but I eventually get it so there
we<00:02:17.250> go

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
we go

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.400 
we go
now<00:02:18.510> we're<00:02:18.690> going<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.900> go<00:02:19.050> all<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.290> way

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
now we're going to go all the way

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.830 
now we're going to go all the way
through<00:02:19.970> pass<00:02:20.970> all<00:02:21.209> these<00:02:21.360> fully<00:02:21.690> bunks<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
through pass all these fully bunks and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.780 
through pass all these fully bunks and

blight to the volcano should know where

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.420 
blight to the volcano should know where
that<00:02:33.660> area<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:34.410> again<00:02:34.620> if<00:02:34.770> not<00:02:34.950> you'll<00:02:35.310> see

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
you know I wonder what that's about but

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.570 
you know I wonder what that's about but
this<00:03:12.090> Easter<00:03:12.630> Egg<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.959> actually<00:03:13.580> quite

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
this Easter Egg is actually quite

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.340 
this Easter Egg is actually quite
interactive<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.540> rewards<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.109> at<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
interactive and it rewards you at the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.780 
interactive and it rewards you at the
end<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.040> quite<00:03:20.579> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
end of it so it's a you know quite a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.150 
end of it so it's a you know quite a
payoff<00:03:21.500> set<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.799> dust<00:03:23.010> now<00:03:23.190> anyway<00:03:23.609> and

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
payoff set with the dust now anyway and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.770 
payoff set with the dust now anyway and
you<00:03:26.160> know<00:03:26.280> it's<00:03:26.459> not<00:03:26.579> too<00:03:26.820> too<00:03:27.209> badly<00:03:27.450> over

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
you know it's not too too badly over

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.280 
you know it's not too too badly over
couple<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:29.390> maps<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.660> go<00:03:30.780> through<00:03:31.049> but<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
couple of maps to go through but the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.590 
couple of maps to go through but the
dusty<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.700> longest<00:03:33.030> one<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.420> is

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
dusty so this is the longest one this is

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.170 
dusty so this is the longest one this is
the<00:03:33.780> boring<00:03:34.260> one<00:03:34.440> really<00:03:34.859> but<00:03:35.070> we'll<00:03:35.670> soon<00:03:35.970> get

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
the boring one really but we'll soon get

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.810 
the boring one really but we'll soon get
through<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.870> only<00:03:37.079> tip<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.410> can<00:03:37.470> suggest<00:03:38.280> if

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
through it the only tip I can suggest if

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.670 
through it the only tip I can suggest if
you<00:03:38.970> aren't<00:03:39.390> rocket<00:03:39.780> jumping<00:03:40.079> gun<00:03:40.260> zurka<00:03:40.500> as

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
you aren't rocket jumping gun zurka as

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.199 
you aren't rocket jumping gun zurka as
you<00:03:40.769> can<00:03:40.890> see<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.040> just<00:03:41.250> tripped<00:03:41.400> over<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.790> bandit

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
you can see I just tripped over a bandit

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.990 
you can see I just tripped over a bandit
technical<00:03:42.829> these<00:03:43.829> bandit<00:03:44.280> technicals<00:03:44.760> will

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
technical these bandit technicals will

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.849 
technical these bandit technicals will
run<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.359> over

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
run you over

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.710 
run you over
so<00:03:46.859> be<00:03:47.070> seriously<00:03:47.730> careful<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.480> keep

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
so be seriously careful and keep

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.630 
so be seriously careful and keep
checking<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.170> map<00:03:49.410> because<00:03:49.859> they<00:03:50.430> just

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
checking the map because they just

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.280 
checking the map because they just
appear<00:03:50.940> out<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.120> nowhere<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.780> start<00:03:52.049> coming

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
appear out of nowhere and start coming

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.710 
appear out of nowhere and start coming
towards<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.519> make<00:03:53.970> sure<00:03:54.000> you've<00:03:54.329> got<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
towards you so make sure you've got the

we already on blight and route we're
going<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.460> take<00:04:31.700> is<00:04:32.030> just<00:04:32.450> straight<00:04:32.720> on<00:04:32.750> and

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
going to take is just straight on and

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.460 
going to take is just straight on and
then<00:04:33.230> left<00:04:33.560> over<00:04:33.860> this<00:04:33.980> bridge<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:38.540> then<00:04:38.990> just

then left over this bridge and then just
flop<00:04:39.740> down<00:04:39.950> here<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.400> as<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.610> can<00:04:40.670> see<00:04:40.850> is<00:04:40.910> the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
flop down here and as you can see is the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.760 
flop down here and as you can see is the
volcano<00:04:41.450> so<00:04:41.810> we're<00:04:41.930> gonna<00:04:42.020> cost<00:04:42.260> me<00:04:42.470> with<00:04:42.590> this

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
volcano so we're gonna cost me with this
