00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.790
 hello girls today I bring you a first 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:10.580
 impression of a soap thing a little stick 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.180
 exfoliating old house which is this 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.180
 feeling wash 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.750
 and the sleeping mask 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.260
 and this is the reason for the change of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.619
 background and is that right now there is no light 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.570
 day more I have to go to sleep and go 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.490
 to try the mask this morning I will use 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.009
 the rest record the rest of the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.980
 first impression when I got up and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.210
 see if I have done something has not done anything 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.390
 so first let's try the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.220
 peeling puts on the page that is used 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.309
 as a second step already on the skin 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.129
 clean so I'm going to wash my face with 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.620
 the ham decito clark de la resposable 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.330
 my opinion of the soap this is the same 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.920
 that the foam so if you see the clock 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.920
 of the foam but the same this 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.420
 I already have clean skin and now we are going to 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.930
 try the pil wells and miami is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.930
 coming out 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.420
 it's like a translucent gel 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.990
 if you see it well 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.810
 it has scratching granules but they are noticeable 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.810
 very very finite 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.100
 I do not know if you prefer but you can not see 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.659
 practically nothing because the crimes 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.899
 they are hyper mega fine indeed 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.390
 it's as if it looks like it's a 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.660
 little sugar and I in my hand but 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.650
 very very very finite 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.210
 It also does not have a lot of granules 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.990
 so it does not look like it's 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.990
 irritating a lot 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.370
 but if you notice that scratch a little 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.050
 it does not foam it a little more 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.680
 water and still no foam 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.810
 but good 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.810
 if you clean the water foam actually 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.560
 call him massaged well let's clarify 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.080
 Well, the skin feels good to me, so 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.030
 I feel it clean and soft, it's a bit 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.340
 I would say it is a super exfoliating 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.970
 special and it's okay does not irritate much 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.940
 but then it's good what we 're going 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.230
 Well sleeping mask is called 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.380
 although then appear this is a 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.380
 sample 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.739
 It looks like a gel 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.000
 it smells like a clean has nothing super 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.000
 special 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.090
 I've already covered my face 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.300
 mask and now it only remains to go see me 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.100
 and already it points of tomorrow if it has left me 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.540
 some difference in the skin if I notice it 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.959
 softer or something not and I tell you the soap 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.570
 well but neither is nothing super special 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.010
 and have the mask tomorrow I tell you 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.080
 Well, I 've already retired the 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.160
 mask is already day and I have the 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.330
 habitual background and to see how I do not know if 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.290
 appreciate 'aces' 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.930
 apart from the granites and various things 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.269
 the skin is not especially visible 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.060
 resplendent especially nothing yes 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.670
 that hydrates but as it happens to me as the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.050
 from lovely me that moisturizes but is not 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.220
 nothing that he says to his back is the most 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.770
 warm to sleep that leaves your skin 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.190
 such not in my hydrate as a moisturizer 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.170
 for dry skin or normal skin as well 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.270
 that and dredge is hydrated but neither is 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.320
 nothing special once again the 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.780
 sleeping masks have me 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.450
 disappointed I expected something more at least 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.730
 this was just a sample and I'm telling you 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.160
 that not yes that is absorbed well because 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.510
 when I apply it to 5 minutes and 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.680
 friend for the bed and I noticed that I was 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.930
 I had absorbed part and I took a 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.490
 little bit more has a feeling a 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.320
 a little sticky but not too 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.520
 unpleasant but if enough 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.500
 so you can not turn around 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.000
 while good also while you're 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.210
 awake when you are asleep and do not 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.849
 whole of nothing but you have the 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.229
 remains on the pillow 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:14.479
 and good in order to conclude soap 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.330
 true exfoliating is pretty good 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.429
 because yes it exfoliates clean well and the 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.899
 granites are and permeated fine what 

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:23.990
 happens is that it does not have many but good 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:25.759
 it's fine and the sleeping mask 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.490
 Well, I would not buy it again because 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.740
 the same thing happened as the lovely me that 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.240
 it's fine but it does not kill good the only 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.979
 combination that has worked me up 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.459
 Now for masks to sleep is 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.259
 use the luxe oil with the lovely 

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.419
 mine above and then yes I got up 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.089
 with much more juicy skin and a lot 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.159
 best is no longer immune to it 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:48.439
 but sleeping masks 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.300
 they simply are not enough is 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:54.080
 they are too short and do not make me great 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:57.709
 thing so for me the water was the 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.600
 The full house voice is not a big deal either 

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:02.090
 and I would not buy it 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.250
 the scrub to see yes I said that 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.920
 is fine and that the favorites are very 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.900
 fine and therefore does not irritate but has 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.700
 there were others that impressed me more 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.470
 that is, in principle in principle 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.030
 none of these two moix products 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.610
 football to enter my list to buy 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.610
 and up to here these first impressions
