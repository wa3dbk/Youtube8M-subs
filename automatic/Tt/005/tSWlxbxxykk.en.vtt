that instead you're like well that was a

that instead you're like well that was a

time and what makes it a waste of
everyone's<00:04:13.200> time<00:04:13.519> isn't<00:04:14.519> just<00:04:14.730> the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
everyone's time isn't just the

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
offensiveness of the casting but that

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.520 
offensiveness of the casting but that
and<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.750> think<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:19.080> an<00:04:19.169> even<00:04:19.380> more

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
and this I think is an even more

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.920 
and this I think is an even more
egregious<00:04:19.859> offense<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.760> that's<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.660> this

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
egregious offense and that's that this

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.630 
egregious offense and that's that this
doesn't<00:04:22.350> accurately<00:04:22.830> tell<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.160> story<00:04:23.430> of

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.090 
doesn't accurately tell the story of
Moses<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.419> mean<00:04:24.960> not<00:04:25.350> only<00:04:25.380> should<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.919> watch

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
Egypt because it's a better movie but

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.400 
Egypt because it's a better movie but

what's going on in this movie now I

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.780 
what's going on in this movie now I
think<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.800> really<00:04:35.070> scholar<00:04:35.400> would<00:04:35.460> argue

we'll come on everybody knows the story
of<00:04:37.500> Exodus<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.979> my<00:04:38.280> goal<00:04:38.520> here<00:04:38.790> was<00:04:39.240> to<00:04:39.300> retell

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
of Exodus and my goal here was to retell

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.469 
of Exodus and my goal here was to retell
that<00:04:39.900> story<00:04:40.140> by<00:04:40.979> dialing<00:04:41.640> down<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.030> religious

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
that story by dialing down the religious

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.690 
that story by dialing down the religious
aspects<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.260> dialing<00:04:44.040> up<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.310> special

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
aspects and dialing up the special

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.969 
aspects and dialing up the special
effects<00:04:45.270> but<00:04:46.020> then<00:04:46.140> I<00:04:46.229> would<00:04:46.410> counter<00:04:46.830> by

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
effects but then I would counter by

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.100 
effects but then I would counter by
saying<00:04:47.190> hey<00:04:47.460> Ridley<00:04:47.640> when<00:04:48.450> I<00:04:48.479> went<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.900> see

this<00:04:49.260> movie<00:04:49.620> there<00:04:50.010> was<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.190> surprising<00:04:50.880> number

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
this movie there was a surprising number

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.850 
this movie there was a surprising number
of<00:04:51.180> children<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.080> audience<00:04:52.229> because

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
of children in the audience because

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.860 
of children in the audience because
clearly<00:04:53.220> their<00:04:53.850> parents<00:04:54.270> decided<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:54.690> this

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
clearly their parents decided that this

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.270 
clearly their parents decided that this
was<00:04:55.020> an<00:04:55.140> important<00:04:55.560> story<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:55.860> they<00:04:56.100> needed

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
was an important story that they needed

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.520 
was an important story that they needed
to<00:04:56.520> learn<00:04:56.729> but<00:04:57.450> I<00:04:57.479> think<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:57.960> any<00:04:58.200> kid

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
to learn but I think that any kid

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.620 
to learn but I think that any kid
walking<00:04:59.340> out<00:04:59.430> of<00:04:59.460> Exodus<00:04:59.940> gods<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.419> Kings

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
walking out of Exodus gods and Kings

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.030 
walking out of Exodus gods and Kings
would<00:05:00.810> be<00:05:00.930> hard<00:05:01.140> pressed<00:05:01.200> to<00:05:01.500> tell<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.860> with

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
would be hard pressed to tell you with

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.850 
would be hard pressed to tell you with
confidence<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:03.300> story<00:05:03.630> of<00:05:03.960> Moses<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.620> that's

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
confidence the story of Moses and that's

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.730 
confidence the story of Moses and that's
that's<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.400> real<00:05:05.700> shame<00:05:06.419> now<00:05:07.260> as<00:05:07.500> far<00:05:07.680> as

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
that's a real shame now as far as

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.610 
that's a real shame now as far as
playing<00:05:08.220> with<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.610> idea

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
playing with the idea

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.290 
playing with the idea
Moses<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.280> his<00:05:10.370> relationship<00:05:10.970> with<00:05:11.090> God

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
Moses and his relationship with God

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.270 
Moses and his relationship with God
there<00:05:11.990> were<00:05:12.110> some<00:05:12.320> interesting<00:05:12.440> ideas<00:05:12.830> put

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
there were some interesting ideas put

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.710 
there were some interesting ideas put
forward<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:13.790> didn't<00:05:14.060> think<00:05:14.150> it<00:05:14.300> was<00:05:14.419> somewhat

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
forward I didn't think it was somewhat

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.530 
forward I didn't think it was somewhat
compelling<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.710> have<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.760> idea<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:17.090> Moses

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
compelling to have the idea that Moses

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.330 
compelling to have the idea that Moses
was<00:05:17.690> a<00:05:17.750> schizophrenic<00:05:18.410> and<00:05:18.710> this<00:05:19.010> was<00:05:19.160> all<00:05:19.310> in

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
was a schizophrenic and this was all in

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.490 
was a schizophrenic and this was all in
his<00:05:19.550> head<00:05:19.760> but<00:05:20.180> he<00:05:20.270> still<00:05:20.480> did<00:05:20.660> great<00:05:20.870> things<00:05:21.139> I

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
his head but he still did great things I

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.560 
his head but he still did great things I
thought<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.250> was<00:05:22.370> interesting<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:22.880> show<00:05:23.150> that

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
thought it was interesting to show that

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.060 
thought it was interesting to show that
maybe<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.900> Red<00:05:24.050> Sea<00:05:24.230> was<00:05:24.350> parted<00:05:24.740> by<00:05:24.830> an

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
maybe the Red Sea was parted by an

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.830 
maybe the Red Sea was parted by an
earthquake<00:05:25.250> somewhere<00:05:25.850> else<00:05:26.000> which<00:05:26.570> caused

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
earthquake somewhere else which caused

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.080 
earthquake somewhere else which caused
the<00:05:27.080> tsunami<00:05:27.230> as<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:28.070> know<00:05:28.250> as<00:05:28.460> we<00:05:28.790> know<00:05:28.910> from

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
the tsunami as you know as we know from

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.210 
the tsunami as you know as we know from
the<00:05:29.300> tragic<00:05:30.080> tsunami<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.530> couple<00:05:30.800> of<00:05:30.860> years<00:05:31.070> ago

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
the tragic tsunami a couple of years ago

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.610 
the tragic tsunami a couple of years ago
at<00:05:31.669> first<00:05:31.940> all<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.389> water<00:05:32.600> is<00:05:32.780> pulled<00:05:33.050> back<00:05:33.320> so

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
at first all the water is pulled back so

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.050 
at first all the water is pulled back so
that<00:05:33.800> would<00:05:33.980> you<00:05:34.370> know<00:05:34.490> make<00:05:34.639> it<00:05:34.669> look<00:05:34.790> like

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
that would you know make it look like

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.730 
that would you know make it look like
the<00:05:35.150> Red<00:05:35.300> Sea<00:05:35.330> had<00:05:35.660> been<00:05:35.810> parted<00:05:36.230> that's<00:05:36.620> a

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
the Red Sea had been parted that's a

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.680 
the Red Sea had been parted that's a
very<00:05:36.980> interesting<00:05:37.310> idea<00:05:37.580> especially<00:05:37.970> since

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
very interesting idea especially since

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.940 
very interesting idea especially since
what<00:05:38.870> we<00:05:38.960> know<00:05:39.080> about<00:05:39.230> the<00:05:39.500> fact<00:05:39.710> there<00:05:39.830> was<00:05:39.919> a

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
what we know about the fact there was a

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.740 
what we know about the fact there was a
big<00:05:40.160> flood<00:05:40.400> back<00:05:40.700> in<00:05:40.880> biblical<00:05:41.360> times

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
big flood back in biblical times

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.110 
big flood back in biblical times
so<00:05:42.050> while<00:05:42.530> Noah<00:05:42.950> and<00:05:43.370> everybody<00:05:43.700> would<00:05:43.910> think

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
so while Noah and everybody would think

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.520 
so while Noah and everybody would think
that<00:05:44.150> was<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.479> whole<00:05:44.630> world<00:05:44.660> being<00:05:45.139> flooded

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
that was the whole world being flooded

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.469 
that was the whole world being flooded
it<00:05:45.620> was<00:05:45.740> just<00:05:46.010> you<00:05:46.430> know<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.550> Hurricane<00:05:47.030> Katrina

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
it was just you know a Hurricane Katrina

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.200 
it was just you know a Hurricane Katrina
like<00:05:47.720> situation<00:05:48.440> back<00:05:49.160> when<00:05:49.550> nobody<00:05:49.790> really

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
like situation back when nobody really

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.330 
like situation back when nobody really
knew<00:05:50.330> how<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.540> world<00:05:50.780> worked<00:05:51.190> but<00:05:52.190> those

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
knew how the world worked but those

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.730 
knew how the world worked but those
ideas<00:05:52.580> are<00:05:53.000> put<00:05:53.510> forward<00:05:53.720> very<00:05:54.020> subtly<00:05:54.590> and

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
ideas are put forward very subtly and

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.530 
ideas are put forward very subtly and
not<00:05:54.950> particularly<00:05:55.520> in<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.910> compelling<00:05:56.270> manner

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
not particularly in a compelling manner

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.560 
not particularly in a compelling manner
for<00:05:56.900> instance<00:05:57.200> the<00:05:57.620> God<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.210> Moses<00:05:59.210> his<00:05:59.330> head

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
for instance the God and Moses his head

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.900 
for instance the God and Moses his head
is<00:05:59.780> a<00:05:59.840> little<00:06:00.350> kid<00:06:00.620> who<00:06:01.040> at<00:06:01.160> first<00:06:01.190> was<00:06:01.610> kind<00:06:01.850> of

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
is a little kid who at first was kind of

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.820 
is a little kid who at first was kind of
cool<00:06:02.180> but<00:06:02.630> then<00:06:02.750> after<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.080> while<00:06:03.290> I<00:06:03.350> was<00:06:03.650> like

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
cool but then after a while I was like

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.760 
cool but then after a while I was like
can<00:06:04.250> God<00:06:04.520> not<00:06:04.550> say<00:06:05.000> his<00:06:05.180> arse<00:06:05.540> that's<00:06:06.290> a<00:06:06.470> very

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
can God not say his arse that's a very

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.760 
can God not say his arse that's a very
weird<00:06:07.040> choice<00:06:07.460> a<00:06:07.910> lot<00:06:08.510> of<00:06:08.600> weird<00:06:08.840> choices<00:06:09.110> were

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
weird choice a lot of weird choices were

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.490 
weird choice a lot of weird choices were
made<00:06:10.010> in<00:06:10.160> this<00:06:10.280> film<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:11.240> I<00:06:11.330> think<00:06:11.600> that<00:06:11.780> Noah

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
made in this film and I think that Noah

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.950 
made in this film and I think that Noah
was<00:06:12.950> a<00:06:13.280> much<00:06:13.640> more<00:06:13.850> successful<00:06:14.120> film<00:06:14.630> Darren

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
was a much more successful film Darren

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.200 
was a much more successful film Darren
Aronofsky's<00:06:15.229> Noah<00:06:15.740> and<00:06:16.039> trying<00:06:16.640> to<00:06:16.820> evolve

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
Aronofsky's Noah and trying to evolve

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.650 
Aronofsky's Noah and trying to evolve
biblical<00:06:18.050> stories<00:06:18.500> to<00:06:19.070> to<00:06:20.060> be<00:06:20.210> something<00:06:20.539> that

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
biblical stories to to be something that

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.450 
biblical stories to to be something that
a<00:06:20.690> modern<00:06:21.020> audience<00:06:21.200> is<00:06:21.560> interested<00:06:22.070> in<00:06:22.220> and

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
a modern audience is interested in and

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.300 
a modern audience is interested in and
can<00:06:22.970> take<00:06:23.150> a<00:06:23.360> message<00:06:23.539> away<00:06:23.900> from<00:06:24.070> when<00:06:25.070> today

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
can take a message away from when today

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.950 
can take a message away from when today
we<00:06:25.460> know<00:06:25.610> so<00:06:25.850> much<00:06:25.970> more<00:06:26.030> about<00:06:26.479> how<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:26.690> world

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
we know so much more about how the world

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.740 
we know so much more about how the world
works<00:06:27.250> in<00:06:28.250> terms<00:06:28.460> of<00:06:28.669> not<00:06:28.910> only<00:06:28.940> human

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
works in terms of not only human

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.680 
works in terms of not only human
interaction<00:06:30.410> and<00:06:30.620> politics<00:06:31.370> but<00:06:32.210> also<00:06:32.390> just

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
interaction and politics but also just

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.080 
interaction and politics but also just
science<00:06:33.289> and<00:06:33.530> the<00:06:33.770> environment<00:06:34.340> then<00:06:34.940> our

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
science and the environment then our

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.450 
science and the environment then our
counterparts<00:06:35.930> back<00:06:36.200> during<00:06:36.470> biblical<00:06:37.190> times

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
counterparts back during biblical times

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.760 
counterparts back during biblical times
so<00:06:38.389> this<00:06:38.510> movie<00:06:38.750> I<00:06:38.840> just<00:06:39.080> think<00:06:39.289> fails<00:06:39.500> at

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
so this movie I just think fails at

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.379 
so this movie I just think fails at
every<00:06:40.190> single<00:06:40.400> level<00:06:40.669> and<00:06:41.000> it's<00:06:41.120> so

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
every single level and it's so

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.860 
every single level and it's so
frustrating<00:06:41.990> to<00:06:42.979> see<00:06:43.190> so<00:06:43.520> much<00:06:43.729> money<00:06:44.060> just<00:06:44.360> an

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
frustrating to see so much money just an

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.110 
frustrating to see so much money just an
absolutely<00:06:45.410> huge<00:06:45.710> budget<00:06:46.520> was<00:06:46.669> spent<00:06:46.760> on<00:06:47.030> this

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
absolutely huge budget was spent on this

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.510 
absolutely huge budget was spent on this
and<00:06:47.330> some<00:06:47.479> of<00:06:47.600> the<00:06:47.720> sets<00:06:48.650> and<00:06:48.979> the<00:06:49.160> digital

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520

and some of the sets and the digital
sets<00:06:49.789> of<00:06:50.000> course<00:06:50.210> are<00:06:50.630> really<00:06:50.990> really

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
sets of course are really really

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.500

the<00:07:03.590> story<00:07:03.860> of<00:07:03.979> Moses<00:07:04.370> wasted<00:07:05.060> it's<00:07:05.810> just<00:07:06.139> so

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.289 
the story of Moses wasted it's just so

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:08.350

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 
frustrating and the whole thing it

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.060 
frustrating and the whole thing it
should<00:07:08.750> just<00:07:08.900> be<00:07:09.020> washed<00:07:09.350> away<00:07:09.590> with<00:07:09.919> that

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
should just be washed away with that

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.580 
should just be washed away with that
