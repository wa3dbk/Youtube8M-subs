that they taped
of<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> box<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.900> somebody<00:02:13.650> must<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.299> thought

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
of the box so somebody must have thought

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.039

there was a Hot Wheels inside because

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:26.270 
there was a Hot Wheels inside because
unfortunately<00:02:22.069> at<00:02:23.069> this<00:02:23.430> big<00:02:23.700> C<00:02:23.940> store<00:02:25.280> people

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
unfortunately at this big C store people

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.420 
unfortunately at this big C store people
tend<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.560> steal<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.769> basic<00:02:29.220> Hot

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
Wheels which I think it's kind of

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.280 
Wheels which I think it's kind of
ridiculous<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.209> met<00:02:33.629> though<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.170> a

ridiculous but I do met though it's a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.380 
ridiculous but I do met though it's a
