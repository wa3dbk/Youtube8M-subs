alright<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.859> installed<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.970> binaries

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
alright we have installed the binaries

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.269 
alright we have installed the binaries
on<00:00:21.779> our<00:00:21.990> system<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:22.769> pops<00:00:23.009> up<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
on our system and it just pops up the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.490 
on our system and it just pops up the
dialog<00:00:23.759> box<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.269> says<00:00:24.509> welcome<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.349> the

dialog box and says welcome to the
installation<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.640> an<00:00:26.730> advanced<00:00:27.090> mode

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
installation we can do an advanced mode

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.839 
installation we can do an advanced mode
installation<00:00:28.109> Advanced<00:00:28.859> Mode<00:00:29.099> installation

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.749 
installation Advanced Mode installation
let's<00:00:30.239> me<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.980> when<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.519> when<00:00:32.730> you

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
let's me go in and when you when you

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.670 
let's me go in and when you when you
create<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.090> domain<00:00:33.420> controller<00:00:33.470> especially<00:00:34.470> if

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
create a domain controller especially if

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.710 
create a domain controller especially if
this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.220> second<00:00:35.699> domain<00:00:35.850> controller<00:00:36.480> or

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
this is the second domain controller or

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.990 
this is the second domain controller or
the<00:00:36.839> fifth<00:00:37.110> domain<00:00:37.500> controller<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.489> has<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the fifth domain controller it has to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.369 
the fifth domain controller it has to
replicate<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> other<00:00:40.050> domain

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
replicate with the other domain

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.549 
replicate with the other domain
controllers<00:00:40.949> and<00:00:41.480> across<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> slow<00:00:42.960> add<00:00:43.199> link

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
controllers and across a slow add link

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.219 
controllers and across a slow add link
that<00:00:44.129> could<00:00:44.339> be<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> lot<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> lot<00:00:45.449> a<00:00:45.510> lot<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:46.019> data

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
that could be a lot a lot a lot of data

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.009 
that could be a lot a lot a lot of data
so<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.309> an<00:00:47.430> advanced<00:00:47.760> mode<00:00:48.000> installation<00:00:48.809> I

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
so with an advanced mode installation I

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.039 
so with an advanced mode installation I
could<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.189> initial<00:00:50.699> replication<00:00:51.479> off<00:00:51.720> of

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
could do the initial replication off of

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.649 
could do the initial replication off of
a<00:00:52.140> backup<00:00:52.799> of<00:00:53.070> another<00:00:53.760> domain<00:00:54.180> controller

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
a backup of another domain controller

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.840 
a backup of another domain controller
but<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.530> we're<00:00:55.739> making<00:00:55.979> is<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.339> brand<00:00:56.699> new

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
but what we're making is a brand new

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.939 
but what we're making is a brand new
domain<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.479> brand<00:00:57.720> new<00:00:57.839> forest<00:00:58.409> so<00:00:58.739> we

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
domain and a brand new forest so we

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.560 
domain and a brand new forest so we
don't<00:00:59.040> have<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.580> any<00:00:59.759> replication<00:01:00.449> we're

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
don't have to do any replication we're

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.579 
don't have to do any replication we're
just<00:01:00.720> going<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:00.869> go<00:01:00.989> ahead<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.259> keep<00:01:01.379> it

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
just going to go ahead and keep it

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.799 
just going to go ahead and keep it
simple<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.100> I'll<00:01:02.189> say<00:01:02.369> next<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.540> says<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
simple so I'll say next and it says I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.140 
simple so I'll say next and it says I
remember<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.979> domain<00:01:05.339> controllers<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.000> have

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
remember your domain controllers we have

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.210 
remember your domain controllers we have
a<00:01:06.180> lot<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> new<00:01:06.600> features<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.259> with<00:01:07.409> nt4<00:01:07.740> it's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
a lot of new features and with nt4 it's

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.130 
a lot of new features and with nt4 it's
not<00:01:08.400> supported<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.450> don't<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> right

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
not supported we don't have the right

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.090 
not supported we don't have the right
cryptography<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.400> can't<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.000> NT<00:01:12.360> 4<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
cryptography so you can't do NT 4 as a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
cryptography so you can't do NT 4 as a
domain<00:01:14.100> controller<00:01:14.159> which<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.970> fine<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.930> I'll

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
domain controller which is fine so I'll

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620 
domain controller which is fine so I'll
say<00:01:16.200> next<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.299> create<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
say next and we are going to create a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.330 
say next and we are going to create a
brand<00:01:18.960> new<00:01:19.110> domain<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> brand<00:01:19.950> new<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.310> us

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
brand new domain and a brand new for us

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.370 
brand new domain and a brand new for us
now<00:01:20.579> if<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.880> was<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> an<00:01:21.329> existing<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:22.109> us<00:01:22.200> we

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
now if it was in an existing for us we

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.840 
now if it was in an existing for us we
could<00:01:22.499> say<00:01:22.649> add<00:01:22.829> a<00:01:22.859> domain<00:01:23.039> controller<00:01:23.219> to<00:01:23.759> an

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
could say add a domain controller to an

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
could say add a domain controller to an
existing<00:01:24.060> domain<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.840> we're<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.679> create

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
existing domain or we're going to create

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.910 
existing domain or we're going to create
a<00:01:26.130> brand<00:01:26.490> new<00:01:26.729> domain<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.960> could<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.259> but

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
a brand new domain we could do that but

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.380 
a brand new domain we could do that but
we're<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> say<00:01:29.670> create<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.969> new

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
we're just going to say create a new

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.499 
we're just going to say create a new
domain<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:30.990> new<00:01:31.109> forest<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.210> we<00:01:33.210> want<00:01:33.450> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
domain in a new forest and we want to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.149 
domain in a new forest and we want to
call<00:01:33.719> it<00:01:33.749> we're<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> call<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
call it we're going to call this one to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
call it we're going to call this one to

that name i have no idea what it is on
the<00:01:41.850> internet<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:43.159> travel<00:01:44.159> at<00:01:44.249> your<00:01:44.280> own<00:01:44.429> risk

the internet so travel at your own risk

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.539 
the internet so travel at your own risk
so<00:01:45.149> I'll<00:01:45.240> say<00:01:45.389> next<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.829> goes<00:01:47.039> through<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so I'll say next and it goes through and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.489 
so I'll say next and it goes through and
it<00:01:47.670> does<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> DNS<00:01:48.509> check<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.049> see<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.259> that

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
it does a DNS check to see if that

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.010 
it does a DNS check to see if that
forest<00:01:49.889> name<00:01:50.069> is<00:01:50.249> already<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.609> use<00:01:50.819> now<00:01:51.119> what

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
forest name is already in use now what

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
forest name is already in use now what
it's<00:01:52.139> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.469> do<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.310> going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.850> go

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
it's going to do is it's going to go

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
it's going to do is it's going to go
ahead<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.450> look<00:01:54.569> at<00:01:54.749> its<00:01:54.869> dns<00:01:55.319> it's<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.130> to

ahead and look at its dns it's going to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
ahead and look at its dns it's going to

later I'll show you how we can

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.200 
later I'll show you how we can

bump up the domain of forest functional

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.390 
bump up the domain of forest functional
level<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.690> I'll<00:02:33.780> say<00:02:33.960> next<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:35.220> also

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
level so I'll say next and it's also

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.460 
level so I'll say next and it's also
asking<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.150> domain<00:02:36.510> functional<00:02:37.080> level<00:02:37.350> and

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
asking the domain functional level and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.820 
asking the domain functional level and
again<00:02:37.710> we<00:02:37.830> have<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> same<00:02:38.370> options<00:02:39.830> 2003-2008

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
again we have the same options 2003-2008

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.520 
again we have the same options 2003-2008
and<00:02:41.010> 2008r2<00:02:41.690> notice<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:42.960> don't<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.500> a

domain functional level of 2000 we can

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.170 
domain functional level of 2000 we can

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
have a forest functional level of 2,000

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.270 
have a forest functional level of 2,000
but<00:02:48.300> not<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.630> domain<00:02:48.990> what's<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.160> difference

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
but not the domain what's the difference

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.000 
but not the domain what's the difference
well<00:02:51.150> in<00:02:51.420> your<00:02:51.660> forest<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.800> have<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
well in your forest you can have a

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.950 
well in your forest you can have a

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
variety of domain functional levels you

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.810 
variety of domain functional levels you
can<00:02:54.990> have<00:02:55.200> 2,000<00:02:56.300> 2003-2008<00:02:57.300> 2008<00:02:57.930> r2<00:02:57.960> and

can have 2,000 2003-2008 2008 r2 and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.090 
can have 2,000 2003-2008 2008 r2 and
it's<00:02:59.820> all<00:03:00.000> fine<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.270> dandy<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.990> in<00:03:01.800> order<00:03:02.040> to

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
it's all fine and dandy but in order to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.070 
it's all fine and dandy but in order to
elevate<00:03:02.340> your<00:03:02.850> forest<00:03:03.270> functional<00:03:03.540> level<00:03:03.780> of

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
elevate your forest functional level of

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.370 
elevate your forest functional level of
2008<00:03:04.740> r2<00:03:04.770> all<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:06.210> your<00:03:06.330> domain<00:03:06.540> functional

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
2008 r2 all of your domain functional

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.880 
2008 r2 all of your domain functional
levels<00:03:07.740> have<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.400> at<00:03:08.550> 2008<00:03:09.240> r2<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:10.170> again<00:03:10.710> we

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
levels have to be at 2008 r2 so again we

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.350 
levels have to be at 2008 r2 so again we
will<00:03:11.070> go<00:03:11.190> ahead<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.550> show<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.760> how<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.120> can

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
will go ahead and show you how we can

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.820 
will go ahead and show you how we can
elevate<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.930> little<00:03:13.200> bit<00:03:13.260> later<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.680> we're

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
elevate that a little bit later so we're

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.400 
elevate that a little bit later so we're
just<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.130> keep<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.430> at<00:03:14.520> 2003<00:03:15.360> let<00:03:16.200> me<00:03:16.260> get

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
just going to keep it at 2003 let me get

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.770 
just going to keep it at 2003 let me get
to<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.620> right<00:03:16.710> machine<00:03:16.920> here<00:03:17.340> I'll<00:03:18.210> say<00:03:18.510> next

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
to the right machine here I'll say next

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.350 
to the right machine here I'll say next
and<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.800> goes<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.310> looks<00:03:20.430> at<00:03:20.550> DNS<00:03:20.940> we<00:03:21.180> don't

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
and it goes in and looks at DNS we don't

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.210 
and it goes in and looks at DNS we don't
have<00:03:21.540> dns<00:03:21.990> so<00:03:22.260> now<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.500> gives<00:03:22.680> us<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.040> option

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
have dns so now it gives us the option

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.650 
have dns so now it gives us the option
to<00:03:23.670> install<00:03:24.420> dns<00:03:25.110> now<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> also<00:03:25.950> says<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:27.510> can

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
to install dns now it also says you can

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.200 
to install dns now it also says you can
make<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.990> global<00:03:28.320> catalog<00:03:28.590> server<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.250> that

make this global catalog server and that

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.940 
make this global catalog server and that
