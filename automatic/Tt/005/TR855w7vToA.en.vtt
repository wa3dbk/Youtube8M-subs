 that a lot of people asked me to continue 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.740

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 miami 7 ia when you start to 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.850
 signaling locally that for some time 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.550
 disappeared from his law, that is who he was 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.440
 out there x 1 he's honest with you 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.260

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.260
 from the path the path of a leg of a 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:04.439
 way and I do not even know who it was but anyway 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.850
 bush or expense of the state of ours I spoke in 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.570
 which is the apology 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.360
 bush is when you get a big 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.950
 amount than or in a period of time 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.830
 and cuca 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.140
 who watch the league flash league 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.990
 is accustomed to hearing what they swim at 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.659
 hard and ahead of the Brazilian who speaks 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.869
 so totally the state already on the shirt 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.650
 yesterday's shift the 10 o'clock lady 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.990
 melon totally imported btt face that 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.939
 and what happened here falls from a motor 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.040
 now from the boat by a bass of that has to 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.320
 to invent a new guy stick because it was 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.210
 more than 8 must have caused the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.470
 taiff is when you get in the middle 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 where it is when you realize a lot of damage 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.180
 tower to attack the three time male team 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.180
 losing means a backdoor is when 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.290
 You start attacking the team tower. 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.410
 and language're not care to have any 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.130
 help, I have you up and down 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.250
 beating why not be very strong you 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.360
 It is the boss and you can you can 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.120
 have to take it 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.120
 the geologist I do not know what kind of things 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.480
 so when you hit, hit, hit, hit 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.400
 Tui in the tower actor does not think third 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.950
 in the tower 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.320
 Even if you do not love me, your team. 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.320
 attack buttons to protect the day followed 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.099
 Where did you tell this, I said everything wrong? 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.130
 but anyway you 're having 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.950
 are movements that you do that are fetus 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.440
 action of other players for example 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.720
 They play very morgan and when he was 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.220
 how much internet even arrived from 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.540
 college in GoiÃ¢nia and I had more 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.300
 win as champion 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.390
 so I got 80 just playing it 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.450
 type people can laugh at 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.680
 front and try to learn from it more 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.530
 Old Mochican keeps me very much then 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.989
 that she morgana it in another 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.830
 player or you play an acorn neh 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.739
 nah nah another enemy there is what she does 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.459
 it simply paralyzes the other 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.700
 player 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:41.739
 new left there can not move it 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:45.040
 so I love it love love bent 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.880
 try when you are in a position that 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.019
 apparent in you will be favorable the other 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:58.140
 tim team ka meter opens up like the 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:02.069
 How it works now have distanced themselves 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.069
 there sr 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:11.319
 Then someone from the other team sees you. 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.870
 bandit truck single song and kam 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.049
 san and suddenly someone starts to 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.320
 get run off for a certain with me 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.919
 thus unintentionally the relative to the cube and 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.289
 suddenly the team all your team 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.070
 Why did you do a trip? 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:33.490
 or tooth when you do something 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.689
 option is to do here or sell pado 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.129
 return 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:42.369

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:46.379

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:48.969
 the steel ie when you take the life 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.159
 had kind runs practically the life 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.379
 the other champion comes 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:57.369
 only then the shift 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:58.079
 that is, it gives the last beat in a 

00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:05.249
 mall 

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:08.249
 that's when you hear steal steel 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.249
 Continue 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:26.709
 nobody is nobody when you get it 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:31.239

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:35.919
