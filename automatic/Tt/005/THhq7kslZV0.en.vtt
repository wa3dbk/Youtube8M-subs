the<00:01:27.130> Rhino<00:01:27.370> which<00:01:27.910> I'm<00:01:28.060> guessing<00:01:28.300> is<00:01:28.570> if<00:01:28.810> you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
the Rhino which I'm guessing is if you

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.270 
the Rhino which I'm guessing is if you
look<00:01:29.110> at<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.260> picture<00:01:29.590> one<00:01:29.890> of<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.070> players

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
look at the picture one of the players

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.190 
look at the picture one of the players
he<00:01:30.670> has<00:01:30.910> this<00:01:31.150> kind<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.450> like<00:01:31.510> gravity<00:01:32.020> hammer

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
he has this kind of like gravity hammer

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.290 
he has this kind of like gravity hammer
style<00:01:32.530> weapon<00:01:32.890> that<00:01:33.160> you<00:01:33.310> saw<00:01:33.490> in<00:01:33.760> like<00:01:33.910> Halo

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
style weapon that you saw in like Halo

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.970 
style weapon that you saw in like Halo
and<00:01:34.540> those<00:01:34.780> kind<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.080> games<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.530> looks<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:35.950> be

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
and those kind of games it looks to be

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.740 
and those kind of games it looks to be
kind<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.400> this<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.880> same<00:01:37.120> way<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.450> how<00:01:37.570> it's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
kind of this the same way of how it's

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.570 
kind of this the same way of how it's
played<00:01:37.990> though<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.620> seems<00:01:38.920> like<00:01:39.040> it's<00:01:39.280> giving

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
played though it seems like it's giving

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.790 
played though it seems like it's giving
off<00:01:39.640> like<00:01:39.910> this<00:01:40.060> kind<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.390> like<00:01:40.540> EMP<00:01:41.260> wave<00:01:41.470> and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
off like this kind of like EMP wave and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.960 
off like this kind of like EMP wave and
it's<00:01:41.890> just<00:01:42.010> like<00:01:42.160> knocking<00:01:42.370> people<00:01:42.820> back

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
it's just like knocking people back

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.180 
it's just like knocking people back
probably<00:01:43.360> disabling<00:01:43.990> suits<00:01:44.320> though<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:45.010> looks

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
probably disabling suits though it looks

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.260 
probably disabling suits though it looks
like<00:01:45.280> something<00:01:45.610> you're<00:01:45.730> going<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.970> be<00:01:46.060> able

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
like something you're going to be able

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.820 
like something you're going to be able
to<00:01:46.450> use<00:01:46.660> against<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.170> people<00:01:47.440> running<00:01:47.650> around

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
to use against the people running around

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.410 
to use against the people running around
with<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.070> pole<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.730> I'm<00:01:49.000> kind<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.210> glad<00:01:49.300> that

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
with a pole so I'm kind of glad that

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.060 
with a pole so I'm kind of glad that
they're<00:01:49.690> implementing<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:50.290> though<00:01:50.590> still

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
they're implementing this though still

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.470 
they're implementing this though still
that<00:01:51.280> might<00:01:51.460> not<00:01:51.610> be<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.850> Rhino<00:01:52.030> since<00:01:52.390> we

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
that might not be the Rhino since we

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.600 
that might not be the Rhino since we
don't<00:01:52.600> have<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.840> actual<00:01:53.470> confirmed<00:01:54.010> look<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.460> it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
don't have a actual confirmed look of it

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.190 
don't have a actual confirmed look of it
and<00:01:54.730> there<00:01:55.030> are<00:01:55.060> two<00:01:55.450> new<00:01:55.600> game<00:01:55.840> modes<00:01:56.020> called

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
and there are two new game modes called

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.350 
and there are two new game modes called
position<00:01:56.650> and<00:01:56.800> frenzy<00:01:57.280> we<00:01:57.550> still<00:01:58.150> don't

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
position and frenzy we still don't

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.790 
position and frenzy we still don't
really<00:01:58.420> have<00:01:58.690> any<00:01:58.810> details<00:01:59.230> about<00:01:59.320> that<00:01:59.650> we

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
really have any details about that we

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.020 
really have any details about that we
just<00:01:59.980> know<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.340> those<00:02:00.580> are<00:02:00.760> going<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.940> be

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
just know that those are going to be

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.450 
just know that those are going to be
officially<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:02.200> actual<00:02:02.950> multiplayer

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
officially in that actual multiplayer

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.370 
officially in that actual multiplayer
hopefully<00:02:03.910> this<00:02:04.120> will<00:02:04.330> bring<00:02:04.660> back<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:04.990> lot<00:02:05.290> of

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
hopefully this will bring back a lot of

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.110 
hopefully this will bring back a lot of
the<00:02:05.500> actual<00:02:06.040> players<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.610> kind<00:02:06.730> of<00:02:06.820> just

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
the actual players that kind of just

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.179 
the actual players that kind of just
left<00:02:07.300> crisis<00:02:07.780> after<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.170> first<00:02:08.379> first<00:02:08.950> month

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.189 
left crisis after the first first month

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.039 
left crisis after the first first month
because<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.640> kind<00:02:09.849> of<00:02:09.879> got<00:02:10.179> really<00:02:10.479> repetitive

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
because it kind of got really repetitive

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.690 
because it kind of got really repetitive
this<00:02:11.260> would<00:02:11.409> probably<00:02:11.499> change<00:02:11.799> things<00:02:12.129> up<00:02:12.340> so

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
this would probably change things up so

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.010 
this would probably change things up so
the<00:02:12.849> price<00:02:13.150> for<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.510> actual

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
the price for the actual

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.660 
the price for the actual
has<00:02:14.500> been<00:02:14.740> confirmed<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.310> going<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.550> be

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
has been confirmed it's going to be

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.170 
has been confirmed it's going to be
$14.99<00:02:16.450> or<00:02:16.660> $15<00:02:17.470> USD<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:18.460> do<00:02:18.730> not<00:02:18.910> know<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
$14.99 or $15 USD I do not know the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.660 
$14.99 or $15 USD I do not know the
conversion<00:02:19.630> factors<00:02:19.990> on<00:02:20.260> xbox360<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.520> it

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
conversion factors on xbox360 is it it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.670 
conversion factors on xbox360 is it it
is<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.210> be<00:02:22.300> 1200<00:02:22.780> Microsoft<00:02:23.200> Points<00:02:23.350> so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
is going to be 1200 Microsoft Points so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.470 
is going to be 1200 Microsoft Points so
that<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:24.010> still<00:02:24.310> us<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.940> do<00:02:25.000> not<00:02:25.180> know<00:02:25.360> the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
that is still us I do not know the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.180 
that is still us I do not know the
actual<00:02:25.750> conversion<00:02:25.930> factors<00:02:26.590> now<00:02:26.860> there<00:02:27.040> are

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
actual conversion factors now there are

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.920 
actual conversion factors now there are
some<00:02:27.460> pictures<00:02:27.610> actually<00:02:27.910> showing<00:02:28.300> off<00:02:28.600> the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
some pictures actually showing off the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.800 
some pictures actually showing off the
actual<00:02:29.410> map<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.280> first<00:02:30.550> one<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.970> crossing<00:02:31.390> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
actual map the first one is crossing and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.690 
actual map the first one is crossing and
from<00:02:32.110> what<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.380> can<00:02:32.530> see<00:02:32.560> right<00:02:32.920> there<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.430> is

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
from what you can see right there it is

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.390 
from what you can see right there it is
just<00:02:34.270> literally<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:35.140> kind<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:35.860> like<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.070> stream

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
just literally a kind of like a stream

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.910 
just literally a kind of like a stream
with<00:02:36.670> some<00:02:36.850> building<00:02:37.780> uh<00:02:37.810> some<00:02:38.620> actual

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
with some building uh some actual

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.590 
with some building uh some actual
buildings<00:02:39.250> on<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.640> if<00:02:39.910> you<00:02:40.000> look<00:02:40.240> in<00:02:40.420> the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
buildings on it and if you look in the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.900 
buildings on it and if you look in the
act<00:02:40.900> right<00:02:41.530> hand<00:02:41.740> side<00:02:41.950> he<00:02:42.340> does<00:02:42.580> look<00:02:42.880> like

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
act right hand side he does look like

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.940 
act right hand side he does look like
he's<00:02:43.240> carrying<00:02:43.600> some<00:02:43.930> new<00:02:44.140> weapon<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.740> don't

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
he's carrying some new weapon I don't

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.010 
he's carrying some new weapon I don't
know<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> use<00:02:45.460> of<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.730> claw<00:02:46.360> or<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
know that the use of the claw or the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.870 
know that the use of the claw or the
Rhino<00:02:47.320> whatever<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.190> is<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.490> looks<00:02:48.670> pretty

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
Rhino whatever it is it looks pretty

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.790 
Rhino whatever it is it looks pretty
cool<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.480> I'm<00:02:49.570> definitely<00:02:50.350> going<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.680> be

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
cool and I'm definitely going to be

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.680 
cool and I'm definitely going to be
using<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.400> lot<00:02:51.520> though<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.090> map<00:02:52.270> overall

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
using it a lot though the map overall

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.210 
using it a lot though the map overall
just<00:02:52.900> looks<00:02:53.140> really<00:02:53.320> nice<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.920> especially

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
just looks really nice and especially

just looks really nice and especially
for<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:55.000> hunter<00:02:55.930> mode<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.530> stilt<00:02:56.950> because

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
for the hunter mode this stilt because

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.650 
for the hunter mode this stilt because
it<00:02:57.340> has<00:02:57.460> that<00:02:57.640> kind<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.820> gloomy<00:02:58.210> look<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.540> it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
it has that kind of gloomy look to it

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.180 
it has that kind of gloomy look to it
kind<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.930> like<00:02:59.080> suits<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.680> setting<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.040> lot

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
kind of like suits the setting a lot

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.250 
kind of like suits the setting a lot
better<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:00.730> with<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.090> water<00:03:01.300> having<00:03:01.900> across

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
better and with the water having across

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.870 
better and with the water having across
that<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.590> can<00:03:02.740> spot<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.100> invisible<00:03:03.550> people<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
that you can spot the invisible people a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.330 
that you can spot the invisible people a
lot<00:03:04.270> easier<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.050> overall<00:03:05.500> design<00:03:05.770> that

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
lot easier so the overall design that

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.340 
lot easier so the overall design that
you<00:03:06.430> can<00:03:06.580> tell<00:03:06.790> from<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.330> just<00:03:07.600> concept

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
you can tell from like this just concept

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.230 
you can tell from like this just concept
