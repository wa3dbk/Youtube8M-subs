00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
rollup style and one of the big problems

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.580 
rollup style and one of the big problems
with<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.579> was<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> range<00:00:33.960> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
with this was going out to the range you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.190 
with this was going out to the range you
go<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> unfurl<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:36.030> doesn't<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:37.140> we

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
go to unfurl it and it doesn't it we

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560

layer of foam and this isn't just any
foam<00:01:55.969> we<00:01:56.990> sampled<00:01:57.990> endless<00:01:58.909> densities<00:01:59.909> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
foam we sampled endless densities and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
foam we sampled endless densities and
thicknesses<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.659> foam<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.049> come<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
thicknesses of foam to come up with the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.920 
thicknesses of foam to come up with the
right<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.880> found<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> foam<00:02:03.780> was

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
right one we found that if the foam was

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.170 
right one we found that if the foam was
too<00:02:04.200> thick<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.250> mat<00:02:05.430> itself<00:02:05.820> would<00:02:05.969> let<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
too thick the mat itself would let you

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.910 
too thick the mat itself would let you
squirm<00:02:06.540> around<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> lost<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.740> lot<00:02:07.890> of

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
squirm around and you lost a lot of

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.650 
squirm around and you lost a lot of
stability<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:08.610> shooting<00:02:09.000> especially<00:02:09.360> on

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
stability in your shooting especially on

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.990 
stability in your shooting especially on
a<00:02:09.720> recoil<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.770> it's<00:02:10.890> too<00:02:11.099> thin<00:02:11.400> you'll<00:02:11.760> feel

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
a recoil if it's too thin you'll feel

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.970 
a recoil if it's too thin you'll feel
every<00:02:12.150> rock<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.480> every

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
every rock and every

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.160 
every rock and every
crevice<00:02:13.310> underneath<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.599> is<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.840> ideal

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
crevice underneath so this is the ideal

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
crevice underneath so this is the ideal
balance<00:02:15.409> of<00:02:15.800> density<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.610> thickness<00:02:18.190> now

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
balance of density and thickness now

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.949 
balance of density and thickness now
that's<00:02:19.519> not<00:02:19.760> all<00:02:19.940> when<00:02:20.269> you're<00:02:20.390> done<00:02:20.569> shooting

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
that's not all when you're done shooting

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.030 
that's not all when you're done shooting
you<00:02:21.049> take<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.349> rifle<00:02:21.680> off<00:02:23.560> grab<00:02:24.560> these<00:02:24.769> two

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
you take the rifle off grab these two

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.850
