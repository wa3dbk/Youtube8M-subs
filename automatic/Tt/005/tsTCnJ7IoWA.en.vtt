if that's gonna be the case it may be

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.510 
if that's gonna be the case it may be
I'm<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.970> sure<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.840> I'll<00:01:19.439> know<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> don't<00:01:20.159> think

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
I think it's most people won't play
search<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.310> play<00:01:23.490> search<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.299> search

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
search on play search but I think search

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.870 
search on play search but I think search
and<00:01:24.689> rescue<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.259> honestly<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.920> improvement<00:01:26.490> on

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
and rescue is honestly an improvement on
Search<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.479> Destroy<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:28.409> from

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
and why it's actually kind of a good

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.700 
and why it's actually kind of a good
thing<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.389> you<00:04:36.479> can<00:04:36.659> respawn<00:04:36.990> within<00:04:37.560> this
