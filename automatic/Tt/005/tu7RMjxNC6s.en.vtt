naked<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:24.900> know<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.080> that's<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.350> good<00:00:25.380> idea

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
naked I don't know if that's a good idea

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.000 
naked I don't know if that's a good idea
usually<00:00:26.430> if<00:00:26.609> you're<00:00:26.910> using<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.420> Floyd<00:00:27.689> Rose

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
usually if you're using a Floyd Rose

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.800 
usually if you're using a Floyd Rose
which<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.130> not<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> case<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:30.510> would<00:00:30.660> do

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
which is not the case here you would do

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.479 
which is not the case here you would do
it<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.199> string<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.769> time<00:00:32.009> because<00:00:32.219> that's

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
it one string at a time because that's

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.220 
it one string at a time because that's
going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> change<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.360> intonation<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
going to change the intonation in the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.840

action of the guitar I probably should

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.760 
action of the guitar I probably should
have<00:00:35.910> done<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.570> string<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.200> time<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
have done one string at a time and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.889 
have done one string at a time and
change<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:41.210> you<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
change it but you know you don't know a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.150 
change it but you know you don't know a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it's been around for quite a while it's

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.550 
it's been around for quite a while it's
also<00:01:34.110> known<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.770> D<00:01:34.979> string

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.420 

high-quality<00:01:43.560> string<00:01:45.980> string<00:01:46.980> number<00:01:47.130> one

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
high-quality string string number one

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.540 
high-quality string string number one
the<00:01:47.880> high<00:01:48.090> E<00:01:48.120> string<00:01:48.860> there's<00:01:49.860> two<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.190> there<00:01:50.370> I

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
the high E string there's two in there I

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.010 
the high E string there's two in there I
guess<00:01:51.120> they<00:01:51.300> knew<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
guess they knew that I was going to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
guess they knew that I was going to
break<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> first<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.830> so<00:01:53.340> because<00:01:53.820> there's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
break the first one so because there's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.150 
break the first one so because there's
two<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.110> specific<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.950> roto

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
two and that's specific to the roto

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.330 
two and that's specific to the roto
sounds<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:58.080> want<00:01:58.230> to<00:01:58.320> take<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.620> first<00:01:58.800> string

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
sounds you want to take the first string

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.820 
sounds you want to take the first string
and<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.630> first<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.200> take<00:02:01.410> this<00:02:01.650> is

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
and the first one that you take this is

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.410

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
going to cut these extra wires there so

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.300 
going to cut these extra wires there so
let's<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.780> wire<00:02:18.780> cutter

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.530 

much<00:02:22.310> better<00:02:22.580> maybe<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.120> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
much better maybe it's just the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.060 
much better maybe it's just the
excitement<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.170> having<00:02:24.290> new<00:02:24.530> strings<00:02:24.890> on

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
excitement of having new strings on

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.110 
excitement of having new strings on
that's<00:02:25.580> possible<00:02:26.180> but<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:27.370> feel<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.850> tone

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
that's possible but I feel that the tone

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.680 
that's possible but I feel that the tone
is<00:02:29.620> cleaner<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.770> clearer<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.240> hear<00:02:32.480> some

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
is cleaner and clearer and I hear some

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.050 
is cleaner and clearer and I hear some
things<00:02:32.960> some<00:02:33.260> harmonics<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.070> sustain<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.000> I

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
things some harmonics and sustain that I

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.190 
things some harmonics and sustain that I
didn't<00:02:35.360> hear<00:02:35.510> before<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.720> thing<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.110> is

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
didn't hear before the thing that is

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.900 
didn't hear before the thing that is
quite<00:02:39.440> weird<00:02:39.800> here<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.400> usually<00:02:40.760> when<00:02:40.880> I

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
quite weird here is that usually when I

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.000 
quite weird here is that usually when I
change<00:02:41.270> strings<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:42.020> takes<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.560> little<00:02:42.710> bit<00:02:42.890> of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
change strings it takes a little bit of

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.460 
change strings it takes a little bit of
time<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.550> me<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.120> adapt<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:45.020> those<00:02:45.140> strings

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
time for me to adapt to those strings

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.070 
time for me to adapt to those strings
until<00:02:45.740> they<00:02:45.830> become<00:02:46.100> old<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.000> they<00:02:47.600> feel

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
until they become old and and they feel

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.440 
until they become old and and they feel
more<00:02:48.260> comfortable<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:49.430> feels<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:49.910> their

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
more comfortable this feels like their

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.690 
more comfortable this feels like their
old<00:02:50.780> strings<00:02:51.410> which<00:02:51.740> is<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.920> good<00:02:52.160> thing<00:02:52.220> for<00:02:52.430> me

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
old strings which is a good thing for me

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.700 
old strings which is a good thing for me

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710
