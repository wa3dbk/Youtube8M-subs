00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.640
 sexy mother fucker from motor sport wants 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.849
 but also Giedo van de Garde large 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.050
 talents and motor sport and maybe so 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.820

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.730
 Dutch floor anyway ensure a curl 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.020
 it is you do now so that means 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.580
 that we talk to him about important things 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.310
 life and out of sport 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.170
 so I wanted some dilemmas 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.640
 voorschotelen and then you have to choose 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.560
 the toilet seat 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.029
 by the fault to trees or to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.550
 downstairs my girlfriend always says 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 I have to do it layer after layer to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.550
 downstairs and I only see up 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.930
 to do 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 and what does it become then what does it get to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.000
 which he usually still stands with such a rocket 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.129

 the anti color that is really good i 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.649

 to charisma what in itself again 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.700
 charisma, she just becomes absolutely mean 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.070
 it's a special guy and he 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.900
 has a special character if you have the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.580
 car in city is your unbelief fast 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.780
 imagine the time machine and with that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.330
 can send you a message to the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.369
 12 year old griddle of course what would you like 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.530
 put in it what they mainly do or do 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.970
 not to do at all 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.579
 well i have to say everyone makes mistakes 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.869
 and of your mistakes you naturally go whole 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.030
 learn a lot 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.320
 and of course you have career moments 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 I shouldn't have done that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.630
 then I have to do it again but I'm here 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.909
 now achieved with rich nicknames and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.170
 I still have to take that little step and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.509
 I am convinced that it will work 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.619
 how big do you think the chances are 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.360
 succeed 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.149
 good so even harder at the moment 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.829
 is there still a start of season i can 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.720
 you against you in a month and a half 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.969
 months how big the chance is 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.979
 so it 's really very very close 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.409

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.119

 but everyone you like is nice guy 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.250
 a heart can drive and that is what you
