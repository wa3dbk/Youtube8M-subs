about the Breslin one show first one is
most<00:00:59.760> likely<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.170> bought<00:01:01.410> your

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
most likely for you if you bought your

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.609 
most likely for you if you bought your
computer<00:01:02.280> from<00:01:02.520> my<00:01:02.730> major<00:01:03.000> franchise<00:01:03.600> HP<00:01:04.290> Dell

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
computer from my major franchise HP Dell

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.250 
computer from my major franchise HP Dell
or<00:01:04.830> whatever<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.210> their<00:01:06.390> own<00:01:06.420> software

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
or whatever they have their own software

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.760 
or whatever they have their own software
to<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.770> slideshows<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.570> means<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.590> can

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
to do slideshows this means that you can

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.399 
to do slideshows this means that you can
actually<00:01:10.950> use<00:01:11.369> their<00:01:11.700> software<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.020> highly

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
actually use their software and I highly

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
actually use their software and I highly
suggest<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.909> tends<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.509> be

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
suggest that because it tends to be

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.670 
suggest that because it tends to be
better<00:01:16.170> than<00:01:16.710> anything<00:01:17.400> else<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:19.470> far<00:01:19.619> as

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
better than anything else and as far as

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.070 
better than anything else and as far as
as<00:01:20.159> far<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.619> vanilla<00:01:22.619> Windows<00:01:23.280> experience

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
as far as the vanilla Windows experience

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.340 
as far as the vanilla Windows experience
and<00:01:25.250> that's<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.610> something<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.939> notes<00:01:27.350> but

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and that's just something that notes but

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.760 
and that's just something that notes but
if<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.070> did<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.060> buy<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.600> computer<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
if you did not buy your computer from a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
if you did not buy your computer from a
major<00:01:31.950> franchise<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.939> don't<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
major franchise or you don't like the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.800 
major franchise or you don't like the
using<00:01:33.990> their<00:01:34.140> software<00:01:34.400> don't<00:01:35.400> work<00:01:35.810> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
using their software don't work the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.399 
using their software don't work the
other<00:01:37.290> way<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.939> is<00:01:38.939> by<00:01:39.270> PowerPoint<00:01:39.990> which

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
other way is is by PowerPoint which

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.380 
other way is is by PowerPoint which
again<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.950> don't<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.700> suggest<00:01:41.880> because

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
again I don't really suggest because

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.780 
again I don't really suggest because
again<00:01:43.079> you're<00:01:43.320> making<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:45.140> an<00:01:46.140> actual<00:01:46.790> separate

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
again you're making a an actual separate

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.560 
again you're making a an actual separate
file<00:01:48.180> an<00:01:48.720> actual<00:01:49.079> PowerPoint

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
file an actual PowerPoint

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.350 
file an actual PowerPoint
so<00:01:51.050> that's<00:01:51.560> not<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:52.040> solution<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:53.000> them<00:01:53.150> Wakan

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
so that's not a solution of them Wakan

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.700 
so that's not a solution of them Wakan
Tanka<00:01:53.780> I'll<00:01:54.080> do<00:01:54.320> it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
Tanka I'll do it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.590 
Tanka I'll do it
and<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.400> Malcolm<00:01:55.700> Ginjo<00:01:56.150> how<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.390> make<00:01:56.570> a

PowerPoint this time the other way the
third<00:02:00.230> method<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:01.550> is<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:01.910> vanilla<00:02:02.600> one

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
third method and this is the vanilla one

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.700 
third method and this is the vanilla one
owes<00:02:03.680> eight<00:02:03.890> experience<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:06.320> is<00:02:06.500> not

owes eight experience and this is not

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.730 
owes eight experience and this is not
reliable<00:02:07.100> one<00:02:07.430> percent<00:02:07.790> time<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:09.500> don't

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
reliable one percent time but you don't

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
so you might have to do that you might

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.010 
so you might have to do that you might
have<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.170> go<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.680> side<00:03:22.980> right<00:03:23.280> here<00:03:23.640> and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
have to go to the side right here and

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.930 
have to go to the side right here and
mess<00:03:25.020> around<00:03:25.050> with<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.790> can

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
mess around with that and you can

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.680 
mess around with that and you can
reorder<00:03:27.180> all<00:03:28.080> these<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.040> as<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:29.910> sell<00:03:30.120> here

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
reorder all these so as you sell here

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.580 
reorder all these so as you sell here
these<00:03:31.440> were<00:03:31.920> my<00:03:32.340> next<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.790> each<00:03:32.910> other<00:03:33.090> as<00:03:33.590> it's

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
these were my next to each other as it's

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.910 
these were my next to each other as it's
all<00:03:34.800> right<00:03:35.130> here<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.849> all<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.180> stuff<00:03:36.330> was<00:03:36.630> on

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
all right here and all this stuff was on

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.850 
all right here and all this stuff was on
other<00:03:37.920> places<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:39.600> that's<00:03:40.350> just<00:03:40.500> something<00:03:40.709> to

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
other places so that's just something to

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.680 
other places so that's just something to
keep<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.160> mind<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.610> can<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.330> go<00:03:42.540> ahead

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
keep in mind you can you can go ahead

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.759 
keep in mind you can you can go ahead
and<00:03:43.340> do<00:03:44.340> that

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
and do that

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.220 
and do that
and<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.890> period<00:03:47.160> once<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.550> just<00:03:48.019> look<00:03:49.019> at<00:03:49.140> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
and the period once you just look at the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.090 
and the period once you just look at the
playlists<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:50.099> that<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.790> starts<00:03:51.450> working<00:03:52.100> so

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
playlists like that it starts working so

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.660 
playlists like that it starts working so

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
let's go to the next method in case that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.470 
let's go to the next method in case that
didn't<00:03:56.970> work<00:03:57.150> because<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.230> can<00:03:58.940> do<00:03:59.940> at<00:04:00.209> least

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
didn't work because you can do at least

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.350 
didn't work because you can do at least
eight<00:04:00.780> times<00:04:01.260> in<00:04:01.530> row<00:04:01.709> which<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.220> try<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.000> record

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
eight times in row which I try to record

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.630 
eight times in row which I try to record
it<00:04:03.510> eight<00:04:03.720> times<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.410> Road<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.830> didn't<00:04:05.489> work
