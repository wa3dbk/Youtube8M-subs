00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.160
 not for vista 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.380
 he does not like short hockey vista so me 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.170
 I am 64 so it's for me it's 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.519
 so that's it so I'm not going to you 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.530
 show the installation all because 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.530
 it's relatively simple what 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.480
 detector is so I said yeah 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.890
 so that's it ah yes no I had something 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.870
 so under windows 8 to see his which 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.580
 operating system you are you 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.060
 go down there is the home menu which 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.350
 appears 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.560
 do a right click and you go in 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:27.040
 a game is higher it is our 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.540
 cooperation no no that's not it 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.489
 it's to see a cooperation rabbit 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.569
 I'm gutting myself so here's more 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.690
 with this theme you have the little button 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.370
 start as before 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.660
 short and I keep saying true 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.790
 this under the force 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.870
 I do not remember anymore you have to open a 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.700
 document and you go on computer 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.780
 here you right click and you 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.489
 make property here is windows 8 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.970
 so you see a lot more windows 8 the 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.380
 windows 8 operating systems 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.269
 and so here is it there marked in 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.739
 the soul a 64-bit situation system 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.630
 so here you look at the tick of the 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.970
 system and so here is so here at 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.180
 the thing on this thing I have pretty much everything 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.430
 said so I showed you quickly done or 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.829
 is it because I did not look at that 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.280
 must be surely expect I replace 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:21.640
 a little bit my helmet here yeah bah it's 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.789
 pretty much the same system what good 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.060
 playing the referees makes even fouled the 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.060
 imagery 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.130
 good it does not garnish much to good sailly 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.479
 had to click in fact yeah yeah 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.250
 it's not so good you choose 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.620
 between the two brief ways it's the same 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.570
 thing has changed what according to what 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.000
 do not go anyway you'll have the thing what 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.139
 so here you go so you install it 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.900
 normally like normal software and 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:01.909
 then that's it for 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.169
 to have the buttons left so 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.710
 so that does not work on all 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.800
 software 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.270
 so here is no sony vegas or 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.370
 skype and all that's right 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.620
 always because if they are made 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.840
 so we can not change them 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.020
 during the buttons to the right of the shot he 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.560
 I have to have teeth program this so 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.610
 if you downloaded this pack of course 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.039
 so here you click on program 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.770
 it's worth it here and there 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.090
 go click on the egg cider so you 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.469
 click here and then that put you the 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.479
 buttons on the right and left 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:36.949
 well I'm wrong left right I know 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:38.599
