instead of having a hundred videos out
this<00:03:01.260> year<00:03:01.470> I'm<00:03:01.680> probably<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.730> have

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420

this year I'm probably going to have
maybe<00:03:03.750> 95<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:05.010> think<00:03:05.340> right<00:03:05.549> now<00:03:05.760> this

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
maybe 95 I think right now this

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.150 
maybe 95 I think right now this
particular<00:03:06.540> video<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:06.930> 93<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.620> don't<00:03:08.070> know

particular video is 93 I don't know

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.350 
particular video is 93 I don't know
maybe<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.489> sort<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.000> blessing<00:03:09.180> in

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
maybe it's sort of a blessing in

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.449 
maybe it's sort of a blessing in
disguise<00:03:09.390> because<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:10.019> was<00:03:10.739> feeling<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.250> little

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
disguise because I was feeling a little

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.820 
disguise because I was feeling a little

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
some people and you know people just

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.199 
some people and you know people just
don't<00:04:16.860> have<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.130> patience<00:04:17.489> these<00:04:17.730> days<00:04:17.970> to

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
don't have the patience these days to

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.170 
don't have the patience these days to
sit<00:04:18.390> down<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.810> watch<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.170> 12-minute<00:04:19.799> video

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
sit down and watch a 12-minute video

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.700 
sit down and watch a 12-minute video
they<00:04:21.180> want<00:04:21.570> everything<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:22.290> like<00:04:22.470> three

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
they want everything in like three

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.880 
they want everything in like three
minutes<00:04:22.920> or<00:04:23.160> less<00:04:23.460> preferably<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.750> maybe<00:04:25.440> it

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
minutes or less preferably so maybe it

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.770 
minutes or less preferably so maybe it
would<00:04:26.160> be<00:04:26.190> easier<00:04:26.370> for<00:04:26.910> me<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.060> make<00:04:27.330> really

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
would be easier for me to make really

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.290 
would be easier for me to make really
short<00:04:28.110> videos<00:04:28.560> it's<00:04:28.890> less<00:04:29.370> laborious<00:04:29.550> on<00:04:30.120> my

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
short videos it's less laborious on my

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.850 
short videos it's less laborious on my
part<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:31.200> would<00:04:31.320> be<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.440> win-win<00:04:31.680> situation

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
part that would be a win-win situation

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.090 
part that would be a win-win situation
because<00:04:32.670> it's<00:04:32.880> less<00:04:33.240> time<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.530> effort<00:04:34.890> on<00:04:35.070> my

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
because it's less time and effort on my

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.060 
because it's less time and effort on my
part<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.990> people<00:04:36.990> would<00:04:37.140> be<00:04:37.290> more<00:04:37.320> willing<00:04:37.890> to

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
part and people would be more willing to

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.770 
part and people would be more willing to
watch<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.610> now<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.150> does<00:04:39.330> mean<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.540> there

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
watch it now that does mean that there

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.480 
watch it now that does mean that there
would<00:04:39.870> be<00:04:39.900> less<00:04:40.080> information<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:40.890> i<00:04:40.920> have<00:04:41.340> to

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
would be less information so i have to

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.840 
would be less information so i have to
put<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:42.260> detailed<00:04:43.260> information<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:44.250> all<00:04:44.520> my

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
put that detailed information and all my

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.560 
put that detailed information and all my
studies<00:04:46.460> somewhere<00:04:47.460> else<00:04:47.640> I'd<00:04:47.970> perhaps<00:04:48.360> an

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
studies somewhere else I'd perhaps an

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.440 
studies somewhere else I'd perhaps an
e-book<00:04:48.960> or<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.770> special<00:04:50.340> place<00:04:50.550> on<00:04:50.760> my<00:04:50.940> blog<00:04:51.210> or

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
are in favor of having shorter videos

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.120 
are in favor of having shorter videos
