00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
people in Hong Kong have one of these

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.430 
people in Hong Kong have one of these
and<00:05:23.090> when<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:23.810> travel<00:05:24.020> basically<00:05:24.650> and

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
and when you travel basically and

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.470 
and when you travel basically and
enter<00:05:25.680> station<00:05:26.130> and<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.550> would<00:05:26.700> keep<00:05:26.940> river

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
enter station and you would keep river

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.120 
enter station and you would keep river
station<00:05:28.050> or<00:05:28.230> whatever<00:05:28.350> they<00:05:28.620> should<00:05:28.800> check<00:05:28.980> it

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
station or whatever they should check it

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.370 
station or whatever they should check it
out<00:05:29.250> it<00:05:29.460> would<00:05:29.610> automatically<00:05:30.210> take<00:05:30.510> off<00:05:31.110> the

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
out it would automatically take off the

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.750 
out it would automatically take off the
balance<00:05:31.740> so<00:05:31.920> it's<00:05:32.040> really<00:05:32.130> cool<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.430> if<00:05:32.670> you

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
balance so it's really cool that if you

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.800 
balance so it's really cool that if you
want<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:32.970> go<00:05:33.060> somewhere<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:33.480> don't<00:05:33.630> have<00:05:33.720> to

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
want to go somewhere you don't have to

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.900

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
buy a ticket you just do and then you

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.500
