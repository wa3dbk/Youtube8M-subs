00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
you these plastic rings that I found in

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.779 
you these plastic rings that I found in
a<00:00:44.789> bag<00:00:45.590> at<00:00:46.590> Michael's<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.309> i<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.640> like

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
a bag at Michael's for i think is like

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.840 
a bag at Michael's for i think is like
two<00:00:48.000> dollars<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.640> wasn't<00:00:50.640> sure<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
two dollars and wasn't sure if that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.490 
two dollars and wasn't sure if that
we're<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> work<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:51.899> since

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
we're going to work out because since

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.010 
we're going to work out because since
they're<00:00:52.800> kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.370> guess<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.719> curb

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
they're kind of I guess they have curb

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660 
they're kind of I guess they have curb
so<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> wasn't<00:00:55.530> sure<00:00:55.829> how<00:00:56.010> good<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.340> was<00:00:56.430> going

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so I wasn't sure how good it was going

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.750 
so I wasn't sure how good it was going
to<00:00:57.469> hold<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.710> whatever<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> button

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
to hold up whatever like the button

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.100 
to hold up whatever like the button
since<00:01:00.030> they're<00:01:00.180> flat<00:01:00.590> but<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> did<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
since they're flat but so I did one and

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.770 
since they're flat but so I did one and
it<00:01:04.110> worked<00:01:04.409> pretty<00:01:04.619> well<00:01:05.060> all<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.119> did<00:01:06.390> was<00:01:06.420> put

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it worked pretty well all I did was put

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.590 
it worked pretty well all I did was put
the<00:01:06.810> glue<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:08.270> placed<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.540> button<00:01:10.939> see<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.210> did

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the glue I placed the button see I did

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.320 
the glue I placed the button see I did
that<00:01:13.100> double<00:01:14.100> button<00:01:14.400> stock<00:01:14.970> button<00:01:16.159> look<00:01:17.330> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that double button stock button look and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.980 
that double button stock button look and
I<00:01:18.540> put<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> Swarovski<00:01:19.439> crystal<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.600> did

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
I put the Swarovski crystal so it did

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.840 
I put the Swarovski crystal so it did
work<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.530> only<00:01:22.770> thing<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.189> course<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> had

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
work the only thing of course that I had

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.260 
work the only thing of course that I had
to<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.210> since<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.770> not<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.310> guess<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
to do since it it's not I guess the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.499 
to do since it it's not I guess the
Rings<00:01:27.509> not<00:01:27.659> dumb<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:29.750> guess<00:01:31.670> there's<00:01:32.670> bumps<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
Rings not dumb I guess there's bumps of

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.810 
Rings not dumb I guess there's bumps of
course<00:01:33.750> there's<00:01:34.049> ridges<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.829> guess<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.610> i<00:01:35.670> had

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
course there's ridges I guess so i had

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.200 
course there's ridges I guess so i had
to<00:01:35.939> lay<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.299> flat<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.939> close<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
to lay it flat like this and close to a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
to lay it flat like this and close to a
wall<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.530> something<00:01:40.829> else<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> side

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
wall and put something else on the side

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.630 
wall and put something else on the side
of<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.689> hold<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.520> wouldn't<00:01:44.520> move

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
of it just to hold it so wouldn't move

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
of it just to hold it so wouldn't move
of<00:01:44.820> course<00:01:45.000> while<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.450> dries<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:45.990> took

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
of course while it dries up so took

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.090 
of course while it dries up so took
about<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.619> good<00:01:46.920> 24<00:01:47.340> hours<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.939> dry<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
about a good 24 hours for dry up and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.370 
about a good 24 hours for dry up and
then<00:01:50.100> i<00:01:50.130> also<00:01:50.369> did<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.960> ring<00:01:52.200> right

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
