Christmas 3 kit so let's open it up and
see<00:00:33.860> what's<00:00:34.190> inside<00:00:39.130> comes<00:00:40.130> from<00:00:40.280> this

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
see what's inside comes from this

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.290 
see what's inside comes from this
anti-static<00:00:41.240> bag<00:00:41.920> there<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:43.040> even<00:00:43.300> included

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
anti-static bag there is even included

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.180 
anti-static bag there is even included
to<00:00:44.480> triple-a<00:00:45.350> batteries<00:00:49.390> so<00:00:50.390> let's<00:00:51.050> open<00:00:51.410> it

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
to triple-a batteries so let's open it

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:02.260 
to triple-a batteries so let's open it
up<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.400> see<00:00:53.680> how<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:54.830> looks<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:02.000> three

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
up and see how it looks so the three

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.499 
up and see how it looks so the three
comes<00:01:02.570> pre-populated<00:01:03.320> with<00:01:03.740> components<00:01:04.509> as

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
comes pre-populated with components as

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:06.999 
comes pre-populated with components as
you<00:01:05.630> can<00:01:05.780> see<00:01:05.960> here<00:01:06.049> but<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.350> still<00:01:06.590> need<00:01:06.770> to

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
you can see here but you still need to

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.860 
you can see here but you still need to
mount<00:01:07.400> it<00:01:07.700> together<00:01:08.119> yourself<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:11.510> start<00:01:11.570> a

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
mount it together yourself so to start a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.980 
mount it together yourself so to start a
process<00:01:12.110> just<00:01:12.470> break<00:01:13.220> out<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.970> three<00:01:14.540> parts

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
process just break out the three parts

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.420 
process just break out the three parts
of<00:01:15.080> this<00:01:15.790> frame<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.120> can<00:01:17.150> do<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:17.870> by<00:01:17.990> gently

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
of this frame you can do it by gently

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.180 
of this frame you can do it by gently
bending<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.490> whole<00:01:19.670> frame<00:01:19.940> like<00:01:20.120> this<00:01:20.150> and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
bending the whole frame like this and

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.250 
bending the whole frame like this and
then<00:01:22.190> try<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.460> gently<00:01:23.150> push<00:01:23.630> out<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.960> parts

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
then try to gently push out the parts

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.120 
then try to gently push out the parts
without<00:01:25.000> pushing<00:01:26.000> out<00:01:26.300> any<00:01:27.040> components<00:01:28.040> on

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
without pushing out any components on

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.760 
without pushing out any components on
the<00:01:28.220> PCB<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:31.960> just<00:01:32.960> be<00:01:33.110> careful<00:01:33.350> with<00:01:33.560> your

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
the PCB so just be careful with your

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.610 
the PCB so just be careful with your
fingers<00:01:33.830> because<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.960> PCB<00:01:35.960> can<00:01:36.229> be<00:01:36.409> quite

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
fingers because the PCB can be quite

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:50.140 
fingers because the PCB can be quite
sharp<00:01:45.970> okay<00:01:46.970> then<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:47.900> have<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.760> three<00:01:49.760> parts

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
sharp okay then we have the three parts

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.600 
sharp okay then we have the three parts
here<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:51.500> mount<00:01:51.680> them<00:01:51.860> together<00:01:52.159> you<00:01:52.369> just

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
here and to mount them together you just

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.710 
here and to mount them together you just
take<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:53.390> these<00:01:54.020> two<00:01:54.290> are<00:01:54.640> completely

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
take so these two are completely

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.530 
take so these two are completely
identical<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:57.950> can<00:01:58.159> be<00:01:58.420> whichever<00:01:59.420> one

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
identical so this can be whichever one

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.310 
identical so this can be whichever one
and<00:01:59.869> then<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:01.189> just<00:02:01.400> put<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:02.030> okay<00:02:02.990> first<00:02:03.229> you

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
and then you just put it okay first you

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.800 
and then you just put it okay first you
have<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.619> take<00:02:03.860> off<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:04.070> small<00:02:04.640> knob<00:02:05.540> on<00:02:05.780> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
have to take off this small knob on the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.070 
have to take off this small knob on the
connector<00:02:06.439> here<00:02:06.700> then<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.820> just<00:02:08.179> pushed<00:02:08.720> two

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
connector here then you just pushed two

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.790 
connector here then you just pushed two
and<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.129> half<00:02:10.310> together<00:02:10.759> like<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.800> it's

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
and a half together like this and it's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.010 
and a half together like this and it's
supposed<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.220> go<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.690> bottom

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
supposed to go in that and the bottom

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.000 
supposed to go in that and the bottom
six<00:02:15.319> holes<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:15.980> connector<00:02:16.700> on

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
six holes of the connector on

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.580 
six holes of the connector on
the<00:02:17.489> main<00:02:17.700> part<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> three<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.689> you<00:02:19.470> can

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the main part of the three and you can

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.020 
the main part of the three and you can
easily<00:02:19.739> see<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.459> done<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.819> wrong

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
easily see that you have done it wrong

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.179 
easily see that you have done it wrong
if<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.870> doesn't<00:02:22.200> line<00:02:22.349> up<00:02:22.379> on<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.799> top<00:02:22.950> pair

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
if it doesn't line up on the top pair

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.250 
if it doesn't line up on the top pair
like<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:26.629> just<00:02:27.629> put<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.049> like<00:02:28.230> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
like that so just put it in like that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.190 
like that so just put it in like that
and<00:02:28.439> do<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.129> same<00:02:29.310> with<00:02:29.489> other<00:02:29.670> half<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.720> there

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
and do the same with other half so there

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.559 
and do the same with other half so there
are<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.459> now<00:02:35.459> let's<00:02:35.790> see<00:02:35.970> what<00:02:36.120> happens<00:02:36.420> if

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
are this now let's see what happens if

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:45.020 
are this now let's see what happens if
we<00:02:36.690> put<00:02:36.870> some<00:02:37.049> batteries<00:02:37.379> in<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:43.909> should<00:02:44.909> be

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
we put some batteries in it should be

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.640 
we put some batteries in it should be
possible<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.450> fit<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.840> batteries<00:02:46.230> without

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
possible to fit the batteries without

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.520 
possible to fit the batteries without
taking<00:02:47.400> off<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.760> sides<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.540> three<00:02:48.750> so

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
taking off the sides of the three so

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470 
taking off the sides of the three so
just<00:02:49.980> mind<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.340> polarity<00:02:50.879> of<00:02:50.909> the<00:02:51.060> battery

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
just mind the polarity of the battery

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.380 
just mind the polarity of the battery
there's<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.840> small<00:02:52.250> marker<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.879> minus

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
there's a small marker this is minus

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.619 
there's a small marker this is minus
there<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.870> plus<00:02:55.139> some<00:02:55.349> other<00:02:55.440> side<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:56.069> just

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
there and plus some other side so just

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.430 
there and plus some other side so just
put<00:02:57.629> in<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> battery<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.349> right<00:02:58.560> way<00:02:58.769> around

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
put in the battery the right way around
