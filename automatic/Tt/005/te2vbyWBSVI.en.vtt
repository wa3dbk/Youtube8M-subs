00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
basically we don't know what happened to

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.210 
basically we don't know what happened to
them<00:04:30.230> we<00:04:30.440> don't<00:04:30.470> know<00:04:30.650> if<00:04:30.710> they<00:04:30.830> died<00:04:31.070> or

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
died but I have a feeling that they're

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.040 
died but I have a feeling that they're
still<00:04:34.880> alive<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.270> guys<00:04:35.420> are<00:04:35.570> you<00:04:35.810> know<00:04:35.930> the

it<00:04:37.790> I<00:04:37.940> just<00:04:38.390> have<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.630> feeling<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:38.960> this

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
it I just have the feeling that this

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.140 
it I just have the feeling that this
other<00:04:39.530> one<00:04:39.830> on<00:04:40.010> ghoul<00:04:40.220> is<00:04:40.430> still<00:04:40.670> alive<00:04:40.880> and

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
other one on ghoul is still alive and

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.450 
other one on ghoul is still alive and
possibly<00:04:41.660> possibly<00:04:42.350> I<00:04:42.650> don't<00:04:42.830> know<00:04:42.890> maybe

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
possibly possibly I don't know maybe

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.520 
possibly possibly I don't know maybe
this<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.700> a<00:04:43.760> stretch<00:04:43.970> but<00:04:44.330> possibly<00:04:45.200> they're

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
this is a stretch but possibly they're

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.770 
this is a stretch but possibly they're
part<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:46.460> know<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.760> CCG<00:04:47.360> that's<00:04:47.570> what

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
part of the you know the CCG that's what

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.720 
part of the you know the CCG that's what
I'm<00:04:47.900> that's<00:04:48.080> what<00:04:48.200> I'm<00:04:48.410> feeling<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.890> I<00:04:49.490> know

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
I'm that's what I'm feeling and I know

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.220 
I'm that's what I'm feeling and I know
it's<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:49.910> big<00:04:50.090> stretch<00:04:50.300> but<00:04:50.600> possibly<00:04:51.080> the

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
it's a big stretch but possibly the

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.830 
it's a big stretch but possibly the
other<00:04:51.440> one<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.710> do<00:04:51.860> is<00:04:52.280> part<00:04:52.820> of<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.000> CCG<00:04:53.570> maybe

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
other one I do is part of the CCG maybe

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.680 
other one I do is part of the CCG maybe
because<00:04:54.200> like<00:04:54.380> um<00:04:55.180> because<00:04:56.180> we<00:04:56.330> get<00:04:56.450> this

be able to survive but there are some

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.500 
be able to survive but there are some
cases<00:05:30.919> were<00:05:31.280> pretty<00:05:31.550> pretty<00:05:31.880> rare<00:05:32.240> when

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
cases were pretty pretty rare when

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.450 
cases were pretty pretty rare when
ghouls<00:05:33.050> aren't<00:05:33.320> able<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.650> survive<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.280> one

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
ghouls aren't able to survive and one

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.520 
ghouls aren't able to survive and one
will<00:05:34.700> survive<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.300> that<00:05:35.780> person<00:05:36.169> also<00:05:36.350> have

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
will survive and that person also have

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.320 
will survive and that person also have
part<00:05:36.710> of<00:05:36.800> one<00:05:36.950> eye<00:05:37.130> but<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:37.610> one<00:05:38.150> is

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
part of one eye but that one is

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.400 
part of one eye but that one is
different<00:05:38.570> from<00:05:38.870> connecting<00:05:39.290> because

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
different from connecting because

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.040 
different from connecting because
connect<00:05:39.860> II<00:05:40.010> had<00:05:40.280> organs<00:05:41.120> implanted<00:05:41.630> into<00:05:41.780> him

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
connect II had organs implanted into him

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.990 
connect II had organs implanted into him
this<00:05:42.560> one<00:05:42.800> was<00:05:42.950> actually<00:05:43.100> conceived<00:05:43.760> through

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
this one was actually conceived through

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.530 
this one was actually conceived through
a<00:05:44.060> pool<00:05:44.419> and<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:45.410> human<00:05:45.970> and<00:05:46.970> I<00:05:47.060> feel<00:05:47.240> like<00:05:47.419> that

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
a pool and a human and I feel like that

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.850 
a pool and a human and I feel like that
person<00:05:47.750> has<00:05:47.990> some<00:05:48.200> kind<00:05:48.380> of<00:05:48.410> connection<00:05:48.650> with

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
person has some kind of connection with

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.950 
person has some kind of connection with
Rize<00:05:49.400> I<00:05:49.610> don't<00:05:50.030> don't<00:05:50.180> ask<00:05:50.360> me<00:05:50.540> why<00:05:50.720> I<00:05:50.750> just

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
Rize I don't don't ask me why I just

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.570 
Rize I don't don't ask me why I just
have<00:05:51.320> a<00:05:51.350> really<00:05:51.590> strong<00:05:51.740> feeling<00:05:52.100> about<00:05:52.400> that

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
have a really strong feeling about that

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.700 
have a really strong feeling about that
but<00:05:53.150> basically<00:05:53.330> when<00:05:53.870> we<00:05:53.960> move<00:05:54.140> on<00:05:54.320> later<00:05:54.560> in

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
but basically when we move on later in

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.440 
but basically when we move on later in
episode<00:05:55.070> everybody<00:05:55.550> just<00:05:55.850> starts<00:05:56.090> going<00:05:56.300> nuts
