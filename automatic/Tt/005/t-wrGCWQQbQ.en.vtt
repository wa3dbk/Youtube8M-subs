00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
 collected in the mirror system then it will have a temperature control the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.599
 prevents the picture from being distorted deep under the earth 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.409
 There, astronomers make daily measurements 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.199
 the game watchers of the earth 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.710
 make sure that the sun image is stationary and in perfect focus 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.169
 light 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.310
 these are the colors of sunlight its spectrum 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.110
 you can tell him in the spectrum 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.740
 they give information about the elements of the essential components of the sun 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.470
 77 already hints at the temperature the rotational speed 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.240
 and the activity of the magnetic field 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.660
 the red part of the spectrum 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.890
 it is attributable to hydrogen 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.110
 As an essential element of all stars, hydrogen determines much of the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.580
 Spectrum in the sunlight 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.649
 the light rest on us 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.240
 at a speed of 300 thousand kilometers per second 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.110
 if the sun is just a guest ball, their spectrum will be just the colors 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.930
 show a rainbow 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.760
 but that is not the case 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.280
 cooler gases in the outer shell of the sun 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.250
 absorb the light hotter 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.950
 underlying layers 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.090
 they show up as lines 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.140
 At this, scientists can study the different ones on the sun 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.040
 existing elements of identification 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.690
 This mainly includes hydrogen from the three quarters of the sun 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 Sodium magnesium and potassium 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.360
 the sun is huge 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.220
 so big 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.229
 that the earth could sit 100 times on its disk 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.520
 The looping so-called protocol would dance itself into space and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.530
 Sunspots often show signs of domestic activity 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.859
 in the sun, it is sort of a nuclear reactor 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 in which hydrogen is converted to helium 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.539
 the temperature in this process is 25 million degrees 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.899
 slowly the energy moves outwards 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:22.259
 first by radiation then closer to the surface in Conviction Sell 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.239
 above the surface, the outside atmosphere of the sun is her hello 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.239
 the shining sun ring 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.139
 JÃ¼rgen new mexico 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.739
 next to a height of 2700 43 meters 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.270
 on the Sacramento Peak 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.640
 is a building that could be called a sun temple 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:01.819
 it is an observatory 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.819
 in which especially the sunspots are explored 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.689
 set the tone for the clearest and clearest sunbaths in the world 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.879
 detected 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.029
 through a tube they are reflected in the depth of the mountain 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.720
 and keep the sunbathing to a minimum 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.659
 There is a vacuum in the tube 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.189
 deep underground 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.189
 the test was not promoted to a number of instruments 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.100
 because of this closed catacomb 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.260
 The sunspots will be those mysterious rashes of time 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.740
 to time on the face of the sun appear figuratively 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:41.909
 it is told 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.650
 Galileo injured one eye in 1610 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.860
 as he looks directly at the sun while trying to spot sunspots 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.719
 I wanted to go to my own gate 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.359
 Such studies are easier 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.720
 safely on an observation table reflects two sunspots 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.720
 in black and white 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.959
 In color, such a spot resembles a sunflower 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.309
 in the center the color around was a dark color the time 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.369
 this is much cooler here in the middle than by heating funds 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:18.759
 that seething around them and announces circle forming 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.849
 an enlargement of this center shows 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.800
 That is not by a sharp border line from the outside circle of light 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.439
 is disconnected 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.099
 at sunspots like this 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.110
 could devour the earth 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.330
 such a group of sunspots 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.889
 occurs within about ten days 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.309
 and stays active for about two weeks 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:42.120
 only a few exist longer 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.120
 sometimes over a few months 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.670
 such a merger of the chain of sunspots 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.380
 can stretch over a distance of nearly 200,000 kilometers 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.110
 that is about half the distance between earth and moon and 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.850
 they can stay active for so long 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.240
 that they are at their monthly rotation 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.680
 to be carried around the sun several times 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.680
 very small stains will only last for one or two days 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.120
 in the middle of this picture 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.160
 such a small sunspot is only a few hundred miles in diameter and 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.270
 barely visible in the midst of the bubbles of light Crisis 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.720
 the sunspots are slightly charcoal 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.830
 as the circle of light on the whole but even if stains cover the entire sun 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.840
 she would still light appliances and rice lights 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:32.020
 the number of sunspots 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.629
 reaches a peak in a cycle of eleven years 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:40.749
 left a patch of loose sun right during the maximum of the sunspots 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:43.590
 in the seventeenth century the sun showed no stains 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.870
 in Europe there was a short ice age 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.550
 there may be a connection between sunspots and 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.300
 the climate on earth 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.780
 this is the cause of the sunspot's appearance 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.770
 Magnetic field of the sun as the sun turns 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.849
 wave and entangle their magnet
