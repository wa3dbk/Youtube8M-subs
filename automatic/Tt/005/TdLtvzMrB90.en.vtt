made by Kevin potter at Potter USA the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.250 
made by Kevin potter at Potter USA the
purpose<00:00:10.790> for<00:00:10.970> this<00:00:11.090> torque<00:00:11.360> handle<00:00:11.750> is<00:00:11.900> for

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
purpose for this torque handle is for

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.350 
purpose for this torque handle is for
people<00:00:13.070> who<00:00:13.190> want<00:00:13.340> to<00:00:13.550> have<00:00:13.760> repeatable

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
people who want to have repeatable

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.660 
people who want to have repeatable
results<00:00:14.599> on<00:00:15.170> their<00:00:15.440> jack<00:00:15.800> if<00:00:16.070> they<00:00:16.250> don't<00:00:16.430> have

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
results on their jack if they don't have

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.450 
results on their jack if they don't have
a<00:00:16.699> gauge<00:00:17.029> a<00:00:17.359> gauge<00:00:18.109> is<00:00:18.320> very<00:00:18.529> handy<00:00:19.009> if<00:00:19.130> you<00:00:19.279> do

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
a gauge a gauge is very handy if you do

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.429 
a gauge a gauge is very handy if you do
need<00:00:19.640> to<00:00:19.669> repeat<00:00:20.179> your<00:00:20.300> work<00:00:20.570> but<00:00:21.169> like<00:00:21.289> i<00:00:21.409> said

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
need to repeat your work but like i said

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.679 
need to repeat your work but like i said
if<00:00:21.769> you've<00:00:21.980> ended<00:00:22.429> up<00:00:22.550> buying<00:00:22.789> a<00:00:23.150> cheaper

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
if you've ended up buying a cheaper

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.050 
if you've ended up buying a cheaper
model<00:00:23.989> jack<00:00:24.289> or<00:00:24.589> you<00:00:25.279> just<00:00:25.310> purchase<00:00:25.880> one

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
model jack or you just purchase one

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.479 
model jack or you just purchase one
without<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.449> gauge<00:00:26.779> then<00:00:27.499> you're<00:00:27.949> not<00:00:27.980> going<00:00:28.310> to

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
without a gauge then you're not going to

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.380 
without a gauge then you're not going to
have<00:00:28.699> that<00:00:29.949> repeatable<00:00:30.949> results<00:00:31.130> unless<00:00:31.819> you

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
have that repeatable results unless you

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.509 
have that repeatable results unless you
go<00:00:32.509> by<00:00:32.689> feel<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.230> even<00:00:33.620> sometimes<00:00:33.829> that<00:00:34.280> can

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
go by feel and even sometimes that can

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.670 
go by feel and even sometimes that can
vary<00:00:35.449> depending<00:00:35.989> on<00:00:35.989> your<00:00:36.230> metal<00:00:36.500> thickness

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
vary depending on your metal thickness

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.590 
vary depending on your metal thickness
and<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.129> thickness<00:00:37.219> of<00:00:37.820> your<00:00:37.879> dies<00:00:38.269> or

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
and the thickness of your dies or

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.650 
and the thickness of your dies or
whatever<00:00:38.870> you're<00:00:39.109> using<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:40.179> torque<00:00:41.179> handle

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
whatever you're using the torque handle

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.619 
whatever you're using the torque handle
is<00:00:41.870> basically<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:43.010> torque<00:00:43.579> wrench<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:44.329> has

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
is basically a torque wrench that has

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.069 
is basically a torque wrench that has
just<00:00:44.960> been<00:00:45.140> modified<00:00:45.649> to<00:00:45.679> fit<00:00:46.250> into<00:00:46.550> your<00:00:47.210> jack

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
just been modified to fit into your jack

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.560 
just been modified to fit into your jack
so<00:00:48.440> if<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:48.769> do<00:00:48.980> order<00:00:49.219> one<00:00:49.519> of<00:00:49.550> these<00:00:49.820> make

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
so if you do order one of these make

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.119 
so if you do order one of these make
certain<00:00:50.960> that<00:00:51.379> you<00:00:51.769> give<00:00:52.519> Kevin<00:00:52.999> Potter<00:00:53.269> the

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
certain that you give Kevin Potter the

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.099 
certain that you give Kevin Potter the
depth<00:00:55.129> or<00:00:55.429> the<00:00:55.579> width<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:56.120> your<00:00:56.600> inner

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
depth or the width of your inner

depth or the width of your inner
diameter<00:00:57.859> on<00:00:58.039> your<00:00:58.339> jack<00:00:58.670> port<00:00:59.269> so<00:00:59.899> that<00:00:59.929> he

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
diameter on your jack port so that he

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.600 
diameter on your jack port so that he
can<00:01:00.589> fit<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.070> tooling<00:01:01.929> to<00:01:02.929> your<00:01:03.109> jack<00:01:03.610> the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
can fit the tooling to your jack the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.880 
can fit the tooling to your jack the
torque<00:01:04.940> wrench<00:01:05.239> or<00:01:05.600> torque<00:01:05.930> handle<00:01:06.380> works<00:01:06.650> off

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
torque wrench or torque handle works off

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.040 
torque wrench or torque handle works off
of<00:01:06.920> foot<00:01:07.430> pounds<00:01:08.000> which<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.720> little

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
of foot pounds which is a little

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.350 
of foot pounds which is a little
different<00:01:09.380> than<00:01:09.500> what<00:01:09.650> we<00:01:09.770> use<00:01:10.070> on<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.910> gauges

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
different than what we use on the gauges

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
different than what we use on the gauges
you<00:01:11.480> typically<00:01:11.930> go<00:01:12.110> by<00:01:12.520> psi<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.990> you<00:01:14.990> can<00:01:15.170> do

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
you typically go by psi and you can do

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.920 
you typically go by psi and you can do
some<00:01:15.610> calculation<00:01:16.610> on<00:01:16.730> this<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.090> varies

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
some calculation on this it varies

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.620 
some calculation on this it varies
depending<00:01:18.470> on<00:01:18.650> your<00:01:18.920> jack<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.310> little<00:01:19.700> bit<00:01:19.880> but

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
depending on your jack a little bit but

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.170 
depending on your jack a little bit but
again<00:01:21.440> once<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:21.980> get<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.370> feel<00:01:22.640> or<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.940> hang

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
again once you get the feel or the hang

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.210 
again once you get the feel or the hang
of<00:01:23.360> this<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.780> will<00:01:24.020> be<00:01:24.230> repeatable<00:01:24.710> because

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
of this it will be repeatable because

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.260 
of this it will be repeatable because
the<00:01:25.820> breakaway<00:01:26.330> point<00:01:26.630> on<00:01:26.870> this<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.470> same

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
the breakaway point on this is the same

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.180 
the breakaway point on this is the same
every<00:01:29.270> time<00:01:29.300> at<00:01:29.870> least<00:01:30.080> it<00:01:30.260> has<00:01:30.410> been<00:01:30.650> for<00:01:31.010> me

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
every time at least it has been for me

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.680 
every time at least it has been for me
and<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.700> others<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.150> I've<00:01:32.270> talked<00:01:32.570> with

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
and the others that I've talked with

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.660 
and the others that I've talked with
they<00:01:32.930> have<00:01:33.080> also<00:01:33.500> used<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:34.040> particular

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
they have also used this particular

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.770 
they have also used this particular
gauge<00:01:35.590> alright<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.040> what<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.000> foot<00:01:38.510> pound

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
gauge alright so what is a foot pound

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.920 
gauge alright so what is a foot pound
and<00:01:39.050> how<00:01:39.170> does<00:01:39.230> that<00:01:39.530> correlate<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.030> PSI

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
and how does that correlate to the PSI

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.490 
and how does that correlate to the PSI
on<00:01:42.230> our<00:01:42.650> gauge<00:01:43.070> or<00:01:43.370> our<00:01:43.610> jack<00:01:44.060> now<00:01:44.900> again<00:01:45.080> a

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
on our gauge or our jack now again a

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.140 
on our gauge or our jack now again a
foot<00:01:45.740> pound<00:01:46.010> is<00:01:46.250> just<00:01:46.460> another<00:01:46.640> unit<00:01:47.060> of

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
foot pound is just another unit of

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.350 
foot pound is just another unit of
measurement<00:01:47.510> just<00:01:47.930> as<00:01:48.050> psi<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:49.150> what<00:01:50.150> that

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
measurement just as psi is and what that

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.870 
measurement just as psi is and what that
we<00:01:50.480> can<00:01:50.690> do<00:01:50.900> with<00:01:51.080> this<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.650> do<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:52.430> little<00:01:52.700> bit

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
we can do with this is do a little bit

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.530 
we can do with this is do a little bit
of<00:01:52.910> math<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.660> convert<00:01:54.080> this<00:01:54.370> about<00:01:55.370> every<00:01:55.730> 10

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
of math to convert this about every 10

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.160 
of math to convert this about every 10
foot<00:01:57.080> pounds<00:01:57.620> is<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.830> thousand<00:01:58.730> psi<00:01:59.270> on<00:01:59.810> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
foot pounds is a thousand psi on the

torque<00:02:04.850> wrench<00:02:05.120> I<00:02:05.300> have<00:02:05.480> found<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.930> I<00:02:06.350> have

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
torque wrench I have found that I have

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.749 
torque wrench I have found that I have
to<00:02:07.130> get<00:02:07.310> up<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:08.050> 20<00:02:09.050> foot<00:02:09.349> pounds<00:02:09.860> before<00:02:10.190> i<00:02:10.460> hit

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
to get up to 20 foot pounds before i hit

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.710 
to get up to 20 foot pounds before i hit
a<00:02:10.820> thousand<00:02:11.630> psi

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
a thousand psi

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.650 
a thousand psi
and<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:14.020> after<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:15.700> every<00:02:16.240> 10<00:02:16.450> pounds

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
and then after that then every 10 pounds

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.060 
and then after that then every 10 pounds
is<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:17.020> thousand<00:02:17.740> psi<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.270> my<00:02:19.510> case<00:02:20.070> I'm

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
is a thousand psi so in my case I'm

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.670 
is a thousand psi so in my case I'm
going<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.760> have<00:02:24.090> 20<00:02:25.090> foot<00:02:25.420> pounds<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.380> get<00:02:26.560> to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
going to have 20 foot pounds to get to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.630 
going to have 20 foot pounds to get to
the<00:02:26.800> first<00:02:26.980> thousand<00:02:27.640> then<00:02:28.630> 30<00:02:29.500> foot<00:02:30.130> pounds

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
the first thousand then 30 foot pounds

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.630 
the first thousand then 30 foot pounds
is<00:02:30.810> 2,000<00:02:31.810> psi<00:02:32.490> 40<00:02:33.490> foot<00:02:33.760> pounds<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.360> 3,000<00:02:35.320> psi

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
is 2,000 psi 40 foot pounds is 3,000 psi

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.140 
is 2,000 psi 40 foot pounds is 3,000 psi
so<00:02:36.640> on<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:37.210> forth<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.410> that's<00:02:39.220> how<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.640> works<00:02:39.880> on

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
so on so forth so that's how it works on

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.030 
so on so forth so that's how it works on
my<00:02:40.420> particular<00:02:41.200> jack<00:02:42.630> okay<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.050> at<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.650> point

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
my particular jack okay so at this point

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.910 
my particular jack okay so at this point
I<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.270> torque<00:02:46.570> handle<00:02:47.080> completely

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
I have the torque handle completely

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.449 
I have the torque handle completely
untoward<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.810> completely<00:02:50.410> loose<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.100> now

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
untoward it is completely loose and now

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.610 
untoward it is completely loose and now
i'm<00:02:51.610> going<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.940> dial<00:02:52.360> up<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.959> whatever<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.380> need

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
i'm going to dial up to whatever I need

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.920 
i'm going to dial up to whatever I need
so<00:02:54.190> I'm<00:02:54.310> starting<00:02:54.640> here<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.270> I'm<00:02:55.360> watching<00:02:55.540> my

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
so I'm starting here and I'm watching my

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.920 
so I'm starting here and I'm watching my
zero<00:02:56.380> point<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.370> first<00:02:57.670> time<00:02:58.000> around<00:02:58.209> that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
zero point the first time around that

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.860 
zero point the first time around that
takes<00:02:59.260> me<00:02:59.500> up<00:02:59.709> 25<00:03:00.190> foot-pounds<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:01.540> I've<00:03:01.630> got

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
takes me up 25 foot-pounds so I've got

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.400 
takes me up 25 foot-pounds so I've got
the<00:03:01.900> increments<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.910> 10<00:03:03.910> but<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.720> fives<00:03:05.020> on

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
the increments of 10 but in the fives on

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.920 
the increments of 10 but in the fives on
the<00:03:05.680> right-hand<00:03:06.190> side<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.670> then<00:03:07.240> by<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.480> 10

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
the right-hand side and then by the 10

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.740 
the right-hand side and then by the 10
on<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.230> whole<00:03:08.470> numbers<00:03:08.890> on<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.340> left<00:03:09.610> side<00:03:09.910> so

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
that and tighten it and what that will

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.860 
that and tighten it and what that will
allow<00:03:41.590> me<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:41.980> do<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.519> when<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.820> am<00:03:43.150> going

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
allow me to do is when I am going

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.360 
allow me to do is when I am going
through<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.640> jacking<00:03:45.640> up<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:46.780> ram<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.650> don't

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
through and jacking up the ram I don't

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.280 
through and jacking up the ram I don't
accidentally<00:03:49.209> twist<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.440> loosen<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.070> up

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
accidentally twist this and loosen it up

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.560 
accidentally twist this and loosen it up
now<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.350> jack<00:03:54.010> does<00:03:54.459> or<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.910> torque<00:03:55.180> handle

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
now the jack does or the torque handle

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.630 
now the jack does or the torque handle
does<00:03:55.810> come<00:03:56.170> marked<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.070> know<00:03:57.280> which

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
does come marked so that you know which

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.000 
does come marked so that you know which
direction<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.360> put<00:03:58.750> up<00:03:58.989> because<00:03:59.739> what<00:03:59.860> will

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
direction to put up because what will

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.100 
direction to put up because what will
happen<00:04:00.070> is<00:04:00.580> as<00:04:00.790> we're<00:04:01.269> pushing<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.930> we're

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
happen is as we're pushing and we're

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.840 
happen is as we're pushing and we're
putting<00:04:02.290> pressure<00:04:02.680> on<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:03.549> torque

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
putting pressure on to this torque

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.420 
putting pressure on to this torque
handle<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.930> handle<00:04:05.440> will<00:04:05.560> actually<00:04:06.100> kind<00:04:06.340> of

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
handle the handle will actually kind of

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.720 
handle the handle will actually kind of
give<00:04:06.820> way<00:04:07.150> once<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.780> hit<00:04:08.110> that<00:04:08.920> maximum

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
give way once you hit that maximum

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.180 
give way once you hit that maximum
foot-pounds<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:10.840> have<00:04:11.019> set<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.410> at<00:04:11.530> so

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
foot-pounds that you have set it at so

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.090 
foot-pounds that you have set it at so
if<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.700> needed<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.120> go<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.239> 2,000<00:04:13.959> psi<00:04:14.440> on<00:04:14.680> this

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
if I needed to go to 2,000 psi on this

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.460 
if I needed to go to 2,000 psi on this
particular<00:04:15.340> torque<00:04:15.970> handle<00:04:16.419> I'm<00:04:16.630> going<00:04:17.140> to

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
particular torque handle I'm going to

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.340 
particular torque handle I'm going to
dial<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:17.950> in<00:04:18.100> 2<00:04:18.400> 30<00:04:19.030> foot<00:04:19.330> pounds<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:19.930> I'm

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
dial it in 2 30 foot pounds and I'm

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.130 
dial it in 2 30 foot pounds and I'm
going<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.830> go<00:04:21.010> ahead<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.370> jack<00:04:21.940> up<00:04:22.240> my<00:04:22.599> ram

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
going to go ahead and jack up my ram

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.089 
going to go ahead and jack up my ram
until<00:04:24.010> I<00:04:24.039> get<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.700> that<00:04:24.900> 2,000<00:04:25.900> pressure<00:04:26.650> mark

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
until I get to that 2,000 pressure mark

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:27.540 
until I get to that 2,000 pressure mark
or

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
or

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.659 
or
SI<00:04:27.849> and<00:04:28.210> then<00:04:28.659> what<00:04:28.840> should<00:04:28.990> happen<00:04:29.259> is<00:04:29.650> as<00:04:30.310> I'm

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
SI and then what should happen is as I'm

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.820 
SI and then what should happen is as I'm
pumping<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.330> I'm<00:04:31.419> pulling<00:04:31.659> down<00:04:32.199> on<00:04:32.470> that

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
pumping and I'm pulling down on that

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.010 
pumping and I'm pulling down on that
torque<00:04:33.190> handle<00:04:33.580> I<00:04:33.729> should<00:04:34.210> kind<00:04:34.479> of<00:04:34.599> feel<00:04:34.810> it

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
torque handle I should kind of feel it

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.950 
torque handle I should kind of feel it
it'll<00:04:35.800> kind<00:04:36.009> of<00:04:36.099> click<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.849> some<00:04:37.720> torque

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
it'll kind of click and some torque

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.749 
it'll kind of click and some torque
handles<00:04:38.409> have<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:38.620> little<00:04:38.949> louder<00:04:39.129> click<00:04:39.490> than

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
handles have a little louder click than

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.850 
handles have a little louder click than
others<00:04:40.060> mine<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:40.569> very<00:04:40.810> quiet<00:04:41.169> but<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:41.620> can

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
others mine is very quiet but you can

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.999 
others mine is very quiet but you can
definitely<00:04:42.190> feel<00:04:42.879> it<00:04:42.940> so<00:04:43.810> at<00:04:44.199> this<00:04:44.289> point<00:04:44.800> I've

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
definitely feel it so at this point I've

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.270 
definitely feel it so at this point I've
dilated<00:04:45.639> in<00:04:45.819> 2<00:04:46.210> 30<00:04:47.139> foot<00:04:47.440> pounds<00:04:47.830> which<00:04:48.069> should

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
dilated in 2 30 foot pounds which should

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.360 
dilated in 2 30 foot pounds which should
be<00:04:48.460> equivalent<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.150> about<00:04:49.330> 2,000<00:04:50.199> psi<00:04:50.710> on<00:04:50.979> my

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
be equivalent to about 2,000 psi on my

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.180 
be equivalent to about 2,000 psi on my
jack<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:52.840> I'm<00:04:52.900> going<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.169> go<00:04:53.349> ahead<00:04:53.379> and<00:04:53.919> come

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
jack so I'm going to go ahead and come

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.770 
jack so I'm going to go ahead and come
in<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.580> pump<00:04:55.539> this<00:04:55.780> up<00:04:57.240> I'm<00:04:58.240> going<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.569> pump

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
in and pump this up I'm going to pump

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.409 
in and pump this up I'm going to pump
this<00:04:58.930> up<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.409> I<00:04:59.889> can<00:05:00.099> see<00:05:00.370> because<00:05:00.669> I<00:05:00.849> do<00:05:00.969> have

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
this up and I can see because I do have

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.719 
this up and I can see because I do have
a<00:05:01.449> gauge<00:05:01.810> on<00:05:02.050> mine<00:05:02.349> I'm<00:05:02.889> about<00:05:03.219> to<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.580> two

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
a gauge on mine I'm about to the two

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.200 
a gauge on mine I'm about to the two
thousand<00:05:04.150> mark<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:05.400> if<00:05:06.400> you<00:05:06.550> heard<00:05:06.849> that<00:05:06.879> you

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
thousand mark and if you heard that you

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.149 
thousand mark and if you heard that you
kind<00:05:07.419> of<00:05:07.449> heard<00:05:07.629> this<00:05:07.719> little<00:05:07.990> click<00:05:08.319> and<00:05:08.650> I

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
kind of heard this little click and I

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.719 
kind of heard this little click and I
can<00:05:09.190> also<00:05:09.400> feel<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.569> torque<00:05:11.560> handle<00:05:11.949> drop

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
can also feel that torque handle drop

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.119 
can also feel that torque handle drop
down<00:05:13.030> ever<00:05:13.330> so<00:05:13.900> slightly<00:05:14.259> and<00:05:14.590> if<00:05:14.979> you're

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
down ever so slightly and if you're

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.430 
down ever so slightly and if you're
never<00:05:15.340> not<00:05:15.550> sure<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.629> can<00:05:16.780> try<00:05:16.840> it<00:05:17.080> again<00:05:17.460> and

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
never not sure you can try it again and

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.649 
never not sure you can try it again and
then<00:05:20.440> again<00:05:20.469> I've<00:05:21.039> got<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:21.460> click<00:05:21.849> so<00:05:22.509> at

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
then again I've got that click so at

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.170 
then again I've got that click so at
that<00:05:22.780> point<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:23.349> can<00:05:23.680> go<00:05:23.800> ahead<00:05:23.949> and<00:05:24.219> release<00:05:24.639> my

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
that point I can go ahead and release my

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.499 
that point I can go ahead and release my
jack<00:05:25.949> release<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.129> pressure<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.759> pull<00:05:28.479> out

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
jack release the pressure and pull out

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.700 
jack release the pressure and pull out
my<00:05:28.990> my<00:05:29.650> item<00:05:30.750> okay<00:05:31.750> so<00:05:32.080> just<00:05:32.349> to<00:05:32.529> make<00:05:32.590> sure

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
my my item okay so just to make sure

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.680 
my my item okay so just to make sure
that<00:05:33.039> we<00:05:33.130> have<00:05:33.279> repeatable<00:05:33.699> results<00:05:33.909> I<00:05:34.330> have

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
that we have repeatable results I have

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.860 
that we have repeatable results I have
switched<00:05:35.080> out<00:05:35.380> my<00:05:35.789> my<00:05:36.789> metal<00:05:37.210> I've<00:05:37.419> pulled<00:05:37.690> it

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
switched out my my metal I've pulled it

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.659 
switched out my my metal I've pulled it
out<00:05:37.990> from<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.409> dye<00:05:38.560> I've<00:05:38.860> put<00:05:39.099> in<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.279> new<00:05:39.460> piece

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
out from the dye I've put in a new piece

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.029 
out from the dye I've put in a new piece
of<00:05:39.699> metal<00:05:40.060> and<00:05:40.270> we're<00:05:40.990> going<00:05:41.199> to<00:05:41.289> go<00:05:41.409> just<00:05:41.800> by

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
of metal and we're going to go just by

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.100 
of metal and we're going to go just by
the<00:05:42.099> jack<00:05:42.520> or<00:05:42.819> the<00:05:43.090> torque<00:05:43.360> handle<00:05:43.690> and<00:05:43.870> not

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
the jack or the torque handle and not

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.350 
the jack or the torque handle and not
the<00:05:44.289> gauge<00:05:44.500> this<00:05:44.800> time<00:05:45.039> I'm<00:05:45.759> going<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.150> do

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
the gauge this time I'm going to do

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.059 
the gauge this time I'm going to do
another<00:05:46.779> example<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:48.159> this<00:05:48.430> same<00:05:48.729> piece<00:05:49.120> and

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
another example of this same piece and

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.290 
another example of this same piece and
again<00:05:51.069> I'm<00:05:51.279> getting<00:05:51.400> to<00:05:51.669> that<00:05:51.699> point<00:05:52.029> where<00:05:52.180> I

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
again I'm getting to that point where I

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.269 
again I'm getting to that point where I
can<00:05:52.599> kind<00:05:52.870> of<00:05:52.990> feel<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.650> I'm<00:05:53.860> getting<00:05:53.949> close

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:54.279 
can kind of feel that I'm getting close

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.959 
can kind of feel that I'm getting close
to<00:05:54.340> my<00:05:54.610> 2,000<00:05:55.240> pressure<00:05:55.419> mark<00:05:55.750> and<00:05:56.789> there's<00:05:57.789> my

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
to my 2,000 pressure mark and there's my

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.659 
to my 2,000 pressure mark and there's my
clique<00:05:58.270> that<00:05:58.710> point<00:05:59.710> I<00:05:59.860> really<00:06:00.219> would<00:06:00.400> lease

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
clique that point I really would lease

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.180 
clique that point I really would lease
and<00:06:01.000> pull<00:06:01.779> it<00:06:01.930> out<00:06:02.050> and<00:06:02.229> we<00:06:02.469> can<00:06:02.650> compare<00:06:03.009> the

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
and pull it out and we can compare the

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.209 
and pull it out and we can compare the
results<00:06:04.139> alright<00:06:05.139> so<00:06:05.529> here<00:06:05.830> I've<00:06:05.979> done

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:06.219 
results alright so here I've done

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:08.219 
results alright so here I've done
actually<00:06:06.669> three<00:06:07.000> different<00:06:07.029> examples<00:06:07.990> all

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
actually three different examples all

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.860 
actually three different examples all
using<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.650> same<00:06:08.770> die<00:06:09.219> I<00:06:09.520> use<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.300> same<00:06:10.539> exact

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
using the same die I use the same exact

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.469 
using the same die I use the same exact
pressure<00:06:11.139> setting<00:06:11.740> and<00:06:11.889> you<00:06:12.520> can<00:06:12.699> see<00:06:12.909> they're

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
pressure setting and you can see they're

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.129 
pressure setting and you can see they're
all<00:06:13.659> pretty<00:06:13.960> close<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:16.150> height<00:06:16.449> is<00:06:16.479> just

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
all pretty close the height is just

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.309 
all pretty close the height is just
right<00:06:17.409> they<00:06:17.710> all<00:06:17.889> look<00:06:18.279> pretty<00:06:18.550> identical<00:06:19.419> as

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
right they all look pretty identical as

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.110 
right they all look pretty identical as
far<00:06:21.009> as<00:06:21.310> their<00:06:22.300> shape<00:06:22.659> and<00:06:22.900> everything<00:06:23.110> goes

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
far as their shape and everything goes

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.820 
far as their shape and everything goes
so<00:06:25.120> it's<00:06:25.360> definitely<00:06:25.930> a<00:06:26.080> great<00:06:26.590> alternative

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
so it's definitely a great alternative

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.269 
so it's definitely a great alternative
to<00:06:27.520> buying<00:06:28.029> a<00:06:28.449> gauge<00:06:28.719> for<00:06:28.750> your<00:06:29.229> jack<00:06:29.529> and<00:06:29.800> the

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
to buying a gauge for your jack and the

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.219 
to buying a gauge for your jack and the
best<00:06:30.430> part<00:06:30.610> is<00:06:30.969> the<00:06:31.270> tool<00:06:31.509> is<00:06:31.719> a<00:06:31.750> lot<00:06:32.020> less

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
best part is the tool is a lot less

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.399 
best part is the tool is a lot less
expensive<00:06:32.699> then<00:06:33.699> sometimes<00:06:34.690> just<00:06:35.110> the<00:06:35.169> gauge

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.409 
expensive then sometimes just the gauge

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.339 
expensive then sometimes just the gauge
alone<00:06:35.860> and<00:06:36.270> definitely<00:06:37.270> less<00:06:37.690> expensive<00:06:38.320> than

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349 
alone and definitely less expensive than

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:40.980 
alone and definitely less expensive than
a<00:06:38.740> day<00:06:39.550> jack<00:06:39.909> with<00:06:40.210> a<00:06:40.240> gauge
