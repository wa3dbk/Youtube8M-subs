spawning you're pushing them back into
the<00:02:28.290> same<00:02:28.470> spot<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.070> keep<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.550> they

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
the same spot so they keep that they

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
keep spawning right in front of you and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.320 
keep spawning right in front of you and
it's<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.390> very<00:02:33.420> effective<00:02:33.930> strategy<00:02:34.740> if<00:02:34.920> you're

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
it's a very effective strategy if you're

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.970 
it's a very effective strategy if you're
trying<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.420> get<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.630> good<00:02:36.900> kill<00:02:37.680> death<00:02:37.950> ratio

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980

for<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.640> game<00:02:38.790> which<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.810> don't<00:02:39.959> particularly

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
for the game which I don't particularly

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.199 
for the game which I don't particularly
care<00:02:41.010> too<00:02:41.220> much<00:02:41.250> about<00:02:41.400> me<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.790> kill<00:02:41.970> death

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
care too much about me to kill death

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.520 
care too much about me to kill death
ratio<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.290> does<00:02:43.800> look<00:02:43.830> nice<00:02:44.190> on<00:02:44.400> your

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
ratio but it does look nice on your

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.420 
ratio but it does look nice on your
profile<00:02:46.530> or<00:02:46.560> whatever<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.130> called<00:02:48.980> but<00:02:49.980> I'm

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
profile or whatever it's called but I'm

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.720 
profile or whatever it's called but I'm
kind<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.420> sitting<00:02:51.630> back<00:02:51.750> here<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.380> area

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
kind of sitting back here in this area

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.430 
kind of sitting back here in this area
not<00:02:53.730> many<00:02:53.940> people<00:02:54.209> go<00:02:54.420> back<00:02:54.570> here<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.320> a

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
not many people go back here but it's a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.320 
not many people go back here but it's a
good<00:02:55.620> view<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.220> building<00:02:56.640> where<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.120> was

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
good view of that building where I was

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.110 
good view of that building where I was
on<00:02:57.480> before<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:59.100> lot<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.370> people<00:02:59.730> go<00:02:59.940> up

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
on before and a lot of people go up

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.949 
on before and a lot of people go up
there<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.860> good<00:03:02.100> spot<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.430> be<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:02.970> I

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
