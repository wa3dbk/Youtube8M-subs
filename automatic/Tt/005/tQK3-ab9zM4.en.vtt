00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.640
 this 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.640
 for this 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.740
 in the past 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.840
 then a horse 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.860
 we see a higher metric without costs 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.060
 total 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.619
 we already have the first row of scotland 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:49.700
 downward 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.750
 and the taste is no longer this mass 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.380
 for nothing normal is because they go today that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.380
 is losing 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.420
 i 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.120
 to elaborate the history of the Yankee the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.740
 things 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.310
 the light with this recipe is the outside 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.310
 or let's go
