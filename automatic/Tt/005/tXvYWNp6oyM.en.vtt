is<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:39.270> very<00:00:39.420> first<00:00:39.770> engine<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.100> place

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
is the very first engine that you place

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.600 
is the very first engine that you place
if<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.440> within<00:00:43.649> context<00:00:44.309> if

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
if you if it's not within context if

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
if you if it's not within context if

all<00:02:56.590> right<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.550> let's<00:02:58.000> see<00:02:58.240> what<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.630> does<00:02:59.580> I'm

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
all right and let's see what it does I'm

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:09.570 
all right and let's see what it does I'm
gonna<00:03:00.760> log<00:03:01.060> back<00:03:01.330> in

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.580 

yeah<00:03:10.240> bucket<00:03:10.780> server<00:03:10.990> has<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.200> little<00:03:11.500> problem

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
yeah bucket server has a little problem

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:24.930 
yeah bucket server has a little problem
at<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.310> point

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.589 

once<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.630> log<00:03:25.810> mag<00:03:26.050> in

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.190 

do<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.260> same<00:03:34.409> test<00:03:34.680> again<00:03:37.519> place<00:03:38.519> one<00:03:39.200> place

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
do the same test again place one place

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.050 
do the same test again place one place
another<00:03:40.560> one<00:03:40.769> next<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.189> it<00:03:41.219> you<00:03:41.670> see<00:03:41.730> how<00:03:42.030> it

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
another one next to it you see how it

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.660 
another one next to it you see how it
aligns<00:03:42.659> itself<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:43.560> facing<00:03:43.950> toward<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
aligns itself it's facing toward the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.119 
aligns itself it's facing toward the
first<00:03:44.909> engine<00:03:45.269> that's<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.319> good<00:03:46.469> sign<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:46.920> now

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
first engine that's a good sign so now

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.130 
first engine that's a good sign so now
the<00:03:47.189> next<00:03:47.519> test<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.599> want<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> do<00:03:48.989> is

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
the next test that you want to do is

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.589 
the next test that you want to do is
this<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.829> want<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.010> make<00:03:50.099> sure<00:03:50.129> that<00:03:50.400> it's

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
this you want to make sure that it's

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.979 
this you want to make sure that it's
it's<00:03:51.599> working<00:03:51.959> properly<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.650> use<00:03:52.890> two<00:03:53.129> chests

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
it's working properly so use two chests

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.360 
it's working properly so use two chests
place<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.140> chest<00:03:55.790> then<00:03:56.790> place<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:58.099> wooden<00:03:59.099> pipe

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
place the chest then place a wooden pipe

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.059 
place the chest then place a wooden pipe
and<00:04:00.359> then<00:04:00.510> place<00:04:00.780> another<00:04:00.810> chance<00:04:01.560> right<00:04:01.769> next

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
and then place another chance right next

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.550 
and then place another chance right next
to<00:04:02.189> it<00:04:03.920> put<00:04:04.920> something<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.519> first<00:04:05.730> chest

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
to it put something in the first chest

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.119 
to it put something in the first chest
whatever<00:04:07.560> don't<00:04:08.430> matter<00:04:09.500> put<00:04:10.500> an<00:04:10.650> engine<00:04:10.920> down

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
whatever don't matter put an engine down

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.569 
whatever don't matter put an engine down
right<00:04:11.489> next<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.290> wooden<00:04:13.290> pipe<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:14.459> then

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
right next to the wooden pipe and then

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.170 
right next to the wooden pipe and then
power<00:04:14.849> it<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:17.220> should<00:04:17.430> see<00:04:17.639> that<00:04:17.669> things

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
power it you should see that things

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.589 
power it you should see that things
start<00:04:18.449> to<00:04:18.509> animate<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:20.090> then<00:04:21.090> things<00:04:21.389> will

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
start to animate and then things will

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:30.890 
start to animate and then things will
get<00:04:21.750> sucked<00:04:22.079> from<00:04:22.229> one<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:23.370> move<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.090> next

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.240 

and<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.830> don't<00:04:31.890> see<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:33.620> let<00:04:34.620> me<00:04:34.710> put<00:04:35.040> something

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
and I don't see it let me put something

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:44.100 
and I don't see it let me put something
else<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.550> here

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.170 

well<00:04:44.560> guess<00:04:44.949> what<00:04:45.159> the<00:04:45.370> animation<00:04:45.879> is<00:04:46.000> all

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
well guess what the animation is all

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.779 
well guess what the animation is all
screwed<00:04:46.479> up<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:47.590> it's<00:04:47.770> actually<00:04:47.949> working<00:04:48.460> so
