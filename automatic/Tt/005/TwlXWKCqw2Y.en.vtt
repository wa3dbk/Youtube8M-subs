this<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.990> here<00:01:47.260> in<00:01:47.410> this<00:01:47.560> level<00:01:49.229> I've<00:01:50.229> never

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
this is here in this level I've never

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.140 
this is here in this level I've never
figured<00:01:51.640> out<00:01:52.000> there's<00:01:52.810> nothing<00:01:53.110> in<00:01:53.470> this<00:01:53.680> room

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.020 

or<00:01:58.150> at<00:01:58.210> least<00:01:58.420> nothing<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:59.080> I<00:01:59.110> could<00:01:59.380> find

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:19.520 

rather<00:02:04.050> mysterious

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:28.710 

and<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.980> get<00:02:21.250> up<00:02:21.490> here<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.130> clouds<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
and you get up here or in the clouds the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.280 
and you get up here or in the clouds the
clouds<00:02:31.470> that's<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.740> new<00:02:33.010> one

clouds that's a new one
okay<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.440> level<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:35.860> really<00:02:36.160> easy<00:02:36.580> with<00:02:37.000> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
okay this level is really easy with the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:44.010 
okay this level is really easy with the
raccoon<00:02:37.600> suit<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:42.420> can't<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.600> do<00:02:43.780> absolutely

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
raccoon suit I can't to do absolutely

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.490 
raccoon suit I can't to do absolutely
nothing<00:02:47.730> until<00:02:48.730> here<00:02:49.200> these<00:02:50.200> little

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
nothing until here these little

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.790 
nothing until here these little
platforms<00:02:50.769> are<00:02:51.400> like<00:02:51.580> balance<00:02:52.180> things<00:02:52.800> and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
platforms are like balance things and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.979 
platforms are like balance things and
then<00:02:53.950> there's<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.400> spinny<00:02:54.790> ones<00:02:57.750> trial<00:02:58.750> and

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
then there's the spinny ones trial and

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.860 
then there's the spinny ones trial and
and<00:02:59.260> then<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.470> direct<00:02:59.920> center<00:03:03.600> then<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.630> get

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
and then the direct center then you get

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.080 
and then the direct center then you get
to<00:03:05.019> them<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.470> level<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.550> isn't<00:03:06.940> over

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
to them to the level but it isn't over

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.350 
to them to the level but it isn't over
yet<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:08.739> guard<00:03:09.130> some<00:03:09.459> spikes<00:03:10.860> which<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:12.070> like

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
yet that guard some spikes which I like

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.720 
yet that guard some spikes which I like
dodged<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.840> if<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.769> can<00:03:14.980> get<00:03:15.130> like<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.340> bunch

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
dodged and if you can get like a bunch

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.039 
dodged and if you can get like a bunch
of<00:03:15.970> them<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.239> lay<00:03:16.390> around<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:19.540> can<00:03:19.720> get<00:03:19.870> some

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
of them to lay around you can get some

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.199 
of them to lay around you can get some
extra<00:03:20.290> points<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.280> if<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.489> get<00:03:21.640> enough<00:03:21.970> you

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
extra points and if you get enough you

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.789 
extra points and if you get enough you
can<00:03:22.329> actually<00:03:22.510> get<00:03:22.780> extra<00:03:23.230> light<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:29.110> next

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
can actually get extra light and next

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:40.800 
can actually get extra light and next
level<00:03:30.190> would<00:03:32.190> take<00:03:33.190> two<00:03:38.880> nope<00:03:39.880> wrong<00:03:40.150> one<00:03:40.360> it's

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
level would take two nope wrong one it's

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:57.509 
level would take two nope wrong one it's
on<00:03:46.980> whoa<00:03:48.720> time<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.870> be<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.049> statue<00:03:56.430> trying<00:03:57.430> to

but<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.370> have<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.879> hit<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:15.109> and<00:04:16.109> I'm<00:04:16.590> pondering

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
but I have to hit that and I'm pondering

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.490 
but I have to hit that and I'm pondering
if<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.519> have<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:17.850> time<00:04:18.150> for<00:04:18.180> another<00:04:18.810> level<00:04:19.169> I

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
if I have the time for another level I

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.439 
if I have the time for another level I
only<00:04:19.650> have<00:04:19.859> three<00:04:20.220> minutes<00:04:20.400> left<00:04:20.669> on<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.209> tape

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
only have three minutes left on the tape

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.110 
only have three minutes left on the tape
I<00:04:21.690> think<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.049> do

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
I think I do

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.070 
I think I do
I'm<00:04:24.120> going<00:04:24.630> in<00:04:24.889> I<00:04:26.210> don't<00:04:27.210> normally<00:04:27.539> do<00:04:28.020> that

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
I'm going in I don't normally do that

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.460 
I'm going in I don't normally do that
but<00:04:28.710> I'm<00:04:29.669> really<00:04:30.150> pressed<00:04:30.479> for<00:04:30.660> time<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:31.440> I

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
but I'm really pressed for time so I

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:42.200 
but I'm really pressed for time so I
can't<00:04:31.830> really<00:04:32.009> do<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:35.900> music<00:04:36.900> box<00:04:40.639> and<00:04:41.639> I
