00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.390
 if this little ipo in a protected place 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.189
 all the animal and plant species found there 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.489
 his only protected 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:27.429
 On the other hand 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.779
 when the spaces are outside their protected rights 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.970
 there are differences in levels of protection 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.699
 some species that are strictly protected from others 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.320
 partially protected and at the end of last year 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.560
 they are not protected at all 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.010
 but it's really unfair 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 I'm coming with me I'm going to introduce you to some friends 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.560
 it also requires a large mother-of-pearl and porcelain is that of seashells 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.510
 and ten belong to the family warrior big mother-of-pearl and zidan them 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.700
 Posidonia meadows as much to say that his friend rc lens he prefers to hide 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 in the rocks 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.910
 I am delighted to meet them 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.760
 they are both beautiful 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.910
 yes I agree with you little typos but you know he regretted a 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.860
 almost disappeared 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.700
 ah good 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.060
 but what do you mean by that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.710
 because of their pretty shell 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.229
 the men are picking up a lot to collect them and little by little 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.490
 they became more and more rare he was in danger of disappearing 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 happily nature program 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.689
 men realized in time and today it's a species 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.800
 strictly protected 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.970
 I'm glad this story ends well for grand masters 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.190
 but what about for porcelain 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.850
 porcelain and that will still be in danger today because it is only 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.780
 partially protected 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.610
 oh yes it's like me and all my family of seahorses we will continue 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.649
 to be caught and harvested to become lucky 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.900
 and suddenly we are less and less numerous 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.790
 sega us price small typo by the fin helene menard 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.910
 certainly he has three weeks 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.940
 perez gargano here are our friends rope and my wheels 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.189
 they love to hide in the faults of grax and marine 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.239
 for us too we almost disappeared men and found so much 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.009
 delicious who have sinned too much and frame to be able to eat them 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:24.599
 but now strictly protected meroÃ© corner corner is still 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.139
 in danger of extinction and some scientists are watching the evolution 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.149
 of its population 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.459
 poor rope 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.719
 let's hope it gets better for him 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.579
 omer who are these newcomers 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.519
 I was present heritage and four at kawasaki every month but 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.410
 you have marine mammals they like to live in the creeks 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.220
 kartika wall and when that girl he hinted in the sands 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.609
 but there are natural and wild habitats its too often transformed by 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.170
 the man 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.449
 who builds car parks artificial beaches or ports 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.779
 that's why the number of monk seals and loggerhead turtles 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:04.219
 greatly decreased 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.539
 and even today they are in great danger of disappearing despite their 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.219
 strict protection 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.549
 it's terrible what you tell me 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.549
 unfortunately this is the sad reality 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:22.349
 5 here are our dolphin friends whales are cetaceans 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.150
 dolphin has losers the whales that filter the water through 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:27.289
 these women 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.669
 they share their living space with the shipping ships each 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.169
 day 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.090
 he must survive the pollution 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.519
 avoid collisions with boats 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.760
 unfortunately they are too often struck and in most cases 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.760
 the shock is fatal for the animal 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:46.899
 here are the men 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:49.629
 they are really dangerous for us and for nature 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.529
 if I continue like this we will all disappear and the seabed 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.139
 will become a real desert 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.560
 you know pettiti skin 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.090
 all living things on which depend on each other he understood men 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.739
 every animal and every plant on earth or in the sea 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.739
 a very important role to play in balancing our planet 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.790
 the men of fred rutten never forget that what is destroyed it is for 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.669
 always 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.180
 but on the other hand what is in danger can we still be saved
