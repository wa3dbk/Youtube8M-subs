deeper<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.640> depth<00:01:44.970> but

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
deeper I think we have more depth but

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.749 
deeper I think we have more depth but
it's<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.170> hard<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> say<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:46.979> keep<00:01:47.369> telling

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
it's so hard to say I just keep telling

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.210 
it's so hard to say I just keep telling
the<00:01:47.880> kids<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.930> not<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> sprint<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the kids that this is not a sprint to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
the kids that this is not a sprint to
the<00:01:50.670> end<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> season<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.810> marathon<00:01:52.170> we

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
need to take our time we need to do

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.899 
need to take our time we need to do
things<00:01:54.780> right<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:56.040> need<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> peak<00:01:56.579> when<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
things right and we need to peak when it
matters<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.170> November<00:01:58.680> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
matters so and that's in November so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.459 
matters so and that's in November so
it's<00:01:59.490> all<00:01:59.670> about<00:01:59.909> managing<00:02:00.570> everyone<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.380> an

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it's all about managing everyone as an

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.050

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
when it counts but yeah I think this is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.960 
when it counts but yeah I think this is
a<00:02:06.750> team<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> trophy
