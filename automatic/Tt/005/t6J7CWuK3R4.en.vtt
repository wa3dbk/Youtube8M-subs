fine<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.049> the<00:00:10.080> variety<00:00:10.440> we've<00:00:10.830> been

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
fine this is the variety we've been

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.680 
fine this is the variety we've been
growing<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:11.549> being<00:00:11.790> grown<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.270> place<00:00:12.510> at

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
growing was being grown on this place at

growing was being grown on this place at
1730<00:00:13.610> so<00:00:14.610> hardly<00:00:15.180> in<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:15.750> innovation<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:17.250> you

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
1730 so hardly in an innovation but you

meadow<00:00:32.579> fescue<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> sort<00:00:34.559> of

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
meadow fescue here which is the sort of

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250 
meadow fescue here which is the sort of
mixture<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.070> usually<00:00:35.640> make<00:00:35.789> up<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.989> think

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
mixture I usually make up and I think

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
mixture I usually make up and I think
here<00:00:37.470> we've<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> very<00:00:38.010> good<00:00:38.220> balances<00:00:38.850> this

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180

first-class I'm very pleased of it and
they<00:00:46.590> will<00:00:47.340> get<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.550> lot<00:00:47.880> of<00:00:48.090> produce<00:00:48.329> off<00:00:48.750> this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
they will get a lot of produce off this

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.750 
they will get a lot of produce off this
crop<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.399> bloat<00:00:50.700> free<00:00:52.130> it's<00:00:53.130> got<00:00:53.460> high

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
level of protein and animals because of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.069 
level of protein and animals because of
the<00:00:56.340> digestibility<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> blade<00:00:57.840> they'll

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the digestibility of the blade they'll

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.500 
the digestibility of the blade they'll
grow<00:00:58.350> faster<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.520> any<00:00:59.760> other<00:01:00.090> known

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510

grow faster on this and any other known
forage<00:01:01.020> crop<00:01:01.290> and<00:01:01.829> yet<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.280> remains<00:01:02.640> the
