00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
lesson but not a fool you know lesson of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.429 
lesson but not a fool you know lesson of
the<00:01:59.210> within<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.329> book<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> first<00:02:01.079> unit

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the within this book so the first unit

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.289 
the within this book so the first unit
is<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> size<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.219> black<00:02:02.430> hair<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:02.939> Chapter

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
is the size of black hair and in Chapter

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.149 
is the size of black hair and in Chapter
one<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.840> says<00:02:04.049> scalp<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.649> hair<00:02:04.770> structure

one and it says scalp and hair structure
function<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.850> characteristics

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
function and characteristics

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.270 
function and characteristics
so<00:02:07.350> I'm<00:02:07.500> really
