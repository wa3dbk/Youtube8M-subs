00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.129
 good guys that are very good 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.660
 welcome back to the channel 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:07.850
 welcome to a new call of video 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.679
 duty advanced warfare covers we are 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.690
 playing a game on one of the maps 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.849
 that they already took in our old 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.430
 milks and I really liked the 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.600
 departure was quite entertaining as 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.450
 I said is one of the maps that I have not 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.440
 I climbed quite to the channel of these maps 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.800
 I really played them when 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.700
 it belongs but until then you could say 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.500
 not because I knew them more and you know 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.210
 who does not love them very much at the vanguard 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.280
 Well, he simply preferred it 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.809
 but today look has given me I have seen the 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.859
 map I say let's play to see how 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.199
 we are given the truth that they happened to 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.460
 Pretty cool game and I have to say 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.019
 I have been in wow 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.870
 I take the drone I take place men but the 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.089
 drone took them that I am addressing is not 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.069
 self run by ryan or take us to the 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.479
 control of the machine so I've 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.890
 passed the camera a little fast when 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.420
 I put it on when I put it on later 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.100
 he took twice but the second one watching him 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.800
 but it is not some time at the end but 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.780
 not only because he wanted me to have jce 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.850
 killing weapon you want but something more 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.379
 entertaining but good I wanted 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.630
 comment today I basically want to tell you 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.130
 a couple of little things one of them I'm going to 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.229
 tell you a little 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.289
 the series that I will start from advanced 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.350
 many warfare you gave me many 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:18.380
 many ideas options so they are 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.020
 good comments and also by 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.250
 twitter exposed a tweet saying good 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.450
 here that would be a like to see the channel 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.619
 I had an idea thought that 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.390
 probably also do it or 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.340
 these two series that I am going to tell you 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.439
 now you are going to have one hundred percent 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.200
 sure apart you also have to 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.659
 understanding that comes out August 19 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.830
 Beta 3 white according to what I have been told 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.750
 for playstation 4 so also from 23 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.039
 but I do want to do the two series 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.459
 I'm going to tell you what they are 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.240
 well, basically one of them is worth 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.830
 it's going to be one that's going to come back from the past 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.679
 you could say one that I have already done in 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.479
 other cases and is the one you have most 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.259
 asked because I know it's one of the 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.640
 series that we liked the most and the other one is 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.869
 one that I had thought that too 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.829
 It looks pretty cool 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.899
 because I'm pretty lucky 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.549
 what site just when I appear leaves 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.280
 to look there because I was a little 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.710
 rapping there the help waiting for me but 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.690
 good what was said 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.220
 which ones are good because what I had 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.210
 thought of doing what I'm going to do but that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.750
 I hope but I will not do it later I'm going to 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.940
 say now I'm not involved but go 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.630
 the one that takes care of which is the one that had 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.640
 thought of is a 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.740
 I had thought about how to win with all 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.600
 the guns against all all the 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.160
 pistols that are in the object fools to 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.740
 death when I was no longer there 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.740
 I was and I was still 3 hours ago 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.620
 the series of winning against all with 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.540
 all guns draw a video with 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.880
 each gun winning against all 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.830
 could be entertained will be cool 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.140
 so next is a series that I want 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.730
 that you have but by general demand 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.010
 you are also going to have one that you have 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.260
 I asked for a lot and it's 100 casualties 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.230
 try to do we are not going to play games 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.640
 I'm going to do it in 2.0, both 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.650
 the two series the two series are going to be 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.200
 in 2.0 and you are going to have games blue before 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.270
 domain to sack a for casualties or 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.490
 getting in everywhere to stop 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.990
 bust all the people who can 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.880
 games that you like, yes 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.860
 I like to play also, so 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.560
 I decided that because we are not going to 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.550
 try it let's see if it can be done 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.530
 you remember that not of these while and 100 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.200
 losses in the white two were of 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.080
 table that the famous famous famous the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.700
 famous game that is the most seen of my 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:50.269
 channel from 117 to 0 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.470
 this is not the truth so it was nothing 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.170
 bad was not anything else videos has molado 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.970
 a lot and plays and plays make balls 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.519
 short 100 casualties because they are split as 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.560
 I said it's going to sack and pinion and 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.940
 go to go kill everything I can 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.099
 also in this game we have four 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.080
 gusts that we can use because 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.819
 if we use them well and we have the 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.310
 lucky to find a pretty map 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.810
 decent since we can mess it up a lot and 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.360
 I hope you like many, you did not say 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.250
 Many of you told me, uncle, try to attract 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.419
 master time but honestly the world 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.680
 tell me this game does not convince me at all 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.709
 that is for nothing at all for nothing 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.030
 I hope the whites 3 the leagues mode already 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.680
 milk and yes you can have another 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.180
 teacher because I honestly have 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.850
 thought of many times in addition to what 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.090
 you think models you can imagine 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.770
 thought of doing or is another season of 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.960
 soon white teachers 2 but I already said 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.790
 that the last one I would do was the one I did 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.320
 since I was not going to do more for you 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.510
 white teacher 2 because I think that 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.770
 we have had enough but yes that I 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.630
 I really want something that I wanted 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.830
 but even so, I understand that many 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.820
 of you are tired of being 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.250
 tired of whites 2 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.930
 the truth then I would like to go up well 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.620
 I keep doing it, I'm still following 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.510
 up in the game but neither is 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.610
 as to mark another series so 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.140
 it's fine from time to time 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.670
 some game white but I do not see it 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:11.100
 as to make it another continues 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.540
 marta valdÃ©s so I just hope 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.850
 that white 23 we have the opportunity 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.380
 to be able to do another master time but 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.790
 until then you will not get bored 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:24.480
 I will also have regular items not 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:27.390
 worry because we are worried is not going to 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.910
 be like that but I do want to keep 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.840
 some series return such and these two 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.880
 series I think they're going to show 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.870
 quite who knows the people ended 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.180
 right away or maybe it costs me 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.680
 very much did not get to finish I hope 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.840
 that followed although I bleed in the 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.220
 damn eyes to play I think that the 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.450
 100 casualties in some way I have to 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.760
 draw yes or yes I know that in this game is 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.750
 quite difficult to get 100 casualties what 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.310
 I know I know but I'm going to try not to 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.390
 I will try because I feel like it 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.390
 will bring back a lot 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.110
 if it's almost finished as you see me 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.790
 I keep on the next drone at the end 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.770
 I think he threw it for just not 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.850
 lose it 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.110
 I'm going to throw ourselves not against the people and 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.170
 it's a lot easier to find 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.750
 the people with the drone threw the rock 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.550
 came in again or was it a game 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.170
 quite strange but I still got bloated 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.600
 to kill or is it killing me I do not know if it charged me 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.270
 in 46 or something like that I got menchÃ©n 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.180
 very much the truth very much but good 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.400
 nothing else that I have to say I have 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.520
 100 advanced supplies waiting for 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.440
 be open on the playstation 4 so 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.360
 I only say that soon you will have a 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.460
 video opening supplies too 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.840
 everything you are seeing me because 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.810
 obviously I'm just serving as plan 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.830
 a sack call of duty gta you will have fica 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.530
 also soon do not worry but 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.880
 These days you know that I take for granted 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.260
 seasons give me seasonally there are 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.520
 times that I get in case there's finally 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.690
 times we look to get a handful of 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.660
 fifa and this one that I get to upload a 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.280
 handful of you but what is it that has 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.249
 right now because I'm getting to play 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.899
 call of duty people and that's what 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:07:01.849
 I'm going 45 2 ended up loading me to last 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:04.249
 uncle that the truth is not what I 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:05.629
 I was expecting how I killed him, it's not like I 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.939
 I hoped I could step on the 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:10.389
 head that in the end you want but it's what 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:10.389
 what's cool 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.240
 but well, it almost failed 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.350
 guys I hope you die ideas or 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.820
 I hope that you mole in the new series 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.430
 that will come to the channel as I said 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.380
 it's going to be time 100 casualties and win with 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.960
 all the pipes against all be enough 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.150
 entertained in one and I think it's going 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.150
 to really plan molar and 100 casualties me 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.100
 envelops and all the series in 2.0 46 a 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.169
 2 and here 28 kids
