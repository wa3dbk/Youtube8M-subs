open this thing we just briefly show you
about<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.660> lock<00:00:37.129> as<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
about the lock as you see it's a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.479 
about the lock as you see it's a
circular<00:00:38.940> key<00:00:39.690> way<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> there's<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> notch<00:00:41.070> at

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
circular key way and there's a notch at

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.010 
circular key way and there's a notch at
the<00:00:41.550> very<00:00:41.850> bottom<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.300> we'll<00:00:42.450> talk<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:42.780> how

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the very bottom and we'll talk about how

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.529 
the very bottom and we'll talk about how
I<00:00:43.050> figure<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.789> what<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> way<00:00:45.480> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
I figure out what I think is the way to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.459 
I figure out what I think is the way to
tension<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.200> thing<00:00:46.469> using<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.250> notch

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
tension this thing using the notch

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.290 
tension this thing using the notch
inside<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.280> four<00:00:50.579> banks<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
inside of there there are four banks of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.650 
inside of there there are four banks of
four<00:00:51.690> pins<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> total<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.620> 16<00:00:53.160> pins<00:00:53.670> now

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
four pins for a total of 16 pins now

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.770 
four pins for a total of 16 pins now
you'll<00:00:54.870> notice<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.860> look<00:00:55.890> very<00:00:56.280> closely

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
you'll notice if you look very closely

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.119 
you'll notice if you look very closely
there<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:59.390> rod<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> very<00:01:01.199> center<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
there is a a rod in the very center and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.490 
there is a a rod in the very center and
that<00:01:02.370> has<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> ball<00:01:03.059> bearing<00:01:03.329> mounted<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.350> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that has a ball bearing mounted in it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
that has a ball bearing mounted in it
and<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:05.309> course<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.700> probably<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and of course that's probably so you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.750 
and of course that's probably so you
can't<00:01:07.290> drill<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.280> would<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.549> my

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
can't drill it out that would be my

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.800 
can't drill it out that would be my
guess<00:01:09.229> it<00:01:10.229> also<00:01:10.409> centers<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.369> key<00:01:11.810> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
guess it also centers the key and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.940 
guess it also centers the key and
there's<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.170> other<00:01:13.320> things<00:01:13.530> about<00:01:13.680> this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
there's some other things about this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
there's some other things about this
lock<00:01:14.220> has<00:01:14.729> an<00:01:14.909> alarm<00:01:15.090> built<00:01:15.450> into<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:15.990> I've

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
lock has an alarm built into it but I've

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.960 
lock has an alarm built into it but I've
deactivated<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.040> alarm<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.610> got<00:01:17.790> tired

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
deactivated the alarm I just got tired

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.550 
deactivated the alarm I just got tired
of<00:01:18.090> listening<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.490> key<00:01:20.700> itself<00:01:21.560> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
of listening to it the key itself this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
of listening to it the key itself this
is<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> key<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.970> round<00:01:27.240> key

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
is the key you can see it's a round key

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.060 
is the key you can see it's a round key
and<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:28.259> heavy<00:01:28.590> steel<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.549> notches<00:01:30.030> are

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
and very heavy steel and the notches are

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.850 
and very heavy steel and the notches are
ground<00:01:32.070> into<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.810> pretty<00:01:34.229> high<00:01:34.470> degree

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
ground into it with pretty high degree

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
ground into it with pretty high degree
of<00:01:34.890> precision<00:01:35.270> they<00:01:36.270> are<00:01:36.420> all<00:01:36.570> lined<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:37.020> with

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
of precision they are all lined up with

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.590 
of precision they are all lined up with
each<00:01:37.229> other<00:01:37.530> they're<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:37.890> offset<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.119> that's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
each other they're not offset and that's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120 
each other they're not offset and that's
to<00:01:39.810> our<00:01:39.840> advantage<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.530> I'll<00:01:40.650> show<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.860> why

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
to our advantage and I'll show you why

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.910 
to our advantage and I'll show you why
in<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.850> moment<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> very<00:01:43.200> bottom<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
in a moment and at the very bottom of it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
in a moment and at the very bottom of it
there's<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> punch<00:01:44.909> where<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.450> machine

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
there's a punch where they machine

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.200 
there's a punch where they machine
punched<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.189> nib<00:01:47.670> stick

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
punched it to have this little nib stick

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.480 
punched it to have this little nib stick
out<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:49.500> because<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.860> little<00:01:50.159> nib

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
out and that's because that little nib

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.420 
out and that's because that little nib
will<00:01:50.939> fit<00:01:51.270> into<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.810> notch<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.979> lock<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
will fit into the notch on the lock and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.609 
will fit into the notch on the lock and
that's<00:01:54.030> what<00:01:54.270> gives<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.689> lock<00:01:54.869> its<00:01:55.110> tension

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
that's what gives the lock its tension

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
that's what gives the lock its tension
it's<00:01:56.549> also<00:01:56.790> drilled<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.719> accommodate<00:01:58.259> that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it's also drilled to accommodate that

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.130 
it's also drilled to accommodate that
rod<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.610> ball<00:01:59.880> bearing<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.420> fits<00:02:00.869> over

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
rod with the ball bearing and fits over

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.709 
rod with the ball bearing and fits over
that<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:02.430> means<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.820> can't<00:02:03.060> grind<00:02:03.390> too

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
that so that means you can't grind too

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.999 
that so that means you can't grind too
deep<00:02:03.899> otherwise<00:02:04.350> it'll<00:02:04.590> weaken<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
deep otherwise it'll weaken the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.180 
deep otherwise it'll weaken the
structure<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> key<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> will<00:02:06.329> break

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190

it<00:02:08.190> does<00:02:08.399> work<00:02:08.610> very<00:02:08.640> smoothly<00:02:11.270> if<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.540> get

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
it does work very smoothly if I can get

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.800 
it does work very smoothly if I can get
it<00:02:12.750> all<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> way<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.050> there<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:13.800> go

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
it all the way in there we go

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.380 
it all the way in there we go
there<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:15.900> go<00:02:16.290> now<00:02:16.830> when<00:02:17.520> these<00:02:17.640> are<00:02:17.819> locked<00:02:18.150> I

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
there we go now when these are locked I

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.330 
there we go now when these are locked I
would<00:02:18.569> imagine<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:19.290> takes<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.650> total<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:20.040> three

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
would imagine it takes a total of three

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.660 
would imagine it takes a total of three
rotations<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.270> lock<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.430> locked

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
rotations to lock it now if it's locked

rotations to lock it now if it's locked
that<00:02:24.000> means<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.360> order<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.720> unlock<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.230> we

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
that means in order to unlock it we

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.160 
that means in order to unlock it we
actually<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.830> pick<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.250> three<00:02:26.610> times

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
actually have to pick it three times

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.600 
actually have to pick it three times
each<00:02:28.170> time<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.620> goes<00:02:28.709> around<00:02:29.010> we<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> pick

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
each time it goes around we have to pick

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.390 
each time it goes around we have to pick
it<00:02:30.019> so<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.410> could<00:02:31.650> be<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.800> big<00:02:32.069> disadvantage

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
it so that could be a big disadvantage

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.270 
it so that could be a big disadvantage
so<00:02:32.910> kind<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.239> looking<00:02:33.360> for<00:02:33.660> fast<00:02:33.930> ways

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
so kind of looking for fast ways

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.080 
so kind of looking for fast ways
non-destructive<00:02:35.280> ways<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.640> get<00:02:35.760> into<00:02:35.910> this

non-destructive ways to get into this
lock<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.530> when<00:02:37.650> exploring<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:39.450> first

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
lock so when exploring that the first

lock so when exploring that the first
thing<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.900> did<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.730> tried<00:02:41.730> single<00:02:42.420> contiguous

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
thing I did is I tried single contiguous

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.589 
thing I did is I tried single contiguous
so<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.500> order<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.739> SP<00:02:44.310> P<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.580> you're<00:02:45.450> going<00:02:45.540> to

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
so in order to SP P it you're going to

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.449 
so in order to SP P it you're going to
need<00:02:45.660> some<00:02:45.840> kind<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.080> tension<00:02:46.470> wrench<00:02:46.739> well<00:02:47.099> my

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
need some kind of tension wrench well my

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.430 
need some kind of tension wrench well my
first<00:02:47.700> mistake<00:02:48.000> looked<00:02:48.629> something<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.140> this

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
first mistake looked something like this

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.280 
first mistake looked something like this
in<00:02:50.190> fact<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:52.140> actually

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
in fact this is it and it actually

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.170 
in fact this is it and it actually
slides<00:02:52.800> in<00:02:53.040> there<00:02:53.190> very<00:02:53.400> nicely<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:53.940> very

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
slides in there very nicely it's very

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.559 
slides in there very nicely it's very
tight<00:02:54.420> seems<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.379> give<00:02:55.530> good<00:02:55.739> tension<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.849> it

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
tight seems to give good tension but it

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.740 
tight seems to give good tension but it
extended<00:02:58.170> too<00:02:58.409> far<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.250> get<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.489> out<00:02:59.610> now<00:02:59.750> down

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
extended too far and get it out now down

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.869 
extended too far and get it out now down
into<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.170> bottom<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:02.040> what<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.550> without

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
into the bottom and it what and without

into the bottom and it what and without
my<00:03:03.090> knowledge<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.720> spent<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.319> couple<00:03:04.500> hours

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
my knowledge I spent a couple hours

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.820 
my knowledge I spent a couple hours
trying<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.250> pick<00:03:05.519> with<00:03:05.700> nothing<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:07.349> tip<00:03:07.590> of

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
trying to pick with nothing the tip of

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.559 
trying to pick with nothing the tip of
the<00:03:07.980> tension<00:03:08.489> wrench<00:03:08.700> was<00:03:08.879> stuck<00:03:09.150> into<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
the tension wrench was stuck into the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.910 
the tension wrench was stuck into the
housing<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.170> wasn't<00:03:10.379> allowing<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
housing and it wasn't allowing the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.850 
housing and it wasn't allowing the
tension<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.060> then<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.260> cut<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.409> on<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.739> other

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
tension so then I cut this on the other

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.410 
tension so then I cut this on the other
end<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.370> seems<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.700> work<00:03:14.940> pretty<00:03:14.970> good

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
end and this seems to work pretty good

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.790 
end and this seems to work pretty good
again<00:03:15.659> it<00:03:15.780> fits<00:03:15.959> into<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.530> notch

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
again it fits into the notch

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.790 
again it fits into the notch
pretty<00:03:17.790> good<00:03:17.970> fit<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.480> allows<00:03:19.440> me<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.680> get

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
pretty good fit and allows me to get

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.220 
pretty good fit and allows me to get
some<00:03:19.950> pretty<00:03:20.129> good<00:03:20.280> tension<00:03:20.720> but<00:03:21.720> I'm<00:03:21.840> still

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
some pretty good tension but I'm still

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.800 
some pretty good tension but I'm still
unable<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.650> SPP<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.819> can<00:03:24.060> tell<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.780> has

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
unable to SPP it I can tell that it has

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.320 
unable to SPP it I can tell that it has
tension<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.590> core<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.280> can<00:03:26.760> see<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.120> core

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
tension on the core I can see the core

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.770 
tension on the core I can see the core
turning<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.319> little<00:03:28.709> bit<00:03:29.000> but<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.360> spite

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
turning just a little bit but in spite

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.710 
turning just a little bit but in spite
of<00:03:31.519> probably<00:03:32.519> three<00:03:32.909> or<00:03:32.940> four<00:03:33.180> hours<00:03:33.510> of

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
of probably three or four hours of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.649 
of probably three or four hours of
picking<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.500> not<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.489> lot<00:03:35.849> of<00:03:36.030> joy<00:03:36.269> it's

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
picking on it not a lot of joy it's

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.910 
picking on it not a lot of joy it's
picking<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.110> thing<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.349> mean<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.560> know<00:03:37.620> there's

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
picking this thing I mean I know there's

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.740 
picking this thing I mean I know there's
a<00:03:37.980> lot<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.310> pins

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
a lot of pins

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.870 
a lot of pins
there<00:03:38.960> but<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.380> don't<00:03:39.980> think<00:03:40.280> I've<00:03:40.460> even<00:03:40.580> come

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
there but I don't think I've even come

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.150 
there but I don't think I've even come
close<00:03:40.940> no-fault<00:03:41.780> sets<00:03:42.200> nothing<00:03:42.710> like<00:03:42.890> that

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
close no-fault sets nothing like that

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.070 
close no-fault sets nothing like that
nothing<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.180> indicate<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:44.630> I'm<00:03:44.840> even

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
nothing to indicate that I'm even

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.830 
nothing to indicate that I'm even
getting<00:03:45.200> close<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:46.070> picking<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.550> so<00:03:47.390> I<00:03:47.420> decided

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
getting close to picking it so I decided

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.810 
getting close to picking it so I decided
to<00:03:47.960> shortcut<00:03:48.470> things<00:03:48.740> now<00:03:49.130> I'm<00:03:49.400> going<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:49.640> show

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
to shortcut things now I'm going to show

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.310 
to shortcut things now I'm going to show
you<00:03:49.850> I've<00:03:50.240> tried<00:03:50.480> SP<00:03:50.870> peeing

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
you I've tried SP peeing

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.560 
you I've tried SP peeing
I<00:03:51.350> tried<00:03:52.070> raking<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.820> have<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> little<00:03:53.330> rake

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
I tried raking it I have a little rake

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.800 
I tried raking it I have a little rake
here<00:03:53.780> somewhere<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.290> here<00:03:54.980> we<00:03:55.040> go<00:03:55.570> rig<00:03:56.570> that

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
here somewhere that here we go rig that

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.380 
here somewhere that here we go rig that
up<00:03:56.990> and<00:03:57.170> rake<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.610> when<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.150> release

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
up and rake it and and when I release

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.060 
up and rake it and and when I release
tension<00:03:59.870> I<00:03:59.959> hear<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.170> couple<00:04:00.500> clicks<00:04:00.709> as<00:04:00.920> the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
tension I hear a couple clicks as the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.130 
tension I hear a couple clicks as the
pins<00:04:01.280> go<00:04:01.520> back<00:04:01.760> but<00:04:02.030> again<00:04:02.120> no<00:04:02.510> indication

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
pins go back but again no indication

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.830 
pins go back but again no indication
that<00:04:03.410> I'm<00:04:03.500> coming<00:04:03.680> anywhere<00:04:04.040> close<00:04:04.840> because

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
that I'm coming anywhere close because

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.780 
that I'm coming anywhere close because
of<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.110> radical<00:04:06.620> bidding<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.100> think<00:04:07.490> I've<00:04:07.610> need

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
of the radical bidding I think I've need

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.790 
of the radical bidding I think I've need
it<00:04:07.910> pretty<00:04:08.030> radical<00:04:08.660> almost<00:04:09.230> like<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:10.510> Bogota

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
it pretty radical almost like a Bogota

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.520 
it pretty radical almost like a Bogota
rake<00:04:12.800> but<00:04:13.190> there's<00:04:13.370> no<00:04:13.520> way<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:13.730> get<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.000> Bogota

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
rake but there's no way to get a Bogota

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.599 
rake but there's no way to get a Bogota
something<00:04:15.530> with<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.739> degree<00:04:15.920> of<00:04:16.340> depth

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
something with that degree of depth

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.150 
something with that degree of depth
inside<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.570> key<00:04:17.750> way<00:04:17.900> around<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:18.829> Center

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
inside of the key way around that Center

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.420 
inside of the key way around that Center
PO<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:19.730> that's<00:04:20.150> that's<00:04:20.390> defeating<00:04:20.989> us<00:04:21.430> next

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
PO so that's that's defeating us next

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.190 
PO so that's that's defeating us next
thing<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.610> came<00:04:22.820> up<00:04:23.000> with<00:04:23.030> was<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.720> bump<00:04:23.960> key

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
thing I came up with was a bump key

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.460 
thing I came up with was a bump key
so<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:24.950> machined<00:04:25.700> I<00:04:25.940> measured<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.780> distance

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
so I machined I measured the distance

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.890 
so I machined I measured the distance
between<00:04:27.830> each<00:04:28.400> of<00:04:28.460> these<00:04:28.960> ground<00:04:29.960> places<00:04:30.890> I

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
between each of these ground places I

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.880 
between each of these ground places I
machined<00:04:32.900> a<00:04:33.169> brass<00:04:33.680> rod<00:04:35.050> using<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.169> maximum

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
machined a brass rod using the maximum

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.980 
machined a brass rod using the maximum
depth<00:04:37.220> setting<00:04:37.669> that<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.090> could<00:04:38.360> find<00:04:38.600> on<00:04:38.780> this

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
depth setting that I could find on this

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.200 
depth setting that I could find on this
key<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:40.010> course<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.400> had<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.580> drill<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.060> to

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
key of course I had to drill that to

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.070 
key of course I had to drill that to
accommodate<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.900> fits<00:04:42.500> perfectly<00:04:43.040> i

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
accommodate it fits perfectly i

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.420 
accommodate it fits perfectly i
tensioned<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.229> I<00:04:45.380> beat<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.890> devil<00:04:46.190> out<00:04:46.280> of

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
tensioned it I beat the devil out of

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.420 
tensioned it I beat the devil out of
this<00:04:46.520> thing<00:04:46.669> I<00:04:46.760> again<00:04:47.470> couldn't<00:04:48.470> get<00:04:49.010> it<00:04:49.130> to

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
this thing I again couldn't get it to

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
this thing I again couldn't get it to
