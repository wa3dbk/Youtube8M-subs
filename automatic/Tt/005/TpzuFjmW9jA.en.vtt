00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
helping them confront the fears that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.380 
helping them confront the fears that
they<00:01:31.160> may<00:01:31.280> have<00:01:31.310> about<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.790> disease<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.270> then

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
they may have about the disease and then

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.150 
they may have about the disease and then
you<00:01:32.840> don't<00:01:32.990> just<00:01:33.110> manage<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.440> care<00:01:33.830> but<00:01:34.040> you

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
you don't just manage to care but you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.700 
you don't just manage to care but you
always<00:01:34.280> manage<00:01:34.870> their<00:01:35.870> fear<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.410> disease

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
always manage their fear of the disease

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.860 
always manage their fear of the disease
which<00:01:36.950> in<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.280> end<00:01:37.310> really<00:01:37.670> helps<00:01:38.180> them<00:01:38.360> get

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
which in the end really helps them get

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.320 
which in the end really helps them get
better<00:01:39.020> Thomas<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.010> always<00:01:40.310> interested<00:01:40.970> me<00:01:41.000> I

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
better Thomas you always interested me I

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.680 
better Thomas you always interested me I
like<00:01:41.780> drugs<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:43.090> went<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.210> pharmacy<00:01:44.420> school

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
like drugs and went to pharmacy school

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.110 
like drugs and went to pharmacy school
not<00:01:45.110> knowing<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.800> I'll<00:01:45.950> end<00:01:46.190> up<00:01:46.340> teaching<00:01:46.700> it

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
not knowing that I'll end up teaching it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.330 
not knowing that I'll end up teaching it
and<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.390> think<00:01:47.480> that's<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.500> real<00:01:48.710> turnaround

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
and I think that's the real turnaround

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.750 
and I think that's the real turnaround
for<00:01:49.910> me<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.450> never<00:01:51.320> thought<00:01:51.560> I'll<00:01:51.800> I'll<00:01:52.430> teach

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
for me I I never thought I'll I'll teach

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.840 
for me I I never thought I'll I'll teach
in<00:01:52.940> a<00:01:53.060> pharmacy<00:01:53.660> school<00:01:54.020> or<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:55.070> think<00:01:55.760> I

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
in a pharmacy school or and I think I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.930 
in a pharmacy school or and I think I
guess<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.180> entered<00:01:56.650> pharmacy<00:01:57.650> education<00:01:57.980> and

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
guess I entered pharmacy education and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.960 
guess I entered pharmacy education and
never<00:01:59.420> left<00:01:59.690> it
