00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
in animation called stop-motion which is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.910 
in animation called stop-motion which is
what<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> lot<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.320> Lego<00:00:55.770> Star<00:00:56.190> Wars<00:00:56.219> movies<00:00:56.910> do

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
what a lot of Lego Star Wars movies do

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.250 
what a lot of Lego Star Wars movies do
what<00:00:58.920> they<00:00:59.039> use<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.520> order<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> get<00:00:59.969> made

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
what they use in order to get made

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.670 
what they use in order to get made
basically<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.469> stop-motion<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.989> film<00:01:03.989> or

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
basically what stop-motion is is film or

overruns at 29.99 29.97 frames a second
you<00:01:12.180> essentially<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.350> record<00:01:14.070> each<00:01:14.430> frame

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you essentially go record each frame

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.590 
you essentially go record each frame
separately<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:17.610> set<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:17.880> characters<00:01:18.420> up

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
separately so you set your characters up

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.330 
separately so you set your characters up
you<00:01:18.750> set<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.290> figurines<00:01:19.770> your

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you set your little figurines your

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.280 
you set your little figurines your
little<00:01:20.549> Lego<00:01:20.850> guys<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> first

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
little Lego guys up in the first

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.740 
little Lego guys up in the first
position<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> want<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:24.030> hit<00:01:24.180> record<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
position you want you hit record for a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.350 
position you want you hit record for a
frame<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.650> some<00:01:26.130> cameras<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.610> built<00:01:27.180> in

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
frame and some cameras have built in

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.530 
frame and some cameras have built in
stop-motion<00:01:28.790> abilities<00:01:29.790> where<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
stop-motion abilities where they it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.880 
stop-motion abilities where they it
makes<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> much<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.799> hit

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
makes it much you don't have to hit

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.730 
makes it much you don't have to hit
record<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.460> does<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.790> automatically<00:01:33.500> but<00:01:34.500> all

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
record it does it automatically but all

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.200 
record it does it automatically but all
cameras<00:01:35.100> are<00:01:35.189> different<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.790> check<00:01:36.060> your

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
cameras are different so check your

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
cameras are different so check your
manual<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:37.009> but<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.159> essentially

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
manual for that but you essentially

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.109 
manual for that but you essentially
record<00:01:39.210> each<00:01:39.509> frame<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.840> movement<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:41.250> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
record each frame of movement so if you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.330 
record each frame of movement so if you
wanted<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> record<00:01:42.840> me<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.079> stop-motion<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
wanted to record me in stop-motion you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.340 
wanted to record me in stop-motion you
would<00:01:44.460> record<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.270> put<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.600> hand<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
would record and put my hand up you

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
would record and put my hand up you
would<00:01:46.470> record<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.280> frame<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:47.939> this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
would record this frame as one this

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.859 
would record this frame as one this
frame<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.140> -<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.460> frame<00:01:50.909> three<00:01:51.210> frame<00:01:51.630> for

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
frame is - this is frame three frame for

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
frame is - this is frame three frame for
frame<00:01:51.899> five<00:01:52.409> frame<00:01:52.710> six<00:01:52.950> frame<00:01:53.159> seven<00:01:53.520> framing

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
frame five frame six frame seven framing

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.630 
frame five frame six frame seven framing
frame<00:01:54.119> eight<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.509> frame<00:01:54.720> nine<00:01:55.490> until<00:01:56.490> my

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
frame eight the frame nine until my

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.280 
frame eight the frame nine until my
hands<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> way<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.780> essentially

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
hands all the way up so you essentially

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.209 
hands all the way up so you essentially
have<00:01:58.560> an<00:01:58.680> image<00:01:58.890> sequence<00:01:59.130> of<00:02:00.469> JPEGs<00:02:01.469> or<00:02:01.740> movie

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
have an image sequence of JPEGs or movie

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.300 
have an image sequence of JPEGs or movie
