00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.730 

so<00:00:04.390> I<00:00:04.420> did<00:00:04.600> a<00:00:04.630> bit<00:00:04.840> more<00:00:04.930> research<00:00:05.140> about<00:00:05.470> these

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:05.740 
so I did a bit more research about these

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.830 
so I did a bit more research about these
online<00:00:05.950> and<00:00:06.370> it<00:00:06.460> turns<00:00:06.700> out<00:00:06.819> that<00:00:06.880> you<00:00:07.420> can<00:00:07.809> eat

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:07.840 
online and it turns out that you can eat

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.070 
online and it turns out that you can eat
them<00:00:08.440> which<00:00:09.070> seems<00:00:09.370> strange<00:00:10.080> because

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
them which seems strange because

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.150 
them which seems strange because
obviously<00:00:11.440> we<00:00:11.980> made<00:00:12.160> it<00:00:12.280> like<00:00:12.629> plasticine<00:00:14.160> but

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
obviously we made it like plasticine but

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.220 
obviously we made it like plasticine but
apparently<00:00:15.519> it's<00:00:15.639> a<00:00:15.759> type<00:00:16.030> of<00:00:16.059> candy<00:00:16.990> it's

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
apparently it's a type of candy it's

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.750 
apparently it's a type of candy it's
meant<00:00:17.380> to<00:00:17.440> be<00:00:17.470> like<00:00:17.620> a<00:00:17.650> powdered<00:00:18.160> burger<00:00:18.580> and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
meant to be like a powdered burger and
