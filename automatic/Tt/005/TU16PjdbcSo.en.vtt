00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
at and I really liked this lighter sort

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.660 
at and I really liked this lighter sort
of<00:01:58.380> an<00:01:58.469> aqua<00:01:58.920> color<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.310> offset<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:01.490> did<00:02:02.490> think

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
of an aqua color to offset I did think

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
of an aqua color to offset I did think
about<00:02:02.820> immediately<00:02:03.539> when<00:02:03.659> i<00:02:03.689> bought<00:02:03.990> these

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
about immediately when i bought these

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.550 
about immediately when i bought these
just<00:02:04.649> swapping<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.249> the<00:02:05.310> red<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.939> blue

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
just swapping out the red for the blue

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.930 
just swapping out the red for the blue
and<00:02:07.560> i<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.039> would<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> great<00:02:08.729> little

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and i think that would be a great little

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.150 
and i think that would be a great little
look<00:02:09.210> if<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.080> simply<00:02:10.320> took<00:02:10.619> these<00:02:10.860> red

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
look if you just simply took these red

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.880 
look if you just simply took these red
laces<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.910> put<00:02:12.750> them<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.050> those<00:02:13.230> blue<00:02:13.530> shoes

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
laces and put them in those blue shoes

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.309 
laces and put them in those blue shoes
and<00:02:14.250> vice<00:02:14.880> versa<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:15.720> darker<00:02:16.110> blue

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
and vice versa with that darker blue

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.500 
and vice versa with that darker blue
over<00:02:16.560> here<00:02:16.730> especially<00:02:17.730> would<00:02:18.150> july<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
over here especially would july the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.210 
over here especially would july the
forth<00:02:18.840> coming<00:02:19.050> up<00:02:19.380> i<00:02:19.530> think<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.950> would<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.190> a

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
forth coming up i think that would be a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.250 
forth coming up i think that would be a
great<00:02:20.640> way<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.830> look<00:02:22.980> at<00:02:23.100> these<00:02:23.930> for<00:02:24.930> me<00:02:25.050> though
