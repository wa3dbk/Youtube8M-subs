 good enough for me as important 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.199
 especially to know data data 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.749
 real not of the things that present us 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.819
 what they show us is therefore worth not 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.880

 said this attention the call of call demo 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.500
 duty algae warfare that accounted for 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.030
 of three was around 900 p in 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.230
 swan stock 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.300
 this is taken out of an analysis 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.390
 of the call of duty demonstration back 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.420
 warfare that will show on the e3 the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.299
 game could be close to 900 p the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.060
 xbox one with a variable speed of 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.799
 frames per second whose 1 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.530
 show you can see in the source the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.840
 description has been by the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.250
 digital foundry who commented that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.329
 the game presents falls of 40 to 30 fps 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.280
 on several occasions especially in 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.890
 introductory sequences and some 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.270
 action sequences where there is a greater 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.039
 movement obviously, there is no need 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.850
 worry already that it is a version 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:45.000
 preliminary a few months ago and that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.700
 suppose that this all for 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.280
 fix it the truth is that the new 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.490
 improvements of the new graphic engine 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.290

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.750
 of the objects as well as the techniques of 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.850
 dynamic lighting the rendering of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.860
 the shadows the effect of the particles 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.800
 and other details that will be improved 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.620
 what is going to happen, well, not 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.690
 it leaves the moment this is what there is 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.980
 the lawsuit filed in call of duty 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.349

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.599
