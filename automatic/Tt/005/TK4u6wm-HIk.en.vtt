00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099

focusing<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:32.640> basically<00:00:32.759> chromecast<00:00:33.540> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
focusing on but basically chromecast is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.930 
focusing on but basically chromecast is
a<00:00:33.899> dongle<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.890> plug<00:00:35.100> into<00:00:35.280> your<00:00:35.370> TV<00:00:35.760> via

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
a dongle that you plug into your TV via

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
a dongle that you plug into your TV via
HDMI<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:37.020> turns<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.380> into<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.649> smart<00:00:37.829> TV<00:00:38.100> of

HDMI that turns it into a smart TV of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.490 
HDMI that turns it into a smart TV of
sorts<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> box<00:00:39.420> actually<00:00:39.690> says<00:00:40.230> it's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
sorts now as a box actually says it's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
sorts now as a box actually says it's
the<00:00:40.620> easiest<00:00:40.860> way<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.070> watch<00:00:41.640> online<00:00:41.969> video<00:00:42.450> on

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the easiest way to watch online video on

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.420 
the easiest way to watch online video on
your<00:00:42.780> TV<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.590> agree<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.340> you

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
your TV and I agree with that but you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010 
your TV and I agree with that but you
can<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> focus<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> video

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
can see here the focus is on the video

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990 
can see here the focus is on the video
but<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> does<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> bit<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.370> than<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.789> video

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
but it does a bit more than just video

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.790 
but it does a bit more than just video
as<00:00:48.300> you'll<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> second<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.289> when<00:00:49.739> you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
as you'll see in a second so when you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.110 
as you'll see in a second so when you
get<00:00:49.920> your<00:00:50.010> chromecast<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.700> course<00:00:50.879> get

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
get your chromecast you of course get

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.700 
get your chromecast you of course get
everything<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.840> convenient<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.500> box

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
everything in this convenient little box

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.799 
everything in this convenient little box
here<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.129> when<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.610> open<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.030> inside<00:00:54.539> on

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
here and when you open it up inside on

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.420 
here and when you open it up inside on
the<00:00:54.930> left<00:00:55.170> are<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> instructions<00:00:56.340> you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the left are all the instructions you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
the left are all the instructions you
need<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> set<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.270> first<00:00:57.449> time<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
need to set it up for the first time and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
need to set it up for the first time and
you<00:00:58.170> only<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> set<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:59.039> once<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.520> got

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you only have to set it up once I got

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
you only have to set it up once I got
mine<00:00:59.820> done<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.239> literally<00:01:00.690> about<00:01:00.840> two

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
mine done and literally about two

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.760 
mine done and literally about two
minutes<00:01:01.500> flat

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
minutes flat

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
minutes flat
so<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.460> pretty<00:01:02.670> easy<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.300> aside<00:01:03.809> from<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
so it's pretty easy and aside from the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
so it's pretty easy and aside from the
chromecast<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> USB<00:01:05.369> cable<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:05.970> power

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
chromecast you get a USB cable for power

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.710 
chromecast you get a USB cable for power
an<00:01:06.450> HDMI<00:01:07.200> extender<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.369> TV's<00:01:08.850> HDMI<00:01:09.150> port

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
an HDMI extender if your TV's HDMI port

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.690 
an HDMI extender if your TV's HDMI port
is<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:09.990> hard<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.229> reach<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.159> power<00:01:11.400> brick

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
is a bit hard to reach and a power brick

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.130 
is a bit hard to reach and a power brick
which<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> only<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> use<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> can't

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
which you only have to use if you can't

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.320 
which you only have to use if you can't
get<00:01:13.290> USB<00:01:13.710> power<00:01:13.890> from<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.310> TV<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.119> most

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
get USB power from your TV but most

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.810 
get USB power from your TV but most
newer<00:01:15.540> TVs<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.200> powered<00:01:16.890> USB<00:01:17.040> ports<00:01:17.549> anyway

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
newer TVs have powered USB ports anyway

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.100 
newer TVs have powered USB ports anyway
so<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.180> isn't<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> thing<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
so this isn't going to be a thing that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.960 
so this isn't going to be a thing that
everyone<00:01:19.530> needs<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.799> use<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.670> chromecast

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
everyone needs to use the chromecast

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.840 
everyone needs to use the chromecast
itself<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.810> pretty<00:01:22.439> small<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
itself is pretty small it's just a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030 
itself is pretty small it's just a
