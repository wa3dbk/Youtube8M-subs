mini<00:00:31.890> crusher<00:00:32.430> esc<00:00:35.719> takes<00:00:36.719> two<00:00:36.930> batteries

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
mini crusher esc takes two batteries

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.229 
mini crusher esc takes two batteries
under<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.829> silver<00:00:38.250> cover<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.980> there<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.610> one

under this silver cover to there and one

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.170 
under this silver cover to there and one
there<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.690> that's<00:00:42.809> five<00:00:43.170> double<00:00:43.829> a's<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
there so that's five double a's on and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.889 
there so that's five double a's on and
off<00:00:45.270> switch<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> motor<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.539> see<00:00:51.780> it

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
off switch here the motor you can see it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
off switch here the motor you can see it
is<00:00:52.079> right<00:00:52.379> there<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> one-eighth-scale

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
is right there it's a one-eighth-scale

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760 
is right there it's a one-eighth-scale
motor<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> could<00:00:54.930> put<00:00:55.140> any<00:00:55.289> motor<00:00:55.559> you

basically a whole other truck for parts
I'm<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> try<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.130> drive<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.670> thing

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
I'm going to try and drive this thing

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:49.140 
I'm going to try and drive this thing
for<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.450> video<00:01:36.780> at<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.049> time<00:01:37.530> so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:02:40.890 

I<00:02:38.640> don't<00:02:39.640> think<00:02:39.700> there's<00:02:40.060> another<00:02:40.270> mini<00:02:40.540> truck

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
I don't think there's another mini truck

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.840 
I don't think there's another mini truck
out<00:02:41.080> there<00:02:41.320> this<00:02:41.590> size<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.709> servo<00:02:45.430> set<00:02:45.730> up

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
out there this size with a servo set up

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.480 
out there this size with a servo set up
like<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:47.230> about<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.620> same<00:02:47.860> size<00:02:48.100> as<00:02:48.459> a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
like that so about the same size as a

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:57.330 
like that so about the same size as a
min<00:02:48.760> easy<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:54.370> shares<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.940> mini-z<00:02:55.450> body<00:02:56.340> so

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
min easy but shares the mini-z body so

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.220 
min easy but shares the mini-z body so
it's<00:02:57.550> basically<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.060> same<00:02:58.300> size<00:02:58.570> as<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> midi<00:02:58.989> z

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
it's basically the same size as a midi z

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.730 
it's basically the same size as a midi z
this<00:02:59.620> body<00:02:59.860> doesn't<00:03:00.280> come<00:03:00.400> with<00:03:00.580> it
