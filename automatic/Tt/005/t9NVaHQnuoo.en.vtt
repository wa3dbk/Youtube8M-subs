00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
least two sticks because otherwise it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.539 
least two sticks because otherwise it
will<00:03:26.299> tip<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.930> as<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.350> can<00:03:27.500> see<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:27.920> really

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
will tip and as you can see it's really
