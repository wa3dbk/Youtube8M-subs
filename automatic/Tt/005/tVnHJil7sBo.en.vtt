00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.010
 the dacia logan continues to evolve here the 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.740
 second generation of the low sedan 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.879
 cost sports a look of the most prominent 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.949
 and calender and optical blocks him 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.660
 gives a more aggressive look for 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.400
 info the front side is identical to that 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.300
 from the sandero 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.919
 the rear optics also win 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.029
 in modernity 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.039
 three petrol engines are 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.689
 available catalog is between 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.910
 other 1 1 liter decline also in 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.320
 LPG version or a small 3 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.390
 90 horsepower turbo cylinders 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.579
 the latter has left is one of the most 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.540
 nice to use even at low speeds 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.660
 everything is very good 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.610
 approval its low engine capacity 8 198 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.960
 cubic centimeters allows a 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.390
 mixed consumption relatively 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.240
 reasonable count 5.2 liters per 100 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.710
 km on road the suspensions of our 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.930
 ascain always impresses with their 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.480
 absorption power and dan him 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.710
 will pose no problem naturally the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.460
 logan can not have butter and 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 butter money 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.830
 so dynamism is really not the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.510
 strong point of self the cockpit him 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.960
 also improves the quality of 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.240
 plastics is now evolving modernity 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.530
 also invites himself to third parties 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.939
 thus the multi- function central screen 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.119
 tactile makes its appearance 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.390
 however the gps is optional 240 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.549
 euros 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.049
 our award- winning high-end finish 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.119
 offers, among other things, mirrors 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.149
 electrical settings air conditioning or 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.140
 still the front electric windows 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.609
 although it is possible to adjust the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.280
 flying high but not deep 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.460
 and the a6 the driving position is 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.539
 still too high and not very nice 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.950
 our logan has nothing to envy to 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.609
 sedans worthy of the name in terms 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.350
 roominess 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.090
 the rear seats are so 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.790
 generous and the bench accepts without 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.990
 no problem three passengers 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.920
 same for the chest that offers a volume 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.200
 of 510 liters 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.340
 for comparison this is a value 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 superior to that which we can 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.290
 find on a renault laguna or a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.390
 audi a4 for example labat ian logan 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.340
 Teyssieu 90 horses with finishing 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.530
 laureate is displayed at 10,000 1,800 euros 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.970
 diesel engines become 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.810
 accessible as for it from ten 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.810
 thousand euros 700
