00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.970 

yeah<00:00:04.290> that's<00:00:04.440> called<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.710> Dorian<00:00:05.100> scale<00:00:06.980> don't

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
yeah that's called a Dorian scale don't

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.600 
yeah that's called a Dorian scale don't
need<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.250> necessarily<00:00:08.400> know<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:10.490> but<00:00:11.490> it's

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
need to necessarily know that but it's

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.770 
need to necessarily know that but it's
the<00:00:11.700> difference<00:00:12.030> between<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.450> mixolydian

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
the difference between that mixolydian

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.730 
the difference between that mixolydian
scale<00:00:12.990> which<00:00:13.320> has<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.469> major<00:00:13.799> third<00:00:18.619> here's<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
scale which has a major third here's the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.250 
scale which has a major third here's the
minor<00:00:19.949> version<00:00:20.039> again

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
minor version again

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.029 
minor version again
you

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.249 

website<00:00:26.039> came<00:00:26.189> down<00:00:26.340> major<00:00:29.689> okay<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.750> because

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
website came down major okay so because

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.630 
website came down major okay so because
that<00:00:31.470> minor<00:00:31.919> and<00:00:32.129> major<00:00:32.219> thing<00:00:32.520> is

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that minor and major thing is

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.939 
that minor and major thing is
interchangeable<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.629> actually<00:00:33.949> it's

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
interchangeable you can actually it's

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:46.100 
interchangeable you can actually it's
cool<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:35.970> either<00:00:36.269> way<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.690> kind<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> end

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
cool to go either way so you kind of end

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:56.620 
cool to go either way so you kind of end
up<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.350> some<00:00:46.500> chromaticism<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.400> there

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.470 

okay<00:00:57.630> so<00:00:58.940> like<00:00:59.940> what<00:01:00.090> we've<00:01:00.210> talked<00:01:00.390> about

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
okay so like what we've talked about

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.200 
okay so like what we've talked about
before<00:01:00.690> less<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.860> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.700> pick<00:01:02.940> one

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
before less is more you can pick one

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939 
before less is more you can pick one
position<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.900> really<00:01:04.199> guess<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.559> know<00:01:04.739> this

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
position and really guess I know this

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.710 
position and really guess I know this
thing<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.910> able<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.330> some<00:01:09.540> nice

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
thing and be able to do some nice

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.200 
thing and be able to do some nice
acrobatic<00:01:10.680> stuff<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.250> again<00:01:11.580> using

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
acrobatic stuff in there but again using

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.050 
acrobatic stuff in there but again using
those<00:01:12.360> rules<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.750> coming<00:01:12.990> back<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> root

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
those rules are coming back to the root

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.190 
those rules are coming back to the root
let<00:01:15.060> me<00:01:15.119> play<00:01:15.300> a<00:01:15.330> little<00:01:15.570> bit<00:01:15.690> going<00:01:15.930> back<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
let me play a little bit going back and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:54.639 
let me play a little bit going back and
forth

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.260 

so<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.250> only<00:01:56.399> note<00:01:56.580> that's<00:01:56.729> changing<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
so the only note that's changing is that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.990 
so the only note that's changing is that
third<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:59.100> rest<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> notes<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.909> scale

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
third the rest of the notes in the scale

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.930 
third the rest of the notes in the scale
stay<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.539> same<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.640> scale<00:02:05.850> without

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
stay the same so that's a scale without

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.199 
stay the same so that's a scale without
a<00:02:06.090> third<00:02:06.330> in<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.080> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.409> show<00:02:07.470> you

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
a third in it just to kind of show you

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.630 
a third in it just to kind of show you
so<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.539> should<00:02:09.720> explain<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.130> play

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so I should explain that when I play

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.479 
so I should explain that when I play
when<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> improvise<00:02:12.600> I'm<00:02:13.230> thinking<00:02:13.950> about<00:02:14.190> what

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
when I improvise I'm thinking about what

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.860 
when I improvise I'm thinking about what
note<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> scale<00:02:15.090> I'm<00:02:15.420> playing<00:02:15.660> I'm

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
note in the scale I'm playing I'm

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.259 
note in the scale I'm playing I'm
thinking<00:02:16.170> about<00:02:16.440> am<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.160> roots<00:02:17.370> am<00:02:17.970> i<00:02:18.150> on

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
thinking about am I on the roots am i on

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.210 
thinking about am I on the roots am i on
the<00:02:18.390> third<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.500> fifth<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.250> seven

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
the third and the fifth and the seven

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.710 
the third and the fifth and the seven
and<00:02:23.360> exploring<00:02:24.360> each<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.750> those<00:02:24.870> sounds<00:02:26.720> what

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and exploring each of those sounds what

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.720 
and exploring each of those sounds what
those<00:02:27.900> sound<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:31.470> could<00:02:32.370> show<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.519> one<00:02:32.700> of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
those sound like I could show you one of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.009 
those sound like I could show you one of
the<00:02:32.850> things<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.150> I've<00:02:33.269> done<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:33.660> actually

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
the things that I've done is actually

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.840 
the things that I've done is actually
set<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:34.590> drones<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:36.000> loops<00:02:36.980> with<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.400> a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
set up drones or loops with just a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:50.010 
set up drones or loops with just a
single<00:02:39.360> note<00:02:39.569> no<00:02:40.500> delays

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.270 

so<00:02:51.020> I'm<00:02:51.110> just<00:02:51.200> improvising<00:02:51.620> using<00:02:52.160> the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
so I'm just improvising using the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.820 
so I'm just improvising using the
mixolydian<00:02:52.640> scale<00:02:52.940> now

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:11.360 

now<00:02:59.830> if<00:02:59.890> I<00:02:59.980> make<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.280> minor

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.950 

so<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.460> miner<00:03:12.670> has<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.940> much<00:03:13.210> more<00:03:13.480> kind<00:03:13.870> of

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
so the miner has a much more kind of

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.740 
so the miner has a much more kind of
subdued<00:03:14.350> sound

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.589 

where's<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.840> major

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.630 

so<00:03:29.319> I've<00:03:29.409> actually<00:03:29.560> spent<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.040> great<00:03:30.310> deal<00:03:30.370> of

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
so I've actually spent a great deal of

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.449 
so I've actually spent a great deal of
time<00:03:30.999> learning<00:03:31.540> what<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.950> different<00:03:33.280> modes

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
time learning what the different modes

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.789 
time learning what the different modes
and<00:03:33.730> tonality<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.359> sound<00:03:34.749> like<00:03:35.019> by<00:03:35.290> setting<00:03:35.709> up

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
and tonality is sound like by setting up

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.339 
and tonality is sound like by setting up
a<00:03:35.889> drone<00:03:36.189> I<00:03:36.489> mean<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.150> can<00:03:37.329> do<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.810> any<00:03:38.170> way

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
a drone I mean you can do that any way

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.379 
a drone I mean you can do that any way
you<00:03:38.379> want<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.769> can<00:03:38.889> use<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.010> keyboard<00:03:39.430> you<00:03:40.359> can

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
you want you can use a keyboard you can

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.440 
you want you can use a keyboard you can
set<00:03:40.780> up<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.959> loop<00:03:41.849> but<00:03:42.849> getting<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.209> know<00:03:43.329> the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
set up a loop but getting to know the

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.270 
set up a loop but getting to know the
personality<00:03:44.109> of<00:03:44.139> each<00:03:44.409> of<00:03:44.560> those<00:03:44.680> notes<00:03:45.040> and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
personality of each of those notes and

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.099 
personality of each of those notes and
the<00:03:45.370> intervals<00:03:45.819> creates<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.870> relationship

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
the intervals creates a relationship

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.250 
the intervals creates a relationship
that<00:03:48.060> enables<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.239> be<00:03:49.450> able<00:03:49.629> to<00:03:49.900> create

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
that enables you to be able to create

each<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.510> those<00:03:52.750> scales<00:03:53.079> has<00:03:53.349> a<00:03:53.379> different

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
each of those scales has a different

each of those scales has a different
emotional<00:03:54.250> tone<00:03:54.489> you<00:03:55.180> know<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.389> major<00:03:55.599> is<00:03:55.840> a

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
emotional tone you know the major is a

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.989 
emotional tone you know the major is a
little<00:03:56.139> lighter<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.950> minors<00:03:57.280> little<00:03:57.579> darker

that now beyond that I get to know these

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.229 
that now beyond that I get to know these
scales<00:04:07.449> not<00:04:07.810> only<00:04:08.199> in<00:04:08.439> each<00:04:09.310> position<00:04:09.819> on<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
scales not only in each position on the

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.360 
scales not only in each position on the
guitar<00:04:10.540> but<00:04:11.319> I'll<00:04:11.439> also<00:04:11.650> take<00:04:11.949> them<00:04:12.159> one

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
guitar but I'll also take them one

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.050 
guitar but I'll also take them one
string<00:04:12.760> at<00:04:12.879> a<00:04:12.969> time<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.540> for<00:04:13.810> example<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:16.030> a

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
string at a time so for example the a
