alright<00:00:02.070> so<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.790> my<00:00:02.939> first<00:00:03.179> test<00:00:03.389> with

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
alright so this is my first test with

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.179 
alright so this is my first test with
the<00:00:03.840> razor<00:00:04.170> IMU<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:05.759> connected<00:00:06.629> through<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> USB

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
the razor IMU I connected through a USB

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.850 
the razor IMU I connected through a USB
cable<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.849> course<00:00:09.469> well<00:00:10.469> not<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.710> course

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
cable of course well not of course

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.700 
cable of course well not of course
because<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.429> still<00:00:11.759> have<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> bluetooth<00:00:12.179> module

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
because I still have a bluetooth module

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.060 
because I still have a bluetooth module
and<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:14.250> already<00:00:14.820> tested<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:17.250> hrs

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
and I already tested it in the hrs

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.650 
and I already tested it in the hrs
testing<00:00:20.070> program<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:20.789> not<00:00:21.060> connected<00:00:21.539> it

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
testing program but not connected it

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.080 
testing program but not connected it
with<00:00:22.140> any<00:00:22.320> games<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:23.130> yet<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.580> control<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
with any games just yet to control the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.679 
with any games just yet to control the
camera<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:25.550> using<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:26.880> i'm<00:00:27.060> using<00:00:27.090> left<00:00:27.539> 4

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
camera so using here i'm using left 4

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.189 
camera so using here i'm using left 4
dead<00:00:27.720> 2<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.849> i'm<00:00:29.849> using<00:00:30.150> free<00:00:30.359> pie<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.900> thanks

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
dead 2 and i'm using free pie and thanks

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.170 
dead 2 and i'm using free pie and thanks
to<00:00:31.820> cyber<00:00:32.820> villain<00:00:33.329> who<00:00:34.140> helped<00:00:34.350> me<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:35.180> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
to cyber villain who helped me with the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.139 
to cyber villain who helped me with the
small<00:00:36.390> script<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.870> there<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.829> pass<00:00:38.550> these

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
small script in there to pass these

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.860 
small script in there to pass these
values<00:00:39.719> from<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> razor<00:00:40.379> IMU<00:00:41.000> two<00:00:42.000> left<00:00:42.780> for

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
values from the razor IMU two left for

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.119 
values from the razor IMU two left for
that<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> actually<00:00:43.500> emulate<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.820> mouse<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
that and actually emulate the mouse so

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.520 
that and actually emulate the mouse so
the<00:00:47.129> idea<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> hook<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:49.379> hmd<00:00:51.530> vr

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the idea is to hook this up to a hmd vr

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.920 
the idea is to hook this up to a hmd vr
goggles<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.160> use<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.059> hat<00:00:54.390> rack<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.809> so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
goggles and use it as a hat rack or so

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.680 
goggles and use it as a hat rack or so
let's<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.320> how<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.710> goes<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:57.180> calibrating

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
let's see how this goes in calibrating

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.040 
let's see how this goes in calibrating
it<00:00:57.899> today<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:59.940> feel<00:01:00.300> emanated<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> little

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
it today and I feel emanated a little

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.900 
it today and I feel emanated a little
drift<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.649> there<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.340> let's<00:01:02.670> see<00:01:02.820> how<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
drift here and there so let's see how it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.490 
drift here and there so let's see how it
goes<00:01:03.000> let<00:01:03.420> me<00:01:03.539> toggle<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.229> Z<00:01:05.869> let's<00:01:06.869> see

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.630 

holding<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> left<00:01:11.100> hand<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.610> can

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
holding it with the left hand so I can

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.300 
holding it with the left hand so I can
still<00:01:12.140> do<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> mouse<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.509> shoot<00:01:16.220> after<00:01:17.220> all

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
still do the mouse and shoot after all

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.910 
still do the mouse and shoot after all
this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.939> shooter<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.740> it's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
this is a shooter so as you can see it's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
this is a shooter so as you can see it's
fairly<00:01:20.580> accurate<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.330> shoot<00:01:21.570> Nick<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
fairly accurate I can shoot Nick and the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.440 
fairly accurate I can shoot Nick and the
head<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.560> wanted<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> coach<00:01:23.820> afterwards

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
head if I wanted to coach afterwards

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.090 
head if I wanted to coach afterwards
maybe<00:01:25.320> follow<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.860> few<00:01:26.100> seagulls<00:01:27.770> see<00:01:28.770> how<00:01:28.860> far

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
maybe follow a few seagulls see how far

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.000 
maybe follow a few seagulls see how far
it<00:01:29.250> goes

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.700 

the<00:01:34.670> only<00:01:35.030> thing<00:01:35.300> that<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:35.780> bugging<00:01:36.140> me<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.530> the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the only thing that is bugging me is the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.250 
the only thing that is bugging me is the
accelerometer<00:01:37.490> which<00:01:37.750> probably<00:01:38.750> hasn't<00:01:39.110> been

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
accelerometer which probably hasn't been

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.770 
accelerometer which probably hasn't been
calibrated<00:01:39.530> yet<00:01:40.010> not<00:01:40.730> correctly<00:01:41.060> at<00:01:41.240> least<00:01:41.450> I

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
calibrated yet not correctly at least I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.890 
calibrated yet not correctly at least I
know<00:01:41.900> that<00:01:42.500> North<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:43.730> good<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.510> magneto

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
know that North is good so the magneto

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.190 
know that North is good so the magneto
Magneto<00:01:45.350> meter<00:01:45.800> is<00:01:45.980> doing<00:01:46.220> well<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
Magneto meter is doing well the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.330 
Magneto meter is doing well the
accelerometer<00:01:48.980> is<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:50.120> bit<00:01:50.360> off<00:01:50.540> because<00:01:50.960> I

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
accelerometer is a bit off because I

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.670 
accelerometer is a bit off because I
used<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.490> be<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.910> starting<00:01:53.240> position<00:01:53.680> was

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
used to be in the starting position was

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.830 
used to be in the starting position was
it<00:01:54.830> was<00:01:55.070> different<00:01:55.280> then<00:01:55.640> I'm<00:01:55.790> right<00:01:56.390> now<00:01:56.600> and

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
it was different then I'm right now and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.410 
it was different then I'm right now and
I'm<00:01:56.960> holding<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.470> IMU<00:01:57.830> at<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.220> same<00:01:58.430> position

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
I'm holding the IMU at the same position

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.480 
I'm holding the IMU at the same position
or<00:01:59.540> at<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.870> scene<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.350> same<00:02:00.560> orientation<00:02:00.830> so

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
or at the scene the same orientation so

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.110 
or at the scene the same orientation so
has<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.150> do<00:02:02.270> with<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.570> accelerometer<00:02:04.120> let's

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
has to do with the accelerometer let's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.960 
has to do with the accelerometer let's
see<00:02:05.420> what<00:02:06.020> happens<00:02:06.380> if<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.740> toggle<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.400> off<00:02:07.520> for

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
see what happens if I toggle it off for

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.450 
see what happens if I toggle it off for
a<00:02:08.030> minute<00:02:09.190> point<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.310> back<00:02:10.520> where<00:02:10.760> I<00:02:10.790> want<00:02:11.120> it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
a minute point it back where I want it

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.230 
a minute point it back where I want it
over<00:02:13.460> there<00:02:13.910> Oh<00:02:14.440> dimu<00:02:15.550> all<00:02:16.550> right<00:02:16.760> toggle<00:02:17.180> it

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
over there Oh dimu all right toggle it

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.070 
over there Oh dimu all right toggle it
back<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:18.010> let's<00:02:19.010> turn<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.430> around<00:02:20.560> 360<00:02:21.560> degrees

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
back on let's turn it around 360 degrees

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.000 
back on let's turn it around 360 degrees
see<00:02:24.080> what<00:02:24.260> happens<00:02:26.350> I'm<00:02:27.350> not<00:02:27.500> turning<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.890> up

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
see what happens I'm not turning it up

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.390 
see what happens I'm not turning it up
around<00:02:28.400> correctly<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:29.620> works<00:02:30.620> perfectly<00:02:33.400> so

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
around correctly but works perfectly so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.949 
around correctly but works perfectly so
now<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.540> gotta<00:02:35.870> find<00:02:36.160> fight<00:02:37.959> the
