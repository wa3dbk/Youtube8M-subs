hello<00:00:06.000> everyone<00:00:06.180> my<00:00:06.690> name<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.840> raven<00:00:07.200> and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
hello everyone my name is raven and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.830 
hello everyone my name is raven and
welcome<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:08.040> soft<00:00:08.850> body<00:00:09.090> jello<00:00:09.360> tutorial

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
welcome to my soft body jello tutorial

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.440 
welcome to my soft body jello tutorial
and<00:00:10.020> this<00:00:10.559> tutorial<00:00:10.980> we<00:00:11.969> are<00:00:12.000> going<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.240> take<00:00:12.420> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
and this tutorial we are going to take a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.339 
and this tutorial we are going to take a
look<00:00:12.690> at<00:00:13.400> creating<00:00:14.400> cello<00:00:15.120> using<00:00:15.960> soft<00:00:16.139> body

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
look at creating cello using soft body

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.800 
look at creating cello using soft body
physics<00:00:16.710> inside<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.189> blender<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:18.540> the<00:00:18.689> first

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
physics inside a blender so the first

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.030 
physics inside a blender so the first
thing<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.050> need<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.230> do<00:00:19.349> is<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.680> need<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.920> add<00:00:20.009> a

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
thing we need to do is we need to add a

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.420 
thing we need to do is we need to add a
plane<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:21.150> there<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:21.779> three<00:00:21.960> ways<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.230> do<00:00:22.320> this

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
plane so there are three ways to do this

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.189 
plane so there are three ways to do this
shift<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.609> mesh<00:00:24.090> plane<00:00:24.710> space<00:00:25.710> add<00:00:26.490> plane<00:00:27.449> or

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
shift a mesh plane space add plane or

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.450 
shift a mesh plane space add plane or
add<00:00:29.039> mesh<00:00:29.699> plane<00:00:30.260> either<00:00:31.260> will<00:00:31.590> work<00:00:31.619> alright

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
add mesh plane either will work alright

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.790 
add mesh plane either will work alright
we're<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.790> scale<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.150> up<00:00:33.330> 10<00:00:33.629> so<00:00:34.350> hit<00:00:34.590> s

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
we're going to scale this up 10 so hit s

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.130 
we're going to scale this up 10 so hit s
and<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.220> 10<00:00:35.630> all<00:00:36.630> right<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.880> now<00:00:38.880> go<00:00:39.719> over

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
and then 10 all right and now go over

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.010 
and then 10 all right and now go over
and<00:00:41.070> middle<00:00:41.460> mouse<00:00:41.579> over<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.059> slide<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and middle mouse over to slide the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.220 
and middle mouse over to slide the
panels<00:00:43.320> over<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.360> enable<00:00:45.360> collision<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.960> our

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
panels over and enable collision on our

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.410 
panels over and enable collision on our
plane<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.920> our<00:00:47.129> soft<00:00:47.489> body<00:00:47.730> doesn't<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.239> fall

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
plane so our soft body doesn't just fall

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.840 
plane so our soft body doesn't just fall
straight<00:00:48.480> through<00:00:49.070> ok<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:50.820> let's

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
straight through ok now let's

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.470 
straight through ok now let's
right-click<00:00:51.600> r<00:00:52.460> cube<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.640> let's<00:00:54.059> move<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> up

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
right-click r cube and let's move it up

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.610 
right-click r cube and let's move it up
some<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.940> then<00:00:56.940> go<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.210> edit<00:00:57.270> mode<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> let's

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
some and then go to edit mode and let's

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.950 
some and then go to edit mode and let's
just<00:00:58.739> subdivide<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.820> few<00:00:59.969> times<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.780> more

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
just subdivide just a few times the more

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.290 
just subdivide just a few times the more
subdivisions<00:01:02.090> obviously<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> better

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
subdivisions obviously the better

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.190 
subdivisions obviously the better
looking<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.750> soft<00:01:04.410> body<00:01:04.619> simulation<00:01:05.000> will<00:01:06.000> be

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
looking the soft body simulation will be

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.060 
looking the soft body simulation will be
however<00:01:07.200> note<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:07.800> require<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.490> more

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
however note it will require way more

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.740 
however note it will require way more
confucian<00:01:11.070> time<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:13.280> higher<00:01:14.280> poly<00:01:14.610> our<00:01:15.000> cube

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
confucian time the higher poly our cube

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
confucian time the higher poly our cube
is<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.350> we're<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> go<00:01:17.460> any

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
is so we're not really going to go any

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.719 
is so we're not really going to go any
higher<00:01:17.850> than<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.920> alright<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.549> we're<00:01:20.700> going

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
higher than this alright now we're going

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.620 
higher than this alright now we're going
to<00:01:20.850> our<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:22.159> I'm<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.490> rotate<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to our and I'm just going to rotate it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.580 
to our and I'm just going to rotate it
anyway<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.840> I'm<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> go<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
anyway like and I'm going to go to the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.649 
anyway like and I'm going to go to the
modifiers<00:01:29.100> panel<00:01:29.189> add<00:01:29.700> modifier<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:30.479> I'm

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
modifiers panel add modifier and I'm

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.649 
modifiers panel add modifier and I'm
going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> add<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.350> default<00:01:32.310> bevel<00:01:32.700> i'm

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
going to add just a default bevel i'm

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.190 
going to add just a default bevel i'm
going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> set<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> smooth<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.930> you<00:01:36.930> feel

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
going to set it to smooth and you feel

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.249 
going to set it to smooth and you feel
free<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.650> modify<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.640> much<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.030> like

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
free to modify this as much as you like

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.420 
free to modify this as much as you like
all<00:01:40.259> right<00:01:40.670> now<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:42.329> back<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> our<00:01:42.689> physics

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
all right now go back to our physics

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.530 
all right now go back to our physics
check<00:01:44.430> soft<00:01:44.729> body<00:01:44.970> remove<00:01:45.720> soft<00:01:46.020> body<00:01:46.259> goal

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
check soft body remove soft body goal

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.289 
check soft body remove soft body goal
enable<00:01:48.540> self<00:01:48.780> collision<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.619> soft<00:01:49.979> body

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
enable self collision so the soft body

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.440 
enable self collision so the soft body
will<00:01:51.299> collide<00:01:51.600> with<00:01:51.750> itself<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:53.060> if<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.329> were

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
will collide with itself and if we were

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.050 
will collide with itself and if we were
to<00:01:54.479> hit<00:01:54.659> all<00:01:54.899> day<00:01:55.140> right<00:01:55.380> now<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.000> see

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
to hit all day right now as you can see

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.359 
to hit all day right now as you can see
our<00:01:57.360> little<00:01:58.170> jello<00:01:58.530> cube<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.159> falls

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
our little jello cube just falls

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:07.149 
our little jello cube just falls
straight<00:01:59.640> down<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.909> it's<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.180> slow

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.710 

all<00:02:08.030> right<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:10.120> polished<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.209> while<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.540> did

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
all right I I polished it while it did

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.509 
all right I I polished it while it did
that<00:02:11.870> real<00:02:12.019> quick<00:02:12.200> all<00:02:12.830> right<00:02:12.920> as<00:02:13.129> you<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.370> see

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
that real quick all right as you can see

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.009 
that real quick all right as you can see
it<00:02:13.610> basically<00:02:13.910> just<00:02:14.030> became<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> giant<00:02:14.840> pile<00:02:14.989> of

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
it basically just became a giant pile of

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.250 
it basically just became a giant pile of
gook<00:02:15.379> which<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:16.010> kind<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.280> not<00:02:17.000> very<00:02:17.239> useful<00:02:17.390> so

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
gook which is kind of not very useful so

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.330 
gook which is kind of not very useful so
let's<00:02:18.620> up<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.920> bending<00:02:19.580> stiffness<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:21.340> 1.5

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
let's up the bending stiffness to 1.5

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.330 
let's up the bending stiffness to 1.5
and<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:24.170> we'll<00:02:24.319> hit<00:02:24.440> all<00:02:24.560> day<00:02:24.739> so<00:02:24.799> it'll<00:02:25.190> play

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
and then we'll hit all day so it'll play

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.369 
and then we'll hit all day so it'll play
through<00:02:25.549> again<00:02:31.870> all<00:02:32.870> right<00:02:32.959> now<00:02:33.110> I'm<00:02:33.170> going<00:02:33.319> to

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
through again all right now I'm going to

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.839 
through again all right now I'm going to
pause<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.709> what<00:02:33.950> bakes<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:34.430> isn't<00:02:34.730> some

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
pause this what bakes this isn't some

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.479 
pause this what bakes this isn't some
baking<00:02:35.209> we'll<00:02:35.360> do<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.510> quick<00:02:35.660> replay<00:02:36.400> all<00:02:37.400> right

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
baking we'll do a quick replay all right

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.119 
baking we'll do a quick replay all right
so<00:02:38.060> let's<00:02:38.120> set<00:02:38.299> this<00:02:38.450> back<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.840> one<00:02:39.019> as<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:40.010> can

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
so let's set this back to one as you can

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.400 
so let's set this back to one as you can
see<00:02:40.310> it's<00:02:40.519> falls<00:02:40.849> straight<00:02:41.209> down<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.690> then<00:02:42.260> it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
see it's falls straight down and then it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.979 
see it's falls straight down and then it
kind<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.849> its<00:02:43.849> it's<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.269> little<00:02:44.510> bit<00:02:44.629> more<00:02:44.720> jello

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
kind of its it's a little bit more jello

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.069 
kind of its it's a little bit more jello
II<00:02:45.280> all<00:02:46.280> right<00:02:46.400> let's<00:02:46.579> sit<00:02:46.760> let's<00:02:47.599> set<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:47.900> up

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
II all right let's sit let's set it up

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.180 
II all right let's sit let's set it up
to<00:02:48.260> 2.5<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> outcome<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.829> is

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
to 2.5 not and the outcome of this is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.199 
to 2.5 not and the outcome of this is
kind<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.120> similar<00:02:53.329> as<00:02:53.510> before<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.970> let's<00:02:55.970> just

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
kind of similar as before so let's just

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.869 
kind of similar as before so let's just
jump<00:02:56.269> in<00:02:56.599> okay<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.230> five<00:02:58.190> seemed<00:02:58.579> to<00:02:58.700> be<00:02:58.790> the

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
jump in okay so five seemed to be the

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.339 
jump in okay so five seemed to be the
right<00:02:58.910> one<00:02:59.180> now<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.510> depending<00:03:00.170> on<00:03:00.170> how<00:03:00.290> many

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
right one now you depending on how many

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.619 
right one now you depending on how many
times<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.709> cell<00:03:00.890> divided<00:03:01.280> if<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.269> followed

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
times you cell divided if you followed

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.390 
times you cell divided if you followed
me<00:03:02.840> five<00:03:03.260> will<00:03:03.560> obviously<00:03:04.040> were<00:03:04.370> kissing<00:03:04.819> me

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
me five will obviously were kissing me

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.630 
me five will obviously were kissing me
yeah<00:03:07.989> but<00:03:08.989> note<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.470> depending<00:03:10.310> on<00:03:10.579> many

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
yeah but note that depending on many

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.370 
yeah but note that depending on many
subdivisions<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.389> did<00:03:11.569> you<00:03:11.780> may<00:03:11.930> need<00:03:12.109> more

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
subdivisions you did you may need more

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.580 
subdivisions you did you may need more
or<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:12.769> may<00:03:12.889> need<00:03:13.040> less<00:03:13.630> if<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:15.019> did<00:03:15.170> one<00:03:15.380> less

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
or you may need less if you did one less

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.890 
or you may need less if you did one less
subdivision<00:03:16.220> than<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.430> did<00:03:16.639> two<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.180> probably

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
subdivision than I did two is probably

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.839 
subdivision than I did two is probably
plenty<00:03:18.139> so<00:03:19.069> let's<00:03:19.280> see<00:03:19.340> what<00:03:19.459> happens<00:03:19.670> when<00:03:19.700> we

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
plenty so let's see what happens when we

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.440 
plenty so let's see what happens when we
hit<00:03:19.970> all<00:03:20.120> day<00:03:20.590> r<00:03:22.000> cube<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.060> going<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.239> fall<00:03:23.419> down

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
hit all day r cube is going to fall down

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.740 
hit all day r cube is going to fall down
it<00:03:23.989> bounces<00:03:25.120> all<00:03:26.120> right<00:03:26.239> I'd<00:03:26.359> say<00:03:26.389> that<00:03:26.720> looks

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
it bounces all right I'd say that looks

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.000 
it bounces all right I'd say that looks
pretty<00:03:27.109> cool<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:31.750> going<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.870> give<00:03:33.319> our<00:03:33.470> cube<00:03:33.769> a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
pretty cool so going to give our cube a

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.099 
pretty cool so going to give our cube a
random<00:03:34.549> new<00:03:35.359> color<00:03:35.630> changes<00:03:36.049> go<00:03:36.200> thread<00:03:38.109> right

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
random new color changes go thread right

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.420 
random new color changes go thread right
red<00:03:39.459> all<00:03:40.459> right<00:03:40.579> and<00:03:41.950> then<00:03:42.950> we<00:03:43.069> could<00:03:43.220> render

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
red all right and then we could render

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.520 
red all right and then we could render
this<00:03:43.639> out<00:03:43.819> and<00:03:44.030> we<00:03:44.599> could<00:03:44.780> upload<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.260> YouTube

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
this out and we could upload to YouTube

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.839 
this out and we could upload to YouTube
I'm<00:03:45.680> also<00:03:45.799> going<00:03:45.919> to<00:03:45.980> set<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.280> shading<00:03:46.669> to

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
I'm also going to set the shading to

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:54.780 
I'm also going to set the shading to
smooth<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:48.500> see<00:03:49.370> I'm<00:03:49.519> going<00:03:49.639> to<00:03:49.669> go<00:03:49.819> down<00:03:50.030> to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.550 

right<00:03:55.790> where<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.000> was<00:03:56.030> jumping<00:03:56.480> up

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.410 

and<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.650> would<00:04:02.739> seem<00:04:02.980> changing<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:03.879> material

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
and it would seem changing the material

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.350 
and it would seem changing the material
oh<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:08.400> would<00:04:09.400> seem<00:04:09.610> turn<00:04:09.879> it<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.150> smooth

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
oh I would seem turn it to smooth

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.149 
oh I would seem turn it to smooth
shading<00:04:10.720> or<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.319> material<00:04:11.739> kind<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:12.010> messed

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
shading or the material kind of messed

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.439 
shading or the material kind of messed
up<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.840> stimulation<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:14.049> little<00:04:14.260> bit<00:04:15.449> but

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
up the stimulation a little bit but

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.319 
up the stimulation a little bit but
regardless<00:04:17.729> that<00:04:18.729> concludes<00:04:18.940> this<00:04:19.269> tutorial

and<00:04:48.389> i<00:04:49.389> hope<00:04:49.479> you<00:04:49.630> enjoyed<00:04:49.900> this<00:04:50.080> tutorial<00:04:50.169> and

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
and i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.930 
and i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and
I'm<00:04:50.800> really<00:04:51.039> sorry<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.460> ending<00:04:51.729> was<00:04:51.910> a

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
I'm really sorry the ending was a

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.920 
I'm really sorry the ending was a
disaster<00:04:52.560> well<00:04:53.560> in<00:04:53.680> too<00:04:53.860> bad<00:04:54.010> I<00:04:54.039> suppose<00:04:54.370> but

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
disaster well in too bad I suppose but

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.170 
disaster well in too bad I suppose but
and<00:04:55.930> there<00:04:56.889> will<00:04:57.010> be<00:04:57.100> many<00:04:57.280> more<00:04:57.520> where<00:04:58.030> we'll

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
and there will be many more where we'll

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.080 
and there will be many more where we'll
cover<00:04:58.389> more<00:04:58.750> advanced<00:04:59.550> effects<00:05:00.550> using<00:05:00.789> soft

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
cover more advanced effects using soft

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.240 
cover more advanced effects using soft
body<00:05:01.300> physics<00:05:01.750> like<00:05:01.990> a<00:05:02.020> wall<00:05:02.380> debt<00:05:02.620> I<00:05:02.800> have<00:05:03.039> one

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
body physics like a wall debt I have one

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.000 
body physics like a wall debt I have one
planned<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:04.320> we<00:05:05.320> should<00:05:05.590> be<00:05:05.680> seeing<00:05:05.889> it

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
planned and we should be seeing it

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.220 
planned and we should be seeing it
sometime<00:05:06.370> soon<00:05:06.990> all<00:05:07.990> right<00:05:08.139> thank<00:05:08.289> you
