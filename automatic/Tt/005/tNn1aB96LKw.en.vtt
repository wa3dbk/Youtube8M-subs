their eyes send a signal to their brain
this<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:42.940> where<00:00:43.089> my<00:00:43.239> ball<00:00:43.510> here<00:00:43.809> and<00:00:44.019> so<00:00:44.650> in

where you stand and where you slide
where<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.110> ball<00:00:56.260> comes<00:00:56.500> off<00:00:56.680> your<00:00:56.860> hand<00:00:57.040> and

where the ball comes off your hand and
where<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.580> crosses<00:00:57.850> let's<00:00:58.449> say<00:00:58.629> at<00:00:58.750> the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
where it crosses let's say at the

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:01.320 
where it crosses let's say at the
bowling<00:00:59.199> arrows<00:00:59.530> in<00:01:00.430> order<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.909> get<00:01:01.030> down<00:01:01.180> the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
bowling arrows in order to get down the

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.670 
bowling arrows in order to get down the
lane<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.750> breakpoint<00:01:02.260> hook<00:01:02.470> to<00:01:02.589> the

lane to the breakpoint hook to the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.890 
lane to the breakpoint hook to the
pocket<00:01:03.100> that's<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.460> objective<00:01:03.760> but<00:01:04.540> if<00:01:04.750> you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
pocket that's the objective but if you

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.120 
pocket that's the objective but if you
think<00:01:05.110> you're<00:01:05.290> hitting<00:01:05.409> let's<00:01:05.830> say<00:01:05.979> the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
think you're hitting let's say the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.280 
think you're hitting let's say the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
second arrow and you see it cross the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.889 
second arrow and you see it cross the
second<00:01:08.619> arrow<00:01:08.799> and<00:01:09.039> someone<00:01:09.850> behind<00:01:10.149> you<00:01:10.390> your

surface<00:01:27.630> contacted<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.140> so<00:01:29.350> if<00:01:29.439> you<00:01:29.560> think

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
surface contacted and so if you think

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.429 
surface contacted and so if you think
it's<00:01:30.369> hit<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.909> 10<00:01:31.240> board<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:32.020> really<00:01:32.289> hit

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
it's hit the 10 board and you really hit

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.620 
it's hit the 10 board and you really hit
the<00:01:32.469> 12<00:01:32.859> board<00:01:33.189> kind<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.789> like<00:01:33.939> what<00:01:34.149> I<00:01:34.179> do<00:01:34.299> I'm
