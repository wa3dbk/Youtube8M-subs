a gigabyte of memory on a 8600 GT
because<00:00:19.260> 8600<00:00:19.800> GT<00:00:19.830> s<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.250> mean<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.460> don't<00:00:20.520> think

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
because 8600 GT s I mean I don't think

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.189 
because 8600 GT s I mean I don't think
of<00:00:20.939> high<00:00:21.270> resolutions<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> extra

of high resolutions and the extra
gigabyte<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.680> memory<00:00:22.710> we're<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.550> coming

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
gigabyte of memory we're really coming

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.890 
gigabyte of memory we're really coming
handy<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:24.210> you're<00:00:24.300> playing<00:00:24.480> games<00:00:24.600> at<00:00:24.779> high

handy when you're playing games at high

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.290 
handy when you're playing games at high
resolutions<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.619> however<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.430> games<00:00:27.090> it's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
resolutions but however in games it's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.740 
resolutions but however in games it's
about<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> same<00:00:27.779> speed<00:00:28.140> as<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> 256<00:00:29.750> megabytes

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
about the same speed as a 256 megabytes

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.880 
about the same speed as a 256 megabytes
on<00:00:31.730> add<00:00:32.730> something<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.530> gigabyte

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
on add something that that gigabyte

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.100 
on add something that that gigabyte
might<00:00:35.070> come<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.370> handy<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.239> fully<00:00:36.420> HDCP

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
might come in handy with it's fully HDCP

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.860 
might come in handy with it's fully HDCP
and<00:00:37.290> right<00:00:37.440> there<00:00:37.620> that's<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:39.210> an<00:00:39.510> HDMI

and right there that's that is an HDMI

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.060 
and right there that's that is an HDMI
port<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.460> 8600<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> that's

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
port on and is it on 8600 so that's

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.319 
port on and is it on 8600 so that's
gonna<00:00:44.250> come<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.489> handy

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329

thing the extra memory does help there

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.290 
thing the extra memory does help there
so<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.559> thing<00:00:52.739> really<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.219> great<00:00:53.399> card<00:00:53.760> for

on the market in fact I'll show you some
of<00:01:06.210> those<00:01:06.270> benchmarks<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> minute

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
of those benchmarks but in a minute

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.980 
of those benchmarks but in a minute
1080p<00:01:08.250> right<00:01:08.580> there<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.119> board<00:01:09.540> that's

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
1080p right there on board that's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.950 
1080p right there on board that's
awesome<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.010> they<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> VGA<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.700> DVI<00:01:11.960> 2560

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
awesome so they have a VGA and DVI 2560

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.170 
awesome so they have a VGA and DVI 2560
by<00:01:13.080> 1600<00:01:13.530> out<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> those<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.939> said<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
by 1600 out of those and like I said it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.920 
by 1600 out of those and like I said it
does<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:15.810> full<00:01:16.020> gigabyte<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.729> ddr2<00:01:17.930> but

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
does have one full gigabyte of ddr2 but

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.240 
does have one full gigabyte of ddr2 but
in<00:01:19.049> games<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.470> does<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.740> run<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.130> much

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
in games it does not run that much

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.920 
in games it does not run that much
faster<00:01:20.640> than<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.090> 256<00:01:21.689> megabytes

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
faster than the one with 256 megabytes

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.010 
faster than the one with 256 megabytes
the<00:01:22.290> extra<00:01:22.560> gigabyte<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> extra<00:01:24.020> 768

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the extra gigabyte are the extra 768

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
the extra gigabyte are the extra 768
megabytes<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> good<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.340> math<00:01:26.520> I

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
megabytes is that's a good right math I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.359 
megabytes is that's a good right math I
think<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:28.530> mainly<00:01:28.770> gonna<00:01:28.920> help<00:01:29.159> when

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
think so that's mainly gonna help when

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.850 
think so that's mainly gonna help when
you're<00:01:29.520> doing<00:01:30.090> video<00:01:30.210> editing<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.560> sort

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
you're doing video editing and that sort

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.050 
you're doing video editing and that sort
of<00:01:31.920> thing<00:01:32.070> watching<00:01:32.250> high-definition

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
of thing watching high-definition
