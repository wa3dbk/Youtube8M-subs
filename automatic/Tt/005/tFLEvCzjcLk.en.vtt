00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.450 

I<00:00:13.770> think<00:00:14.770> we've<00:00:14.890> become<00:00:15.160> a<00:00:15.220> lot<00:00:15.430> more

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
I think we've become a lot more

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.109 
I think we've become a lot more
intuitive<00:00:16.270> as<00:00:16.420> musicians<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:18.550> we've<00:00:18.850> learnt

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
intuitive as musicians like we've learnt

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.240 
intuitive as musicians like we've learnt
to<00:00:19.300> feed<00:00:19.510> off<00:00:19.690> each<00:00:19.869> others<00:00:20.230> energy<00:00:20.320> kind<00:00:21.220> of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
to feed off each others energy kind of

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.570 
to feed off each others energy kind of
in<00:00:21.400> a<00:00:21.430> silent<00:00:21.850> way<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:23.590> just<00:00:24.070> think<00:00:24.220> we<00:00:24.369> feel

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
in a silent way I just think we feel

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.660 
in a silent way I just think we feel
kind<00:00:24.850> of<00:00:24.880> excited<00:00:25.450> for<00:00:25.830> what's<00:00:26.830> to<00:00:26.920> come<00:00:27.010> like

kind of excited for what's to come like
I<00:00:27.850> feel<00:00:28.180> like<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:30.130> don't<00:00:30.280> feel<00:00:30.460> like<00:00:30.670> we've

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
I feel like we don't feel like we've

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.790 
I feel like we don't feel like we've
spent<00:00:31.180> our<00:00:31.420> best<00:00:31.630> ideas<00:00:32.020> I<00:00:32.169> think<00:00:32.349> we're<00:00:32.770> just

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
spent our best ideas I think we're just

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.979 
spent our best ideas I think we're just
excited<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.610> like<00:00:33.790> play<00:00:34.510> more<00:00:34.720> shows<00:00:34.960> and

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
excited to like play more shows and

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.830 
excited to like play more shows and
write<00:00:35.350> more<00:00:35.500> records<00:00:35.949> we<00:00:36.070> feel<00:00:36.250> pretty<00:00:36.520> good

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
write more records we feel pretty good

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.900 
write more records we feel pretty good
so<00:00:37.840> does<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.080> mean<00:00:38.199> as<00:00:38.320> it's<00:00:38.590> easier<00:00:39.010> by<00:00:39.309> with

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
so does it mean as it's easier by with

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.030 
so does it mean as it's easier by with
the<00:00:39.970> time<00:00:40.180> passing<00:00:40.600> by<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:41.350> manage<00:00:41.830> its

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
the time passing by to to manage its

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.340 
the time passing by to to manage its
music<00:00:42.489> or<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.879> emotion<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:43.690> mute<00:00:43.989> the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
music or the emotion of the mute the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.369 
music or the emotion of the mute the
music<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.890> that<00:00:45.340> right<00:00:45.519> um<00:00:46.180> no<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:46.540> well<00:00:46.900> I<00:00:47.140> think

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
music is that right um no I well I think

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.950 
music is that right um no I well I think
it's<00:00:47.710> both<00:00:47.920> I<00:00:48.129> mean<00:00:48.250> I<00:00:48.339> think<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.629> get<00:00:49.809> more

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
it's both I mean I think you get more

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.520 
it's both I mean I think you get more
used<00:00:50.199> to<00:00:50.290> certain<00:00:50.559> things<00:00:50.920> um<00:00:51.280> in<00:00:51.729> other<00:00:51.970> ways

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
used to certain things um in other ways

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.410 
used to certain things um in other ways
it<00:00:53.530> gets<00:00:53.800> harder<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:54.280> surprise<00:00:54.699> yourself<00:00:54.909> and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
it gets harder to surprise yourself and

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.960 
it gets harder to surprise yourself and
to<00:00:56.140> break<00:00:56.350> out<00:00:56.650> of<00:00:56.680> familiar<00:00:57.250> patterns<00:00:57.699> and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
to break out of familiar patterns and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.090 
to break out of familiar patterns and
that's<00:00:58.690> kind<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:58.989> what<00:00:59.080> we<00:00:59.199> try<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.470> do<00:00:59.680> we<00:00:59.860> try

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
that's kind of what we try and do we try

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.729 
that's kind of what we try and do we try
and<00:01:00.190> evolve<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:01.690> that<00:01:01.839> becomes<00:01:02.140> harder<00:01:02.589> each

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
and evolve so that becomes harder each

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.600 
and evolve so that becomes harder each
record<00:01:04.530> because<00:01:05.530> it's<00:01:05.860> it's<00:01:06.190> harder<00:01:06.580> to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
record because it's it's harder to

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.820 
record because it's it's harder to
surprise<00:01:07.120> yourself<00:01:07.299> but<00:01:08.140> is<00:01:08.229> it<00:01:08.350> important<00:01:08.770> to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
surprise yourself but is it important to

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.430 
surprise yourself but is it important to
surprise<00:01:09.310> yourself<00:01:09.430> every<00:01:10.090> time<00:01:12.659> um<00:01:13.659> yeah<00:01:14.409> I

something magical happens that I didn't
expect<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.460> where<00:01:42.700> it<00:01:42.790> makes<00:01:42.970> you<00:01:43.090> feel<00:01:43.330> that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
expect and where it makes you feel that

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.930 
expect and where it makes you feel that
you're<00:01:44.500> far<00:01:44.800> you're<00:01:45.130> communicating<00:01:45.520> with

something far bigger than you you know
that<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.800> music<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.250> bigger<00:01:48.490> than<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:49.390> your

feels like there's some sort of
inspiration<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.790> that's<00:01:55.000> kind<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.270> what

inspiration so that that's kind of what

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.469 
inspiration so that that's kind of what

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.740 
with the music um I think I think
actually<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.550> some<00:02:12.730> ways<00:02:12.790> I'm<00:02:13.120> like<00:02:13.360> less

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
actually in some ways I'm like less

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.229 
actually in some ways I'm like less
critical<00:02:14.200> I'm<00:02:15.160> it's<00:02:15.670> kind<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.060> hard

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
critical I'm it's kind of a hard

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.610 
critical I'm it's kind of a hard
question<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.630> answer<00:02:16.750> because<00:02:17.110> it's<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.410> bit<00:02:17.530> of

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
question to answer because it's a bit of

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.710 
question to answer because it's a bit of
both<00:02:17.830> because<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.970> beginning<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.450> was<00:02:19.569> like

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
both because in the beginning I was like

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.030 
both because in the beginning I was like
very<00:02:20.040> tough<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.540> controlling<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.500> obsessive

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
very tough and controlling and obsessive

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.100 
very tough and controlling and obsessive
and<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.180> think<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.630> things<00:02:25.870> I've<00:02:26.080> learned

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
and then I think the things I've learned

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.080 
and then I think the things I've learned
is<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.590> actually<00:02:27.160> in<00:02:27.430> order<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.819> make

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
is that actually in order to make

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.790 
is that actually in order to make
something<00:02:28.330> better<00:02:28.540> sometimes<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.560> need<00:02:29.680> to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
something better sometimes you need to

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.470 
something better sometimes you need to
open<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.160> window<00:02:30.310> or<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.910> need<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.150> go<00:02:31.269> for<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
open a window or you need to go for a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.630 
open a window or you need to go for a
walk<00:02:31.780> or<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.530> need<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.830> learn<00:02:33.099> when<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.370> leave

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
walk or you need to learn when to leave

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.520 
walk or you need to learn when to leave
something<00:02:33.880> alone<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:37.299> not<00:02:37.510> force<00:02:37.870> not

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
something alone and to not force not

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.170 
something alone and to not force not
force<00:02:38.830> things<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.310> allow<00:02:39.580> things<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:39.970> flow

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
force things to allow things to flow

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.800 
force things to allow things to flow
naturally<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.709> in<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.730> way<00:02:42.790> I'm<00:02:43.239> easier<00:02:43.720> on

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
naturally so in that way I'm easier on

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.900 
naturally so in that way I'm easier on
myself<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:44.380> don't<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.980> don't<00:02:45.220> get<00:02:45.459> angry<00:02:45.640> at

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
myself I don't like I don't get angry at

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.289 
myself I don't like I don't get angry at
myself<00:02:46.060> if<00:02:46.480> something<00:02:46.660> isn't<00:02:46.930> working<00:02:47.080> i<00:02:47.590> just

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
myself if something isn't working i just

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.449 
myself if something isn't working i just
realized<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.420> it's<00:02:49.599> to<00:02:49.720> do<00:02:49.900> with<00:02:50.459> something

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
realized that it's to do with something

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.789 
realized that it's to do with something
intangible<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.720> i<00:02:52.780> can't<00:02:53.049> control<00:02:53.260> so

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
intangible that i can't control so

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:54.870 
intangible that i can't control so
basically<00:02:54.040> I've<00:02:54.160> learned<00:02:54.400> what<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.640> can

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
basically I've learned what I can

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.699 
basically I've learned what I can
control<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.420> why<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.540> can't<00:02:55.900> control<00:02:56.260> better

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
control and why I can't control better

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.069 
control and why I can't control better
and<00:02:57.519> when<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.700> was<00:02:57.849> younger<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.150> got<00:02:58.269> they<00:02:58.720> get

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
and when I was younger I got they get

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.110 
and when I was younger I got they get
frustrated<00:02:59.290> with<00:02:59.650> myself<00:02:59.799> because<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.579> thought

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
frustrated with myself because I thought

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.949 
frustrated with myself because I thought
I<00:03:01.150> could<00:03:01.450> control<00:03:01.569> everything<00:03:02.110> or<00:03:02.940> create

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
I could control everything or create

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.080 
I could control everything or create
endlessly<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.170> know<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:06.250> not<00:03:06.459> it's<00:03:06.940> not

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
endlessly you know and it's not it's not

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.590 
endlessly you know and it's not it's not
like<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.299> life's<00:03:07.690> not<00:03:07.870> like<00:03:12.180> food<00:03:13.180> wise<00:03:13.359> s

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
like that life's not like food wise s
