 Hello, my name is franÃ§ois gauthier 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.099
 topless mixologist and who shows us 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.389
 full of cocktail recipes 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.849
 he shows us this time a recipe 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.469
 completely alcohol-free regressive based 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.379
 of cotton candy you'll see done that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.820
 to achieve the magic and cocktails so 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.369
 a creation of liquid chef paris he 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.560
 we simply need to beard to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.449
 daddy so this one we learn it 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.250
 taxes for a practical question on 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.199
 can we find the beard pots at 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.630
 daddy in the cinemas or in the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:40.190
 luxury supermarkets and we need to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.030
 sparkling water and a cocktail glass 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 in the cocktail glass 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.920
 we are going to place cotton candy in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.449
 tip shape so try not too much 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.949
 do not touch her too much 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.640
 because it's sugar so its fauna 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.640
 very quickly 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 the most important thing is not to exceed 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.750
 the edges of the glass then it remains to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.490
 uncap the sparkling water then pour on 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.450
 the top of the cotton candy that will 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.750
 disappear and flavored our water 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.750
 gas 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.990
 a very simple decoration with a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.550
 strawberry and the head of a mint stalk 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.900
 we will cut the strawberry in half 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.830
 parts on the top of the strawberry we 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 let's go make a little hole that goes 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.890
 allow us to plant the head of the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.890
 mint 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.480
 then there is only 1.6 left and the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.690
 strawberry along the glass for an effect 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.690
 guaranteed
