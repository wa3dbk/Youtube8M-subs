00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.420
 hello everyone today means show you 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:12.010
 how to port the handbrake on gazelles 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.720
 but spreading the pads means doing it 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.170
 all on the viewing pit 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:21.750
 either on the lift so as to climb 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.550
 to the bottom of the car to start means a 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.020
 weaken the parking brake cable 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.970
 it is not exactly that we weaken 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.330
 not much there literally a centimeter to 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.330
 fame 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:43.559
 so now we remove means anthers here with 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.559
 basic disk 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.289
 here we see a fever and as the center so 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:57.460
 head 17 means unscrew 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.100
 locking nut like that 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.149
 lock nut unscrewed 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.409
 now head for 9 euros. we breed 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.340
 pads to the side 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:13.179
 tightening that is clockwise 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.090
 we breed here and developed and the return 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:20.560
 head 17 is also tightened 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.420
 clockwise and be sure to check 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.840
 so that we don't have or pads to 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.590
 the car rolled the same thing we do with 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:36.459
 the other hand the main thing is not to overdo it and 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:40.419
 so that the pads are not jammed so here 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:44.310
 now after we have developed the pads 

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:44.310
 you can tighten the cable 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.090
 in fact, that's the whole procedure 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.140
 average it takes five minutes to all 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.740
