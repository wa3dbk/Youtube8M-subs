this<00:01:06.150> gameplay<00:01:06.390> looks<00:01:06.810> too<00:01:07.200> similar<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:08.340> our

reserve<00:01:09.000> judgment<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:09.840> is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
reserve judgment because there is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
reserve judgment because there is
something<00:01:10.640> interesting<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
something interesting about it and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
something interesting about it and
that's<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> fact<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.369> during<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.610> fighting

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that's the fact that during the fighting

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.710 
that's the fact that during the fighting
it<00:01:15.119> looks<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:17.060> lot<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> things<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.509> sort

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it looks like a lot of things are sort

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.999 
it looks like a lot of things are sort
of<00:01:18.750> happening<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.470> could<00:01:19.770> mean<00:01:19.799> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of happening and that could mean that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.249 
of happening and that could mean that
there's<00:01:20.369> maybe<00:01:20.939> two<00:01:21.299> button<00:01:21.600> combinations

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
there's maybe two button combinations

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.210 
there's maybe two button combinations
similar<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.009> 10k<00:01:23.909> EG<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.650> raging<00:01:25.650> blast<00:01:25.890> as

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
similar to 10k EG or raging blast as

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.130 
similar to 10k EG or raging blast as
opposed<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.210> button<00:01:27.450> combo<00:01:27.930> system

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
opposed to the one button combo system

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.069 
opposed to the one button combo system
that<00:01:28.890> was<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.220> battle<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.640> z<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.479> pretty

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that was in battle of z that I pretty

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.060 
that was in battle of z that I pretty
much<00:01:31.229> despised<00:01:31.950> um<00:01:32.720> but<00:01:33.720> at<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.470> point<00:01:34.799> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
much despised um but at this point it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.910 
much despised um but at this point it
could<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.579> either<00:01:35.790> or<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.479> could<00:01:37.200> go<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> bind

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
could be either or it could go to bind

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.069 
could be either or it could go to bind
it<00:01:38.100> could<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.610> button<00:01:38.909> who<00:01:39.180> knows<00:01:39.420> one

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it could be one button who knows one

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.899 
it could be one button who knows one
thing<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.650> notice<00:01:40.860> also<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> look<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.330 
points I triangle square circle and X
will<00:01:47.820> pop<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.619> whatever<00:01:49.619> they<00:01:49.770> press<00:01:50.009> will

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
will pop up and whatever they press will

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.819 
will pop up and whatever they press will
do<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> corresponding<00:01:51.479> move<00:01:51.659> now<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.680> can

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
do a corresponding move now this can

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.380 
do a corresponding move now this can
either<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.880> could<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.149> few<00:01:54.360> things

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
either be this could be a few things

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.020 
either be this could be a few things
actually<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.049> could<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.409> um<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> other

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
actually this could be um how the other

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.569 
actually this could be um how the other
games<00:01:57.299> used<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> we're<00:01:58.860> two<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
games used to do it we're two of the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.880 
games used to do it we're two of the
abilities<00:02:00.090> would<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.719> solar<00:02:01.469> flare<00:02:01.860> or

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
abilities would be like solar flare or

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.580 
abilities would be like solar flare or
instant<00:02:02.549> transmission<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.320> other

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
instant transmission and then the other

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950 
instant transmission and then the other
two<00:02:04.770> abilities<00:02:05.310> would<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.960> Kamehameha

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
two abilities would be like Kamehameha

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.770 
two abilities would be like Kamehameha
or<00:02:07.610> Gallic<00:02:08.610> gun<00:02:08.819> or<00:02:09.060> something<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
or Gallic gun or something like that and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.360 
or Gallic gun or something like that and
that<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.319> almost

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
that is almost

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.009 
that is almost
proven<00:02:11.819> because<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.569> see<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.840> there<00:02:12.989> is

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
proven because you see that there is

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.570 
proven because you see that there is
three<00:02:13.409> meters<00:02:13.620> there's<00:02:14.040> obviously<00:02:14.430> the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
three meters there's obviously the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.330 
three meters there's obviously the
health<00:02:14.819> meter<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.200> first<00:02:16.409> big<00:02:16.830> meter

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
health meter that is the first big meter

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.920 
health meter that is the first big meter
at<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> top<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.120> then<00:02:18.209> there's<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.569> below<00:02:18.900> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
at the top and then there's one below it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.680 
at the top and then there's one below it
and<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:19.319> there's<00:02:19.470> one<00:02:19.650> below<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:20.909> in

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
and then there's one below that so in

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.050 
and then there's one below that so in
the<00:02:21.750> old<00:02:21.900> games<00:02:22.530> how<00:02:23.159> it<00:02:23.340> would<00:02:23.489> be<00:02:23.519> was<00:02:23.879> you

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the old games how it would be was you

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.390 
the old games how it would be was you
would<00:02:24.180> get<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.390> little<00:02:24.900> separate<00:02:25.799> meter<00:02:26.069> thing

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
would get a little separate meter thing

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.190 
would get a little separate meter thing
that<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.730> would<00:02:26.819> use<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.060> Ultimates<00:02:27.989> and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
that you would use for Ultimates and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.140 
that you would use for Ultimates and
also<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.860> could<00:02:28.950> consume<00:02:29.459> those<00:02:29.819> little

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
also you could consume those little

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.470 
also you could consume those little
charges<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.750> would<00:02:30.870> get<00:02:30.989> form<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:32.480> use

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
charges that you would get form to use

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.729 
charges that you would get form to use
stuff<00:02:33.840> like<00:02:33.930> solar<00:02:34.530> flare<00:02:34.890> or<00:02:36.170> kaio-ken<00:02:37.170> or

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
stuff like solar flare or kaio-ken or

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.309 
stuff like solar flare or kaio-ken or
certain<00:02:38.640> power<00:02:38.879> up<00:02:39.150> stuff<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.110> could<00:02:40.290> be

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
certain power up stuff so it could be

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.949 
certain power up stuff so it could be
going<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.739> route<00:02:40.950> as<00:02:41.129> well<00:02:41.159> um<00:02:41.579> in<00:02:42.299> general

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
going that route as well um in general

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
going that route as well um in general

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
status but I should have known that that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.160 
status but I should have known that that
really<00:03:02.579> wasn't<00:03:02.849> going<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.120> happen<00:03:03.269> I'm<00:03:03.780> really

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
really wasn't going to happen I'm really

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.440 
really wasn't going to happen I'm really
curious<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.159> what<00:03:05.340> those<00:03:05.519> four<00:03:06.000> abilities

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
curious as to what those four abilities

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.940 
curious as to what those four abilities
are<00:03:06.599> on<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.780> bottom<00:03:07.079> right<00:03:07.200> corner<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.620> think

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
are on the bottom right corner I think

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.069 
are on the bottom right corner I think
there<00:03:08.129> they<00:03:08.489> are<00:03:08.519> going<00:03:09.359> to<00:03:09.480> be<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.900> two

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
there they are going to be the two

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.949 
there they are going to be the two
abilities<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.980> would<00:03:11.220> use<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:12.540> I

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
abilities that you would use that I

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.330 
abilities that you would use that I
mentioned<00:03:13.440> before<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.159> to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
mentioned before and then like to

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.240 
mentioned before and then like to
comment<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:14.819> a<00:03:15.180> combat<00:03:15.510> mahalo<00:03:16.079> gun<00:03:16.380> stuff

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
comment like a combat mahalo gun stuff

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.490 
comment like a combat mahalo gun stuff
like<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.669> then<00:03:17.970> I'm<00:03:18.389> I<00:03:19.139> don't<00:03:19.349> think

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
like that and then I'm I don't think

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.809 
like that and then I'm I don't think
we've<00:03:19.590> seen<00:03:19.620> an<00:03:19.889> ultimate<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.459> guess<00:03:20.639> this

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
we've seen an ultimate I guess this

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.509 
we've seen an ultimate I guess this
would<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.269> ultimate<00:03:21.410> cancel<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:23.190> I

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
would be the ultimate cancel that but I

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.729 
would be the ultimate cancel that but I
don't<00:03:24.510> know<00:03:24.599> that's<00:03:25.049> one<00:03:25.260> thing<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:25.410> also

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
don't know that's one thing that also

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.229 
don't know that's one thing that also
threw<00:03:25.950> me<00:03:26.069> off<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.430> hope<00:03:26.730> that's<00:03:26.970> not<00:03:27.030> an

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
threw me off I hope that's not an

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.360 
threw me off I hope that's not an
ultimate<00:03:27.690> because<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.769> doesn't<00:03:28.919> look<00:03:29.310> that

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
ultimate because that doesn't look that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.190 
ultimate because that doesn't look that
cool<00:03:29.849> like<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:30.299> all<00:03:30.419> the<00:03:30.450> other<00:03:30.690> dragon<00:03:31.049> ball

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
cool like in all the other dragon ball

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.180 
cool like in all the other dragon ball
games<00:03:31.379> when<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.590> hit<00:03:31.709> somebody<00:03:31.889> with<00:03:32.040> an

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
games when you hit somebody with an

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.129 
games when you hit somebody with an
ultimate<00:03:32.669> like<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.419> was<00:03:33.599> awesome<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.109> know

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139

ultimate like that was awesome you know
what<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.349> mean<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.739> there<00:03:34.889> was<00:03:34.919> a<00:03:35.010> hole<00:03:35.220> cut

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
what I mean like there was a hole cut

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.129 
what I mean like there was a hole cut
scene<00:03:35.609> happening<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.419> you<00:03:36.540> can<00:03:36.660> see<00:03:36.840> here

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
scene happening and you can see here

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.050 
scene happening and you can see here
that<00:03:37.220> looks<00:03:38.220> like<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.430> sort<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.760> shoots

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
that looks like you just sort of shoots

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.939 
that looks like you just sort of shoots
it<00:03:39.239> out<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:39.720> then<00:03:39.750> like<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.290> camera<00:03:40.560> zooms<00:03:40.769> in

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
it out and then like the camera zooms in

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.770 
it out and then like the camera zooms in
on<00:03:41.069> them<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.430> mean<00:03:41.579> it's<00:03:41.970> okay<00:03:42.389> and<00:03:42.599> stuff

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
on them and I mean it's okay and stuff

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.680 
on them and I mean it's okay and stuff
like<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.260> won't<00:03:43.889> let<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.340> deter<00:03:44.790> me<00:03:45.239> at<00:03:45.510> all

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
like I won't let that deter me at all

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.479 
like I won't let that deter me at all
like<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.959> won't<00:03:46.139> be<00:03:46.230> like<00:03:46.379> oh<00:03:46.560> wow<00:03:46.859> so<00:03:47.280> that's

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
like I won't be like oh wow so that's

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.819 
like I won't be like oh wow so that's
the<00:03:47.579> only<00:03:47.879> thing<00:03:48.060> there<00:03:48.419> I'm<00:03:48.930> upset<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.590> know

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
the only thing there I'm upset you know

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.909 
the only thing there I'm upset you know
if<00:03:50.549> that<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:51.329> then<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.169> I'm<00:03:52.500> fine

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
if that is it then you know I'm fine

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.900 
if that is it then you know I'm fine
with<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.160> um<00:03:53.959> but<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.410> guess<00:03:56.010> that's<00:03:56.040> really

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
with that um but I guess that's really

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.809 
with that um but I guess that's really
all<00:03:57.329> my<00:03:57.660> opinions<00:03:58.199> on<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:59.040> universe<00:03:59.489> gameplay

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
all my opinions on the universe gameplay

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.250 
all my opinions on the universe gameplay
we<00:03:59.940> saw<00:04:00.060> there<00:04:00.209> was<00:04:00.299> also<00:04:00.480> another<00:04:00.780> gameplay

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
we saw there was also another gameplay

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.530 
we saw there was also another gameplay
video<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.829> you<00:04:01.919> can<00:04:01.949> find<00:04:02.790> by<00:04:02.970> searching<00:04:03.000> up

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
video that you can find by searching up

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.479 
video that you can find by searching up
I<00:04:03.900> forgot<00:04:04.139> who<00:04:04.470> who<00:04:04.889> else<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.190> fighting<00:04:05.459> i

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
I forgot who who else is fighting i

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.800 
I forgot who who else is fighting i
think<00:04:05.639> it's<00:04:05.760> going<00:04:06.090> visita<00:04:06.449> if<00:04:06.599> i'm<00:04:06.690> not

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
think it's going visita if i'm not

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.569 
think it's going visita if i'm not
mistaken<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.769> can<00:04:07.980> go<00:04:08.129> ahead<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.370> look

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
mistaken so you can go ahead and look

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.869 
mistaken so you can go ahead and look
that<00:04:08.790> up<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:09.000> see<00:04:09.180> some<00:04:09.660> more<00:04:09.690> stuff<00:04:10.230> but

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
that up to see some more stuff but

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.460 
that up to see some more stuff but
essentially<00:04:11.879> I<00:04:11.910> add<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.540> lock-on<00:04:12.870> system<00:04:13.139> to

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
essentially I add the lock-on system to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.470 
essentially I add the lock-on system to
is<00:04:13.709> another<00:04:14.040> thing<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.459> don't<00:04:15.090> like<00:04:15.359> it

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
is another thing that I don't like it

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.479 
is another thing that I don't like it
just<00:04:15.629> reminds<00:04:15.930> me<00:04:16.019> of<00:04:16.109> battle<00:04:16.410> of<00:04:16.500> z<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:17.370> know

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
just reminds me of battle of z you know

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.640 
just reminds me of battle of z you know
I<00:04:17.519> just<00:04:17.609> associate<00:04:18.479> battle<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.049> Z<00:04:19.260> with<00:04:19.289> and

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
I just associate battle of Z with and

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.069 
I just associate battle of Z with and
not<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:20.250> great<00:04:20.519> DBZ<00:04:21.030> game<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.479> in<00:04:21.840> my

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
not that great DBZ game it in my

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.330 
not that great DBZ game it in my
personal<00:04:22.380> opinion<00:04:22.760> again<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.909> know<00:04:24.030> at

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
personal opinion again you know at

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.710 
personal opinion again you know at
right<00:04:24.460> answer<00:04:24.699> own<00:04:24.820> opinions<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.300> stuff<00:04:25.510> but

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
right answer own opinions and stuff but

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.590 
right answer own opinions and stuff but
for<00:04:26.380> me<00:04:26.470> I<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:26.620> associated<00:04:27.370> with<00:04:27.490> okay<00:04:27.820> not

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
for me I just associated with okay not

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.220 
for me I just associated with okay not
that<00:04:28.810> good<00:04:29.110> um<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:30.820> mean<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.780> targeting<00:04:32.110> system

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
that good um I mean the targeting system

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.510 
that good um I mean the targeting system
kind<00:04:32.590> of<00:04:32.680> makes<00:04:32.830> sense<00:04:32.949> cuz<00:04:33.160> these<00:04:33.280> maps

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
kind of makes sense cuz these maps

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.969 
kind of makes sense cuz these maps
actually<00:04:33.970> do<00:04:34.120> seem<00:04:34.389> relatively<00:04:35.169> large<00:04:35.620> and

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
actually do seem relatively large and

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.290 
actually do seem relatively large and
you<00:04:36.040> know<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.220> got<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.580> keep<00:04:36.699> an<00:04:36.880> eye<00:04:37.000> on<00:04:37.030> your

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
you know you got to keep an eye on your

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.469 
you know you got to keep an eye on your
enemy<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.020> stuff<00:04:38.290> but<00:04:38.560> I<00:04:38.889> think<00:04:39.880> they<00:04:40.060> need<00:04:40.300> to

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
enemy and stuff but I think they need to

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.240 
enemy and stuff but I think they need to
rework<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.110> again<00:04:41.440> this<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.710> probably<00:04:41.919> very

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
rework that again this is probably very

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.580 
rework that again this is probably very
early<00:04:43.120> stages<00:04:43.690> i<00:04:43.960> don't<00:04:44.199> think<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.410> games

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
early stages i don't think the games

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.439 
early stages i don't think the games
coming<00:04:44.830> out<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.190> year<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:46.060> guys<00:04:46.210> can<00:04:46.360> watch

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
coming out this year you guys can watch

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.629 
coming out this year you guys can watch
my<00:04:46.720> dragon<00:04:47.680> ball<00:04:47.830> xenoverse<00:04:47.979> released<00:04:48.520> a

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
my dragon ball xenoverse released a

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.070 
my dragon ball xenoverse released a
video<00:04:48.790> where<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.090> speculate<00:04:49.600> on<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:49.780> but<00:04:50.050> I

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
video where I speculate on that but I

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.150 
video where I speculate on that but I
don't<00:04:50.229> think<00:04:50.350> it's<00:04:50.440> gonna<00:04:50.560> be<00:04:50.620> releasing<00:04:51.070> this

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
don't think it's gonna be releasing this

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.830 
don't think it's gonna be releasing this
year<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:51.490> they<00:04:51.580> still<00:04:51.760> have<00:04:51.910> a<00:04:52.120> lot<00:04:52.510> of<00:04:52.540> times

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
year so they still have a lot of times

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.469 
year so they still have a lot of times
sort<00:04:53.139> of<00:04:53.229> fix<00:04:53.470> things<00:04:53.710> up<00:04:53.949> on<00:04:54.190> another<00:04:55.120> thing

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
sort of fix things up on another thing

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.050 
sort of fix things up on another thing
the<00:04:55.720> bars<00:04:56.080> under<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.590> health<00:04:56.740> bar<00:04:56.919> are<00:04:57.190> very

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
the bars under the health bar are very

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.330 
the bars under the health bar are very
small<00:04:58.450> I<00:04:58.479> mean<00:04:58.900> I'm<00:04:59.290> nitpicking<00:04:59.590> here<00:05:00.130> they
