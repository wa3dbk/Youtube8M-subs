00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.270
 good morning we met in the workshop 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.270
 of general mechanics 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.450
 to explain how we have developed 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.820
 descriptors 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.410
 this piece of aluminum that consists of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.039
 three parts the first one is 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.410
 our axis this 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.899
 again an inch and our disk 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.730
 from four ordination we are going to 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:36.310
 explain the turning process 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.310
 different machines 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.310
 ah 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:50.080
 in the traditional environment 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.520
 as you can see the status of many 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.520
 levers of varied 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.290
 and we present it to change this 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.700
 material that will be in June 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.530
 we use this form 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.750
 I remember telling the tribulation 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.770
 have been able 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.440
 we have our 901,000 on you for the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.560
 gantry speed of diameter and 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.840
 following the specifications of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.510
 math we find that speed 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.120
 closest with speeds 6,000 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.960
 revolutions 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.880
 and then in our 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.990
 In general we find the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.320
 the key that is in 660 is in the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.320
 letter 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.290
 do 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.090
 and then we proceed to stand 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.980
 now to turn, you need a piece 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.980
 fast steel 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.840
 the environment 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.319
 the blender fis because it's our 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.319
 piece 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.640
 the sediment 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.010
 this piece will continue around the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.390
 contrary 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.390
 with this be here 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.930
 do not die 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.890
 and the interesting part is that of the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.319
 games because for this it has been 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.159
 needed to go to the manual 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.159
 for long 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.610
 for these gaps as the side of the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.610
 angle 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:16.890
 of the piece like this 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.890
 the blade and in this 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.270
 God 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.120
 now so that it does not stay accurate is used 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.120
 the divisional head 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.140
 suddenly he is looking 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.080
 is also the one that will come here is 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.760
 is 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.310
 until we see here is the head 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.530
 universal reviewer has been given 45 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.860
 degrees and as we can see here in the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.860
 series 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.550
 these are the ones that are going to give it the form 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.020
 for example I want to give you a 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.020
 in games and media 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.360
 they are given to the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.220
 you might want and this is going to go 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.220
 turning for example let's see 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.319
 and we see how the base can be turned 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.319
 each 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.580
 and so this is how you can 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.580
 big ours 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.529
 now at the end to give you details of 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:43.959
 Simply finished with oil 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:47.789
 Actually , the idea is oil for 

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.789
 that gives the brightness that is 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.729
 and basically that's how to give this 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.300
 our part 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.300
 now 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.130
 Well, let's go 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.190
 to explain the use of coffee is the 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.500
 money about universal 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.660
 for our centrifuge that consists of 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.600
 six holes we use this formula 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.420
 that may forgot them but as there are six 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.330
 holes not solving we get that 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.900
 we need six laps and 26 of 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.330
 holes in the circumference of 39 the 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.670
 circumference consist of more and less 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.310
 holes and the one that we are going to 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.940
 use the one of 39 go whole 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.800
 and 26 eggs we counted 26 votes so that 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.460
 give us 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.659
 an exact distance between each hole 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.659
 of religion 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.199
 as an important part also of the 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.880
 elaboration of month 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.550
 freud 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.540
 at the time of assembling as we can see 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:57.110
 here is a screw that we have 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.670
 turning is a four- screw 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.770
 four sides then in any 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.840
 moment one can unscrew it and 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.449
 remove it to separate both pieces if it is 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.460
 that need maintenance or something 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:13.110
 to join the pieces only the plan 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.110
 let's say put under pressure 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:19.580
 to this machine 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.410
 we raise and press and there 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.600
 pressure is exerted or can we 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.950
 keep pushing and that was what 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:30.330
 used to be by the sea 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.330
 together the two pieces 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.550
 equally 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.100
 then more or less something like that 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.850
 its form when starting to turn 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.020
 we see that the piece is spinning and in the 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.020
 moment we need 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.950
 in this case 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.020
 I the part of here where it gives a 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.710
 blade which will change if it is 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.710
 this piece 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:11.790
 I hope I have clarified doubts 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.790
 we'll see
