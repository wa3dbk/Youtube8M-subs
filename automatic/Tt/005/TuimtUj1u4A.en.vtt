weighs sixteen point six ounces the
support<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.079> definitely<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.860> par<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
support is definitely up to par the

shape of the shoe helps once again with

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.830 
shape of the shoe helps once again with
that<00:02:53.040> because<00:02:53.549> they<00:02:53.850> lace<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:54.360> pretty<00:02:54.570> high

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
that because they lace up pretty high

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.319 
that because they lace up pretty high
while<00:02:55.500> still<00:02:55.890> allowing<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.459> flexibility

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
it isn't the best ever but it does get

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.229 
it isn't the best ever but it does get
the<00:03:39.930> job<00:03:39.959> done<00:03:40.410> looks<00:03:41.160> wise<00:03:41.400> I've<00:03:41.790> always

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239

liked<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.599> hyper<00:03:42.780> dunks<00:03:43.260> real<00:03:43.890> simple<00:03:44.459> and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
liked the hyper dunks real simple and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.789 
liked the hyper dunks real simple and
clean<00:03:44.849> on<00:03:45.060> court<00:03:45.450> it's<00:03:45.900> not<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.170> shoe<00:03:46.500> I'd

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
clean on court it's not a shoe I'd

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.890 
clean on court it's not a shoe I'd
probably<00:03:47.220> wear<00:03:47.549> casually<00:03:48.269> but<00:03:48.720> it's<00:03:48.840> a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
probably wear casually but it's a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.020 
probably wear casually but it's a
basketball<00:03:49.379> sneaker<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.430> think<00:03:50.700> they<00:03:50.790> look

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
basketball sneaker and I think they look

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.869 
basketball sneaker and I think they look
great<00:03:51.299> as<00:03:51.569> just<00:03:51.599> that<00:03:52.160> overall<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.489> highly

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
great as just that overall I highly

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.880

lot<00:04:03.599> of<00:04:03.750> times<00:04:03.989> when<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.319> sneaker<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:04.980> strong<00:04:05.340> in

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
lot of times when a sneaker is strong in

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.880 
lot of times when a sneaker is strong in
one<00:04:05.819> particular<00:04:06.359> area<00:04:06.690> it's<00:04:07.109> weak<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.590> another

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
protection is out of this world but

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.219 
protection is out of this world but
there's<00:04:14.280> very<00:04:14.519> little<00:04:14.790> flexibility<00:04:15.510> or<00:04:15.750> court

I<00:04:16.709> think<00:04:17.400> Nike<00:04:17.789> did<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.000> great<00:04:18.329> job<00:04:18.359> on<00:04:18.690> these<00:04:19.079> in

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
I think Nike did a great job on these in

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.400 
I think Nike did a great job on these in
just<00:04:20.070> making<00:04:20.400> them<00:04:20.699> extremely<00:04:21.120> well<00:04:21.600> balanced

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
just making them extremely well balanced

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.980 
just making them extremely well balanced
these<00:04:23.010> are<00:04:23.190> like<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.520> honey<00:04:23.789> nut<00:04:23.880> cheerios<00:04:24.419> of
