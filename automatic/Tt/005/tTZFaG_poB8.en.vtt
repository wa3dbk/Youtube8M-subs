in<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.329> position<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.079> that's<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
in that position so that's that's the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.289 
in that position so that's that's the
one<00:01:32.250> thing<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.430> struck<00:01:32.700> me<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> most<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
one thing that struck me the most is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.520 
one thing that struck me the most is
that<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> different

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that this is going to be a different

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.770 
that this is going to be a different
offense<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.790> really<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> regear

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
offense and you really have to regear

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.149 
offense and you really have to regear
you're<00:01:36.990> thinking<00:01:37.350> about<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:37.680> Rutgers<00:01:37.860> on

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you're thinking about what Rutgers on

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.950 
you're thinking about what Rutgers on
fence<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.490> about<00:01:38.759> when<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> watch<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.750> team

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
fence is about when you watch this team

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.510 
fence is about when you watch this team
now<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:41.100> completely<00:01:41.430> different

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
now that's completely different

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
now that's completely different
challenge<00:01:42.090> now<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> maybe<00:01:42.600> they've<00:01:43.530> played

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
challenge now and maybe they've played

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.230 
challenge now and maybe they've played
this<00:01:43.920> team<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> lot<00:01:44.460> though<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.060> feel

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
this team a lot though I have to feel

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.789 
this team a lot though I have to feel
like<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.540> experience<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.200> playing<00:01:46.380> against

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
like the experience of playing against

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.550 
like the experience of playing against
that<00:01:46.829> triple<00:01:47.280> option<00:01:47.820> attack<00:01:48.360> will<00:01:49.170> help<00:01:49.409> them

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that triple option attack will help them

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.929 
that triple option attack will help them
this<00:01:49.680> time<00:01:49.890> Andy<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.460> think<00:01:50.700> they're<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
think there's still some danger there or

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.530 
think there's still some danger there or
this<00:01:52.920> team<00:01:53.159> defensively<00:01:53.909> prepared<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.420> them

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
this team defensively prepared for them

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.300 
this team defensively prepared for them
one<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> things<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.920> saw<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
one of the things that we saw out of the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.590 
one of the things that we saw out of the
opener<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.939> Rutgers<00:01:57.240> didn't<00:01:57.479> create

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
opener was that Rutgers didn't create

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240 
opener was that Rutgers didn't create
some<00:01:57.869> turnovers<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.770> need<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.070> create

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
some turnovers they need to create

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
some turnovers they need to create
turnovers<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.880> game<00:01:59.939> that's<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.630> way<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
turnovers this game that's one way the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
turnovers this game that's one way the
other<00:02:01.409> way<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.710> think<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.189> Rutgers<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.969> can

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
other way I think that Rutgers can can

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
other way I think that Rutgers can can
sort<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.540> solve<00:02:03.840> Navy's<00:02:04.350> offense<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.040> by

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
sort of solve Navy's offense is by

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.039 
sort of solve Navy's offense is by
scoring<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.090> which<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.509> think<00:02:06.719> they<00:02:06.840> can

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
scoring a lot which I think they can

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.540 
scoring a lot which I think they can
against<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.409> Navy<00:02:07.649> defense<00:02:08.069> that's<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> one

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
against this Navy defense that's the one

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.559

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
see that and I saw it and I think if you

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.690

not be required to ever pronounce it
that<00:02:20.200> that's<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:20.530> two<00:02:20.650> hyphen<00:02:20.980> limit<00:02:21.249> I<00:02:21.430> think

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
that that's the two hyphen limit I think

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.199 
that that's the two hyphen limit I think
it's<00:02:21.999> in<00:02:22.900> Haku<00:02:23.409> and<00:02:23.739> hotter<00:02:24.219> hotter<00:02:25.090> and

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
it's in Haku and hotter hotter and

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's in Haku and hotter hotter and
hotter<00:02:25.329> something<00:02:25.870> like<00:02:26.019> that<00:02:26.049> it's<00:02:26.439> close<00:02:26.739> I

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
hotter something like that it's close I

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.379 
hotter something like that it's close I
mean<00:02:27.069> that's<00:02:27.159> as<00:02:27.340> close<00:02:27.519> as<00:02:27.579> I<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:27.849> get<00:02:28.060> you're

I<00:02:52.150> think<00:02:52.329> this<00:02:52.689> game<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:52.930> going<00:02:53.169> to<00:02:53.230> be<00:02:53.290> closer

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
I think this game is going to be closer

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.780 
I think this game is going to be closer
to<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:53.889> lot<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.040> people<00:02:54.250> think<00:02:54.370> i'm<00:02:54.549> gonna<00:02:54.639> go<00:02:54.760> to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790

prediction<00:02:57.819> I<00:02:58.090> don't<00:02:58.959> think<00:02:58.989> it's<00:02:59.169> going<00:02:59.260> to

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319

be<00:02:59.439> that<00:02:59.590> close<00:02:59.739> I<00:03:00.069> think<00:03:00.099> it's<00:03:00.400> going<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.549> be

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
be that close I think it's going to be

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.959 
be that close I think it's going to be
more<00:03:00.969> like<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.560> 35-14<00:03:02.560> game<00:03:02.769> possibly<00:03:03.669> even<00:03:03.849> a

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:03.969
