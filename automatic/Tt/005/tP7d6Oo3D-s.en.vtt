00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.420
 hello to all hello to all I hope 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.160
 that you're fine today I'll you 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.290
 found for a new makeup tutorial 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.910
 so today it changes a little bit 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.100
 everything I've done before 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.300
 since it's a make-up 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.000
 really more discreet more natural less 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.309
 charged - charcoal this is me 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.989
 asked several times to make the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.089
 makeup to go to school for 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.829
 go to college and so suddenly it's 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.150
 true that all makeup that 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.760
 I had proposed so far were 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.450
 rather make-ups loaded rather 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.940
 adult makeup in quotation marks 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.080
 makeup more than that for more 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.060
 evening etc 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.170
 so suddenly I thought 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.750
 it was the moment 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.570
 so I realized this makeup there with 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.940
 the naked palette to tell me the number 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.009
 1 and brushes 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.300
 costelle sense so I really hope that 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.280
 would you like it to be at the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.140
 high expectations of those who 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.750
 asked me a little makeup 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.880

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.900
 this darker lighthouse will give more 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.250
 depth to the eye and that's what will 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.250
