you're gonna take this piece of thread

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.080 
you're gonna take this piece of thread
and<00:01:06.479> create<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.110> large<00:01:07.320> loop<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.580> ends<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and create a large loop take the ends of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.990 
and create a large loop take the ends of
the<00:01:09.840> side<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.350> hold<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.159> opposite<00:01:11.670> hands

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the side and hold it in opposite hands

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.940 
the side and hold it in opposite hands
you're<00:01:12.360> gonna<00:01:12.479> create<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> knot<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.740> piece

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you're gonna create a knot in this piece

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
you're gonna create a knot in this piece
of<00:01:14.070> string<00:01:14.310> put<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> ends<00:01:15.659> together<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
of string put the ends together and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.499 
of string put the ends together and
pinch<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.680> create<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.950> small

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
pinch it like this and create a small

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.160 
pinch it like this and create a small
loop<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.820> bring<00:01:23.820> around<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.630> ends

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
loop like this and bring around the ends

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.649 
loop like this and bring around the ends
and<00:01:25.310> pull<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> through<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:27.900> create<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.619> knot<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
and pull it through to create a knot and

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.819 
and pull it through to create a knot and
now<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.530> large<00:01:32.040> loop<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.729> this

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
now you have a large loop like this

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.560 
now you have a large loop like this
it's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.399> knot<00:01:35.609> that<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.820> created<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.390> want<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's a knot that you created you want to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230 
it's a knot that you created you want to
keep<00:01:36.719> that<00:01:37.460> behind<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.759> hand<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.149> don't

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
keep that behind your hand you don't

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.209 
keep that behind your hand you don't
want<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.570> able<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.200> knot<00:01:40.439> so

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
want to be able to see that knot so

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.709 
want to be able to see that knot so
right<00:01:41.399> now<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> looks<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.969> a<00:01:42.000> perfect<00:01:42.509> piece

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
right now it looks like a perfect piece

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.929 
right now it looks like a perfect piece
of<00:01:42.750> thread<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.679> the<00:01:43.710> loop<00:01:43.979> hidden<00:01:44.460> got<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
of thread with the loop hidden got it

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.279 
of thread with the loop hidden got it
yeah<00:01:46.429> now<00:01:47.429> you're<00:01:48.149> gonna<00:01:48.270> take<00:01:48.569> this<00:01:48.750> loop<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
yeah now you're gonna take this loop and

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.190 
yeah now you're gonna take this loop and
create<00:01:50.219> tiny<00:01:50.939> little<00:01:51.240> loops<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> middle

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
create tiny little loops in the middle

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.289 
create tiny little loops in the middle
and<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.130> by<00:01:53.189> twisting<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.060> hand

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and you do this by twisting your hand

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.410 
and you do this by twisting your hand
like<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.569> eight<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:56.009> ten<00:01:56.250> times<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:57.060> your

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
like this eight to ten times and your

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.309 
like this eight to ten times and your
end<00:01:57.569> product<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:59.060> a<00:02:00.060> weird<00:02:00.539> X<00:02:00.840> looking

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
end product will be a weird X looking

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.830 
end product will be a weird X looking
type<00:02:01.709> thing<00:02:02.100> or<00:02:02.399> an<00:02:02.640> infinity<00:02:03.329> sign<00:02:03.569> or
