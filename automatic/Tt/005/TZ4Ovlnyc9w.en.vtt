00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
black pepper and then I'm just going to

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.370 
black pepper and then I'm just going to
clamp<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.480> lid<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.840> allow<00:03:47.109> to<00:03:47.170> simmer

away<00:03:48.060> here's<00:03:49.060> what<00:03:49.299> your<00:03:49.450> pizza<00:03:49.780> dough<00:03:49.900> should

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
away here's what your pizza dough should

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.350 
away here's what your pizza dough should
look<00:03:50.290> like<00:03:50.319> after

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
look like after

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:02.660 
look like after
an<00:03:51.480> hour<00:03:59.360> all<00:04:00.360> I'm<00:04:00.690> doing<00:04:00.990> now<00:04:01.020> is<00:04:01.670> flattening

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
an hour all I'm doing now is flattening

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.540 
an hour all I'm doing now is flattening
my<00:04:03.150> dough<00:04:03.210> onto<00:04:03.960> a<00:04:04.320> board<00:04:04.740> lined<00:04:05.160> with<00:04:05.370> either

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
my dough onto a board lined with either

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.300 
my dough onto a board lined with either
Silpat<00:04:06.360> or<00:04:06.600> parchment<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.590> doesn't<00:04:07.920> stick

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
Silpat or parchment so it doesn't stick

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.970 
Silpat or parchment so it doesn't stick
and<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:09.150> personally<00:04:09.780> never<00:04:10.110> conquered<00:04:10.800> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
and I personally never conquered the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.070 
and I personally never conquered the
whole<00:04:11.220> hand<00:04:11.760> tossing<00:04:12.210> it<00:04:12.300> over<00:04:12.570> your<00:04:12.720> head<00:04:13.020> and

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
whole hand tossing it over your head and

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.990 
whole hand tossing it over your head and
fancy<00:04:13.770> bit<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.220> I'm<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.430> doing<00:04:14.580> what<00:04:14.820> works

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
fancy bit so I'm just doing what works

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.180 
fancy bit so I'm just doing what works
for<00:04:15.150> me<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:15.960> far<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.380> don't<00:04:16.650> need<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.890> rolling

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
for me this far you don't need a rolling

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.310 
for me this far you don't need a rolling
pin<00:04:17.459> you're<00:04:17.700> just<00:04:18.060> merely<00:04:18.359> punching<00:04:18.959> out<00:04:19.109> the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
pin you're just merely punching out the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.830 
pin you're just merely punching out the
extra<00:04:19.739> air<00:04:19.980> and<00:04:20.459> you're<00:04:20.609> letting<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:21.090> rise<00:04:21.480> a

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
extra air and you're letting it rise a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.050 
extra air and you're letting it rise a
little<00:04:22.200> bit<00:04:22.350> longer<00:04:22.650> here's<00:04:23.520> what<00:04:23.790> my<00:04:23.880> dome

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
little bit longer here's what my dome

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.120 
little bit longer here's what my dome
looks<00:04:24.300> like<00:04:24.480> after<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.930> second<00:04:25.350> rise<00:04:25.590> and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
looks like after the second rise and

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.070 
looks like after the second rise and
it's<00:04:26.580> important<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.210> allow<00:04:27.480> it<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.660> do<00:04:27.900> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
it's important to allow it to do the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.020 
it's important to allow it to do the
second<00:04:28.440> rise<00:04:28.590> since<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:29.190> will<00:04:29.310> develop<00:04:29.640> the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
second rise since it will develop the

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.330 
second rise since it will develop the
flavors<00:04:30.480> so<00:04:30.930> much<00:04:31.140> more<00:04:31.380> intricately<00:04:31.860> I'm

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
flavors so much more intricately I'm

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.190 
flavors so much more intricately I'm
just<00:04:32.670> going<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.000> flatten<00:04:33.420> it<00:04:33.630> out<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.050> can

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
just going to flatten it out and you can

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.630 
just going to flatten it out and you can
make<00:04:34.230> it<00:04:34.470> as<00:04:34.590> thick<00:04:34.620> or<00:04:35.040> as<00:04:35.100> thin<00:04:35.220> as<00:04:35.430> you'd

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
make it as thick or as thin as you'd

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.090 
make it as thick or as thin as you'd
like<00:04:35.960> completely<00:04:36.960> up<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:37.440> your<00:04:37.650> personal

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
like completely up to you your personal

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.300 
like completely up to you your personal
preference<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.260> then<00:04:40.260> I'm<00:04:40.530> going<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.920> part<00:04:41.250> a

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
preference and then I'm going to part a

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.240 
preference and then I'm going to part a
bake<00:04:41.490> it<00:04:41.730> before<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:42.690> put<00:04:43.050> in<00:04:43.170> my<00:04:43.320> toppings<00:04:43.890> as
