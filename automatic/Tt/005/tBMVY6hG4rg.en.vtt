00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.729 
World War was made by treyarch which is
why<00:00:40.760> I'm<00:00:41.210> playing<00:00:41.600> well<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.440> war<00:00:42.590> at<00:00:42.680> the

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
why I'm playing well the war at the

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.080 
why I'm playing well the war at the
moment<00:00:43.100> because<00:00:43.280> black<00:00:43.520> ops<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:43.789> just<00:00:43.969> round

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
moment because black ops is just round

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.639 
moment because black ops is just round
the<00:00:44.210> corner<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:44.780> it's<00:00:45.140> being<00:00:45.320> made<00:00:45.500> by<00:00:45.620> the

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
the corner and it's being made by the

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.060 
the corner and it's being made by the
same<00:00:46.120> gaming<00:00:47.120> company<00:00:47.510> so<00:00:47.840> what<00:00:48.800> I<00:00:48.829> want<00:00:49.010> to

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
same gaming company so what I want to

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.209 
same gaming company so what I want to
see<00:00:49.190> different<00:00:49.430> in<00:00:49.820> Waldo<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:50.899> black<00:00:51.590> ops<00:00:51.769> even

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
see different in Waldo in black ops even

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.119 
see different in Waldo in black ops even
then<00:00:52.730> in<00:00:52.910> world<00:00:53.090> at<00:00:53.239> war<00:00:53.420> is<00:00:53.660> that<00:00:54.260> I<00:00:54.440> don't<00:00:54.769> see

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
then in world at war is that I don't see

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.540 
then in world at war is that I don't see
one<00:00:55.480> super<00:00:56.480> overpowered<00:00:56.989> gun<00:00:57.350> like<00:00:57.739> obviously

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
one super overpowered gun like obviously

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.229 
one super overpowered gun like obviously
is<00:00:58.760> really<00:00:59.539> obvious<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.960> mp40<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.030> what<00:01:02.030> from

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
is really obvious the mp40 and what from

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.390 
is really obvious the mp40 and what from
what<00:01:02.390> I've<00:01:02.449> heard<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:02.660> far<00:01:02.870> I<00:01:03.320> think<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.710> m16

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
what I've heard so far I think the m16

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.540 
what I've heard so far I think the m16
is<00:01:04.610> really<00:01:04.910> overpowered<00:01:05.510> from<00:01:05.840> a<00:01:06.250> few<00:01:07.250> people

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
is really overpowered from a few people

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.550 
is really overpowered from a few people
I've<00:01:07.670> been<00:01:07.820> talking<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.330> they<00:01:08.960> pre<00:01:09.170> ordered<00:01:09.440> it

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
I've been talking to they pre ordered it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.110 
I've been talking to they pre ordered it
and<00:01:09.620> they've<00:01:09.800> got<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.010> game<00:01:10.160> early<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:10.520> I've

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
and they've got the game early and I've

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.580 
and they've got the game early and I've
been<00:01:11.240> told<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.720> m16<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.350> really

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
been told that the m16 is really

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.900 
been told that the m16 is really
overpowered<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.690> I<00:01:14.710> heard<00:01:15.710> one<00:01:15.860> of<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.100> black

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
overpowered and I heard one of the black

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.960 
overpowered and I heard one of the black
ops<00:01:17.150> presenters<00:01:18.310> actually<00:01:19.310> say<00:01:19.550> that<00:01:19.790> they

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
ops presenters actually say that they

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.800 
ops presenters actually say that they
released<00:01:20.720> quite<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.200> few<00:01:21.730> good<00:01:22.730> guns<00:01:23.120> for<00:01:23.690> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
released quite a few good guns for the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.660 
released quite a few good guns for the
first<00:01:24.050> few<00:01:24.230> levels<00:01:24.470> because<00:01:24.860> obviously<00:01:25.010> if

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
first few levels because obviously if

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.250 
first few levels because obviously if
you<00:01:25.790> get<00:01:25.940> bad<00:01:26.120> guns<00:01:26.420> at<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.630> first<00:01:26.840> few<00:01:27.050> levels

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
you get bad guns at the first few levels

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.990 
you get bad guns at the first few levels
then<00:01:27.710> it's<00:01:28.190> going<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.370> kind<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.640> put<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:28.880> off

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
then it's going to kind of put you off

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.980 
then it's going to kind of put you off
the<00:01:29.120> game<00:01:29.330> because<00:01:29.540> you're<00:01:29.630> not<00:01:29.720> going<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.900> be

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
the game because you're not going to be

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.530 
the game because you're not going to be
able<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:30.230> get<00:01:30.380> good<00:01:30.410> kills<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.580> which<00:01:32.420> is

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
able to get good kills and which is

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.500 
able to get good kills and which is
pretty<00:01:32.630> much<00:01:32.780> wide<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.350> UMP<00:01:33.830> was<00:01:34.360> unlocked<00:01:35.360> at

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
pretty much wide the UMP was unlocked at

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.900 
pretty much wide the UMP was unlocked at
such<00:01:35.690> an<00:01:35.810> early<00:01:35.960> level<00:01:36.470> on<00:01:36.680> modern<00:01:37.430> warfare<00:01:37.580> 2

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
such an early level on modern warfare 2

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.280 
such an early level on modern warfare 2
so<00:01:38.150> you<00:01:38.240> can<00:01:38.360> get<00:01:38.510> a<00:01:38.570> good<00:01:38.750> feel<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.260> game

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
so you can get a good feel of the game

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.710 
so you can get a good feel of the game
get<00:01:39.920> quite<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.160> few<00:01:40.250> good<00:01:40.640> kills<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.510> could

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
get quite a few good kills and you could

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.910 
get quite a few good kills and you could
rank<00:01:42.410> up<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.680> little<00:01:42.890> bit<00:01:43.480> but<00:01:44.480> in<00:01:44.660> in<00:01:45.320> black<00:01:45.710> ops

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
rank up a little bit but in in black ops

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.610 
rank up a little bit but in in black ops
is<00:01:46.040> kind<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.430> same<00:01:46.580> as<00:01:46.760> that<00:01:46.910> but

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
is kind of the same as that but

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.980 
is kind of the same as that but
hopefully<00:01:48.620> in<00:01:49.040> black<00:01:49.280> ops<00:01:49.460> it<00:01:50.120> won't<00:01:50.420> fail<00:01:50.750> I

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
hopefully in black ops it won't fail I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.050 
hopefully in black ops it won't fail I
me<00:01:51.740> I've<00:01:52.130> really<00:01:52.400> got<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.550> lot<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.790> faith<00:01:53.030> in

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
me I've really got a lot of faith in

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.550 
me I've really got a lot of faith in
this<00:01:53.300> game<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:53.720> looks<00:01:53.750> like<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> really<00:01:54.350> nice

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
this game it looks like a really nice

but i'm not going to be doing now in
black<00:03:38.570> ops<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.959> probably<00:03:39.170> gonna<00:03:39.709> do<00:03:39.980> single

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
black ops and probably gonna do single

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.170 
black ops and probably gonna do single
player<00:03:40.489> once<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:41.239> focus<00:03:42.019> on<00:03:42.140> ranking<00:03:42.590> up<00:03:43.180> so

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
player once and focus on ranking up so

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.120 
player once and focus on ranking up so
in<00:03:44.299> black<00:03:44.510> ops<00:03:44.690> obviously<00:03:45.170> there's<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.440> 50

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
in black ops obviously there's a 50

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.910 
in black ops obviously there's a 50
levels<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:47.290> i'm<00:03:48.290> not<00:03:48.470> sure<00:03:48.530> how<00:03:48.860> many

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
levels and i'm not sure how many

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.039 
levels and i'm not sure how many
prestigious<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:49.640> think<00:03:49.820> it's<00:03:49.940> either<00:03:50.120> 15<00:03:50.570> or<00:03:50.720> 10

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
prestigious I think it's either 15 or 10

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.990 
prestigious I think it's either 15 or 10
because<00:03:52.010> I've<00:03:52.190> heard<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.519> they<00:03:52.670> were<00:03:52.730> making

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
because I've heard it they were making

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.140 
because I've heard it they were making
10<00:03:53.450> again<00:03:53.840> or<00:03:54.140> they<00:03:54.170> were<00:03:54.350> making<00:03:54.650> 15<00:03:55.100> but<00:03:55.400> feel

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
10 again or they were making 15 but feel

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.970 
10 again or they were making 15 but feel

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
one kill streak killing me I respawn it

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.790 
one kill streak killing me I respawn it
kills<00:04:26.090> me<00:04:26.270> again<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:26.539> respawn<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.440> kills<00:04:27.620> me

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800

kills me again I respawn and it kills me
again<00:04:28.070> I've<00:04:28.640> seen<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:28.880> few<00:04:29.000> clips<00:04:29.419> of<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
again I've seen a few clips of the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.450 
again I've seen a few clips of the
each<00:04:30.240> chopper<00:04:30.540> gunner<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:32.220> looks

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
each chopper gunner and that looks

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.850 
each chopper gunner and that looks
pretty<00:04:32.669> goddamn<00:04:33.180> overpowered<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.020> hopefully

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
pretty goddamn overpowered and hopefully

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.969 
pretty goddamn overpowered and hopefully
if<00:04:35.130> they<00:04:35.699> get<00:04:35.970> if<00:04:36.210> treyarch<00:04:37.020> actually<00:04:37.410> gets<00:04:37.680> a

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
if they get if treyarch actually gets a

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.920 
if they get if treyarch actually gets a
few<00:04:38.550> requests<00:04:38.940> from<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> community<00:04:39.720> to

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
few requests from the community to

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.920 
few requests from the community to
actually<00:04:40.470> change<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.610> game<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.570> little<00:04:42.720> bit

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
actually change the game a little bit

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.890 
actually change the game a little bit
hopefully<00:04:43.440> they<00:04:43.560> will<00:04:43.710> add<00:04:43.919> patches<00:04:44.430> like

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
hopefully they will add patches like

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.300 
hopefully they will add patches like
they<00:04:45.900> did<00:04:46.080> in<00:04:46.110> modern<00:04:46.440> warfare<00:04:46.590> 2<00:04:46.949> with<00:04:47.280> the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
they did in modern warfare 2 with the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.980 
they did in modern warfare 2 with the
models<00:04:47.729> and<00:04:47.880> stuff<00:04:48.000> at<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:48.570> they

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
models and stuff at that but they

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.990 
models and stuff at that but they
Infinity<00:04:49.919> Ward<00:04:50.070> actually<00:04:50.400> only<00:04:50.520> made<00:04:50.790> one

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
Infinity Ward actually only made one

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000 
Infinity Ward actually only made one
patch<00:04:51.240> which<00:04:51.510> was<00:04:51.690> with<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.229> models<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.770> that

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
patch which was with the models and that

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.650 
patch which was with the models and that
was<00:04:53.130> really<00:04:53.370> early<00:04:53.520> on<00:04:53.880> in<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.090> game<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.540> they

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
was really early on in the game and they

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.469 
was really early on in the game and they
never<00:04:54.870> made<00:04:55.199> a<00:04:55.229> patch<00:04:55.470> ever<00:04:55.710> again<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:57.330> was

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290

Twitter<00:05:22.500> and<00:05:22.710> stuff<00:05:22.770> at<00:05:23.010> that<00:05:23.190> they<00:05:23.780> they're

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
Twitter and stuff at that they they're

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.320 
Twitter and stuff at that they they're
listening<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.320> community<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:26.330> hopefully

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
listening to the community and hopefully

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.029 
listening to the community and hopefully
they<00:05:27.479> will<00:05:27.690> listen<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.470> community<00:05:28.889> if

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
they will listen to the community if

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.890 
they will listen to the community if
there's<00:05:29.220> quite<00:05:29.520> a<00:05:29.550> lot<00:05:29.729> of<00:05:29.880> bad<00:05:30.870> things

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
there's quite a lot of bad things

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.590 
there's quite a lot of bad things
happening<00:05:31.770> on<00:05:31.889> in<00:05:32.039> black<00:05:32.220> ops<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:32.760> obviously

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
happening on in black ops and obviously

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.510 
happening on in black ops and obviously
they've<00:05:33.810> nerfed<00:05:34.200> quickscoping<00:05:34.919> really<00:05:35.310> badly

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
they've nerfed quickscoping really badly

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.969 
they've nerfed quickscoping really badly
and<00:05:35.820> you<00:05:35.940> can't<00:05:36.270> quickscope<00:05:36.870> at<00:05:37.020> all<00:05:37.169> and<00:05:37.470> it's

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
and you can't quickscope at all and it's

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.270 
and you can't quickscope at all and it's
really<00:05:38.039> hard<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:38.760> snipe<00:05:39.270> in<00:05:39.539> black<00:05:39.780> ops<00:05:40.280> also

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
really hard to snipe in black ops also

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.270 
really hard to snipe in black ops also
I've<00:05:41.430> heard<00:05:41.669> and<00:05:43.039> that's<00:05:44.039> a<00:05:44.130> real

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
I've heard and that's a real

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.680 
I've heard and that's a real
disappointment<00:05:44.550> for<00:05:44.940> me<00:05:45.000> because<00:05:45.090> I<00:05:45.330> really

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
disappointment for me because I really

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.810 
disappointment for me because I really
enjoyed<00:05:46.050> sniping<00:05:46.590> it<00:05:46.740> was<00:05:46.830> one<00:05:47.430> of<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:47.639> things

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
enjoyed sniping it was one of the things

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.690 
enjoyed sniping it was one of the things
that<00:05:48.000> made<00:05:48.389> me<00:05:48.919> continue<00:05:49.919> to<00:05:50.070> enjoy<00:05:50.190> modern
