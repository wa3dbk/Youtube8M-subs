00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.580
 report patron of June I am doing to you 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.250
 do this little when the friend for 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.170
 see what kind of casino you create in 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.269
 our house when you do not know is clear 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.740
 in short, when one of the two is alone 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.210
 do not believe that it makes things clearer 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.220
 what we did with the money 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 earned so far we are continuing to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.580
 set aside for a big project 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.650
 to which we must work but but you know that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.360
 we have to put in a closet and the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.820
 Today's expenditure and this is seen yes yes 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.280
 see is a screen we have mounted 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.160
 to ensure that when we dub us 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.860
 we see very well what we owe 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.660
 going to dub here is now on but 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.760
 the present before what we did 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 we used a tablet that I now do to you 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.480
 also see maybe more followed me 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 follow minutes with some home 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.730
 we used this tablet using a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.199
 broadcasting program called 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.199
 split screen it seems to me that practically 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.480
 via wireless it connected this to me 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.729
 my computer and we could see here 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.710
 on this tablet and not what he saw 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.790
 that second screen going through 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.939
 inter was shit 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.280
 instead now with this mega screen 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.020
 very cool is not very practical ie mega 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.540
 comfortable we can now have everything 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.430
 as without latency without lag e 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.860
 double or better quality ie 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.259
 we can really see much better 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.369
 all lips all sing and double 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.299
 without losing twice the time 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.009
 compared to before 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.530
 and this we owe only to you 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.570
 because if I were not mine I would have hesitated 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.430
 to buy such a name now 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.280
 we also have to take stuff like 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.259
 of the sound-absorbing material from 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.180
 put on the walls and another of 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.810
 andrea all this then you will see it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.820
 maybe next month if I can 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.580
 recover them to buy them but now 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.980
