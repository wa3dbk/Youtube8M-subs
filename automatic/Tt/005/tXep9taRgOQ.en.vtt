00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:01.540 

you

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.710 

mmm

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.850 

you

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.640 

it<00:04:10.860> does<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.250> through<00:04:11.490> most<00:04:11.820> of<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.060> song

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
it does that through most of the song

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.160 
it does that through most of the song
when<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.680> gets<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.190> end<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.970> think<00:04:15.870> that

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
when it gets to the end I think that

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:58.200 
when it gets to the end I think that
Keith<00:04:16.860> is<00:04:17.040> strumming<00:04:17.550> a<00:04:17.610> little<00:04:17.820> bit<00:04:17.940> more

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.450 

and<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.990> only<00:04:59.110> other<00:04:59.230> part<00:04:59.740> I<00:04:59.860> can<00:05:00.010> think<00:05:00.190> of

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
and the only other part I can think of

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.810 
and the only other part I can think of
to<00:05:01.300> show<00:05:01.570> you<00:05:01.630> is<00:05:02.080> uh<00:05:02.250> there's<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.310> little<00:05:03.460> riff

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
to show you is uh there's a little riff

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.850 
to show you is uh there's a little riff
where<00:05:04.180> a<00:05:04.390> little<00:05:04.690> lick<00:05:04.870> that<00:05:05.110> key<00:05:05.320> throws<00:05:05.650> in

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
where a little lick that key throws in

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:16.210 
where a little lick that key throws in
at<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.220> end<00:05:06.400> where

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.560 

um<00:05:17.220> you're<00:05:17.700> gonna<00:05:17.790> go<00:05:18.000> from<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.360> D

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
- guess this would be like a G because

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.770 
- guess this would be like a G because
it's<00:05:27.350> part<00:05:27.950> of<00:05:28.010> a<00:05:28.100> D<00:05:28.370> position<00:05:29.150> at<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.420> seventh

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
it's part of a D position at the seventh
