myself<00:00:56.280> every<00:00:57.280> time<00:00:57.430> I<00:00:57.489> would<00:00:57.610> hurt<00:00:57.760> myself

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
myself every time I would hurt myself

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.330 
myself every time I would hurt myself
I'd<00:00:58.210> end<00:00:58.390> up<00:00:58.480> in<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.660> hospital<00:00:58.840> and<00:00:59.440> I<00:01:00.070> kind<00:01:00.280> of

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
I'd end up in a hospital and I kind of

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.860 
I'd end up in a hospital and I kind of
looked<00:01:00.580> around<00:01:00.670> at<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.210> people<00:01:01.360> that<00:01:01.570> were<00:01:01.750> in

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
the hospital and I saw that they weren't

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.430 
the hospital and I saw that they weren't
in<00:01:03.940> bad<00:01:04.210> danger<00:01:04.750> they<00:01:05.080> were<00:01:05.110> in

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
in bad danger they were in

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.200 
in bad danger they were in
air-conditioning<00:01:06.159> in<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.370> summer<00:01:06.610> they<00:01:07.150> were

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
air-conditioning in the summer they were

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.750 
air-conditioning in the summer they were
in<00:01:07.420> heat<00:01:07.659> in<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.870> winter<00:01:08.020> it<00:01:08.979> seemed<00:01:09.220> like<00:01:09.370> it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
in heat in the winter it seemed like it

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.250 
in heat in the winter it seemed like it
seemed<00:01:10.000> like<00:01:10.150> a<00:01:10.180> happy<00:01:10.510> place<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.780> work<00:01:11.049> there

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
seemed like a happy place to work there

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.289 
seemed like a happy place to work there
was<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> lot<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.650> action<00:01:12.010> going<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.610> I

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
was a lot of action going on and I

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.270 
was a lot of action going on and I
figured<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:13.780> going<00:01:14.770> into<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.070> healthcare

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
figured that going into the healthcare

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.630 
figured that going into the healthcare
field<00:01:15.610> was<00:01:15.850> was<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.299> good<00:01:16.659> choice<00:01:16.870> for<00:01:16.930> me

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
field was was a good choice for me

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.310 
field was was a good choice for me
well<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.670> looked<00:01:19.000> at<00:01:19.120> other<00:01:19.270> fields<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.869> looked

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320

radiology I felt that respiratory was a

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.969 
radiology I felt that respiratory was a
