that the end result of this will be that

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.949 
that the end result of this will be that

expulsion or worse will simply be not

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.199 
expulsion or worse will simply be not
they<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.459> won't<00:02:45.760> be<00:02:45.849> allowed<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.120> be

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
they just won't be allowed to be

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.610 
they just won't be allowed to be
punished<00:02:46.569> what<00:02:46.959> effect<00:02:47.200> do<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.290> think<00:02:47.500> this

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
punished what effect do you think this

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.619

is<00:02:47.739> going<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.220> on<00:02:48.489> success<00:02:49.090> rates<00:02:49.390> in

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
is going to have on success rates in

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.759 
is going to have on success rates in
tough<00:02:49.900> inner-city<00:02:50.470> schools<00:02:52.620> well<00:02:53.620> there<00:02:53.709> are

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
tough inner-city schools well there are

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:54.750 
tough inner-city schools well there are
a<00:02:53.799> couple<00:02:53.890> things<00:02:54.099> that<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:54.400> makes<00:02:54.609> you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
a couple things that this makes you

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.940 
a couple things that this makes you
think<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.150> number<00:02:55.450> one<00:02:55.659> do<00:02:55.959> they<00:02:56.109> believe<00:02:56.470> that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
think of number one do they believe that

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.039 
think of number one do they believe that
misbehavior<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:57.909> culturally<00:02:58.420> determined<00:02:58.569> and

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
misbehavior is culturally determined and

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.479 
misbehavior is culturally determined and
therefore<00:02:59.319> acceptable<00:02:59.859> if<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.069> come<00:03:00.220> from<00:03:00.430> a

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
therefore acceptable if you come from a

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.890 
therefore acceptable if you come from a
particular<00:03:00.639> culture<00:03:01.329> or<00:03:01.480> skin<00:03:01.720> color

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
particular culture or skin color

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.240 
particular culture or skin color
therefore<00:03:02.260> there's<00:03:02.709> nothing<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.010> can<00:03:03.159> do

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
therefore there's nothing you can do

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.339 
therefore there's nothing you can do
about<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.700> it's<00:03:04.060> just<00:03:04.329> genetically<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.139> you

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
about it it's just genetically in you

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.470 
about it it's just genetically in you
number<00:03:05.859> two<00:03:06.069> do<00:03:06.519> they<00:03:06.639> believe<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.329> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
number two do they believe that the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.720 
number two do they believe that the
