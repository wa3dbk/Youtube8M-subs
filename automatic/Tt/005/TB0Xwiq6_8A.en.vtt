00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
aren't as deep it looks a little

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.319 
aren't as deep it looks a little
oversaturated<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.559> also<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.730> detail

oversaturated a bit and also the detail
is<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.800> good<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.670> would<00:01:02.789> expect

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
is not as good as you would expect

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.200 
is not as good as you would expect
because<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.470> 720p<00:01:05.040> vs<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> 1080p

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
because this is going to 720p vs a 1080p

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.149 
because this is going to 720p vs a 1080p

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
cleaner not a placebo effect let's try

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.590 
cleaner not a placebo effect let's try
to<00:02:00.240> get<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:00.780> over<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:02.479> see<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to get this to go over it see the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.059 
to get this to go over it see the
difference

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.850 

it's<00:02:08.069> very<00:02:08.369> small<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:08.849> there's<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.479> difference

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
it's very small but there's a difference

right here very very good detail begin
to<00:03:11.910> me<00:03:12.030> we<00:03:12.180> can<00:03:12.329> go<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.810> grain<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:14.070> grain<00:03:14.910> of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
to me we can go to a grain a grain of

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.729 
to me we can go to a grain a grain of
sand<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.750> looks<00:03:15.930> still<00:03:16.320> pretty<00:03:16.530> good<00:03:16.709> a

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
sand and it looks still pretty good a

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.830 
sand and it looks still pretty good a
little<00:03:16.950> pixelated<00:03:17.400> but<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:17.820> still<00:03:17.970> really

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840

can see it but it's more pix elated and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.330 
can see it but it's more pix elated and
is<00:03:32.310> less<00:03:33.170> separation<00:03:34.170> between<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.709> grains<00:03:34.980> of

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
is less separation between the grains of

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.410 
is less separation between the grains of
sand<00:03:35.910> here<00:03:37.010> take<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.250> what<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.400> want<00:03:38.670> but

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.660 
sand here take it for what you want but
the<00:03:39.930> resolution<00:03:40.109> is<00:03:40.650> really<00:03:41.069> making<00:03:41.489> a

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
the resolution is really making a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.140 
the resolution is really making a
difference<00:03:42.859> on<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:44.430> right<00:03:44.639> side<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.060> looks

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
difference on the right side it looks

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.449 
difference on the right side it looks
more<00:03:45.420> pics<00:03:45.690> later<00:03:45.810> than<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.079> left<00:03:46.230> side<00:03:46.459> also

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
more pics later than the left side also

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.900 
more pics later than the left side also
the<00:03:48.120> color<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.720> an<00:03:49.139> exact<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:50.069> looks<00:03:50.280> more<00:03:50.609> has

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
the color is an exact it looks more has

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
take it for take with a grain of sand if

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.340 
take it for take with a grain of sand if
you<00:04:02.010> will<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:03.239> that's<00:04:03.389> another<00:04:03.630> example<00:04:04.049> of

you will so that's another example of
the<00:04:04.410> differences<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.579> screen<00:04:06.650> alright<00:04:07.650> so

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
the differences in the screen alright so

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.470 
the differences in the screen alright so
we're<00:04:07.980> going<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.160> watch<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.700> YouTube<00:04:09.299> video

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
comparison i'm going to go to the

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.610 
comparison i'm going to go to the
Google+<00:05:53.230> application<00:05:56.070> and<00:05:57.180> as<00:05:58.180> I<00:05:58.360> said<00:05:58.420> before

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
Google+ application and as I said before

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.020 
Google+ application and as I said before
the<00:05:59.620> right<00:05:59.830> side<00:06:00.100> is<00:06:00.280> more<00:06:00.460> of<00:06:00.520> a<00:06:00.580> cool<00:06:00.820> tone

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
the right side is more of a cool tone

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.100 
the right side is more of a cool tone
the<00:06:01.840> left<00:06:02.140> side<00:06:02.380> is<00:06:02.770> more<00:06:03.040> of<00:06:03.160> a<00:06:03.250> warm<00:06:03.610> tone<00:06:04.110> and

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
the left side is more of a warm tone and

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.140 
the left side is more of a warm tone and
we're<00:06:05.860> going<00:06:05.980> to<00:06:06.010> get<00:06:06.280> really<00:06:06.490> close<00:06:06.790> to<00:06:07.030> it

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
we're going to get really close to it

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:17.320 
we're going to get really close to it
and<00:06:07.240> see<00:06:07.390> if<00:06:07.510> we<00:06:07.630> see<00:06:07.840> any<00:06:08.020> differences

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.210 

it's<00:06:17.900> really<00:06:18.110> tough<00:06:18.349> to<00:06:18.379> for<00:06:18.800> this<00:06:18.889> camera<00:06:19.129> to

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
it's really tough to for this camera to

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.040 
it's really tough to for this camera to
pick<00:06:19.430> it<00:06:19.550> up<00:06:19.669> but<00:06:19.879> the<00:06:20.030> font<00:06:20.330> is<00:06:20.509> extremely

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
pick it up but the font is extremely

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.469 
pick it up but the font is extremely
crisp<00:06:21.379> I<00:06:21.680> can<00:06:22.340> read<00:06:22.550> it<00:06:22.669> from<00:06:22.699> a<00:06:22.909> really<00:06:23.300> good

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
crisp I can read it from a really good

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.839 
crisp I can read it from a really good
distance<00:06:23.870> and<00:06:24.530> I<00:06:24.710> can<00:06:24.860> really<00:06:25.099> actually<00:06:25.460> read

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
distance and I can really actually read

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.149 
distance and I can really actually read
the<00:06:26.000> text<00:06:26.449> fully<00:06:26.719> I<00:06:26.990> know<00:06:27.289> during<00:06:27.650> the<00:06:27.770> verge

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
the text fully I know during the verge
