00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
actual activator liquid so what you want

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.679 
actual activator liquid so what you want
is<00:01:22.110> 15<00:01:22.650> mil<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.400> each<00:01:23.549> four<00:01:23.880> eggs<00:01:24.119> okay<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
is 15 mil to each four eggs okay so you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.840 
is 15 mil to each four eggs okay so you
put<00:01:24.720> 30<00:01:25.200> mil<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:25.950> eight<00:01:26.100> eggs<00:01:26.310> we're

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
put 30 mil with your eight eggs we're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.520 
put 30 mil with your eight eggs we're
set<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.390> should<00:01:27.600> make<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.869> about<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> kilo

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
set up that should make you about a kilo

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.380 
set up that should make you about a kilo
of<00:01:28.560> bait<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.100> need<00:01:29.280> medium<00:01:29.490> sized<00:01:29.939> eggs<00:01:30.210> as

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
of bait you need medium sized eggs as

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
of bait you need medium sized eggs as
well<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:30.750> worth<00:01:30.930> pointing<00:01:31.229> out<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.040> whisk

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
well that's worth pointing out so whisk

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.670 
well that's worth pointing out so whisk
them<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:32.880> together<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.570> then<00:01:33.720> slowly<00:01:34.409> start

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
them all together and then slowly start

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.370 
them all together and then slowly start
adding<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> sell<00:01:35.880> base<00:01:36.119> mix<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:37.049> what<00:01:37.259> you're

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
be too hard that'll all start crumbling

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
be too hard that'll all start crumbling
you<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.259> too<00:01:46.560> soft<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.009> it

you don't want it to be too soft that it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.770 
you don't want it to be too soft that it
would<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.369> sort<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.640> too<00:01:47.880> pasty<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
would be sort of too pasty if you like

of it make sure you've got two or three
layers<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.739> cling<00:02:23.010> film<00:02:23.040> around<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.790> roll

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
layers of cling film around it so roll

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.420 
layers of cling film around it so roll
them<00:02:24.239> into<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.659> twist<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.469> ends<00:02:25.739> fold<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
them into it twist the ends fold the

them into it twist the ends fold the
ends<00:02:26.640> over<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.000> top<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.359> make<00:02:27.480> sure<00:02:27.510> they

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
ends over the top and make sure they

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.179 
ends over the top and make sure they
sort<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.959> stuck<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.620> outside<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.010> the

sort of stuck to the outside of the

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.039 
sort of stuck to the outside of the
cling<00:02:29.459> film<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.879> then<00:02:30.359> they're<00:02:30.480> ready<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.930> go

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
cling film and then they're ready to go

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.420 
cling film and then they're ready to go
in<00:02:31.139> the<00:02:31.230> water<00:02:31.379> now<00:02:31.769> what<00:02:31.980> you're<00:02:32.099> going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> do

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
in the water now what you're going to do

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.190 
in the water now what you're going to do
is<00:02:32.519> you're<00:02:32.609> actually<00:02:32.849> gonna<00:02:32.939> steam<00:02:33.329> these<00:02:33.599> for

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
is you're actually gonna steam these for

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.110 
is you're actually gonna steam these for
12<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.739> 16<00:02:35.219> minutes<00:02:35.519> depending<00:02:35.909> on<00:02:36.030> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
12 to 16 minutes depending on the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.479 
12 to 16 minutes depending on the
diameter<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.930> your<00:02:37.019> sausages<00:02:37.889> okay

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
diameter of your sausages okay

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.699 
diameter of your sausages okay
I've<00:02:38.819> seen<00:02:39.209> these<00:02:39.389> ones<00:02:39.629> for<00:02:39.750> 14<00:02:40.230> minutes<00:02:40.439> and

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709
