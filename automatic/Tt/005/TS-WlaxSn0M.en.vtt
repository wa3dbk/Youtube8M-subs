00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.049
 ike Baptist who declared back to 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.840
 middle class a gigantic boat there that 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.079

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.490
 so we created five reasons why 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:57.920
 which to return to the middle class is a thump 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:02.179
 gigantic for which Baptist struck the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.119
 curb hefty toast that you 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:10.220

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.549
 with synthetic wires fit in the budget but 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.860
