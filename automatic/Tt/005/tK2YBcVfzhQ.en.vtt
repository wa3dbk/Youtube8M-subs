all<00:00:02.909> right<00:00:03.060> so<00:00:03.210> today<00:00:03.389> we're<00:00:03.540> looking<00:00:03.600> at<00:00:03.780> the

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
all right so today we're looking at the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.369 
all right so today we're looking at the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
Forster m65 RGB Gaming Mouse at the same

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.839 
Forster m65 RGB Gaming Mouse at the same
time<00:00:07.649> we're<00:00:07.859> also<00:00:08.040> going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.250> look<00:00:08.340> at<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.550> mm

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
time we're also going to look at the mm

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.150 
time we're also going to look at the mm
600<00:00:09.420> miles<00:00:09.750> pad<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.260> kind<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.559> goes<00:00:10.740> with<00:00:10.769> it

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
600 miles pad that kind of goes with it

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.919 
600 miles pad that kind of goes with it
and<00:00:11.400> pretty<00:00:12.120> much<00:00:12.240> complements<00:00:12.690> are<00:00:12.750> really

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
and pretty much complements are really

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.919 
and pretty much complements are really
nice<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.860> m65<00:00:14.490> RGB<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.120> as<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.630> can<00:00:15.750> guess

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
nice so the m65 RGB is as you can guess

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.609 
nice so the m65 RGB is as you can guess
it<00:00:16.109> pretty<00:00:16.379> much<00:00:16.500> exactly<00:00:17.070> like<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.510> m65<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
it pretty much exactly like the m65 the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.529 
it pretty much exactly like the m65 the
original<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.340> comes<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.670> black<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.390> in

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
original one it comes in black and in

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.540 
original one it comes in black and in
white<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:21.990> whichever<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.500> prefer<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:23.400> can

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
white so whichever you prefer you can

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000 
white so whichever you prefer you can
get<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.359> more<00:00:24.600> or<00:00:24.660> less<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:24.840> exactly<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
get but more or less it's exactly the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.400 
get but more or less it's exactly the
same<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.519> only<00:00:26.550> difference<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
same the only difference is is that it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.189 
same the only difference is is that it
has<00:00:28.619> sixteen<00:00:29.279> point<00:00:29.550> eight<00:00:29.730> million<00:00:30.359> colors

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
has sixteen point eight million colors

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.530 
has sixteen point eight million colors
of<00:00:31.410> lighting<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:33.180> actually<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
of lighting on here so it's actually a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.049 
of lighting on here so it's actually a
three<00:00:33.960> zone<00:00:33.989> lighting<00:00:34.530> setup<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.010> each<00:00:35.730> one

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
three zone lighting setup and each one

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.790 
three zone lighting setup and each one
can<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.270> its<00:00:36.480> individual<00:00:37.050> set<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> sixteen

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
can have its individual set of sixteen

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
can have its individual set of sixteen
point<00:00:38.040> eight<00:00:38.190> million<00:00:38.670> colors<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.420> entire

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
point eight million colors or the entire

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.260 
point eight million colors or the entire
RGB<00:00:40.320> gamut<00:00:40.730> spectrum<00:00:41.730> whatever<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.059> want<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
RGB gamut spectrum whatever you want to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.639 
RGB gamut spectrum whatever you want to
call<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.260> unibody

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
call it it's got the unibody

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.380 
call it it's got the unibody
construction<00:00:43.800> which<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.940> nice<00:00:45.090> an

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
construction which is really nice an

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.740 
construction which is really nice an
8200<00:00:45.989> dpi<00:00:46.219> laser<00:00:47.219> sensor<00:00:47.640> which<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> Vigo

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
8200 dpi laser sensor which is the Vigo

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.770 
8200 dpi laser sensor which is the Vigo
18s<00:00:49.200> 8900<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> custom<00:00:51.239> weighting

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
18s 8900 it's got a custom weighting

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.350 
18s 8900 it's got a custom weighting
system<00:00:51.960> got<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> sniper<00:00:52.920> button<00:00:53.399> which<00:00:53.820> will

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
system got a sniper button which will

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.450 
system got a sniper button which will
let<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.690> go<00:00:54.870> ahead<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> reduce<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
let you go ahead and kind of reduce the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
let you go ahead and kind of reduce the
sensitivity<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.210> when<00:00:57.329> you're<00:00:57.420> zoomed<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
sensitivity so when you're zoomed in a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.540 
sensitivity so when you're zoomed in a
sniping<00:00:58.469> mode<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.280> bit

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
sniping mode you can get a little bit

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
sniping mode you can get a little bit
more<00:00:59.670> control<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.600> got<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> braided<00:01:01.020> cable

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
more control it's got a braided cable

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
more control it's got a braided cable
which<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:02.039> six<00:01:02.219> feet<00:01:02.399> long<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.730> case

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
which is actually six feet long in case

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.420 
which is actually six feet long in case
you're<00:01:03.030> curious<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.840> has<00:01:04.110> onboard<00:01:04.589> memory<00:01:04.949> so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you're curious it has onboard memory so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.570 
you're curious it has onboard memory so
if<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.420> use<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.659> mouse<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.020> home<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.580> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
if you use this mouse at home and you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210 
if you use this mouse at home and you
are<00:01:09.090> also<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> land<00:01:10.590> parties<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.100> let's

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
are also going to land parties and let's

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.440 
are also going to land parties and let's
say<00:01:11.340> you're<00:01:11.490> using<00:01:11.520> someone<00:01:11.909> else's<00:01:12.000> system

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
say you're using someone else's system

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
say you're using someone else's system
or<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> gaming<00:01:13.229> laptop<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:14.130> can

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
or you have a gaming laptop you can

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280 
or you have a gaming laptop you can
store<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:14.670> game<00:01:15.090> profiles<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.080> top

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
store your game profiles on here on top

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
store your game profiles on here on top
of<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.740> got<00:01:16.890> switchable<00:01:17.670> polling

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of that it's got switchable polling

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730 
of that it's got switchable polling
rates<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> refresh<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
rates so if you want to refresh it at a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
rates so if you want to refresh it at a
thousand<00:01:20.159> five<00:01:20.310> hundred<00:01:20.430> 250<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:21.119> 125<00:01:21.720> Hertz

what's cool about it is it has three
millimeters<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.070> aluminum<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:58.270> not<00:02:58.660> soft

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
millimeters of aluminum so it's not soft
