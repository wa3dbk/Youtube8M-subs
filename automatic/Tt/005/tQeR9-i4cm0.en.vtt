from<00:00:38.700> microsoft<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.440> definitely<00:00:40.739> not

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
from microsoft so this is definitely not

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
from microsoft so this is definitely not
one<00:00:41.460> hundred<00:00:41.610> percent<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.540> I'm<00:00:42.870> guessing<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
one hundred percent but I'm guessing it

kind<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.189> sucks<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> bummer<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
kind of sucks and kind of is a bummer I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.249 
kind of sucks and kind of is a bummer I
think<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> end<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.729> gamers<00:01:27.150> win<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.810> look

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
think in the end the gamers win I look

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.780 
think in the end the gamers win I look
at<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> game<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.770> The<00:01:28.950> Witcher<00:01:29.220> 3<00:01:29.250> being

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
at a game like The Witcher 3 being

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.020 
at a game like The Witcher 3 being
delayed<00:01:30.119> over<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.750> over<00:01:30.869> again<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:32.220> really

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
delayed over and over again and I really

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.550 
delayed over and over again and I really
think<00:01:33.240> once<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.689> game<00:01:33.900> comes<00:01:34.110> out<00:01:34.320> it's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
think once this game comes out it's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.319 
think once this game comes out it's
gonna<00:01:34.770> blow<00:01:35.040> people's<00:01:35.460> minds<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.210> it's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
gonna blow people's minds I think it's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.910 
gonna blow people's minds I think it's
going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.049> best<00:01:37.320> games<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
going to be one of the best games this

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.550 
going to be one of the best games this
year<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:39.180> when<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.380> our

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
year and I think when we get it in our

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.859 
year and I think when we get it in our
hands<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.979> wait<00:01:41.340> will<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.700> worth<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.840> I

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
hands the wait will be worth it so I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.170 
hands the wait will be worth it so I
definitely<00:01:43.350> believe<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.100> rumor<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.579> true<00:01:44.820> we

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
definitely believe this rumor is true we

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
definitely believe this rumor is true we
will<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.869> will<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.439> Microsoft

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
will see we will see if Microsoft
