is<00:00:51.930> into<00:00:52.289> being<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.879> movie

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
is into being this so this is a movie

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.619 
is into being this so this is a movie
where<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:56.670> guess<00:00:58.219> we<00:00:59.219> broadcast<00:01:00.000> out<00:01:00.180> somehow

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
where I guess we broadcast out somehow

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
where I guess we broadcast out somehow
into<00:01:00.840> space<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.710> fact<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.129> play<00:01:02.309> video

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
into space the fact that we play video

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
into space the fact that we play video
games<00:01:02.820> where<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.149> gets<00:01:03.239> out<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.930> so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
games where that gets out there and so

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
games where that gets out there and so
the<00:01:04.559> aliens<00:01:04.860> interpret<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.970> guess<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the aliens interpret that as I guess a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.899 
the aliens interpret that as I guess a
way<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> attack<00:01:07.140> us<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> inspiration<00:01:08.820> of

a needle to something and then run it

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.429 
a needle to something and then run it
and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:43.799> kind<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.700> put<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> cone<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and then kind of put a cone on it and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.859 
and then kind of put a cone on it and
then<00:01:46.680> basically<00:01:47.430> -<00:01:47.700> yet<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.180> move<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> around<00:01:48.659> I

then basically - yet to move it around I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.179 
then basically - yet to move it around I
have<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.020> feeling<00:01:49.290> I'll<00:01:49.380> whoever<00:01:49.590> discovers<00:01:50.040> X

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

tight hold on being in the movie sure

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.670 
tight hold on being in the movie sure
but<00:05:56.639> you<00:05:56.699> don't<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.930> don't<00:05:58.139> need<00:05:58.349> it<00:05:58.529> because
