I<00:00:23.250> really<00:00:24.000> know<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.119> they're<00:00:24.300> actually

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
I really know what they're actually

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.679 
I really know what they're actually
called<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.020> scares<00:00:25.320> Dawn<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.300> I<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.599> it's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
called but scares Dawn and I think it's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.060 
called but scares Dawn and I think it's
about<00:00:27.840> time<00:00:28.050> snowboarders<00:00:28.619> took<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.860> trick

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
about time snowboarders took a trick

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:40.310 
about time snowboarders took a trick
from<00:00:29.160> skiers<00:00:37.880> all<00:00:38.880> right<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.210> basically<00:00:39.630> if

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
from skiers all right so basically if

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.350 
from skiers all right so basically if
you<00:00:40.410> want<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.710> learn<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.160> these<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you want to learn one of these it's a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.600 
you want to learn one of these it's a
really<00:00:42.690> simple<00:00:42.870> trick<00:00:43.290> kind<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> looks<00:00:44.280> kind

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
really simple trick kind of looks kind

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
really simple trick kind of looks kind
of<00:00:44.700> hard<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.989> involves<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
of hard but all it involves is a bit of

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.189 
of hard but all it involves is a bit of
commitment<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.879> basically<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.960> want<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
commitment so basically you want to

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.599 
commitment so basically you want to
approach<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.710> knuckle<00:00:50.039> first<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
approach the knuckle first of all you

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.369 
approach the knuckle first of all you
got<00:00:50.699> to<00:00:50.789> find<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.089> big<00:00:51.300> knuckle<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.929> off<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> big

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
got to find a big knuckle so off a big

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.000 
got to find a big knuckle so off a big
jump<00:00:52.679> one<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.370> parish's<00:00:53.820> pretty<00:00:54.059> good<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
jump one at parish's pretty good and you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.139 
jump one at parish's pretty good and you
would<00:00:56.129> approach<00:00:56.429> it<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.609> you're<00:00:56.850> doing<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
would approach it like you're doing a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.819 
would approach it like you're doing a
back<00:00:57.329> three<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:57.929> of<00:00:57.989> meal<00:00:58.170> style<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
back three kind of meal style like a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.430 
back three kind of meal style like a
hand<00:00:59.070> drag<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.609> then<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:00.659> you<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.929> is<00:01:00.960> here

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
hand drag and then what you do is here

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.770 
hand drag and then what you do is here
about<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.249> meter<00:01:02.640> from<00:01:03.089> the<00:01:03.239> tip<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
about a meter from the tip of the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.660 
about a meter from the tip of the
knuckle<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.680> got<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:04.890> pop<00:01:05.070> off<00:01:05.280> your<00:01:05.460> toe<00:01:05.640> edge

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
knuckle you got to pop off your toe edge

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.690 
knuckle you got to pop off your toe edge
place<00:01:06.630> both<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.200> hands<00:01:07.650> down<00:01:08.190> on<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.430> ground

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700

and kick your legs out the back out
behind<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.730> and<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.720> once<00:01:12.960> you're<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.170> that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
position there all you got to do is just

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.960 
position there all you got to do is just
