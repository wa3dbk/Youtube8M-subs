00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860

knew at the time that it made it there's
a<00:02:50.620> great<00:02:50.920> deal<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.190> maturing<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.120> went<00:02:52.360> on

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
a great deal of maturing that went on

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.360 
a great deal of maturing that went on
between<00:02:52.600> these<00:02:52.990> two<00:02:53.140> projects<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:54.190> guess

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
between these two projects but guess

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.060 
between these two projects but guess
what<00:02:54.550> guys<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.030> can't<00:02:55.510> get<00:02:55.690> here<00:02:56.110> unless<00:02:56.860> you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
what guys you can't get here unless you

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.770 
what guys you can't get here unless you
start<00:02:57.340> there<00:02:57.640> we<00:02:57.850> all<00:02:58.060> start<00:02:58.420> at<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.630> bottom

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
start there we all start at the bottom

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.830 
start there we all start at the bottom
and<00:02:59.080> we<00:02:59.590> have<00:02:59.800> to<00:03:00.010> grow<00:03:00.310> but<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.940> won't<00:03:01.390> grow

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
and we have to grow but you won't grow

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.660 
and we have to grow but you won't grow
and<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.860> secret<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.220> woodworking

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
and this is the secret to woodworking

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.480 
and this is the secret to woodworking
you<00:03:04.420> won't<00:03:04.690> grow<00:03:04.990> unless<00:03:05.320> you<00:03:05.620> get<00:03:05.920> out<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
you won't grow unless you get out in the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.090 
you won't grow unless you get out in the
shop<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.090> get<00:03:07.690> woodworking<00:03:08.380> you've<00:03:08.770> got<00:03:08.980> to

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
shop and get woodworking you've got to

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.699 
shop and get woodworking you've got to
put<00:03:09.250> hands<00:03:09.580> on<00:03:09.700> tools<00:03:10.000> tools<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.110> material<00:03:11.590> and

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
put hands on tools tools to material and

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.130 
put hands on tools tools to material and
start<00:03:11.980> building<00:03:12.520> projects<00:03:13.180> if<00:03:13.360> you're<00:03:13.959> not

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
start building projects if you're not

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.720 
start building projects if you're not
building<00:03:14.410> projects<00:03:15.040> you're<00:03:15.160> not<00:03:15.340> developing

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
building projects you're not developing

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.210 
building projects you're not developing
that<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.050> beating<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.500> path<00:03:17.740> from<00:03:17.980> your

that and beating that path from your

that and beating that path from your
brain<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.640> your<00:03:18.820> hands<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.600> have<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.050> you<00:03:20.380> have

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
brain to your hands you have to you have

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.110 
brain to your hands you have to you have
to<00:03:20.920> make<00:03:21.160> those<00:03:21.310> connections<00:03:21.550> from<00:03:21.910> your

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
to make those connections from your

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.610 
to make those connections from your
brain<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.330> your<00:03:22.540> hands<00:03:22.780> you're<00:03:23.200> only<00:03:23.320> going<00:03:23.560> to

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
brain to your hands you're only going to

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.260 
brain to your hands you're only going to
do<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.400> get<00:03:24.580> out<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.850> shop<00:03:25.060> and

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
do that if you get out in the shop and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.210 
do that if you get out in the shop and
get<00:03:25.660> woodworking<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.860> make<00:03:27.040> those

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
get woodworking to make those

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.970 
get woodworking to make those
connections<00:03:27.459> from<00:03:28.000> repetition<00:03:28.680> also<00:03:29.680> you're

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
connections from repetition also you're

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.590 
connections from repetition also you're
going<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.190> develop<00:03:30.430> your<00:03:30.700> design<00:03:31.030> sense<00:03:31.390> if

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
going to develop your design sense if

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.259 
going to develop your design sense if
you<00:03:32.050> get<00:03:32.320> out<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:33.220> get<00:03:33.519> woodworking

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
you get out and you get woodworking

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.820 
you get out and you get woodworking
first<00:03:34.720> you're<00:03:34.870> going<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.050> start<00:03:35.290> off<00:03:35.440> building

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
first you're going to start off building

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.009 
first you're going to start off building
projects<00:03:36.280> probably<00:03:36.790> from<00:03:37.060> plans<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.600> whether

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
projects probably from plans and whether

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.199 
projects probably from plans and whether
you<00:03:38.110> follow<00:03:38.410> them<00:03:38.680> closely<00:03:39.160> or<00:03:39.580> loosely

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
you follow them closely or loosely

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.590 
you follow them closely or loosely
you're<00:03:40.959> going<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.140> be<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:42.130> making<00:03:43.120> what<00:03:43.450> else

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
you're going to be just making what else

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.320 
you're going to be just making what else
is<00:03:43.840> out<00:03:43.989> there<00:03:44.050> and<00:03:44.500> that's<00:03:45.010> fine<00:03:45.370> because<00:03:45.640> you

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
is out there and that's fine because you

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.460 
is out there and that's fine because you
need<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.600> start<00:03:46.810> building<00:03:47.140> that<00:03:47.170> repetition

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
need to start building that repetition

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.490 
need to start building that repetition
that<00:03:48.100> we<00:03:48.610> talked<00:03:48.850> about<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.390> then<00:03:49.600> you'll

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
that we talked about and then you'll

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.140 
that we talked about and then you'll
start<00:03:50.800> getting<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:51.130> sense<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.580> design<00:03:51.940> and

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
start getting a sense of design and

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.479 
start getting a sense of design and
proportions<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.019> how<00:03:53.140> one<00:03:53.380> piece<00:03:53.590> relates<00:03:54.340> to

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
proportions and how one piece relates to

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.580 
proportions and how one piece relates to
another<00:03:54.730> you'll<00:03:54.940> also<00:03:55.090> learn<00:03:55.930> how<00:03:55.989> things<00:03:56.200> are

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
another you'll also learn how things are

these<00:03:59.110> two<00:03:59.320> pieces<00:03:59.560> in<00:04:00.070> my<00:04:00.250> woodworking

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
these two pieces in my woodworking

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.850 
these two pieces in my woodworking
journey<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.150> made<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.390> table<00:04:01.870> with<00:04:02.140> what<00:04:02.650> kind<00:04:02.830> of

journey I made a table with what kind of

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.259 
journey I made a table with what kind of
asian-inspired<00:04:03.220> legs<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.850> was<00:04:03.940> made<00:04:04.120> out<00:04:04.150> of

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
asian-inspired legs it was made out of

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.210 
asian-inspired legs it was made out of
mahogany<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.170> table<00:04:05.530> was<00:04:05.650> beautiful<00:04:06.070> is

mahogany and the table was beautiful is

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.310 
mahogany and the table was beautiful is
really<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.730> point<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.510> threshold<00:04:08.110> that<00:04:08.170> I

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
really the point the threshold that I

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.560 
really the point the threshold that I
stepped<00:04:08.620> across<00:04:08.769> when<00:04:09.610> I<00:04:09.640> felt<00:04:10.060> like<00:04:10.239> that<00:04:10.540> I

stepped across when I felt like that I

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.860 
stepped across when I felt like that I
was<00:04:10.870> starting<00:04:11.820> my<00:04:12.820> foray<00:04:13.120> into<00:04:13.510> fine

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
little secret about that I did I had

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.970 
little secret about that I did I had
this<00:04:51.340> great<00:04:51.670> idea<00:04:51.730> of<00:04:52.210> making<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.320> table<00:04:53.770> but

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
this great idea of making this table but

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.680 
this great idea of making this table but
I<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.520> really<00:04:54.940> didn't<00:04:55.150> know<00:04:55.210> anything<00:04:55.240> about

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
I I really didn't know anything about

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.150 
I I really didn't know anything about
joinery<00:04:56.320> so<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:57.070> first<00:04:57.640> I<00:04:57.820> cut<00:04:58.030> biscuits<00:04:58.750> in

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
joinery so I first I cut biscuits in

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.890 
joinery so I first I cut biscuits in
slots<00:05:00.160> in<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.460> end<00:05:00.700> of<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.120> stretchers<00:05:01.600> and

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
slots in the end of the stretchers and

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.750 
slots in the end of the stretchers and
in<00:05:02.230> the<00:05:02.350> legs<00:05:02.560> for<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.860> mating<00:05:03.130> pieces<00:05:03.550> and

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
in the legs for the mating pieces and

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.640 
in the legs for the mating pieces and
then<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.300> started<00:05:04.660> putting<00:05:04.810> them<00:05:05.050> together<00:05:05.200> and

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
then I started putting them together and

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.380 
then I started putting them together and
then<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.770> realized<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:06.490> started<00:05:07.090> thinking<00:05:07.330> to

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
then I realized I started thinking to

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.060 
then I realized I started thinking to
myself<00:05:07.480> well<00:05:08.350> that's<00:05:08.530> not<00:05:08.710> going<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.950> hold

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
myself well that's not going to hold

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.590 
myself well that's not going to hold
biscuits<00:05:09.490> aren't<00:05:09.670> going<00:05:09.790> to<00:05:09.850> hold<00:05:10.030> so<00:05:10.390> then<00:05:10.540> I

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
biscuits aren't going to hold so then I

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.930 
biscuits aren't going to hold so then I
put<00:05:10.780> pocket<00:05:11.110> screws<00:05:11.380> into<00:05:11.620> so<00:05:12.340> here<00:05:12.790> this

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
put pocket screws into so here this

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.550 
put pocket screws into so here this
really<00:05:13.270> nice<00:05:13.420> sophisticated<00:05:13.720> looking<00:05:14.500> piece

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
really nice sophisticated looking piece

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.880 
really nice sophisticated looking piece
of<00:05:15.280> woodwork<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.910> had<00:05:16.510> at<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:17.080> time<00:05:17.260> I<00:05:17.560> had<00:05:17.860> a

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
of woodwork I had at that time I had a

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.220 
of woodwork I had at that time I had a
great<00:05:18.160> idea<00:05:18.340> my<00:05:19.060> finish<00:05:19.510> work<00:05:19.840> actually

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
great idea my finish work actually

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.260 
great idea my finish work actually
spraying<00:05:21.040> finishes<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.700> was<00:05:21.910> getting<00:05:22.150> very

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
spraying finishes I was getting very

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.360 
spraying finishes I was getting very
good<00:05:22.390> at<00:05:22.540> that<00:05:22.720> time<00:05:22.960> at<00:05:23.140> doing<00:05:23.380> that<00:05:23.530> and<00:05:23.800> I

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370
