00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
over just like this this will be the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.660

you make them because we all make

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.749 
you make them because we all make
mistakes<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.920> then<00:02:09.100> I'm<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.250> going<00:02:09.670> to

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
mistakes and then I'm just going to

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.480 
mistakes and then I'm just going to
extend<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.330> wing<00:02:10.509> outward<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.350> kind<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.710> make

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
extend the wing outward and kind of make

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.920 
extend the wing outward and kind of make
it<00:02:12.520> like<00:02:12.760> it's<00:02:12.970> coming<00:02:13.240> from<00:02:13.360> my<00:02:13.510> lower<00:02:13.660> lash

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
it like it's coming from my lower lash

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.130 
it like it's coming from my lower lash
line<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.500> go<00:02:15.100> um<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.910> little<00:02:16.210> bit<00:02:16.420> further<00:02:16.720> than

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
line and go um a little bit further than

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.020 
line and go um a little bit further than
your<00:02:17.350> crease<00:02:17.740> line<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.430> then<00:02:18.610> as<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.910> can

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
your crease line is and then as you can

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.840 
your crease line is and then as you can
see<00:02:19.270> here<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:20.170> fill<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.100> line<00:02:21.400> where<00:02:21.700> your

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
see here just fill in a line where your

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.300 
see here just fill in a line where your
crease<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.360> just<00:02:22.720> just<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.560> line<00:02:23.770> where<00:02:24.100> your

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
crease is just just a line where your

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.760 
crease is just just a line where your
crease<00:02:24.610> fold<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:28.240> then<00:02:28.540> fill<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.500> tip

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
crease fold is and then fill in the tip

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.120 
crease fold is and then fill in the tip
of<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.130> eyeliner<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.200> line<00:02:32.740> of<00:02:32.770> the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
of the eyeliner to that line of the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.910 
of the eyeliner to that line of the
crease<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.480> I'm<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.900> lining<00:02:35.140> my<00:02:35.560> lower

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
crease and I'm just lining my lower

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.010 
crease and I'm just lining my lower
waterline<00:02:36.130> with<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.850> white<00:02:37.180> eyeliner<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.930> this

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
waterline with a white eyeliner and this

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.590 
waterline with a white eyeliner and this
will<00:02:38.170> really<00:02:38.320> make<00:02:38.530> your<00:02:38.680> eyes<00:02:38.860> pop

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.410 

for<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.410> lips<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.830> have<00:02:43.010> chosen<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.670> rosy<00:02:44.180> color

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
for the lips I have chosen a rosy color

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.510 
for the lips I have chosen a rosy color
because<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.320> think<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.650> complements<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.370> eyes

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
because I think it complements the eyes

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:56.740 
because I think it complements the eyes
very<00:02:46.760> nicely

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.030 

next<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.140> call<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.680> fish<00:02:58.860> eye

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
next I like to call this the fish eye

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.160 
next I like to call this the fish eye
and<00:02:59.460> it's<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.820> little<00:02:59.940> bit<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.420> twist<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:01.080> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
and it's a little bit of a twist to the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.440 
and it's a little bit of a twist to the
normal<00:03:01.500> fish<00:03:01.740> one<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.580> first<00:03:02.850> just<00:03:03.090> create

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
normal fish one so first just create

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.800 
normal fish one so first just create
your<00:03:03.600> wing<00:03:04.130> outward<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.490> make<00:03:06.300> sure<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.660> can

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
your wing outward and make sure you can

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.570 
your wing outward and make sure you can
create<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.380> as<00:03:07.530> thick<00:03:07.770> as<00:03:07.950> you'd<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.130> and

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
create it as thick as you'd like and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.850 
create it as thick as you'd like and
then<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.480> want<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.810> create<00:03:10.080> something<00:03:10.170> very

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
then you want to create something very

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.400 
then you want to create something very
symmetrical<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.820> top<00:03:12.150> line<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:13.230> what

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
symmetrical to the top line so what

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.010 
symmetrical to the top line so what
you're<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> do<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:13.950> just<00:03:14.130> create<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.450> line

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
you're going to do is just create a line

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.900 
you're going to do is just create a line
as<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.440> see<00:03:16.620> here<00:03:16.890> pointing<00:03:17.340> downwards

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
as you can see here pointing downwards

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.780 
as you can see here pointing downwards
and<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:18.830> bring<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.980> line<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.430> your<00:03:20.580> lower

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
and then bring the line on your lower

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.060 
and then bring the line on your lower
lashline<00:03:21.300> but<00:03:21.600> don't<00:03:21.780> connect<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.410> exactly<00:03:22.950> to

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
lashline but don't connect it exactly to

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.370 
lashline but don't connect it exactly to
your<00:03:23.310> waterline<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.540> leave<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> space<00:03:25.140> in

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
your waterline so leave a space in

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.360 
your waterline so leave a space in
between<00:03:25.410> both<00:03:26.160> lines<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.850> then<00:03:26.940> fill<00:03:27.210> them<00:03:27.390> in

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
between both lines and then fill them in

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:37.460 
between both lines and then fill them in
jump<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.580> high<00:03:29.610> touch<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.690> clouds<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.260> from

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
jump so high touch the clouds so from

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.740 
jump so high touch the clouds so from
that<00:03:37.500> space<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.010> can<00:03:38.610> add<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> color<00:03:39.330> or<00:03:39.630> you

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
that space you can add a color or you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.090 
that space you can add a color or you
can<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:39.990> leave<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.320> how<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.500> was<00:03:40.740> but<00:03:40.980> i'm

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.120 

the<00:04:01.880> next<00:04:02.180> one<00:04:02.360> is<00:04:02.390> pretty<00:04:03.020> edgy<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:03.860> it's<00:04:04.010> a

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
the next one is pretty edgy but it's a

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.490 
the next one is pretty edgy but it's a
twist<00:04:04.430> from<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.760> normal<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.300> thick<00:04:06.020> eyeliner

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
twist from the normal a thick eyeliner

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.100 
twist from the normal a thick eyeliner
so<00:04:06.740> start<00:04:07.490> off<00:04:07.610> with<00:04:07.850> your<00:04:08.030> base<00:04:08.300> I<00:04:08.630> line<00:04:08.930> as

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
so start off with your base I line as

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.740 
so start off with your base I line as
you<00:04:09.230> can<00:04:09.410> see<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.980> then<00:04:10.670> just<00:04:11.180> go<00:04:11.330> on<00:04:11.569> your

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
you can see and then just go on your

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.470 
you can see and then just go on your
lower<00:04:11.959> lash<00:04:12.319> line<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.890> fill<00:04:13.610> it<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:13.940> basically

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
lower lash line and fill it in basically

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.569 
lower lash line and fill it in basically
halfway<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.410> then<00:04:15.470> extend<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.070> outward

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
halfway and then extend that outward

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.990 
halfway and then extend that outward
into<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:17.480> wing<00:04:17.900> shape<00:04:21.400> then<00:04:22.400> you<00:04:22.550> want<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.790> take

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
into a wing shape then you want to take

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.580 
into a wing shape then you want to take
from<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.390> way<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:23.720> want<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.080> create<00:04:24.290> a<00:04:24.350> line

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
from that way you want to create a line

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.400 
from that way you want to create a line
going<00:04:24.800> in<00:04:25.100> halfway<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.790> your<00:04:26.090> crease<00:04:26.419> and<00:04:26.720> then

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
going in halfway to your crease and then

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
create a half circle from that line

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.090 
create a half circle from that line
connecting<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.460> your<00:04:31.490> upper<00:04:32.350> water<00:04:33.350> lash<00:04:33.830> line

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.629 

so<00:04:53.629> last<00:04:53.900> one<00:04:54.169> is<00:04:54.349> an<00:04:54.529> interesting<00:04:55.159> twist<00:04:55.430> on

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
so last one is an interesting twist on

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.010 
so last one is an interesting twist on
the<00:04:55.999> normal<00:04:56.330> cat<00:04:56.599> eye<00:04:58.389> so<00:04:59.389> start<00:04:59.659> off<00:04:59.809> with

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
the normal cat eye so start off with

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.290 
the normal cat eye so start off with
your<00:05:00.139> base<00:05:00.379> eyeliner<00:05:00.979> then<00:05:01.610> go<00:05:01.849> into<00:05:02.089> the

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
your base eyeliner then go into the

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.909 
your base eyeliner then go into the
inner<00:05:02.449> corners<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.169> create<00:05:03.469> a<00:05:03.499> triangle

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
inner corners and create a triangle

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.170 
inner corners and create a triangle
shape<00:05:04.569> extending<00:05:05.569> your<00:05:06.349> inner<00:05:06.680> corner<00:05:07.219> area

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.790 

this<00:05:11.180> will<00:05:11.389> give<00:05:11.539> it<00:05:11.659> that<00:05:11.809> array<00:05:12.199> bukh<00:05:12.439> feel

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
this will give it that array bukh feel

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.429 
this will give it that array bukh feel
and<00:05:13.099> then<00:05:13.699> in<00:05:13.939> the<00:05:14.059> outer<00:05:14.240> corner<00:05:14.870> start

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:15.439 
and then in the outer corner start

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.559 
and then in the outer corner start
creating<00:05:15.770> your<00:05:15.949> wing<00:05:16.309> and<00:05:16.669> really<00:05:17.089> make<00:05:17.360> sure

creating your wing and really make sure
to<00:05:17.779> kind<00:05:17.990> of<00:05:18.050> extend<00:05:18.379> the<00:05:18.710> wing<00:05:18.860> don't<00:05:19.159> make<00:05:19.430> it

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
to kind of extend the wing don't make it

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.059 
to kind of extend the wing don't make it
point<00:05:20.300> upward<00:05:20.779> too<00:05:20.990> much<00:05:21.169> but<00:05:21.409> more<00:05:21.620> elongated

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
point upward too much but more elongated

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.860 
point upward too much but more elongated
the<00:05:22.610> eye

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.780 

and<00:05:27.870> then<00:05:28.260> create<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.680> line<00:05:28.920> parallel<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:29.520> that

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
and then create a line parallel to that

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.750 
and then create a line parallel to that
line<00:05:30.110> underneath<00:05:31.110> it<00:05:31.530> leaving<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.250> space<00:05:32.400> in

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
line underneath it leaving a space in

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:43.620 
line underneath it leaving a space in
between<00:05:32.910> both<00:05:33.390> lines

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:51.360 

I<00:05:43.770> mean

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.210 

and<00:05:51.790> for<00:05:52.660> the<00:05:52.780> lips<00:05:52.960> I'm<00:05:53.199> just<00:05:53.350> dabbing<00:05:54.100> a

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
and for the lips I'm just dabbing a

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.280 
and for the lips I'm just dabbing a
small<00:05:54.610> amount<00:05:54.910> of<00:05:55.120> red<00:05:55.360> lipstick<00:05:55.900> so<00:05:56.110> it'll

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
small amount of red lipstick so it'll

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.620 
small amount of red lipstick so it'll
give<00:05:56.470> me<00:05:56.650> that<00:05:56.800> red<00:05:57.070> tint<00:05:57.460> but<00:05:57.970> not<00:05:58.210> pull<00:05:58.510> out

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
give me that red tint but not pull out

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.090 
give me that red tint but not pull out
the<00:05:58.870> red<00:05:59.050> lips<00:05:59.320> because<00:05:59.620> I<00:05:59.680> think<00:05:59.889> that<00:06:00.010> would

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
the red lips because I think that would

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.610 
the red lips because I think that would
be<00:06:00.250> a<00:06:00.280> little<00:06:00.460> too<00:06:00.729> much<00:06:01.080> so<00:06:02.080> that<00:06:02.110> is<00:06:02.500> the
