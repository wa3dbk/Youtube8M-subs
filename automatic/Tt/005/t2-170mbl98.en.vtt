comes<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.510> box<00:00:24.750> which<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.080> entirely<00:00:25.470> too<00:00:25.949> big

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
comes in a box which is entirely too big

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.830 
comes in a box which is entirely too big
they've<00:00:26.849> reprinted<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> couple<00:00:27.810> times

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
they've reprinted this a couple times

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.599 
they've reprinted this a couple times
they've<00:00:28.260> done<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.710> least<00:00:28.949> once<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.519> a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
they've done it at least once in a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.880 
they've done it at least once in a
future<00:00:29.970> sci-fi<00:00:30.449> setting<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.560> kind<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
future sci-fi setting which is kind of a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.350 
future sci-fi setting which is kind of a
bummer<00:00:32.070> because<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.759> Ave<00:00:33.120> Caesar

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
bummer because I think the Ave Caesar

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.700 
bummer because I think the Ave Caesar
setting<00:00:33.930> works

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
setting works

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.280 
setting works

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.740 

here's<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.490> board<00:01:09.700> for<00:01:09.910> Ave<00:01:10.150> Caesar<00:01:10.210> there's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750

here's the board for Ave Caesar there's
actually<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.410> double-sided<00:01:12.340> board<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.980> it's

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
actually a double-sided board this it's

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.890 
actually a double-sided board this it's
not<00:01:15.190> that<00:01:15.550> critical<00:01:15.790> but<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.420> other<00:01:16.570> board

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
not that critical but the other board

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.360 
not that critical but the other board
should<00:01:17.140> be<00:01:17.260> used<00:01:17.440> for<00:01:17.620> three<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.920> four<00:01:18.100> players

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
should be used for three to four players

should be used for three to four players
this<00:01:19.000> board<00:01:19.420> works<00:01:19.660> better<00:01:19.930> with<00:01:20.200> five<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.680> six

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
this board works better with five to six

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.510 
this board works better with five to six
players

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
players

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.670 
players
there's<00:01:21.910> actually<00:01:22.360> four<00:01:22.780> racetracks<00:01:23.410> per

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
there's actually four racetracks per

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.410 
there's actually four racetracks per
board<00:01:23.980> you<00:01:24.400> can<00:01:24.550> see<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.850> yellow<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.270> red

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
board you can see the yellow on the red

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.720 
board you can see the yellow on the red
outline<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:26.110> here's<00:01:26.620> one<00:01:26.860> track<00:01:27.220> going<00:01:27.580> the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
outline so here's one track going the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.190 
outline so here's one track going the
other<00:01:27.850> way<00:01:28.030> is<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.510> other<00:01:28.630> track<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.110> then

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
other way is the other track and then

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.530 
other way is the other track and then
the<00:01:29.260> red<00:01:29.410> track<00:01:29.680> so<00:01:30.460> you<00:01:30.490> can<00:01:30.610> go<00:01:30.850> clockwise<00:01:31.150> or

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
the red track so you can go clockwise or

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.090 
the red track so you can go clockwise or
counterclockwise<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:32.440> does<00:01:32.620> not<00:01:32.770> really

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
counterclockwise it does not really

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.400 
counterclockwise it does not really
matter<00:01:33.400> that<00:01:33.580> much<00:01:33.940> each<00:01:34.660> person<00:01:34.720> has<00:01:35.380> a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
matter that much each person has a

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.490 
matter that much each person has a
chariot<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:36.340> they<00:01:37.210> will<00:01:37.510> you'll<00:01:37.990> draw<00:01:38.200> card

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
chariot and they will you'll draw card

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.530 
chariot and they will you'll draw card
to<00:01:38.619> see<00:01:38.770> who<00:01:38.890> goes<00:01:39.100> first<00:01:39.369> and<00:01:39.700> apparently<00:01:40.479> I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
to see who goes first and apparently I

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.900 
to see who goes first and apparently I
can't<00:01:40.900> make<00:01:41.080> some<00:01:41.350> of<00:01:41.440> these<00:01:41.560> horses<00:01:41.800> face<00:01:42.670> the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
can't make some of these horses face the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.219 
can't make some of these horses face the
correct<00:01:43.210> direction<00:01:43.360> but<00:01:43.810> there<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.050> go

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
correct direction but there you go

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.740 
correct direction but there you go
then<00:01:45.070> each<00:01:45.340> player<00:01:45.670> is<00:01:45.790> also<00:01:46.119> going<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.420> have

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
then each player is also going to have

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.380 
then each player is also going to have
two<00:01:47.470> other<00:01:47.710> pieces<00:01:48.160> of<00:01:48.340> things<00:01:49.119> they're<00:01:49.300> gonna

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
two other pieces of things they're gonna

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.690 
two other pieces of things they're gonna
have<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.600> coin<00:01:50.040> which<00:01:51.040> is<00:01:51.160> here<00:01:51.310> more<00:01:51.490> for

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
have a coin which is here more for

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.280 
have a coin which is here more for
symbolic<00:01:51.970> thing<00:01:52.390> than<00:01:52.630> anything<00:01:52.780> else<00:01:53.020> and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
symbolic thing than anything else and

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.890 
symbolic thing than anything else and
then<00:01:54.130> you'll<00:01:54.310> have<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.520> deck<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:54.910> cards<00:01:55.060> these

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
then you'll have a deck of cards these

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.400 
then you'll have a deck of cards these
cards<00:01:56.440> are<00:01:56.619> numbered<00:01:56.800> from<00:01:57.220> 1<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.759> 6<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.660> every

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
one has the exact same deck and you're

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.390

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
people so let's say the yellow player

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.560 
people so let's say the yellow player
has<00:02:27.130> landed<00:02:27.550> here<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.850> blue<00:02:28.000> players<00:02:28.269> here

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
has landed here in the blue players here

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.990 
has landed here in the blue players here
and<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:28.840> Reds<00:02:29.110> turn<00:02:29.459> red<00:02:30.459> cannot<00:02:30.790> go

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
and it's Reds turn red cannot go

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.130 
and it's Reds turn red cannot go
anywhere<00:02:31.300> they<00:02:31.480> can't<00:02:31.660> go<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:31.900> by<00:02:32.080> this

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
anywhere they can't go in this by this

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.620 
anywhere they can't go in this by this
spot<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:32.650> can't<00:02:32.890> play<00:02:33.100> any<00:02:33.280> card<00:02:33.519> if<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
spot so they can't play any card if the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.740 
spot so they can't play any card if the
cards<00:02:34.930> were<00:02:35.080> here<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.560> red<00:02:36.160> had<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.640> one<00:02:37.269> then

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
cards were here and red had a one then

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.390 
cards were here and red had a one then
red<00:02:37.959> could<00:02:38.140> move<00:02:38.320> but<00:02:38.500> if<00:02:38.590> red<00:02:38.769> had<00:02:38.920> only<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.190> two

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
red could move but if red had only a two

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.240 
red could move but if red had only a two
or<00:02:39.519> higher<00:02:39.700> again<00:02:40.690> red<00:02:41.290> could<00:02:41.530> not<00:02:41.709> move<00:02:41.980> so

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
or higher again red could not move so

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.250 
or higher again red could not move so
you<00:02:42.549> can<00:02:42.670> see<00:02:42.970> there<00:02:43.180> are<00:02:43.269> some<00:02:43.450> spots<00:02:43.720> too

and<00:03:40.239> there'll<00:03:40.840> be<00:03:40.870> some<00:03:41.140> debate<00:03:41.379> on<00:03:41.440> which

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
and there'll be some debate on which

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.280 
and there'll be some debate on which
one's<00:03:42.010> better<00:03:42.250> now<00:03:42.879> you<00:03:42.940> could<00:03:43.209> just<00:03:43.390> say<00:03:43.540> Ave

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
one's better now you could just say Ave

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.599 
one's better now you could just say Ave

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.569 
chair and scream it at the top of your
lungs<00:03:48.959> anyhow<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.680> racers<00:03:51.099> just<00:03:51.250> keep<00:03:51.400> going

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
around it's a very simple game I

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.990 
around it's a very simple game I
basically<00:03:53.409> just<00:03:53.500> told<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.890> everything<00:03:54.010> the

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
so that not only you help yourself but

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.009 
so that not only you help yourself but
in<00:04:00.159> this<00:04:00.250> game<00:04:00.459> you<00:04:00.670> will<00:04:01.180> very<00:04:01.450> specifically

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
in this game you will very specifically

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.170 
in this game you will very specifically
and<00:04:02.349> very<00:04:02.560> often<00:04:02.769> deliberately<00:04:03.670> move<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.150> a

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
and very often deliberately move to a

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.240 
and very often deliberately move to a
spot<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:04.629> that<00:04:04.659> you<00:04:04.870> hurt<00:04:05.139> other<00:04:05.319> people<00:04:05.739> if

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
spot so that you hurt other people if

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.699 
spot so that you hurt other people if
I'm<00:04:06.489> here<00:04:06.760> for<00:04:06.909> example<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.780> these<00:04:08.260> racers

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
I'm here for example and these racers

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.979 
I'm here for example and these racers
are<00:04:08.859> behind<00:04:09.220> me<00:04:09.359> I'm<00:04:10.359> sure<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.540> might<00:04:10.840> have<00:04:10.959> a

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
are behind me I'm sure I might have a

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.509 
are behind me I'm sure I might have a
five<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.379> my<00:04:11.470> handwriting<00:04:11.889> go<00:04:11.980> one<00:04:12.129> two<00:04:12.250> three

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
five of my handwriting go one two three

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.430 
five of my handwriting go one two three
four<00:04:12.730> five<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.150> get<00:04:13.209> around<00:04:13.420> but<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.049> think<00:04:14.319> the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
four five and get around but I think the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.349 
four five and get around but I think the
one<00:04:14.650> is<00:04:14.799> more<00:04:15.010> fun<00:04:15.190> to<00:04:15.220> play<00:04:15.370> because<00:04:16.060> now

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
one is more fun to play because now

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.879 
one is more fun to play because now
everyone<00:04:16.600> behind<00:04:17.019> me<00:04:17.139> is<00:04:17.260> gonna<00:04:17.440> get<00:04:17.590> jammed

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
everyone behind me is gonna get jammed

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.789 
everyone behind me is gonna get jammed
up<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.190> can't<00:04:18.459> move<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.840> can't<00:04:19.870> play<00:04:20.289> a<00:04:20.320> six

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
up and can't move you can't play a six

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.340 
up and can't move you can't play a six
if<00:04:21.039> you're<00:04:21.190> in<00:04:21.310> first<00:04:21.489> place<00:04:21.930> other<00:04:22.930> than<00:04:23.050> that

if you're in first place other than that

if you're in first place other than that
and<00:04:23.530> there's<00:04:23.710> a<00:04:23.830> few<00:04:24.039> other<00:04:24.130> rules<00:04:24.340> then

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
and there's a few other rules then

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.339 
and there's a few other rules then
there's<00:04:24.669> about<00:04:24.760> thirty<00:04:25.419> different<00:04:25.630> variants

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
there's about thirty different variants

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.050 
there's about thirty different variants
that<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.560> can<00:04:26.710> play<00:04:26.889> with<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.310> game<00:04:27.520> but

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
that you can play with the game but

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.520 
that you can play with the game but
