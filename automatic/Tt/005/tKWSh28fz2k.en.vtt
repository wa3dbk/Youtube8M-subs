00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
we've got a lot more air capacity in the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.570 
we've got a lot more air capacity in the
tank<00:00:19.770> again<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.119> 230<00:00:22.020> volt<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:23.279> plug<00:00:23.460> it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
tank again it's a 230 volt just plug it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.300

comes with a 3 pin plug show you the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.189 
comes with a 3 pin plug show you the
compressor<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.449> weight<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.900> by<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.109> way

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
compressor the weight of it by the way

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.139 
compressor the weight of it by the way
is<00:00:32.870> 23<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.559> half<00:00:34.590> kilograms<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
is 23 and a half kilograms and just to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.850 
is 23 and a half kilograms and just to
show<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.660> actually<00:00:37.040> pick<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:39.860> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
show you I can actually pick that up the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
show you I can actually pick that up the
portability<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.879> two<00:00:42.090> wheels<00:00:42.270> there<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
portability has two wheels there and a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.540 
portability has two wheels there and a
handle<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.920> roll<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> against

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
handle so you can just roll it against

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.150 
handle so you can just roll it against
the<00:00:44.760> even<00:00:45.000> surface<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.500> unreal<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the even surface but it's not unreal to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.700 
the even surface but it's not unreal to
actually<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.610> able<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> carry<00:00:48.200> the<00:00:49.200> compressor

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
actually be able to carry the compressor

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
actually be able to carry the compressor
around<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.309> an<00:00:50.550> oilless<00:00:50.910> version<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.719> like

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
around it's an oilless version just like

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.799 
around it's an oilless version just like
it's<00:00:52.110> baby<00:00:52.320> brother<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> from<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.480> point<00:00:54.660> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it's baby brother so from that point of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's baby brother so from that point of
view<00:00:55.020> there's<00:00:55.260> no<00:00:55.410> oil<00:00:55.440> there's<00:00:56.039> no<00:00:56.190> Sun<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.270> if

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
view there's no oil there's no Sun so if

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.540 
view there's no oil there's no Sun so if
you<00:00:57.719> were<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.020> transport<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.100> lay<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> down

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you were to transport it and lay it down

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.070 
you were to transport it and lay it down
in<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.539> boot<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.960> car<00:01:01.070> you've<00:01:02.070> got<00:01:02.100> no<00:01:02.520> oil

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
in the boot of a car you've got no oil

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.390 
in the boot of a car you've got no oil
that<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.199> possibly<00:01:04.379> leak<00:01:04.860> from<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that can possibly leak from the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.730 
that can possibly leak from the
compressor<00:01:06.110> now<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> want<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> show<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
compressor now I want to show you a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740 
compressor now I want to show you a
little<00:01:07.890> bit<00:01:08.010> more<00:01:08.250> detail<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.299> does<00:01:09.450> come

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
little bit more detail when it does come

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
little bit more detail when it does come
it's<00:01:10.110> packaged<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.549> only<00:01:11.939> thing

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
you one or two of the features on the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:38.270 
you one or two of the features on the
compressor<00:01:34.579> right<00:01:35.579> what<00:01:35.850> we've<00:01:36.000> got<00:01:36.210> um<00:01:37.280> this

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
compressor right what we've got um this

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850 
compressor right what we've got um this
is<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.579> main<00:01:38.729> pressure<00:01:39.140> control<00:01:40.140> switch<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
is your main pressure control switch and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.740 
is your main pressure control switch and
once<00:01:41.460> you've<00:01:41.579> plugged<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.090> switch<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> arm

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
once you've plugged it in switch the arm

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.880 
once you've plugged it in switch the arm
on<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.290> mains<00:01:44.299> you<00:01:45.299> pull<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.630> off<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
on the mains you pull that off and the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.679 
on the mains you pull that off and the
compressor<00:01:47.340> will<00:01:47.460> cut<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.299> cut<00:01:48.509> out

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
compressor will cut in and cut out

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
compressor will cut in and cut out
accordingly<00:01:49.259> obviously<00:01:50.189> when<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.369> first

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
accordingly obviously when you first

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.359 
accordingly obviously when you first
switch<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.689> there's<00:01:52.500> no<00:01:52.680> pressure<00:01:53.009> in

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
switch it on and there's no pressure in

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.149 
switch it on and there's no pressure in
the<00:01:53.640> tank<00:01:54.079> it<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.229> run<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.590> quite<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> while

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the tank it will run for quite a while

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.370

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and it will cut out at the maximum

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.859 
and it will cut out at the maximum

you use you staple gun or your nail gun
the<00:02:06.570> pressure<00:02:06.810> will<00:02:07.049> drop<00:02:07.200> down<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the pressure will drop down to a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
and at that point the compressor cuts in

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.590 
and at that point the compressor cuts in
and<00:02:18.750> goes<00:02:19.110> back<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.710> maximum<00:02:20.130> pressure

it's<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.340> switch<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.210> off<00:02:24.330> there<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.050> can

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
it's just switch it off there on the can

psi<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.580> then<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.300> version<00:02:51.810> we've<00:02:52.230> got

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
psi and then on this version we've got

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.550 
psi and then on this version we've got
two<00:02:52.590> outlets<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.180> can<00:02:54.390> use<00:02:54.720> two<00:02:55.110> airlines

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
two outlets so you can use two airlines

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.790 
two outlets so you can use two airlines
and<00:02:56.450> obviously<00:02:57.450> simultaneously<00:02:58.380> two<00:02:58.590> Brad

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
and obviously simultaneously two Brad

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.910 
and obviously simultaneously two Brad
guns<00:02:59.100> or<00:02:59.310> two<00:02:59.459> staple<00:02:59.940> guns<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.450> then<00:03:01.410> via

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
guns or two staple guns and then via

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.150 
guns or two staple guns and then via
this<00:03:02.070> regulator<00:03:02.930> we<00:03:03.930> then<00:03:04.170> got<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.920> pressure

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
this regulator we then got the pressure

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.360 
this regulator we then got the pressure
coming<00:03:05.940> through<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.300> outlets<00:03:06.950> at<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> moment

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
coming through the outlets at the moment

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.970 
coming through the outlets at the moment
that's<00:03:08.459> regulated<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.270> pressure<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.840> 90<00:03:10.290> psi

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
that's regulated to a pressure of 90 psi

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.340 
that's regulated to a pressure of 90 psi
and<00:03:11.670> as<00:03:11.850> explained<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.450> other<00:03:12.510> videos<00:03:12.840> when

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
and as explained on other videos when

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.800 
and as explained on other videos when
you<00:03:13.440> regulate<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:14.670> works<00:03:14.910> opposite<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you regulate this this works opposite to

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.570 
you regulate this this works opposite to
a<00:03:15.840> normal<00:03:16.200> tap<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.010> if<00:03:17.100> we<00:03:17.220> go<00:03:17.430> anti-clockwise

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
a normal tap so if we go anti-clockwise

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.400 
a normal tap so if we go anti-clockwise
instead<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.670> opening<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> tap<00:03:21.570> would<00:03:21.780> this

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
instead of opening like a tap would this

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.710 
instead of opening like a tap would this
actually<00:03:22.739> closes<00:03:23.370> down<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.790> air<00:03:23.910> pressure<00:03:24.269> as

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
actually closes down the air pressure as

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.830 
actually closes down the air pressure as
you<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.080> see<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.410> reduces<00:03:25.860> down<00:03:26.130> there

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
you can see it reduces down there

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.009 
you can see it reduces down there
conversely<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.989> other<00:03:28.110> way<00:03:28.320> clockwise<00:03:30.019> will

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
conversely the other way clockwise will

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.270 
conversely the other way clockwise will
bring<00:03:31.290> up<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.560> air<00:03:31.739> pressure<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:34.290> desired

one<00:04:26.760> piece<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.000> advice<00:04:27.180> that

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
one piece of advice that

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.190 
one piece of advice that
I<00:04:27.990> would<00:04:28.350> do<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.710> probably<00:04:29.010> outdoors<00:04:29.610> or

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
I would do that probably outdoors or

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.930 
I would do that probably outdoors or
over<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.230> drain<00:04:31.590> because<00:04:32.070> what<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.550> do<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.820> do

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
over a drain because what you do you do

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.790 
over a drain because what you do you do
get<00:04:33.090> rust<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.630> sediment<00:04:34.140> so<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.500> wouldn't

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
get rust and sediment so you wouldn't

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.740 
get rust and sediment so you wouldn't
want<00:04:34.920> that<00:04:35.010> spilling<00:04:35.490> onto<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.790> nice<00:04:36.000> floor<00:04:36.480> or

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
want that spilling onto a nice floor or

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.490 
want that spilling onto a nice floor or
