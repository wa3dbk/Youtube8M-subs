00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.480
 hello everyone here the cheap 08 and 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.060
 well we are here in the good leader there is 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.740
 the evidence of the crime and for what 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.200
 we are here well it is very easy 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.880
 comfortable in the title of the video is a 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.670
 golden farm that by a hundred efficient 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.010
 made the 1.8 good now friends of the 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.020
 last moderate snapshot by the way but 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.840
 well , we'll take it down from her in another 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.210
 moment we are here for this little 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.750
 farm that I designed pit worth not the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.750
 look no where 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.420
 of man is the same but good I already 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.250
 I say it 's mine because the inventory 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.770
 it will be happened before then nothing 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.290
 the case comes look now and well this 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.030
 farm convinced me quite 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.059
 mainly because it is this that speaks 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 you know the 20 farms of mox 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.590
 made with pistons like the others 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.809
 we see normal made in the over well 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.820
 with honest pistons you talk and you're 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.979
 they are also almost always good 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.850
 always because so much done by portals 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.720
 as word pistons as by systems are 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.220
 stable you can do everything great 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.460
 what do you want, well, here we have 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.490
 four modules worth 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.710
 each module consists of three subsections is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.250
 so to speak one your choices this 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.990
 basically all that is here pushes you and 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.640
 as there are these berries you hit against the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.530
 teak valley of flavor at low to zero in a 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.990
 collection system by reuters and already 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.490
 it is very simple the design is worth but 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.950
 well this minute in this hard video that 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.580
 six minutes then nothing 26 minutes but 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.650
 good to know it here a model of 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:49.040
 those little ones worth 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.409
 because they do not have to update the blocks 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.979
 so they take off to see three blocks 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.979
 for here it's worth 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.180
 at this point I think but I'm going to copy the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.430
 piston 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.430
 with the wheel with the knee on its side 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.630
 around here this way around here 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.630
 this over here these blocks are worth 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.470
 So it is 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.790
 here 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.879
 that in each of us it arrives in a way 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.879
 more on a string in other thread 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.090
 and good both on this side and for 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.870
 this side you basically make them join 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.030
 and this this this and this and you put dust 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.510
 of rest is worth second place here 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.400
 effectively and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.769
 and I would be 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.180
 it's simple then to do the following 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.180
 model you stick to the other 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.380
 the recital that well 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.220
 I do it mainly to make it look 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.640
 well the construction and tell me if you 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.120
 it bothers a lot around here 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.750
 upside down 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.750
 3 are 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.540
 this is something like 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.900
 have this so like this like that and the rest 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.159
 on all sides and then so that 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.110
 know even where we are not interested 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:21.700
 we put slaps such what 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.680
 yes 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.970
 in case you do not want to extend this anymore 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.769
 then we can not here one is the villa 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.900
 is in case you want to extend it to 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.379
 up like this very simple we have to 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.230
 this soil put it here is not worth it because 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.420
 if we turn it on here what's going to happen 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.140
 is that when this piston touches this 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.140
 block will take it 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.370
 you see 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:50.750
 the piston and the block is very renewed a 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.210
 lot so you have to put it and you 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.840
 we put all three like this 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.940
 the block of the tri wire is here 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.900
 and it would be repeating exactly the same thing that 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.160
 we have done below 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.540
 so what 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.860
 at this height a piston 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.080
 a blog that I blocked 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.080
 so like this way like this 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.820
 it's true 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:25.120
 and it would be nothing more so good not 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.950
 I know if it will serve as a showcase more 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.500
 that a tutorial because good just wanted 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.000
 present my golden farm model and 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.070
 well obviously once in your real 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.770
 because I already have the quadruple goal bread in 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.810
 which I'm working hard on 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.730
 material grams every two times three and 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.790
 I am working on others in others 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.350
 jobs over there and by his rival 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.300
 quite pretty big is not even like 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.270
 he got me five moments so that in 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.280
 general is always but good the case 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.550
 that anything that is put here to 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.550
 watch 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.650
 as you see 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.069
 it takes a bit because it's books of the 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.069
 current ships 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.220
 how do you see the speed 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.300
 is very small to the farm but if we 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.070
 let's make this model that is 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.030
 decent he gets would do a lot of 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.660
 things I've already checked 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.210
 Y 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.870
 here you should do a pickup with 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:32.080
 hopper nothing more but that you liked 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.490
 this little design is worth and very very 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.580
 small the truth the truth is that I 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.280
 like compact and others and good nothing else 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.889
 I hope it serves you that you liked it 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:46.909
 and nothing more 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.909
 until the next video subscribe
