bass guitar playing that pattern you can
do<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:51.290> just<00:00:51.680> joining<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.460> open<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:53.000> fifth

string a kind of maybe helps it be palm
unit<00:00:58.580> I<00:00:58.790> tend<00:00:59.660> to<00:00:59.720> use<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.080> first<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.190> fourth

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
bar chord to fill it out a bit for a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.050 
bar chord to fill it out a bit for a
guitar<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:10.160> that's<00:01:10.340> one<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.700> patterns

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
guitar and that's one of the patterns

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.469 
guitar and that's one of the patterns
the<00:01:11.210> other<00:01:11.330> pattern<00:01:11.720> just<00:01:11.960> changes<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.410> bit

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.820 

okay<00:01:17.479> any<00:01:17.930> kind<00:01:18.110> of<00:01:18.170> heard<00:01:18.350> away<00:01:18.500> at<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
okay any kind of heard away at the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.740 
okay any kind of heard away at the
beginning<00:01:19.070> that's<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.000> typical<00:01:20.270> pattern<00:01:20.540> of

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
beginning that's the typical pattern of

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:32.950 
beginning that's the typical pattern of
the<00:01:20.869> song<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.700> then<00:01:32.300> it<00:01:32.390> starts<00:01:32.660> over<00:01:32.780> and

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
the song and then it starts over and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:43.740 
the song and then it starts over and
over<00:01:33.110> again<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.940> guitar<00:01:35.270> comes<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.840> goes

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.940 

and<00:01:44.680> that's<00:01:45.010> this<00:01:45.220> cord<00:01:45.580> here<00:01:46.710> take<00:01:47.710> your<00:01:47.740> a

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
and that's this cord here take your a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.070 
and that's this cord here take your a
bar<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.430> think<00:01:48.550> it's<00:01:48.730> a<00:01:48.820> it's<00:01:49.540> sort<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.900> D

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
bar I think it's a it's sort of a D

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.610 
bar I think it's a it's sort of a D

any beginners out there who've never
learned<00:02:07.670> this<00:02:07.790> pattern<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:09.259> kind<00:02:09.500> of

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
learned this pattern of this kind of

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.440 
learned this pattern of this kind of
chord<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:10.520> should<00:02:10.670> really<00:02:10.910> learn<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.240> because

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
chord you should really learn it because

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.090 
chord you should really learn it because
it<00:02:11.570> moves<00:02:11.750> well<00:02:12.020> all<00:02:12.260> over<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.560> all<00:02:12.800> over<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
it moves well all over that all over the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:21.070 
it moves well all over that all over the
neck<00:02:18.370> okay<00:02:19.370> if<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.000> could<00:02:20.180> do<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.390> fluently<00:02:20.870> he

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
neck okay if I could do that fluently he

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.690 
neck okay if I could do that fluently he
would<00:02:21.230> see<00:02:21.380> how<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.920> sounds<00:02:22.250> pretty<00:02:22.400> good

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
would see how it sounds pretty good

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.100 
would see how it sounds pretty good
that<00:02:23.060> was<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> very<00:02:23.390> very<00:02:23.780> good<00:02:23.959> demonstration

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
that was a very very good demonstration

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.070 
that was a very very good demonstration
anyways<00:02:25.600> after<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.290> other<00:02:27.410> part<00:02:27.709> is

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.080 

which<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.010> pretty<00:02:33.130> much<00:02:33.250> all<00:02:33.550> on<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.850> fifth

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
which is pretty much all on the fifth

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.090 
which is pretty much all on the fifth
string<00:02:34.240> starts<00:02:35.050> on<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.290> seventh<00:02:35.650> fret<00:02:35.860> and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
string starts on the seventh fret and

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.740 
string starts on the seventh fret and
you<00:02:36.370> slide<00:02:36.700> up<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.060> from<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.270> fifth<00:02:37.480> fret<00:02:37.690> I

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
you slide up to it from the fifth fret I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:51.300 
you slide up to it from the fifth fret I
guess

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:02.670 

right<00:02:52.310> minutes

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.630 

playing<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:03.770> on<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.950> second<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.490> third

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
playing this on the second and third

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.290 
playing this on the second and third
string<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:06.290> is<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.950> eighth<00:03:07.640> fret<00:03:07.910> and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
string this is the eighth fret and

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.220 
string this is the eighth fret and
that's<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.720> ninth<00:03:08.930> fret<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:13.720> then<00:03:14.720> into<00:03:14.960> a<00:03:14.990> D

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
that's the ninth fret and then into a D

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:26.940 
that's the ninth fret and then into a D
chord<00:03:16.150> okay<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.180> think<00:03:17.480> he<00:03:17.570> does<00:03:17.750> this

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.229 

I'm<00:03:27.950> not<00:03:28.159> sure<00:03:28.310> exactly<00:03:28.489> which<00:03:28.730> one<00:03:28.909> does<00:03:29.060> let

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
I'm not sure exactly which one does let

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.460 
I'm not sure exactly which one does let
me<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.510> do<00:03:29.629> it<00:03:29.659> like<00:03:29.900> this<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.170> don't<00:03:30.230> know<00:03:30.379> if

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
me just do it like this I don't know if

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.780 
me just do it like this I don't know if
you<00:03:30.530> had<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.890> noted<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.400> doesn't<00:03:31.670> quite

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
you had that noted that it doesn't quite

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:40.809 
you had that noted that it doesn't quite
sound<00:03:32.060> like<00:03:32.239> he<00:03:32.330> does<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:33.019> that's<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:40.640> kind
