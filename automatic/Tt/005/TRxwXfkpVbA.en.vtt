awesome<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.450> what<00:04:01.570> about<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.870> game<00:04:02.049> don't<00:04:02.500> you

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
awesome so what about the game don't you

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.390 
awesome so what about the game don't you
like<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.459> interface<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:04.560> all<00:04:05.560> right<00:04:06.010> but<00:04:06.280> it's

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
like the interface is all right but it's

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.690 
like the interface is all right but it's
not<00:04:06.760> completely<00:04:08.280> user-friendly<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.310> think

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
not completely user-friendly I think

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.080 
not completely user-friendly I think
they<00:04:10.060> were<00:04:10.120> trying<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.600> make<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:11.049> meld<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.769> a

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
they were trying to make this meld of a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.030 
they were trying to make this meld of a
interface<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.239> would<00:04:13.360> work<00:04:13.480> on<00:04:13.600> a<00:04:13.660> PC<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.410> on

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
interface that would work on a PC and on

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.849 
interface that would work on a PC and on
the<00:04:15.130> 360<00:04:15.640> unequip<00:04:16.540> equipping<00:04:17.290> things<00:04:17.560> it's

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
the 360 unequip equipping things it's

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.319 
the 360 unequip equipping things it's
not<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.310> completely<00:04:18.700> difficult<00:04:19.180> it's

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
not that it's completely difficult it's

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.440 
not that it's completely difficult it's
just<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:19.750> like<00:04:19.900> this<00:04:20.019> weird<00:04:20.079> hybrid<00:04:20.620> of

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
just that it's like this weird hybrid of

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.640 
just that it's like this weird hybrid of
PC<00:04:22.450> versus<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:24.419> joypad<00:04:25.419> kind<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:26.020> deal<00:04:26.140> so<00:04:26.560> what

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
PC versus a joypad kind of deal so what

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.050 
PC versus a joypad kind of deal so what
about<00:04:26.740> overall<00:04:27.130> impressions<00:04:27.760> what<00:04:27.970> do<00:04:28.030> you

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
about overall impressions what do you

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.060 
about overall impressions what do you
think<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.300> game<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:28.570> far<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:28.960> really<00:04:29.830> really

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
think the game so far I really really

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.409 
think the game so far I really really
like<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.340> game<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:30.610> far<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:30.820> think<00:04:30.940> it's<00:04:31.270> going

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
like the game so far I think it's going

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.310 
like the game so far I think it's going
to<00:04:31.539> be<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.930> really<00:04:32.470> good<00:04:33.360> game<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.539> have<00:04:34.750> hang<00:04:35.140> on

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
to be a really good game to have hang on

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.260 
to be a really good game to have hang on
to<00:04:35.500> play<00:04:35.950> for<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.220> long<00:04:36.400> time<00:04:36.640> I<00:04:36.789> mean<00:04:36.940> there's

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
to play for a long time I mean there's

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.450 
to play for a long time I mean there's
no<00:04:37.479> way<00:04:37.660> I'm<00:04:37.810> even<00:04:38.050> remotely<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:39.340> know<00:04:39.430> a

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
no way I'm even remotely you know a

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.390 
no way I'm even remotely you know a
percent<00:04:40.450> done<00:04:40.720> with<00:04:40.900> this<00:04:41.020> game<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:41.650> I'm<00:04:42.130> just

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
percent done with this game and I'm just

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.730 
percent done with this game and I'm just
having<00:04:42.729> fun<00:04:42.760> talking<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.479> people<00:04:43.870> laughing<00:04:44.410> at

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
having fun talking to people laughing at

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.340 
having fun talking to people laughing at
it<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:45.240> think<00:04:46.240> it's<00:04:46.419> going<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.600> be<00:04:46.750> great<00:04:46.960> for

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
it I think it's going to be great for

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.630 
it I think it's going to be great for
picking<00:04:47.650> up<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:47.979> having<00:04:48.190> these<00:04:48.280> little

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
picking up and having these little

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.070 
picking up and having these little
random<00:04:48.940> adventures<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.599> then<00:04:49.690> eventually

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
random adventures and then eventually

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.450 
random adventures and then eventually
getting<00:04:50.470> onto<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.770> main<00:04:50.919> quest<00:04:51.190> but

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
getting onto the main quest but

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.820 
getting onto the main quest but
it's<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:52.120> good<00:04:52.330> graphics<00:04:52.960> it's<00:04:53.139> good<00:04:53.319> sound
