00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
our backs so we can create some troops

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.749

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
ahead and look on the battleground and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.790 
ahead and look on the battleground and
see<00:01:58.459> a<00:01:58.489> base<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.239> we<00:01:59.330> can<00:01:59.479> attack<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.709> it

see a base that we can attack so it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.469 
see a base that we can attack so it
looks<00:02:01.009> like<00:02:01.069> it<00:02:01.280> wants<00:02:01.429> us<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.880> go<00:02:02.030> for<00:02:02.270> cleaner

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.540 
looks like it wants us to go for cleaner
soul<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.170> why<00:02:03.440> not<00:02:03.590> go<00:02:03.800> for<00:02:03.830> cleaner<00:02:04.220> soul

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.870 
like we're out of pekka's unfortunately
not<00:03:33.830> too<00:03:34.340> cool<00:03:34.820> come<00:03:35.750> on<00:03:35.900> Wizards<00:03:36.320> do<00:03:36.620> work<00:03:36.880> so

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
not too cool come on Wizards do work so

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.320 
not too cool come on Wizards do work so
let's<00:03:38.450> go<00:03:38.750> barbarian<00:03:39.740> king<00:03:40.030> he<00:03:41.030> still<00:03:41.240> has

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
let's go barbarian king he still has

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.360 
let's go barbarian king he still has
some<00:03:41.480> help<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.860> we<00:03:42.980> only<00:03:43.100> got<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.280> one

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
some help so we only got the one

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.120 
some help so we only got the one
star<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:43.940> far<00:03:44.209> we<00:03:44.420> got<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.660> two<00:03:44.840> star<00:03:45.110> so<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
star so far we got the two star so the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.740 
star so far we got the two star so the
rate<00:03:46.250> isn't<00:03:46.430> your<00:03:46.760> complete<00:03:47.120> failure<00:03:47.480> i<00:03:47.540> guess

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
rate isn't your complete failure i guess

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.440 
rate isn't your complete failure i guess
you<00:03:47.840> could<00:03:47.930> say<00:03:48.250> we<00:03:49.250> still<00:03:49.490> do<00:03:49.790> have<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:50.180> pot

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
you could say we still do have the pot

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.000 
you could say we still do have the pot
now<00:03:50.480> we<00:03:50.870> don't<00:03:51.110> have<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.410> possibility<00:03:51.740> for

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
now we don't have the possibility for

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.560 
now we don't have the possibility for
three<00:03:52.280> i<00:03:52.310> mean<00:03:52.550> we<00:03:52.640> do<00:03:52.820> it's<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.330> very

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
three i mean we do it's just very

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.930 
three i mean we do it's just very
unlikely<00:03:54.080> i'm<00:03:54.830> just<00:03:55.040> kind<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:55.220> figuring<00:03:55.790> out

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
unlikely i'm just kind of figuring out

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.460 
unlikely i'm just kind of figuring out
where<00:03:56.090> I<00:03:56.120> want<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.390> place<00:03:56.540> my<00:03:56.780> archers<00:03:57.170> because

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
where I want to place my archers because

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.190 
where I want to place my archers because
let's<00:03:57.800> see<00:03:57.920> we<00:03:58.040> have<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.160> golem<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.720> let's<00:04:00.050> just

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
let's see we have a golem and let's just

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.290 
let's see we have a golem and let's just
drop<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.500> rest<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.770> our<00:04:00.920> arches<00:04:01.850> over<00:04:01.970> here

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
drop the rest of our arches over here

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.820 
drop the rest of our arches over here
because<00:04:02.450> we<00:04:02.720> do<00:04:02.870> have<00:04:02.990> that<00:04:03.170> going<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.680> help

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
because we do have that going to help

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.580 
because we do have that going to help
with<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.100> distraction<00:04:04.850> but<00:04:05.270> we<00:04:05.360> did<00:04:05.630> we<00:04:06.500> have

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
with the distraction but we did we have

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.990 
with the distraction but we did we have
one<00:04:06.800> more<00:04:06.920> goal<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.310> we<00:04:07.430> have<00:04:07.550> a<00:04:07.580> little<00:04:07.880> bit

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
one more goal and we have a little bit

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.970 
one more goal and we have a little bit
archers<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:09.050> know<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.320> attack<00:04:09.620> could<00:04:09.770> when

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
archers you know that attack could when

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.390 
better I definitely wasn't really paying

attention to the clan castle and that

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.900 
attention to the clan castle and that
really<00:04:13.550> screwed<00:04:13.970> up<00:04:14.120> our<00:04:14.300> attack<00:04:14.890> huh<00:04:15.910> you
