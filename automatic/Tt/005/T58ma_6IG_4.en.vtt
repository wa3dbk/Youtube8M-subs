00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
this is going to be my updated tutorial

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.070 
this is going to be my updated tutorial
about<00:00:01.800> how<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.220> get<00:00:02.399> manga<00:00:02.669> on<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.389> Kindle<00:00:03.780> um

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
about how to get manga on the Kindle um

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.800 
about how to get manga on the Kindle um
I<00:00:04.830> got<00:00:05.160> people<00:00:05.759> asking<00:00:06.270> last<00:00:06.450> time<00:00:06.629> why<00:00:06.750> it

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
I got people asking last time why it

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.299 
I got people asking last time why it
wasn't<00:00:06.990> working<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.500> theirs<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.010> figured

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
wasn't working on theirs and I figured

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.860 
wasn't working on theirs and I figured
out<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:08.639> because<00:00:08.880> not<00:00:09.030> every<00:00:09.330> Kindle<00:00:09.660> has<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
out it's because not every Kindle has a

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.499 
out it's because not every Kindle has a
picture<00:00:10.230> viewer<00:00:10.679> but<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.880> new<00:00:12.120> method

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
picture viewer but this new method

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.660 
picture viewer but this new method
should<00:00:12.719> work<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.200> any<00:00:13.440> Kindle<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.040> has<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> PDF

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
should work on any Kindle that has a PDF

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.700 
should work on any Kindle that has a PDF
view<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.420> I'm<00:00:15.509> pretty<00:00:15.780> sure<00:00:15.900> almost<00:00:16.410> all<00:00:16.560> of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
view and I'm pretty sure almost all of

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.250 
view and I'm pretty sure almost all of
them<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:18.210> you're<00:00:18.420> only<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.779> need<00:00:18.840> two

them do so you're only going to need two

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.420 
them do so you're only going to need two

so what we're going to do first is we're

which<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> settings<00:00:43.430> if<00:00:44.430> anything<00:00:44.850> my

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
which is the settings if anything my

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.670 
which is the settings if anything my

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
computer seems to be running slow it's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.310 
computer seems to be running slow it's
just<00:00:46.920> because<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.280> my<00:00:47.370> screen<00:00:47.700> recorder<00:00:48.320> this

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
just because of my screen recorder this

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.459 
just because of my screen recorder this
usually<00:00:49.739> works<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.100> lot<00:00:50.250> faster<00:00:50.870> but<00:00:51.870> anyway<00:00:52.199> um

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
usually works a lot faster but anyway um

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.189 
usually works a lot faster but anyway um
go<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> images<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.699> usually<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> keep<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
go to images I usually like to keep the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.520 
go to images I usually like to keep the
trim<00:00:55.469> whitespace<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.340> because<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.690> think<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
trim whitespace on because I think it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
trim whitespace on because I think it
looks<00:00:58.710> better<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> Kindle<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
looks better on the Kindle but like it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.500 
looks better on the Kindle but like it
says<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.719> parenthesis<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> CPU<00:01:02.039> intensive

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
says in parenthesis it is CPU intensive

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.140 
says in parenthesis it is CPU intensive
so<00:01:03.890> if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.549> your<00:01:05.670> computer<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
so if you know that your computer is

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
so if you know that your computer is
particularly<00:01:06.450> slow<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.200> wouldn't<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.920> but

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
particularly slow I wouldn't do it but

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.980 
particularly slow I wouldn't do it but
if<00:01:08.549> your<00:01:08.670> computer<00:01:09.119> runs<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> normal<00:01:09.960> speed

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
if your computer runs at a normal speed

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.580 
if your computer runs at a normal speed
or<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.830> fast<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.500> go

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
or is really fast then you can and we go

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.840 
or is really fast then you can and we go
to<00:01:13.650> download<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.670> make<00:01:14.820> sure

make sure it's on portrait I think the
default<00:03:46.069> setting<00:03:46.489> is<00:03:46.549> landscape<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.299> you

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
default setting is landscape and you

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.729 
default setting is landscape and you
can't<00:03:47.569> read<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.900> on<00:03:47.959> your<00:03:48.079> kindle<00:03:48.379> like<00:03:48.530> that

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
can't read it on your kindle like that

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.319 
can't read it on your kindle like that
so<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.010> have<00:03:49.189> to<00:03:49.310> put<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.549> as<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.670> portrait<00:03:50.060> and

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
so you have to put it as a portrait and

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.930 
so you have to put it as a portrait and
then<00:03:51.200> where<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.560> says<00:03:51.769> fit<00:03:52.220> picture<00:03:52.549> to<00:03:52.670> frame

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
then where it says fit picture to frame

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.699 
then where it says fit picture to frame
make<00:03:53.540> sure<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.049> not<00:03:54.650> clicked<00:03:55.159> because

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
make sure that is not clicked because

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.960 
make sure that is not clicked because
it'll<00:03:57.709> cut<00:03:58.159> off<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.430> part<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.760> picture

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
it'll cut off the part of the picture

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.119 
it'll cut off the part of the picture
and<00:03:59.269> make<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.599> hard<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.840> read<00:04:00.079> once<00:04:01.010> you're

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
and make it hard to read once you're

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.399 
and make it hard to read once you're
done<00:04:01.250> with<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.909> just<00:04:02.060> click<00:04:02.209> print<00:04:03.819> and

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
done with that you just click print and

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:11.380 
done with that you just click print and
the<00:04:06.409> settings<00:04:06.709> will<00:04:06.890> come<00:04:07.040> up<00:04:07.159> I<00:04:10.269> usually<00:04:11.269> make

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
the settings will come up I usually make

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.330 
the settings will come up I usually make
sure<00:04:11.569> it's<00:04:11.780> just<00:04:12.019> small<00:04:12.319> file<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.040> that<00:04:13.069> way<00:04:13.280> it

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
sure it's just small file so that way it

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.589 
sure it's just small file so that way it
doesn't<00:04:13.489> take<00:04:13.670> up<00:04:13.790> too<00:04:13.819> much<00:04:13.940> space<00:04:14.090> on<00:04:14.569> my
