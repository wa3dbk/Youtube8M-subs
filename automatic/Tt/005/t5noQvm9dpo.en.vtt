00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
bit longer of a focal length use

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.130 
bit longer of a focal length use
something<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.400> brace<00:02:39.700> yourself<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.720> you

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
in a soccer ball in the air on you know

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.670 
in a soccer ball in the air on you know
and<00:05:00.240> just<00:05:00.300> have<00:05:00.540> him<00:05:00.690> kind<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:00.990> walk<00:05:01.230> into<00:05:01.590> the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
and just have him kind of walk into the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.590 
and just have him kind of walk into the
shot<00:05:01.920> like<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.190> from<00:05:02.670> out<00:05:02.820> of<00:05:02.850> focus<00:05:03.120> that's

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
shot like that from out of focus that's

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.810 
shot like that from out of focus that's
a<00:05:03.690> really<00:05:03.960> good<00:05:04.080> way<00:05:04.230> to<00:05:04.290> use<00:05:04.640> refocusing<00:05:05.640> so

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
a really good way to use refocusing so

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.460 
a really good way to use refocusing so
there's<00:05:06.300> another<00:05:06.600> trick<00:05:06.930> i<00:05:07.050> want<00:05:07.230> to<00:05:07.290> show<00:05:07.440> you

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
there's another trick i want to show you

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.290 
there's another trick i want to show you
it's<00:05:07.770> called<00:05:07.950> raft<00:05:08.310> focusing<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.060> this<00:05:09.150> is

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
it's called raft focusing and this is

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.930 
it's called raft focusing and this is
pretty<00:05:09.840> widely<00:05:10.140> used<00:05:10.650> this<00:05:10.890> is<00:05:11.100> used<00:05:11.400> in<00:05:11.670> the

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
pretty widely used this is used in the

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.480 
pretty widely used this is used in the
in<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.180> cinema<00:05:12.600> world<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:13.950> tell<00:05:14.130> a<00:05:14.160> story

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
in the cinema world to tell a story

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.570 
in the cinema world to tell a story
using<00:05:14.940> foreground<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.810> background<00:05:16.100> so<00:05:17.100> what

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
using foreground and background so what

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.240 
using foreground and background so what
rack<00:05:18.510> focusing<00:05:18.990> really<00:05:19.140> is<00:05:19.380> is<00:05:19.590> just<00:05:19.620> shifting

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
rack focusing really is is just shifting

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.920 
rack focusing really is is just shifting
the<00:05:20.340> focus<00:05:20.370> from<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:21.090> foreground<00:05:21.540> to<00:05:21.720> the

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
the focus from the foreground to the

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.230 
the focus from the foreground to the
background<00:05:22.410> or<00:05:22.950> vice<00:05:23.250> versa<00:05:23.580> so<00:05:23.940> i<00:05:23.970> want<00:05:24.210> to

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
background or vice versa so i want to

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.240 
background or vice versa so i want to
show<00:05:24.420> you<00:05:24.450> exactly<00:05:24.750> how<00:05:25.320> we<00:05:25.500> do<00:05:25.680> that<00:05:25.830> is<00:05:26.040> that

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
show you exactly how we do that is that

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.680 
show you exactly how we do that is that
what<00:05:26.370> these<00:05:26.520> are<00:05:26.700> for<00:05:26.910> that's<00:05:27.420> what<00:05:27.600> all

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
little fishy so we're just going to put

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.430 
little fishy so we're just going to put
one<00:05:39.090> in<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.390> foreground<00:05:39.690> and<00:05:40.020> then<00:05:40.230> one<00:05:40.350> in

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
one in the foreground and then one in

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.630 
one in the foreground and then one in
the<00:05:40.500> background<00:05:40.920> and<00:05:41.070> all<00:05:41.160> I'm<00:05:41.310> going<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.460> do

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
the background and all I'm going to do

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.060 
the background and all I'm going to do
here<00:05:41.670> is<00:05:42.090> simply<00:05:42.660> drop<00:05:43.260> down<00:05:43.440> low<00:05:43.680> so<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.950> can

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
here is simply drop down low so I can

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.290 
here is simply drop down low so I can
get<00:05:44.130> all<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.280> same<00:05:44.460> plane<00:05:44.700> as<00:05:44.730> them<00:05:44.970> I'm<00:05:45.150> just

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
get all the same plane as them I'm just

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.000 
get all the same plane as them I'm just
adjusting<00:05:45.420> my<00:05:45.840> monopod<00:05:46.260> by<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:46.560> way<00:05:46.740> and

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
adjusting my monopod by the way and

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.660 
adjusting my monopod by the way and
again<00:05:47.940> points<00:05:48.420> of<00:05:48.510> contact<00:05:49.080> steady<00:05:49.770> image<00:05:50.220> I'm

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
again points of contact steady image I'm

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.870 
again points of contact steady image I'm
leaning<00:05:51.120> into<00:05:51.240> my<00:05:51.420> camera<00:05:51.960> nice<00:05:52.200> and<00:05:52.590> steady

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
leaning into my camera nice and steady

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.430 
leaning into my camera nice and steady
holding<00:05:53.880> my<00:05:54.030> focus<00:05:54.420> here<00:05:54.750> on<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:55.050> foreground

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
holding my focus here on the foreground

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.190 
holding my focus here on the foreground
object<00:05:55.950> and<00:05:56.460> I've<00:05:57.120> got<00:05:57.270> a<00:05:57.300> 50<00:05:57.600> millimeter<00:05:57.780> lens

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
object and I've got a 50 millimeter lens

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.230 
object and I've got a 50 millimeter lens
on<00:05:58.470> and<00:05:58.800> my<00:05:59.040> settings<00:05:59.460> on<00:05:59.580> my<00:05:59.610> thirtieth<00:06:00.090> of<00:06:00.150> a

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
on and my settings on my thirtieth of a

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.690 
on and my settings on my thirtieth of a
second<00:06:00.630> at<00:06:00.750> 22<00:06:01.230> so<00:06:01.860> my<00:06:02.010> depth<00:06:02.280> of<00:06:02.400> field<00:06:02.550> is

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
second at 22 so my depth of field is

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.940 
second at 22 so my depth of field is
really<00:06:03.030> shallow<00:06:03.240> my<00:06:03.630> aperture<00:06:03.900> but<00:06:04.530> you<00:06:04.860> know

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
really shallow my aperture but you know

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.820 
really shallow my aperture but you know
you<00:06:05.010> don't<00:06:05.520> really<00:06:05.640> have<00:06:05.820> to<00:06:05.880> be<00:06:06.060> that<00:06:06.420> deep<00:06:06.990> in

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
you don't really have to be that deep in

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.190 
you don't really have to be that deep in
order<00:06:08.070> to<00:06:08.190> achieve<00:06:08.640> this<00:06:08.940> focus<00:06:09.330> but<00:06:09.870> simply

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
order to achieve this focus but simply

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.280 
order to achieve this focus but simply
all<00:06:10.380> I'm<00:06:10.470> going<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.650> do<00:06:10.740> is<00:06:10.920> shift<00:06:11.130> from<00:06:11.460> my

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
all I'm going to do is shift from my

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.100 
all I'm going to do is shift from my
foreground<00:06:13.670> to<00:06:14.670> my<00:06:14.850> background<00:06:15.090> and<00:06:15.540> I'm

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
foreground to my background and I'm

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.330 
foreground to my background and I'm
gonna<00:06:16.200> shift<00:06:16.410> from<00:06:16.560> my<00:06:16.710> background<00:06:16.920> on<00:06:17.250> the

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
gonna shift from my background on the

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.720 
gonna shift from my background on the
fishy<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:18.870> foreground<00:06:19.290> drummer<00:06:19.620> dude<00:06:19.860> and

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
fishy to the foreground drummer dude and

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.420 
fishy to the foreground drummer dude and
I'll<00:06:20.850> do<00:06:20.970> it<00:06:21.060> one<00:06:21.150> more<00:06:21.210> time<00:06:22.190> back<00:06:23.190> to<00:06:23.340> the

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
I'll do it one more time back to the

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.050 
I'll do it one more time back to the
fishy<00:06:23.610> and<00:06:24.620> then<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:26.130> the<00:06:26.220> foreground<00:06:26.520> guy<00:06:26.730> and

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
fishy and then to the foreground guy and

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.420 
fishy and then to the foreground guy and
you<00:06:27.480> can<00:06:27.630> do<00:06:27.750> that<00:06:27.780> with<00:06:28.080> couples<00:06:28.590> you<00:06:29.130> can<00:06:29.280> do

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
you can do that with couples you can do

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.550 
you can do that with couples you can do
that<00:06:29.580> with<00:06:29.850> if<00:06:30.120> you<00:06:30.210> have<00:06:30.330> a<00:06:30.360> wall<00:06:30.660> and<00:06:31.020> kind<00:06:31.500> of

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
that with if you have a wall and kind of

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.870 
that with if you have a wall and kind of
like<00:06:31.650> your<00:06:31.770> seniors<00:06:32.100> leaning<00:06:32.430> up<00:06:32.520> against<00:06:32.820> the

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880
