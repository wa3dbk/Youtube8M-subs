00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 the glasses of the glasses make the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 eyes are in the background I 'm going to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.259
 teach two ways to make up for 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.269
 that the frame frames them by attracting 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.130
 towards them all the attention the secret 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.110
 is in the black line air I'm going to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.849
 focus on the makeup of the eyes as well 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.010
 that once prepared the skin applies a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.570
 base for eyelids so shadows last 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.310
 all day apply a little bit of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.529
 product and spread it with your finger 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.330
 all the eyelid in this first version 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.010
 let's work more shadows and the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.140
 black line will be more discreet than the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.699
 so you can choose the style that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.500
 more like in the upper eyelid 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.600
 Apply a beige shade and lightly 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.480
 curly to open the look with a touch 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.520
 of light 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.380
 in the lacrimal it puts illuminator for 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.329
 accentuate this area and illuminate still 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.010
 more the look when we wear glasses there 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.510
 that intensify the light of the eyes a 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.920
 little more than usual so that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.920
 stand out through the crystals 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.910
 to enlarge the eyes visually mark 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.560
 the basin with a chocolate shade or 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.670
 hazelnut to get a contrast 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.670
 between this area and the eyelid 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.790
 applies this tone also at the end of 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.190
 lower eyelid to give depth 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.080
 to the eyes 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.520
 with a chubby and rounded brush 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.110
 blur the edges of the shadow 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.110
 chocolate so there are no cuts 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.460
 behind the lashes draw the line 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.799
 black well stuck in this way it seems 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 much thicker to do it to me 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.590
 like to start at the end taking it 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.590
 little by little towards the lacrimal 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.680
 fill the inside of the eyelid 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.780
 higher 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.130
 and the spaces between the tabs for 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.910
 get the stroke is totally 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.910
 black 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.660
 to finish review the possible 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.300
 imperfections of the top part of 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.790
 the bay is black line changes 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.380
 totally the eye looks good to us 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.380
 then the lashes apply 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.170
 the mask apply insisting on the 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.730
 root to perform them as much as possible 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.470
 richer are less reason 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.470
 glasses of the glasses when blinking 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.200
 a touch of the whit inside the 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.760
 lower eyelid to give it an air 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.760
 fresh and rested in the look 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.560
 this is the first option 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.800
 in these are a proposal to the shadows 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.930
 they will be more discreet and the liner more 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.790
 colorful once the base has been applied 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.620
 shadows put a beige shade matte for 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.510
 that seems the natural tone of the eyelid 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.220
 If you have brown skin with a color 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.220
 that looks more like the tone of your skin 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.690
 then we go directly to the 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.550
 lainer this time instead of a pencil 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.349
 black go to use a bullet angel eyeliner 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.450
 that the liquid is even more intense 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.130
 it's also of course different 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.810
 from before I'm just going to do the black stroke 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.150
 at the end of the eye to enhance this 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.470
 zone that is what defines the look with 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.270
 the open eye makes a mark of the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.830
 prolongation of the imaginary line that 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.690
 it would continue from the end of the eyelid 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.570
 inferior or so 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.670
 a thread with the rest and with the eye 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.380
 open I finish filling the stroke of 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.570
 this way is more accurate since you see in 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.090
 at all times how will it be delineated 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.290
 also the end of the lower eyelid and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.290
 join it with the top 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.640
 a touch of illuminator in the lacrimal 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.530
 without forgetting the eyelash curler 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.549
 and the black mask 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.069
 and to finish the raw pencil 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.260
 Y 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.090
 If you stain your mask eyelid like 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.189
 it has happened to me I expected it to dry and 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.049
 I pass a dry swab over it 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.450
 erase without spoiling the shadows is a 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.560
 magic trick and the second one is already 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.560
 finished makeup 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.300
