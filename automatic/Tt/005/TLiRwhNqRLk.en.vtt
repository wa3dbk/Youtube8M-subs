00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.519 

the<00:00:00.260> urinary<00:00:01.260> system<00:00:02.389> so<00:00:03.389> we've<00:00:03.750> got<00:00:03.990> kidney

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
the urinary system so we've got kidney

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.920 
the urinary system so we've got kidney
turnip<00:00:05.130> here<00:00:05.460> where<00:00:05.910> urine<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.390> formed<00:00:06.810> and

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
turnip here where urine is formed and

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.190 
turnip here where urine is formed and
then<00:00:07.049> we<00:00:07.109> have<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.350> tube<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.220> ureter<00:00:09.200> would

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
then we have that tube the ureter would

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.240 
then we have that tube the ureter would
connect<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.730> urinary<00:00:12.179> bladder<00:00:12.860> on<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
connect to the urinary bladder on the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.039 
connect to the urinary bladder on the
other<00:00:14.370> side<00:00:14.639> we<00:00:14.759> have<00:00:14.910> cut<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.630> we<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.870> pull

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
other side we have cut it so we can pull

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.230 
other side we have cut it so we can pull
this<00:00:16.199> over<00:00:16.529> here<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:16.980> there<00:00:17.730> would<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:17.850> two

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
this over here but there would be two

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.609 
this over here but there would be two
ureters<00:00:18.660> connected<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> urinary<00:00:19.529> bladder

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
ureters connected to the urinary bladder

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.220 
ureters connected to the urinary bladder
and<00:00:19.920> then<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.220> single<00:00:20.520> urethra<00:00:21.390> which<00:00:21.660> would

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and then a single urethra which would

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.000 
and then a single urethra which would
take<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.590> urine<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> exit<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.650> that's

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
take the urine to the exit so that's

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.859 
take the urine to the exit so that's
your<00:00:26.220> name<00:00:26.369> bladder<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.330> your<00:00:27.599> wreath

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
your name bladder this is your wreath

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.130 
your name bladder this is your wreath
run<00:00:28.670> now<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:30.179> do<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> reproductive

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
run now we can do the reproductive

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.500 
run now we can do the reproductive
structures<00:00:31.740> oh<00:00:32.210> all<00:00:33.210> right

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
structures oh all right

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
structures oh all right
so<00:00:33.690> they're<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:35.630> cat<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.140> lot<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
so they're a cat just like a lot of

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.209 
so they're a cat just like a lot of
mammals<00:00:37.980> they<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.480> litter<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.219> offspring

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
mammals they have a litter of offspring

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.080 
mammals they have a litter of offspring
at<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.579> time

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
at a time

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.930 
at a time
so<00:00:42.570> they're<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:43.140> need<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.559> larger

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
so they're they need a much larger

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.410 
so they're they need a much larger
uterus<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.649> allowing<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:47.070> multiple<00:00:47.610> spots

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
uterus with allowing for multiple spots

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.310 
uterus with allowing for multiple spots
for<00:00:48.539> implantation

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
for implantation

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.110 
for implantation
so<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> uterus<00:00:50.250> itself<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:51.079> y-shaped<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> what

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
so the uterus itself is y-shaped so what

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.580 
so the uterus itself is y-shaped so what
we<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.719> tiny<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.260> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
we see here that little tiny thing is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.610 
we see here that little tiny thing is
the<00:00:58.770> ovary<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.870> there's<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.289> tube

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the ovary and there's a little tube

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.250 
the ovary and there's a little tube
around<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.280> ovary<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.960> called

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
around the ovary and that can be called

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.560 
around the ovary and that can be called
the<00:01:04.559> oviduct<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.729> sort<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.330> nonhuman

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the oviduct that's sort of a nonhuman

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.380 
the oviduct that's sort of a nonhuman
name<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.770> give<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.790> human<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.180> call

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
name we give it and the human we call

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.210 
name we give it and the human we call
them<00:01:09.570> fallopian<00:01:09.869> tubes<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:10.530> uterine<00:01:10.920> tubes

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
them fallopian tubes or uterine tubes

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.910 
them fallopian tubes or uterine tubes
but<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.840> ovary<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
but that is the ovary and then the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.060 
but that is the ovary and then the
oviduct<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.850> then<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.840> right<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
oviduct and then this right here and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130 
oviduct and then this right here and
same<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.850> other<00:01:17.909> side<00:01:18.080> these<00:01:19.080> are

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
same on the other side these are

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.560 
same on the other side these are
actually<00:01:19.590> parts<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> uterus<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.759> these

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
actually parts of the uterus and these

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
actually parts of the uterus and these
are<00:01:21.810> called<00:01:22.020> uterine<00:01:22.290> horns<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.280> both

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
are called uterine horns they both

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.370 
are called uterine horns they both
connect<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> body<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> uterus<00:01:24.630> here

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
connect to the body of the uterus here

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.920 
connect to the body of the uterus here
so<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> would<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.939> labeled<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
so here I would just if I labeled you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
so here I would just if I labeled you
had<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> pin<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.710> say<00:01:28.860> uterus<00:01:29.340> but

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
had a pin here you just say uterus but

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.249 
had a pin here you just say uterus but
if<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.790> labeled<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.390> these<00:01:30.509> branches<00:01:30.869> of

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
if I labeled one of these branches of

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.980 
if I labeled one of these branches of
the<00:01:31.409> uterus<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.799> would<00:01:31.920> say<00:01:32.070> uterine<00:01:32.520> horn

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
the uterus you would say uterine horn

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
the uterus you would say uterine horn
again<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.290> ovary<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.100> here<00:01:35.340> oviduct

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
again this is ovary and up here oviduct

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.289 
again this is ovary and up here oviduct
so<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:39.140> would<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.290> sorry<00:01:41.040> no<00:01:41.610> I

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
so you can see that would you sorry no I

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.340 
so you can see that would you sorry no I
was<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.869> that's<00:01:43.020> how<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
was just one that's how would you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.560 
was just one that's how would you
separate<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> ovaries<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.399> overdone<00:01:44.970> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
separate the ovaries and overdone it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.120 
separate the ovaries and overdone it
says<00:01:45.780> you'll<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.530> able<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.710> tell<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.979> have

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the pin in the ovary itself or if I have

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.649 
the pin in the ovary itself or if I have
the<00:01:49.200> pin<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.700> oviduct<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.390> hard

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the pin in the oviduct and if it's hard

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.350 
the pin in the oviduct and if it's hard
for<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> ask<00:01:53.100> me<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.670> come

the uterus so similar to the male tract
in<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.800> female<00:02:15.550> cat<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:16.630> urinary<00:02:16.990> system

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
in the female cat to a urinary system

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.740 
in the female cat to a urinary system
and<00:02:17.680> reproductive<00:02:18.160> systems<00:02:18.460> connect<00:02:19.150> so

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
and reproductive systems connect so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.210 
and reproductive systems connect so
there<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> single<00:02:20.520> exit<00:02:21.520> for<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:23.620> material

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
there is a single exit for all material

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.300 
there is a single exit for all material
here<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:26.010> urethra

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
here so the urethra

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.100 
here so the urethra
this<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.450> uterus<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.980> portion<00:02:30.610> here<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.210> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
this is uterus this portion here is the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.840 
this is uterus this portion here is the
vagina<00:02:32.730> okay<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.450> where<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.490> urethra<00:02:36.490> and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
vagina okay and where the urethra and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.690 
vagina okay and where the urethra and
the<00:02:37.030> vagina<00:02:37.150> come<00:02:37.570> together<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:38.700> cavity

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the vagina come together this cavity

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.120 
the vagina come together this cavity
here<00:02:39.790> which<00:02:40.000> actually<00:02:40.300> cut<00:02:40.450> into<00:02:40.960> this<00:02:41.740> space

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
here which actually cut into this space

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.510 
here which actually cut into this space
is<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.210> tube<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.620> space<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.160> enlarged

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
is a tube I like space it's enlarged

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.100 
is a tube I like space it's enlarged
tube<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.300> it's<00:02:46.450> called<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.840> urogenital

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
tube and so it's called the urogenital

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.920 
tube and so it's called the urogenital
sinus<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.210> follow<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.630> female

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
sinus so we follow the female

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.470 
sinus so we follow the female
reproductive<00:02:50.410> tract<00:02:50.860> up<00:02:51.130> we<00:02:51.820> start<00:02:52.150> with<00:02:52.240> your

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
reproductive tract up we start with your

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.530 
reproductive tract up we start with your
genital<00:02:52.840> sinus<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:55.090> get<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.390> this

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
genital sinus and then we get to this

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.500 
genital sinus and then we get to this
tube<00:02:55.870> here<00:02:56.080> vagina<00:02:56.770> which<00:02:57.130> leads<00:02:58.060> us<00:02:58.210> today

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
tube here vagina which leads us today

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.190 
tube here vagina which leads us today
uterus<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.860> uterine<00:03:00.220> horns

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:23.449 

over<00:03:07.200> DOCSIS<00:03:07.739> tubes<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.519> then<00:03:22.340> there<00:03:23.340> would

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
over DOCSIS tubes and then there would

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.220 
over DOCSIS tubes and then there would
be<00:03:23.489> yeah<00:03:23.940> three<00:03:24.920> three<00:03:25.950> now<00:03:26.760> we've<00:03:27.090> if<00:03:27.870> we
