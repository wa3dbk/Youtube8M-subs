00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
before I try to use the wire on is I'll

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.850 
before I try to use the wire on is I'll
pre<00:00:37.020> fold<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.560> first<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.700> idea<00:00:39.060> is<00:00:39.560> I<00:00:40.560> want

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
pre fold it first and the idea is I want

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.800 
pre fold it first and the idea is I want
to<00:00:41.100> flatten<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.550> down<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> little<00:00:41.910> bit<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.360> but

small<00:02:13.770> bead<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.310> you're<00:02:14.430> doing<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.880> top<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
small bead when you're doing it top and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.400 
small bead when you're doing it top and
it<00:02:17.160> generally<00:02:17.459> faces<00:02:18.030> down<00:02:18.300> because<00:02:19.020> if<00:02:19.290> you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
it generally faces down because if you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.050 
it generally faces down because if you
turn<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> wire<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.160> around<00:02:20.489> have<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.880> facing

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
turn the wire on around have it facing

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.360 
turn the wire on around have it facing
up<00:02:21.360> it's<00:02:21.900> going<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.110> catch<00:02:22.290> water<00:02:22.620> if<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.069> if

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
up it's going to catch water if you if

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.970 
up it's going to catch water if you if
you're<00:02:23.640> out<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.910> rain<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:25.140> top<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.620> a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
you're out in the rain on the top of a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.390 
you're out in the rain on the top of a
seat<00:02:26.310> cushion<00:02:27.709> like<00:02:28.709> on<00:02:28.920> use<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> top<00:02:30.090> of

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
seat cushion like on use on the top of

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.580 
seat cushion like on use on the top of
town<00:02:32.400> sedan<00:02:32.730> backrest<00:02:33.390> or<00:02:33.690> something<00:02:34.440> like

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
town sedan backrest or something like

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.440 
town sedan backrest or something like
that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
that

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.949 
that
I<00:02:36.480> generally<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.550> small<00:02:38.910> bead<00:02:39.239> facing

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
I generally have the small bead facing

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.009 
I generally have the small bead facing
towards<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.590> front<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.670> seat<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
towards the front of the seat and the

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.289 
towards the front of the seat and the
reason<00:02:43.349> I<00:02:43.470> do<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:44.010> when<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:44.640> go<00:02:44.819> around<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
reason I do that is when you go around a

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.039 
reason I do that is when you go around a
corner<00:02:46.310> it'll<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.730> bends<00:02:48.060> easier<00:02:48.510> towards<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
corner it'll it bends easier towards the

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.479 
corner it'll it bends easier towards the
small<00:02:49.380> bead<00:02:49.680> as<00:02:49.950> opposed<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.180> large<00:02:51.390> bead

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
small bead as opposed to the large bead

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.920 
small bead as opposed to the large bead
if<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:53.700> pretty<00:02:53.940> much<00:02:54.090> straight<00:02:54.390> like<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
if it's pretty much straight like the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.080 
if it's pretty much straight like the
crust<00:02:55.200> across<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.310> header<00:02:56.519> bow<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
crust across the header bow on a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.630 
crust across the header bow on a
convertible<00:02:57.660> or<00:02:57.840> something<00:02:58.200> like<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.640> and

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
convertible or something like that and

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.789 
convertible or something like that and
you<00:03:00.209> know<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.630> want<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.200> always<00:03:01.410> want<00:03:01.739> it

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
you know you want it you always want it

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.130 
you know you want it you always want it
facing<00:03:01.980> down<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.690> then<00:03:03.840> what<00:03:03.930> I'm<00:03:03.989> going<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
facing down and then what I'm going to

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.170 
facing down and then what I'm going to
do<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:04.620> right<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.489> between<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.940> stitches

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
do is just right in between the stitches

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.130 
do is just right in between the stitches
on<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.630> inside<00:03:07.760> I'm<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.209> pull<00:03:10.049> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
on the inside I'm just going to pull it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:20.539 
on the inside I'm just going to pull it
down<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:18.470> can<00:03:19.470> do<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.680> same<00:03:19.859> thing<00:03:20.130> with<00:03:20.280> tax

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
down you can do the same thing with tax

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.390 
down you can do the same thing with tax
but<00:03:20.850> I'm<00:03:20.940> using<00:03:21.420> staples<00:03:22.010> after<00:03:23.010> I've<00:03:23.130> tacked

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
but I'm using staples after I've tacked

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.670 
but I'm using staples after I've tacked
it<00:03:23.609> onto<00:03:23.760> whatever<00:03:24.450> I'm<00:03:24.750> working<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.590> I'll

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
it onto whatever I'm working on and I'll

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.740 
it onto whatever I'm working on and I'll
just<00:03:31.890> flatten<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.400> down<00:03:32.579> again<00:03:32.940> then<00:03:33.630> it

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
just flatten it down again then it

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.690 
just flatten it down again then it
closes<00:03:33.989> right<00:03:34.350> up<00:03:34.380> tight<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:35.069> can't<00:03:35.310> see<00:03:35.519> any

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
closes right up tight you can't see any

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.920 
closes right up tight you can't see any
tax<00:03:36.060> or<00:03:36.299> staples<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:38.269> about<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.450> only<00:03:39.750> other

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.000 
tax or staples and about the only other
thing<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:41.720> if<00:03:42.720> I'm<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.230> I'm<00:03:43.650> going<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.950> be

generally<00:03:50.280> what<00:03:50.459> I'll<00:03:50.549> do<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.850> I'll<00:03:50.970> take<00:03:51.000> the

generally what I'll do is I'll take the

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.020 
generally what I'll do is I'll take the
wire<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.370> because<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.579> shape<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.970> the
