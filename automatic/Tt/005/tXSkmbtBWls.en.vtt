00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.029
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.170
 again diego machete making a 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.540
 more video 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.280
 this is a tutorial I already had one in the 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.100
 another youtube account but for some 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.050
 reason why this evil to block or no longer 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.419
 I had access to them is that the people 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.759
 he has been putting many comments 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.570
 there I could not answer for that 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.429
 reason is that I'm going to make another 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.310
 web tutorial if you have this 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.390
 problem I am using the american 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.230
 Audio 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.460
 james group in one since the problem is 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.690
 so this happens regularly 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.420
 pretty that is here 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.420
 this is working and this one does not 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.010
 what happens if we do this 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.250
 it's total uncontrol 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.159
 in this case we are mixing videos 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.070
 so you can see it here mix the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.700
 video but the audio is like a 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.770
 little bit 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.640
 a little confusing good 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.920
 let's do something to fix it is the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.740
 question that everyone has 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.860
 they ask if in fact it is one is a 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.960
 america's failure in biem audio is 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.549
 power man or it's just a bad 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.490
 good configuration I have good 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.590
 news is a bad build two 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.159
 forgiveness configuration 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.250
 and here we are going to show you how it is that 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.540
 is configured and we are talking about the bm is 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.640
 one one 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.640
 so that's how the situation is 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.180
 it comes to configurations 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.960
 is going to come out this screen is very simple 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.660
 in the first option first here you get 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.660
 the sound car make sure it's okay 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.020
 I have selected then in the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.400
 first option where says inputs give you 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.400
 of down 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.610
 in advanced settings here is going 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:30.690
 to leave something that says master in this 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:34.320
 case you are going to put 1 excel of 1 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.770
 the one below the two if you do not have one 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.870
 can add 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.080
 here they are going to put it in america on 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.850
 20,000 bytes audio 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.120
 this is where the trick of these is 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.320
 last two in the first one they put the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.950
 tweets 1 and 2 and in the second they put 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.230
 output 3 and 4 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.060
 and to the beach 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.819
 kane 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.160
 clyde 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.400
 and again let's see 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.350
 how our problem was fixed we are going to 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.440
 check 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:18.530
 again starting 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.530
 let's see here we have play 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:27.700
 there is everything very well there we are now 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.700
 let's try the other 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.550
 there they are 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.090
 as we see until the mix of the videos 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.660
 they are very good there they are passing the 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.660
 solution 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.720
 and this is 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.940
