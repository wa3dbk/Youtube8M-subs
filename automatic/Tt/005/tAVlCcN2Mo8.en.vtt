00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.540 

all<00:00:01.680> right<00:00:01.860> I<00:00:01.890> figured<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.310> make<00:00:02.429> at<00:00:02.520> least

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
all right I figured that make at least

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:12.680 
all right I figured that make at least
one<00:00:02.909> start<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.659> finish<00:00:05.210> so<00:00:11.300> called<00:00:12.300> mystery

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
one start to finish so called mystery

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.029 
one start to finish so called mystery
filters<00:00:14.599> basically<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.839> my<00:00:15.929> fuel<00:00:16.289> rail<00:00:16.500> just

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
filters basically is my fuel rail just

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.050 
filters basically is my fuel rail just
keep<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.369> loose<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.680> slide<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.789> over<00:00:20.939> here

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
keep it loose and slide it over here

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.849 
keep it loose and slide it over here
yourself<00:00:21.300> some<00:00:21.630> room<00:00:21.779> don't<00:00:22.289> break<00:00:22.529> any<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
yourself some room don't break any the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.570 
yourself some room don't break any the
clips<00:00:23.100> or<00:00:23.279> anything

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.310 

like<00:00:28.060> I<00:00:28.179> said<00:00:28.420> there<00:00:28.599> is<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.720> tool<00:00:29.019> that<00:00:29.050> looks

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
like I said there is a tool that looks

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.259 
like I said there is a tool that looks
to<00:00:29.560> do<00:00:29.679> this<00:00:29.800> I'm<00:00:30.009> considering<00:00:30.609> by<00:00:30.789> that's

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
to do this I'm considering by that's

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.270 
to do this I'm considering by that's
kind<00:00:31.539> of<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.660> pain<00:00:31.810> in<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:31.990> ass<00:00:32.140> but<00:00:32.529> this<00:00:32.980> works

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
kind of a pain in the ass but this works

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.729 
kind of a pain in the ass but this works
too<00:00:34.110> basically<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.320> screw<00:00:35.590> in<00:00:37.320> let's<00:00:38.320> say<00:00:38.470> four

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
too basically to screw in let's say four

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.150 
too basically to screw in let's say four
or<00:00:38.860> five<00:00:39.070> full<00:00:39.370> turns<00:00:40.649> enough<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:41.769> get<00:00:41.920> a<00:00:41.949> good

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
or five full turns enough to get a good

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.500 
or five full turns enough to get a good
bite

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389 

and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.140> when<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.290> figured<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:46.980> recently

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and then when I figured out as recently

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.170 
and then when I figured out as recently
as<00:00:48.260> it<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.380> you<00:00:52.220> push<00:00:53.220> it<00:00:53.370> down<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> slightly

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
as it if you push it down on it slightly

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.390 
as it if you push it down on it slightly
you<00:00:57.440> know<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> keeps<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.890> attached<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
you know it keeps it attached to the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.100 
you know it keeps it attached to the
breast<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.940> helps<00:01:00.420> remove<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
breast and helps remove it

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.960 
breast and helps remove it
I<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.890> been<00:01:02.040> using<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> pair<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> pliers<00:01:02.699> at

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
I just been using a pair of pliers at

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.410 
I just been using a pair of pliers at
the<00:01:03.089> end<00:01:04.190> putting<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.280> slight<00:01:05.489> downward

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the end putting a slight downward

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:20.779 
the end putting a slight downward
pressure<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:19.190> when<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.280> put<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.670> new

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
pressure to it when you put in the new

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:28.840 
pressure to it when you put in the new
ones<00:01:21.000> you'll<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.300> why<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.660> a<00:01:21.720> snug<00:01:25.280> so

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:38.280 

little<00:01:29.240> downward<00:01:29.600> pressure<00:01:34.270> see<00:01:35.270> pop<00:01:35.900> that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.850 

that's<00:01:39.290> good<00:01:39.560> removal<00:01:40.990> not<00:01:41.990> over-the-top

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
that's good removal not over-the-top

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.960 
that's good removal not over-the-top
I<00:01:42.890> broke<00:01:43.400> anything<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:45.550> mean<00:01:46.550> again<00:01:46.820> these

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
I broke anything I mean again these

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.590 
I broke anything I mean again these
filters<00:01:47.390> looks<00:01:47.570> fairly<00:01:47.870> clean<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.320> me<00:01:48.440> but

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
filters looks fairly clean to me but

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.300 
filters looks fairly clean to me but
they're<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:50.900> fine<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.229> think<00:01:51.500> they're<00:01:51.710> 2<00:01:51.890> micron

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
they're so fine I think they're 2 micron

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.870 
they're so fine I think they're 2 micron
or<00:01:52.460> even<00:01:52.670> 1<00:01:52.850> micron<00:01:54.220> they're<00:01:55.220> literally<00:01:55.550> any

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
or even 1 micron they're literally any

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.310 
or even 1 micron they're literally any
amount<00:01:56.180> of

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.590 

so<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.310> take<00:02:05.460> some<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.180> seafoam

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
so I'm going to take some the seafoam

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:19.589 
so I'm going to take some the seafoam
spray<00:02:08.660> sprayed<00:02:09.660> directly<00:02:09.840> into<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.289> injector

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:26.420 

right<00:02:20.200> directly<00:02:20.530> into<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.799> injector

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.399 

give<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.209> some<00:02:27.420> kind<00:02:27.689> of<00:02:27.720> work<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:27.930> look<00:02:28.319> at

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
give that some kind of work so look at

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.569 
give that some kind of work so look at
all<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.650> varnish<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.370> built<00:02:30.060> up

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
all the varnish and that built up

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.850 
all the varnish and that built up
take<00:02:32.579> a<00:02:32.610> new<00:02:33.379> little<00:02:34.379> filter<00:02:36.439> like<00:02:37.439> I<00:02:37.530> said

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
take a new little filter like I said

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.140 
take a new little filter like I said
these<00:02:38.040> are<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.250> little<00:02:38.459> shorter<00:02:38.849> than<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
these are a little shorter than the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.540 
these are a little shorter than the
other<00:02:39.360> ones

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.230 

super<00:02:46.540> happy<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:47.020> they're<00:02:47.290> shorter<00:02:48.240> they

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
super happy that they're shorter they

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.090 
super happy that they're shorter they
are<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.510> same<00:02:49.720> filter<00:02:50.500> essentially<00:02:50.950> these

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
are the same filter essentially these

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.360 
are the same filter essentially these
are<00:02:51.160> ejector<00:02:51.730> filters<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.920> flow<00:02:54.130> rate<00:02:54.340> should

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
are ejector filters the flow rate should

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.440 
are ejector filters the flow rate should
be<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.640> say<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:54.880> mean<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.180> about<00:02:55.300> seven<00:02:55.570> cars

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
be a say I mean it's about seven cars

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.420 
be a say I mean it's about seven cars
should<00:02:58.450> work<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.770> just<00:02:59.920> take<00:03:00.070> something<00:03:00.340> to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
should work and I just take something to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.070 
should work and I just take something to
cover<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.760> whole<00:03:00.970> top<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.720> don't<00:03:01.870> want<00:03:02.020> to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
cover the whole top you don't want to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:11.000 
cover the whole top you don't want to
bend<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.440> obviously<00:03:02.920> going<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.900> very<00:03:04.900> lightly

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:20.260 

you<00:03:12.010> gotta<00:03:12.190> get<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.520> foolish

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:40.860 

if<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:20.780> want<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:22.900> inject<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.170> seat<00:03:24.440> properly

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.330 

there<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:41.959> go<00:03:42.110> we<00:03:42.530> want<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.799> be<00:03:42.890> flush<00:03:45.340> and

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
there you go we want to be flush and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.760 
there you go we want to be flush and
you're<00:03:46.519> good<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.730> go
