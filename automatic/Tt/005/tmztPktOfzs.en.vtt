00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.259
 Earth ecosystems are constantly changing, with the mixing and mixing of organisms due to each other 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.500
 Migrations, alien events, and slow progressive expansions. But since we humans entered 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.160
 For the event, we put things into rapid introduction, we moved plants, animals, and other objects 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.150
 Around the globe, whether it was intentional or not. 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.990
 From time to time, one of those portals may have an evolutionary property as a deadly name 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.390
 Or resistance to predators, or appetizing appetites, which help them unexpectedly to dominate 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.619
 On their new areas. Earthworms, for example, were introduced by European settlers into North American territory 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.560
 It began to move slowly across the continent ever since, plowing the soil 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.060
 And increase crop production wherever it occurs. 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.950
 But if the newcomer hurts us or part of the environment we care about, we will call it 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.730
 "Invasive organisms". Technically, humans are not "invaders" because we are 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.530
 Usually we do not consider ourselves an environmental threat ... to ourselves. 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.660
 But other organisms are certainly a threat. They have our interest in one way and it costs us money. 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.969
 a lot of money. The United States spends billions of dollars in fighting invasive weeds like 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.420
 The attractive and harmful yellow watercress flower, which chokes the fields and sneaks into the golf courses and meadows. 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.440
 The other invaders destroyed many fragile ecosystems that we can not but worry about 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.840
 Even if it does not cost us money. For example, he spent the crazy yellow ants 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.600
 - which settled in southeastern Asia - on many of Australia's precious and endangered species 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920
 Since entering its territory several decades ago. These little ants feed on almost anything 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.770
 Caught in his way whether insects, amphibians, birds, small mammals, or even known red sea crabs 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.229
 In Australia's Christmas Island, which was used to control the island's shrubs; without crabs 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.830
 Will disrupt its ecosystem. 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.570
 Observation of invasive organisms is easy, but the real difficulty lies in their fight 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.310
 When we brought the rabbits to the New Zealand land for food and the use of their fur, the rabbits fled and multiplied like ... well ... rabbits invaded 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.130
 Throughout the country. So we brought the son of a lender to control the rabbits, but 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.740
 The two spread like wildfire, ignoring the son of the rabbit lender while heeding the rare species like 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.270
 The Cacabou, which is about to extinction. The rabbits and the son of a lender are still taking over New Zealand. 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.070
 This is just one of several well-intentioned biological control attempts that have led to destruction. 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.829
 The best way to combat this invasion is to first arm us with knowledge, rather than 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.219
 Trying to eliminate the crazy yellow ants in Australia by spraying insecticides all over, we have learned 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.609
 The best way is that the attack is by several stages and for a year, targeting specifically the areas affected by the ants 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:21.260
 At a time when the breeding ants of the eggs are mature and susceptible to pesticides. 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.879
 Then we distribute two types of bait to the workers, to move them to their holes, taste kills 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.879
 The other causes infertility to the queens. There is no effective poison, but together, 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.889
 It is possible to kill 99% of ants. 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.799
 But with so many invaders, even 99 percent is not enough because it does not erase, whatever the advantage 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.239
 Which gave the invaders priority in the first place. And unless we are sincere in trying to eliminate 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.680
 Each organism is effective and productive of them; they will eventually return as strongly as before, 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.859
 Then we will do our utmost to stop them. 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.139
 Above all, we must really stop moving potentially problematic objects around, 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.609
 We leave rabbits wherever they belong and make sure that ants and earthworms are not hidden in ships or cars 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.139
 Or excavators. But in a modern globalized world, it is easier to say than to act. 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.849
 Our only hope is to release the beings either intentionally or unintentionally just to see them 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.809
 Quickly spread out of our control, is to learn as much as possible about 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:17.559
 Habits and lives, only then will we have an opportunity to control their harmful behavior 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:24.559
 In its depths. Translation: team translate. Twitter: autrjim @
