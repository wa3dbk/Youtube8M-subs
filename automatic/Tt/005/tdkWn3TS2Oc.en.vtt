filter<00:00:20.580> assembly<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:22.109> side<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.529> got

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
filter assembly on this side we have got

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.810 
filter assembly on this side we have got
the<00:00:23.100> bike<00:00:23.310> with<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.670> seeds<00:00:24.090> removed<00:00:25.760> okay<00:00:26.760> so

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the bike with the seeds removed okay so

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.570 
the bike with the seeds removed okay so
basically<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.380> had<00:00:28.830> picked<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.340> five

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
basically I had picked the five

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.460 
basically I had picked the five
millimeter<00:00:30.029> allen<00:00:30.119> key<00:00:30.510> but<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.349> it

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
millimeter allen key but you can do it

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
millimeter allen key but you can do it
with<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> T<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.870> conventional

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
with it with the T and the conventional

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.190 
with it with the T and the conventional
head<00:00:34.050> also<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.890> makes<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> job<00:00:35.399> easier<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
head also it makes the job easier so you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560 
head also it makes the job easier so you
have<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> remove<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> four<00:00:38.430> bolts<00:00:38.879> which<00:00:39.270> flix

have to remove the four bolts which flix

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.860 
have to remove the four bolts which flix
the<00:00:39.719> tank<00:00:39.960> onto<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> chassis<00:00:41.540> once<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the tank onto the chassis once that is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.100 
the tank onto the chassis once that is
done<00:00:43.280> then<00:00:44.280> you'll<00:00:44.640> get<00:00:44.879> four<00:00:45.180> bolts<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
done then you'll get four bolts and a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.139 
done then you'll get four bolts and a
metal<00:00:46.590> spacer<00:00:46.890> there<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.910> four

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
metal spacer there they are the four

metal spacer there they are the four
bolts<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> metal<00:00:49.050> spacer<00:00:49.410> make<00:00:49.590> sure<00:00:49.739> you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
bolts and the metal spacer make sure you

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
bolts and the metal spacer make sure you
don't<00:00:50.039> lose<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> metal<00:00:50.579> spacer<00:00:50.879> it's

you do that the tank is gonna come loose
like<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> turn<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
like that and you have to turn it

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.100 
like that and you have to turn it
clockwise<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.740> pull<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> Delta<00:01:09.960> box

the metallic puck it will make the bike

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
the metallic puck it will make the bike
more<00:01:19.710> vertical<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.220> will<00:01:20.400> prevent<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> tank

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
more vertical and will prevent the tank

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
more vertical and will prevent the tank
from<00:01:21.509> tipping<00:01:22.500> over<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.950> slipping<00:01:23.250> off<00:01:23.430> the

and<00:01:25.860> fuel<00:01:26.070> cable<00:01:26.520> underneath<00:01:27.860> once<00:01:28.860> you've

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and fuel cable underneath once you've

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.190 
and fuel cable underneath once you've
done<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.250> there's<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> airbox<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:31.110> are

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
done that there's the airbox there are

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840 
done that there's the airbox there are
four<00:01:31.439> screws<00:01:31.770> holding<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> top<00:01:32.430> cover<00:01:32.670> in

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
four screws holding the top cover in

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.240 
four screws holding the top cover in
place<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:34.140> won't<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.619> remove<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
place you won't have to remove the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.050 
place you won't have to remove the
screws<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.960> use<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.170> T<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> Phillips<00:01:37.979> head

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
screws I use the T with a Phillips head

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.010 
screws I use the T with a Phillips head
because<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> screws<00:01:39.420> are<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> little<00:01:39.720> hard

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
because the screws are a little hard

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.350 
because the screws are a little hard
when<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.189> then<00:01:41.970> use<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
when you can do that and then use the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.760 
when you can do that and then use the
small<00:01:42.570> screwdriver<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> t

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
small screwdriver because the t

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.240 
small screwdriver because the t
scratches<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> tank<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.729> know<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:45.450> turning

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
scratches the tank you know when turning

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.560 
scratches the tank you know when turning
so<00:01:47.250> once<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.579> four<00:01:47.759> screws<00:01:47.970> are<00:01:48.090> off<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.450> air

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
so once the four screws are off the air

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.359 
so once the four screws are off the air
box<00:01:48.720> cover<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.409> comes<00:01:49.680> off<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> effort

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
box cover just comes off in the effort

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.580 
box cover just comes off in the effort
also<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.909> comes<00:01:51.299> out<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.600> know<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
also just comes out you know that's it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.200 
also just comes out you know that's it
and<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.340> eye<00:01:53.369> box<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.909> even

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and if you see the eye box don't even

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.289 
and if you see the eye box don't even
clean<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.540> from<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> inside<00:01:55.969> okay<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.180> is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
clean it from the inside okay this is

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.550 
clean it from the inside okay this is
the<00:01:57.450> difference<00:01:57.810> between<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.200> new<00:01:58.380> air

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the difference between the new air

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.190 
the difference between the new air
filter<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> older<00:01:59.460> filter<00:01:59.790> now<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.630> top

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
filter and the older filter now the top

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200 
filter and the older filter now the top
one<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.530> old<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:01.890> obviously<00:02:02.490> which<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
one is the old one obviously which is

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.359 
one is the old one obviously which is
run<00:02:03.479> twelve<00:02:03.719> thousand<00:02:03.990> kilometers

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
run twelve thousand kilometers

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.190 
run twelve thousand kilometers
and<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.299> very<00:02:06.390> dirty<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.799> need<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.190> keep

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
and it's very dirty so you need to keep

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.530 
and it's very dirty so you need to keep
cleaning<00:02:10.200> your<00:02:10.500> filter<00:02:10.769> every<00:02:10.979> say<00:02:11.489> 250<00:02:12.420> or

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
cleaning your filter every say 250 or

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.180 
cleaning your filter every say 250 or
300<00:02:12.720> kilometers<00:02:13.379> because<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.800> keeps<00:02:14.069> giving

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
300 kilometers because it keeps giving

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.850 
300 kilometers because it keeps giving
you<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.550> throttle<00:02:14.819> response<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.620> at<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.739> same

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
you go throttle response and at the same

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.670 
you go throttle response and at the same
time<00:02:17.069> maintains<00:02:17.550> good<00:02:17.610> efficiency<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.470> this

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
time maintains good efficiency so this

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.470 
time maintains good efficiency so this
is<00:02:19.769> how<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.950> new<00:02:20.310> air<00:02:20.550> filter<00:02:20.670> goes<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
is how the new air filter goes in the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.050 
is how the new air filter goes in the
endo<00:02:21.690> side<00:02:21.840> facing<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.940> there<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.030> a

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
endo side facing up and there is a

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.220 
endo side facing up and there is a
groove<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.780> way<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:26.129> sits<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.910> airbox<00:02:27.230> so

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
groove in way it sits in the airbox so

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.660 
groove in way it sits in the airbox so
make<00:02:28.410> sure<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.739> seats<00:02:28.950> properly<00:02:29.160> there's<00:02:29.610> a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
make sure it seats properly there's a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.119 
make sure it seats properly there's a
rubber<00:02:29.940> flap<00:02:30.239> towards<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> top<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.920> one

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
rubber flap towards the top that one

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.430 
rubber flap towards the top that one
which<00:02:32.519> comes<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> way<00:02:33.110> make<00:02:34.110> sure<00:02:34.319> it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
which comes in the way make sure it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.509 
which comes in the way make sure it
doesn't<00:02:34.680> come<00:02:34.739> on<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.980> when<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:35.280> seats

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
doesn't come on the when it seats

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.420 
doesn't come on the when it seats
properly<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.380> put<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.799> filter<00:02:38.130> back<00:02:38.160> in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
properly so just put the filter back in

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.520 
properly so just put the filter back in
place<00:02:38.670> put<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.329> air<00:02:39.569> box<00:02:39.690> cover<00:02:39.930> back<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.349> top

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
place put the air box cover back on top

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.140 
place put the air box cover back on top
and<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:42.290> rescrew<00:02:43.290> everything<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.829> way<00:02:43.950> you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
and just rescrew everything the way you

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.289 
and just rescrew everything the way you
undone<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:46.310> using<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.400> tee<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
undone it using the tee and then the

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.020 
undone it using the tee and then the
small<00:02:48.510> screwdriver<00:02:48.900> philips<00:02:49.230> ID<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.760> once

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
small screwdriver philips ID so once

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.390 
small screwdriver philips ID so once
that<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.420> done<00:02:51.629> basically<00:02:52.410> move<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.069> bike<00:02:53.190> out

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that is done basically move the bike out

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.460 
that is done basically move the bike out
to<00:02:53.459> some<00:02:53.760> area<00:02:54.299> open<00:02:54.629> area<00:02:54.900> where<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.290> can

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
to some area open area where you can

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.350 
to some area open area where you can
start<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:58.549> basically<00:02:59.549> you<00:03:00.150> haven't

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
start it and basically you haven't

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.150 
start it and basically you haven't
disabled<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> audio<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.290> there<00:03:01.950> were<00:03:02.040> some

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
disabled the audio but there were some

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.650 
disabled the audio but there were some
problems<00:03:02.489> with<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.640> microphone<00:03:03.120> but

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
problems with the microphone but

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.210 
problems with the microphone but
basically<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.230> start<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.829> listen

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
basically you start it and you listen

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.369 
basically you start it and you listen
for<00:03:05.400> easier<00:03:05.760> breathing<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:07.110> way<00:03:07.230> she

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
for easier breathing and the way she

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.800 
for easier breathing and the way she
responds<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.829> throttle<00:03:08.250> now<00:03:08.540> don't<00:03:09.540> rev<00:03:09.720> your

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
responds to throttle now don't rev your

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.360 
responds to throttle now don't rev your
bike<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.440> cold<00:03:10.650> engine<00:03:10.799> make<00:03:11.100> sure<00:03:11.250> your

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
bike on the cold engine make sure your

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.710 
bike on the cold engine make sure your
engine<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.639> warm<00:03:11.850> enough<00:03:11.970> before<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.389> rev<00:03:12.630> it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
engine is warm enough before you rev it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.809 
engine is warm enough before you rev it
hard

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
hard

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.160 
hard
ok<00:03:14.819> so<00:03:14.880> there<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.239> started<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.720> bike<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.049> was

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
ok so there I started the bike and was

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.759 
ok so there I started the bike and was
sounding<00:03:16.470> pretty<00:03:16.799> easy<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.940> was<00:03:18.060> really<00:03:18.389> easy

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
sounding pretty easy it was really easy

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.920 
sounding pretty easy it was really easy
responding<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.859> throttle<00:03:20.130> fast<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:21.569> that's<00:03:21.750> it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
responding to throttle fast so that's it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.629 
responding to throttle fast so that's it
that's<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.410> video<00:03:22.530> dr<00:03:22.829> I<00:03:22.950> hope<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.519> guys
