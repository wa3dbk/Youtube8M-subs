00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.310
 hello how about friends how are the day 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.170
 today we are going to 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.830
 to download and install the update 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:16.539
 de doÃ±ana line is 1 point per point 0 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:19.029
 which improves this of those problems of 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:23.199
 performance that the game has in me 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:27.160
 case I have a laptop at 550 from the 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:31.060
 which has a ram 2gb memory and also 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.230
 a graphic card hd 86 70 m of 2 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.730
 gigabytes 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:42.190
 still the game when installing it canon 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:45.579
 previous had problems of 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.760
 very large yields without food 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.180
 did not feel politicized when starting the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.370
 fire 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.489
 we are on the roof if you could say 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.890
 when it says fire no but already when 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.570
 we enter the open world and it begins to 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.979
 the performance problems and eric everything 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.530
 it becomes a nightmare because then 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.330
 here I bring a solution to that program 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.610
 to those who have problems of 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.869
 performance and also so that they have 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.460
 updated their underline like good in the 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.830
 description of this video are going to can 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.810
 find the links if you like they can 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.759
 Download the game to non-transferable 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.460
 I will also leave you another link where 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.869
 can download the update and if 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.750
 this law is you can download this 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.820
 via torrent and also a program that 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.820
 will allow us to improve performance 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.270
 graphic quality for starting 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:57.420
 you already downloads 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:02:01.770
 and you have to do is open a game 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.890
 always installed so I'm going to apply 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.799
 the update if we are going to update it 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.030
 to 1.4 for that is very simple 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.569
 first you have to give it double 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.420
 involvement of 16 points 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:21.769
 immediately a window will be displayed 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:24.560
 where all allow put if witnesses 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.180
 where you have installed the leek here 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.299
 he demanded a little bit we have to be 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.310
 patients and this here appeared here that 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.129
 part we must find where we have 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.079
 us up to the flag in my case I 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:41.419
 I have it in the wayward fit and as well as 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:45.139
 comes by default we'll give here the 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:48.790
 team we are going to do and then search 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.790
 a folder 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.130
 and finally 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.130
 we go where they say 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.690
 but also 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:17.820
 and then we're going to accept and then we're going to 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.820
 to be here 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.680
 ready since you have it strange and the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.680
 upgrade 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.920
 depending on the case 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.490
 let's open 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.580
 we copy we will minimize as here I have 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.840
 the direct access where I have installed 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:02.890
 my game will be here right click and the 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:05.160
 location and here in this part of the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.160
 records 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.239
 appear even if you want to change it 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.200
 of language I love it and where it says there 213 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:24.130
 and we look for the option where it says petticoats 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:28.780
 and put under pressure by ford in 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.440
 we change spam and then save where the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.800
 writer and then pass 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:38.630
 this same genetics from the same file what 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:43.160
 you pass here where it's perfect already 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:48.610
 you have to update to version 1.4 and there 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.610
 can you try it to see if it improves 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:03.190
 what if 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.970
 and go if you're going to run our 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.620
 new one runs and then makes it difficult 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.000
 our prediction plus series of options 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.000
 without you are these 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:22.750
 I already trying with several options 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.180
 disable these two missions is something 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:30.960
 as it is here and then the game sends 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.960
 phenomenal excellent and there's nothing 

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:38.119
 incredible with celestial charts then 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:40.189
 after doing that but he forgot here 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:43.449
 you have to give the location where you have 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.449
 the game 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.069
 and they look for that it will look for installed 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:11.839
 and you have configured it only daia 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:14.909
 line if the game will start working 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:17.279
 that's all gentlemen I hope that this 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.679
 have served their video 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:22.860
 comments and they do not tell me about the TV I have 

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:25.889
 so they can leave their 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.020
 comment and I will gladly answer the most 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:33.479
