00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.160
 we are going to put you here half 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.840
 we have it here and we are going to use 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.710
 accessories that are like sticks 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.510
 wood that bring hazards and some 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.160
 pretty for something 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.130
 If the materials we are going to need 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.890
 because as you can see is the accessory east 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.280
 classroom of the host these sticks of 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.770
 wood we're going to need slats 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.620

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.640

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.520
 pistol and zinc in light and good 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.200
 we have these accessories here that 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.820
 for me they are fundamental because they give them 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.400
 much enhancement 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.830

 use of several slats so that 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.530
 so that they give a different body to 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.530
 our bun and it would be much more attractive 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.290
