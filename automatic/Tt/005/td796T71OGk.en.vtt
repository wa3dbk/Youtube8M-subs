00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.029
 a matching implant between two 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.379
 bone 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.799
 lukas break with that 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:16.779
 hat and his lecturer dr ulrich simon den 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.070
 top most personal care 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.350
 Actually, Lukas wanted to be right 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.240
 Bones work but now benefits 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.660
 not he of the medicine but the 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.460
 medicine from him but then the women 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.170
 I had to reorient myself 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.449
 what else interests me and everything else 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.430
 has found him cs level study course 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.380
 the have the whole interests as I 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.010
 linked and also talk about this 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.800
 interface to medicine still manufactures 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.340
 cse stands for computational science and 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.340
 engineering to german computer aided 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.780
 nature and engineering the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.070
 he is studying at the faculty of 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.620
 mathematics and economics 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.070
 the uni ulm 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.110
 and what does it look like i have math 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.750
 Lecture I have computer science so 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.640
 computer lecture and i have this 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.950
 just this scientific and 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.039
 Engineering lecture 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.329
 as a concrete example has higher matte 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.619
 to get together with the physicists 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.069
 Computer science with many more 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.939
 people and engineers lecture at the 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.279
 University 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.109
 da viren corp cooperate with the 

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:25.609
 have college or the uni and 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.170
 university are equal 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.009
 also the technical mechanics for 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.899
 Example or electrical engineering 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.959
 who can not imagine that 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.929
 lukas explains that more exactly at which 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.789
 project he currently works very close to 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.520
 the practice it will be in the healing of 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.909
 Bones help in this bone healing 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.409
 we just have a project 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.880
 Bone parts simulated from above and 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.939
 down practically the whirl and 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.169
 interposed in our implant 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.639
 and then simulated what it says 

00:01:56.169 --> 00:02:00.409
 is called models that occur in nature 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:03.229
 or problems against either 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.590
 company has a simulation too 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.359
 do 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.900
 to make the calculation so that the 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.780
 results are available 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.920
 no doubt csu was for lukas the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.700
 right decision 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.600
 his colleagues see it the same way and the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.610
 Career perspectives are dazzling 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
 So what I do after the master knows 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.890
 I'm not sure yet 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.170
 we already have many 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.270
 Cooperation with companies was in companies 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.660
 all of us already want us 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.880
 look what happens there lukas drives so 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.950
 in a happy future and all 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.040
 others as well as Lukas at the faculty 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.790
 it will be studying for math and chemistry 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.790
 same thing
