00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 what's up youtube so I hope that 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 they are very good, good guys came out 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.680
 this tutorial point of how to duplicate 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.480
 any mineral 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.289
 and then another few things that 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.590
 can convert from an item to a block and 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:19.109
 be for example wheat etc. with a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.240
 very good gray that you passed this garden 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.310
 it's called on twitter thank you very much to see 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.410
 I send you a greeting and well basically 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.119
 it's very easy boy is this to be able 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.610
 make this event we need only 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.940
 an anvil and with this we will be able to 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.550
 duplicate as I say iron diamonds 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.739
 gold coal networks tones and also 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.210
 lapis lazuli what they want good we are 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.149
 in the build seven guys not because what 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.000
 remove stiglitz because it's a leaks like 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.520
 that very little known in fact as they 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.680
 I say hardly anyone had met him or 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.210
 be told me hardy and I think no one the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.270
 saw upload to youtube or anything or 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.760
 let's say that thanks to him you can be the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.920
 thriller and basically it's very simple 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.780
 guys to do as I say 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.510
 we need an anvil 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.759
 and have nine because let 's say the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.219
 material that we want to duplicate ok a 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.289
 Once we have it, we need to go to 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.940
 our anvil suns with 9 obviously is 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.950
 whereby a block is OK A 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.259
 block of these 9 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.990
 and so making a block is ok ok 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.520
 now how do we do it to duplicate 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.530
 anything of these that becomes 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.920
 in good blocks we go to the anvil we have 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.350
 that put the nine and once the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.850
 duplicates that we put them in there sorry 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.560
 we have to put any name that 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.149
 you are going to put one of and as 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.189
 can see asks us a level of 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.409
 enchantment we touch it we grasp them 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.750
 how to put there is and now how can 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.100
 see my diamonds are called d let's 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.899
 do it equally with iron to 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.140
 that they see that it works well with only 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.240
 the nine iron and let's put them h 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.290
 iron the letter h ok for finally 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.150
 we erase the name and we put 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.250
 we grab them until we have 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.380
 our diamond then changed its name 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.660
 and our iron changed its name and 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.670
 Now it 's as easy and as simple as 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.340
 come to our table of class teo and 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.530
 grab good put where the block is and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.170
 start making a bunch of blocks 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.970
 guys how can you see that's how it works 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.760
 perfectly as I tell you, I was already 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.560
 testing with coal with network with then with 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.150
 all the blocks that you can with 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.130
 all with all the things that you 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.350
 can convert in block and as they 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.380
 I say it is very very good this one like them 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.820
 I say it's not as difficult as I say ok 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.709
 to repeat that of how I tell you sometimes 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.090
 but we only need an anvil and 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.640
 a level of experience is not so 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.320
 difficult is not just that I do not think 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.270
 make it so difficult and we can have 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.400
 countless diamonds or what 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.000
 want guys and for me to believe that 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.600
 it only works like this if we put 99 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.100
 normal diamond how can you see if what 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.660
 let's spend this one I can not continue 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.150
 doing because it's normal obviously 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.970
 but hey this is a beats obviously and 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.640
 Well, it works perfectly and it's already 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.860
 how can they be observing everything that 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.690
 we want to do we can continue doing it 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.460
 he does quiet things for relatives 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.960
 because we liked it, I would appreciate it if 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.690
 they leave a like to see if we can get to 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.280
 thousand and I love you very much and see you in a 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.280
 next video goodbye
