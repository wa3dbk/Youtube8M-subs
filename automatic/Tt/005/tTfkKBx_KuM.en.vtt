00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.379 

the<00:00:10.590> reason<00:00:10.890> we<00:00:11.040> want<00:00:11.220> to<00:00:11.309> make<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> dinosaur<00:00:11.970> is

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the reason we want to make a dinosaur is

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.470 
the reason we want to make a dinosaur is
is<00:00:13.050> really<00:00:14.540> to<00:00:15.540> satisfy<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.310> children<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.550> we

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
is really to satisfy the children and we

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.460 
is really to satisfy the children and we
chose<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> bird<00:00:19.830> because<00:00:20.490> birds<00:00:20.849> are<00:00:21.470> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
chose a bird because birds are the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.310 
chose a bird because birds are the
direct<00:00:23.340> descendants<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> dinosaurs<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.990> they

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
direct descendants of dinosaurs so they

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.040 
direct descendants of dinosaurs so they
in<00:00:25.770> fact<00:00:26.250> are<00:00:27.199> living<00:00:28.199> dinosaurs<00:00:29.900> but<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
in fact are living dinosaurs but the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.420 
in fact are living dinosaurs but the
project<00:00:31.680> really<00:00:32.129> is<00:00:32.279> about<00:00:33.890> figuring<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.040> how

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
project really is about figuring out how

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.960 
project really is about figuring out how
to<00:00:35.780> turn<00:00:36.780> ancestral<00:00:37.769> genes<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.790> how<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
to turn ancestral genes on and how to

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.219 
to turn ancestral genes on and how to
turn<00:00:39.300> them<00:00:39.510> off<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:41.299> in<00:00:42.299> the<00:00:42.540> end<00:00:42.720> we<00:00:42.989> think

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:43.229 
turn them off and in the end we think

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:46.039 
turn them off and in the end we think
that<00:00:43.350> these<00:00:44.309> kinds<00:00:44.790> of<00:00:44.850> studies<00:00:45.269> will<00:00:45.600> help<00:00:45.629> us

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:46.049 
that these kinds of studies will help us

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.930 
that these kinds of studies will help us
understand<00:00:46.729> a<00:00:47.729> lot<00:00:48.360> about<00:00:49.489> genetic<00:00:50.489> diseases

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
understand a lot about genetic diseases

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.560 
understand a lot about genetic diseases
and<00:00:51.750> things<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.769> but<00:00:53.220> this<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.269> fun

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and things like that but this is the fun

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.229 
and things like that but this is the fun
way<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:56.159> tools<00:00:56.580> that<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.000> use<00:00:57.210> are

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
way to do it the tools that we use are

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.439 
way to do it the tools that we use are
really<00:00:58.140> genetic<00:00:58.830> engineering<00:00:59.400> we<00:01:00.089> go<00:01:00.269> into

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
really genetic engineering we go into

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.399 
really genetic engineering we go into
the<00:01:00.659> embryo<00:01:01.049> of<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.879> bird<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:06.409> either

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the embryo of a bird and and either

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.770 
the embryo of a bird and and either
switch<00:01:07.860> its<00:01:08.070> genes<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.760> switch<00:01:09.210> its<00:01:09.420> genes

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
switch its genes on or switch its genes

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.550 
switch its genes on or switch its genes
off<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:11.040> certain<00:01:11.580> characteristics<00:01:12.560> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
off to get certain characteristics to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.940 
off to get certain characteristics to
grow<00:01:14.550> in<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.570> embryo<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.440> animal<00:01:16.830> is

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
grow in the embryo as the animal is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.650 
grow in the embryo as the animal is
developing<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.600> case<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:21.150> make<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> Dino

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
developing so in the case to make a Dino

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.900 
developing so in the case to make a Dino
chicken<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.070> things<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.490> needs<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
chicken one of the things that needs to

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.010 
chicken one of the things that needs to
have<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> long<00:01:24.540> tail<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:27.020> during

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
have is a long tail and so during

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.130 
have is a long tail and so during
development<00:01:28.650> when<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> embryo<00:01:29.730> is<00:01:30.140> beginning

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
development when the embryo is beginning

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.450 
development when the embryo is beginning
to<00:01:31.290> grow<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.890> bird<00:01:32.640> has<00:01:32.940> a<00:01:32.970> long<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.540> has<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> tail

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
to grow a bird has a long it has a tail

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.230 
to grow a bird has a long it has a tail
but<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.910> gene<00:01:36.240> turns<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.080> destroys<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
but then a gene turns on and destroys it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.640 
but then a gene turns on and destroys it
so<00:01:39.240> we're<00:01:39.390> looking<00:01:39.690> for<00:01:39.870> that<00:01:39.960> gene<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.620> that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
so we're looking for that gene so that

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.630 
so we're looking for that gene so that
we<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.070> stop<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.450> being<00:01:42.690> destroyed<00:01:43.640> we

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
we can stop it from being destroyed we

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.810 
we can stop it from being destroyed we
actually<00:01:45.120> know<00:01:45.780> how<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.140> grow<00:01:46.920> teeth<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
actually know how to grow teeth in a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.620 
actually know how to grow teeth in a
bird<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:49.980> found<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.790> gene<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.450> teeth

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
bird we have found the gene for teeth

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.180 
bird we have found the gene for teeth
and<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.750> actually<00:01:55.260> could<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.920> bird

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
and so so we actually could have to bird

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.000 
and so so we actually could have to bird
with<00:01:56.670> teeth<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:57.330> we<00:01:57.510> wanted

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
with teeth if we wanted

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.390 
with teeth if we wanted
but<00:01:59.000> before<00:01:59.660> we<00:01:59.780> do<00:01:59.930> that<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.290> want<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:00.650> we<00:02:01.220> want

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
but before we do that we want to we want

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.890 
but before we do that we want to we want
to<00:02:01.460> make<00:02:01.520> we<00:02:01.820> want<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.300> add<00:02:02.450> some<00:02:02.750> other

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
to make we want to add some other

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.610 
to make we want to add some other
characters<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:03.740> one<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.820> characters<00:02:05.300> is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
characters so one of the characters is

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.300 
characters so one of the characters is
the<00:02:06.620> long<00:02:06.830> tail<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.660> another<00:02:08.660> one<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:09.080> to

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
the long tail and another one is to

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.200 
the long tail and another one is to
transform<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:11.480> wing<00:02:12.640> actually<00:02:13.640> into<00:02:14.030> an

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
transform the the wing actually into an

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.800 
transform the the wing actually into an
arm<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.590> three<00:02:15.860> fingered<00:02:16.220> hand<00:02:16.810> during

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
arm and a three fingered hand during

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.710 
arm and a three fingered hand during
development<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.830> embryo<00:02:19.820> actually<00:02:20.510> has

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
development the embryo actually has

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.500 
development the embryo actually has
three<00:02:21.200> fingers<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.950> then<00:02:22.850> they<00:02:23.060> fuse

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
three fingers and then they fuse

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.530 
three fingers and then they fuse
together<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:24.320> make<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.340> wing<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.270> we're

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
together to make the wing and so we're

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.240 
together to make the wing and so we're
looking<00:02:26.630> for<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.110> gene<00:02:27.320> that<00:02:27.620> fuses<00:02:28.070> them

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
looking for the gene that fuses them

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.390 
looking for the gene that fuses them
together<00:02:28.570> so<00:02:29.570> we<00:02:29.720> can<00:02:29.900> patch<00:02:30.470> with<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> three

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
together so we can patch with a three

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
together so we can patch with a three
fingered<00:02:31.700> hand<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.640> figure<00:02:34.940> if<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.210> bird

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
fingered hand and so we figure if a bird

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.990 
fingered hand and so we figure if a bird
has<00:02:35.720> teeth<00:02:36.940> arms<00:02:37.940> with<00:02:38.720> hands<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:40.670> long

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
has teeth arms with hands and a long

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.320 
has teeth arms with hands and a long
tail<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:42.680> will<00:02:42.920> look<00:02:43.100> enough<00:02:43.460> like<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.730> dinosaur

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
tail it will look enough like a dinosaur

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.000 
tail it will look enough like a dinosaur
that<00:02:44.830> children<00:02:45.830> will<00:02:46.040> be<00:02:46.750> satisfied

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.729 

the<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.909> reason<00:02:51.239> we're<00:02:51.450> pretty<00:02:51.750> sure<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.080> we

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
the the reason we're pretty sure that we

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.280 
the the reason we're pretty sure that we
have<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.370> there<00:02:53.970> are<00:02:54.120> three<00:02:54.450> genes<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:55.049> are

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
have that there are three genes that are

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.830 
have that there are three genes that are
necessary<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.250> make<00:02:56.430> major<00:02:56.819> changes<00:02:57.030> is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
necessary to make major changes is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.800 
necessary to make major changes is
because<00:02:58.680> these<00:02:59.159> are<00:02:59.400> what<00:02:59.670> we<00:02:59.790> call<00:02:59.819> atavistic

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
because these are what we call atavistic

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.220 
because these are what we call atavistic
genes<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.730> these<00:03:02.730> are<00:03:02.879> genes<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.450> that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
genes and these are genes that that

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.170 
genes and these are genes that that
actually<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:05.280> know<00:03:05.370> every<00:03:05.670> once<00:03:05.879> in<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.090> while

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
actually you know every once in a while

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.369 
actually you know every once in a while
a<00:03:06.690> bird<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:08.250> born<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:08.940> tail<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:10.260> like

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
a bird is born with the tail just like

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.680 
a bird is born with the tail just like
children<00:03:11.040> every<00:03:11.760> once<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.180> while<00:03:12.360> aren't

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
children every once in a while aren't

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.800 
children every once in a while aren't
born<00:03:12.930> with<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.200> tail<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.940> means<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:15.569> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
born with the tail that means that the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.430 
born with the tail that means that the
genetic<00:03:16.440> pathway<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.250> still<00:03:17.730> intact<00:03:18.440> it's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
genetic pathway is still intact it's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.670 
genetic pathway is still intact it's
still<00:03:19.769> there<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.310> hasn't<00:03:20.519> changed<00:03:21.110> so<00:03:22.110> we're

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
still there it hasn't changed so we're

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.470 
still there it hasn't changed so we're
just<00:03:22.709> we're<00:03:23.250> trying<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.790> find<00:03:24.150> those

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
just we're trying to find those

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.059 
just we're trying to find those
atavistic<00:03:25.140> genes<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:26.430> will<00:03:26.670> allow<00:03:27.180> us<00:03:27.209> to

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
atavistic genes that will allow us to

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.470 
atavistic genes that will allow us to
basically<00:03:29.069> do<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.459> same<00:03:29.489> thing<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:30.090> nature

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
basically do the same thing that nature

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.330 
basically do the same thing that nature
does<00:03:30.829> it<00:03:31.829> seems<00:03:32.430> very<00:03:32.970> easy<00:03:33.260> but<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.890> really

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
does it seems very easy but is it really

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.369 
does it seems very easy but is it really
that<00:03:35.549> easy<00:03:36.620> no<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:38.220> colleague<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.940> mine<00:03:39.379> likens

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
that easy no a colleague of mine likens

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.199 
that easy no a colleague of mine likens
it<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.980> moon<00:03:41.220> project<00:03:43.340> we<00:03:44.340> know<00:03:44.640> we<00:03:44.849> can<00:03:45.060> do

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
it to the moon project we know we can do

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.589 
it to the moon project we know we can do
it<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:46.709> just<00:03:47.099> it'll<00:03:47.430> take<00:03:47.730> some<00:03:47.940> time<00:03:48.000> and

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
it it's just it'll take some time and

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.229 
it it's just it'll take some time and
it'll<00:03:48.870> take<00:03:49.109> some<00:03:49.319> money<00:03:49.579> but<00:03:50.579> we've<00:03:51.000> got<00:03:51.209> a

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
it'll take some money but we've got a

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.809 
it'll take some money but we've got a
lot<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.480> people<00:03:51.870> working<00:03:52.200> on<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.470> now<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.010> we

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
lot of people working on it now and we

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.470 
lot of people working on it now and we
expect<00:03:54.319> that<00:03:55.319> we<00:03:55.650> will<00:03:55.919> be<00:03:56.190> able<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.549> make<00:03:57.180> a

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
expect that we will be able to make a

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.710 
expect that we will be able to make a
dino<00:03:57.840> chicken<00:03:58.349> in<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.799> next<00:03:59.099> four<00:03:59.489> years<00:03:59.720> but

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
dino chicken in the next four years but

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.890 
dino chicken in the next four years but
is<00:04:01.169> it<00:04:01.349> really<00:04:01.739> enough<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:02.669> have<00:04:02.880> chicken<00:04:03.690> with

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
is it really enough to have chicken with

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.740 
is it really enough to have chicken with
long<00:04:04.230> tails<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.040> teeth<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.669> say<00:04:05.970> it's<00:04:06.419> a

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
long tails and teeth to say it's a

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.280 
long tails and teeth to say it's a
dinosaur<00:04:07.519> yes<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.669> is<00:04:08.819> because<00:04:09.239> birds<00:04:09.900> are

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
dinosaur yes it is because birds are

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.789 
dinosaur yes it is because birds are
dinosaurs<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:11.340> start<00:04:11.609> with<00:04:11.819> so<00:04:12.389> all<00:04:13.079> birds<00:04:13.470> are

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
dinosaurs to start with so all birds are

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.140 
dinosaurs to start with so all birds are
dinosaurs<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:17.400> we<00:04:17.549> don't<00:04:17.700> really<00:04:17.910> have

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
dinosaurs and so so we don't really have

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.650 
dinosaurs and so so we don't really have
to<00:04:18.269> do<00:04:18.419> anything<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.079> mean

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
to do anything I mean

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.230 
to do anything I mean
we<00:04:20.230> want<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.709> make<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.130> bird<00:04:21.310> look<00:04:21.610> more<00:04:21.910> like

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
we want to make the bird look more like

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.050 
we want to make the bird look more like
a<00:04:22.270> dinosaur<00:04:22.960> at<00:04:23.800> least<00:04:24.130> what<00:04:24.370> we<00:04:24.550> think<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.940> as

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
a dinosaur at least what we think of as

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.830 
a dinosaur at least what we think of as
a<00:04:25.090> dinosaur<00:04:25.720> an<00:04:26.530> animal<00:04:26.920> with<00:04:27.040> a<00:04:27.070> long<00:04:27.190> tail

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
a dinosaur an animal with a long tail

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.770 
a dinosaur an animal with a long tail
then<00:04:28.840> we<00:04:29.230> need<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.500> fix<00:04:29.710> chicken<00:04:30.580> okay

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
then we need to fix chicken okay

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.170 
then we need to fix chicken okay
but<00:04:32.110> in<00:04:32.320> this<00:04:32.500> way<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.770> are<00:04:33.180> building

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
but in this way you are building

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.410 
but in this way you are building
something<00:04:34.450> new<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:35.020> mean<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.500> are<00:04:35.620> not

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
something new I mean you are not

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.150 
something new I mean you are not
rebuilding<00:04:37.420> a<00:04:37.840> dinosaur<00:04:38.620> that<00:04:38.830> really

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
rebuilding a dinosaur that really

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.500 
rebuilding a dinosaur that really
existed<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.880> past

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
existed in the past

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.010 
existed in the past
we<00:04:40.870> are<00:04:40.990> not<00:04:41.400> resurrecting<00:04:42.600> dinosaurs<00:04:43.600> from

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
we are not resurrecting dinosaurs from

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.640 
we are not resurrecting dinosaurs from
the<00:04:44.110> past

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
the past

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.610 
the past
we're<00:04:45.100> resurrecting<00:04:46.030> their<00:04:46.810> ancestral

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
we're resurrecting their ancestral

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.090 
we're resurrecting their ancestral
characters<00:04:48.630> but<00:04:49.630> not<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.260> animal<00:04:50.800> that

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
characters but not the animal that

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.820 
characters but not the animal that
themselves<00:04:51.880> we<00:04:52.060> cannot<00:04:52.420> make<00:04:52.660> it

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
themselves we cannot make it

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.730 
themselves we cannot make it
Tyrannosaurus<00:04:53.830> Rex<00:04:54.100> but<00:04:55.030> in<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.080> future<00:04:56.320> we

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
Tyrannosaurus Rex but in the future we

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.800 
Tyrannosaurus Rex but in the future we
might<00:04:56.980> be<00:04:57.160> able<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.370> get<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> lot<00:04:57.760> closer<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.600> my

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
might be able to get a lot closer to my

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.050 
might be able to get a lot closer to my
tribe<00:04:59.410> you've<00:04:59.680> always<00:04:59.950> wanted<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.760> pet

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
tribe you've always wanted a pet

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.400 
tribe you've always wanted a pet
dinosaur<00:05:01.450> this<00:05:01.900> my<00:05:02.200> house<00:05:02.380> yes<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:05.290> are

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
dinosaur this my house yes so you are

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.950 
dinosaur this my house yes so you are
close<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:06.160> reach<00:05:06.430> for<00:05:06.700> your<00:05:06.880> dream<00:05:07.180> what<00:05:07.750> will

basically a dino chicken is the same

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.270 
basically a dino chicken is the same
thing<00:05:37.630> it's<00:05:37.870> an<00:05:38.020> animal<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.620> we<00:05:39.070> have

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
thing it's an animal that we have

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.910 
thing it's an animal that we have

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
instead of breeding over thousands of

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.380 
instead of breeding over thousands of
years<00:05:42.000> we<00:05:43.000> have<00:05:43.030> changed<00:05:43.810> its<00:05:44.050> genes<00:05:44.530> quickly

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
years we have changed its genes quickly

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.720 
years we have changed its genes quickly
