worked<00:02:24.610> pretty<00:02:24.790> good<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.150> front<00:02:25.420> tire<00:02:25.660> is

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
worked pretty good the front tire is

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.490 
worked pretty good the front tire is
pretty<00:02:27.430> darn<00:02:27.670> hard<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:31.420> went<00:02:32.230> out<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:32.320> on

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
pretty darn hard and I went out there on

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.540 
pretty darn hard and I went out there on
a<00:02:32.560> track<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:32.830> definitely<00:02:33.250> had<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> lot<00:02:33.430> of

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
a track that definitely had a lot of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.760 
a track that definitely had a lot of
traction<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.640> car<00:02:36.880> would<00:02:37.060> turn<00:02:37.390> in<00:02:37.630> but<00:02:38.620> not

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
traction the car would turn in but not

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.550 
traction the car would turn in but not
get<00:02:39.250> out<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.460> corner<00:02:39.880> oh<00:02:40.090> my<00:02:41.080> head<00:02:41.380> and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
get out of the corner oh my head and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.950 
get out of the corner oh my head and
actually<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.370> way<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.610> front<00:02:42.880> end<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.150> you

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
actually the way the front end is you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.540 
actually the way the front end is you
know<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.650> links<00:02:44.950> are<00:02:45.070> actually<00:02:45.340> fairly

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
know that the links are actually fairly

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.480 
know that the links are actually fairly
aggressive<00:02:46.240> in<00:02:46.390> terms<00:02:46.600> of<00:02:46.900> how<00:02:47.350> far<00:02:47.590> down<00:02:47.770> they

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
aggressive in terms of how far down they

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.810 
aggressive in terms of how far down they
are<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.050> angle<00:02:50.770> of<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:50.980> camber<00:02:51.430> link<00:02:51.610> you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
are on the angle of the camber link you

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.570 
are on the angle of the camber link you
know<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.000> produces<00:02:52.660> alone<00:02:52.900> whoops<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.460> you

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
know it produces alone whoops if you

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.300 
know it produces alone whoops if you
really<00:02:54.730> see<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.060> does<00:02:55.270> that<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.830> tires<00:02:57.070> do

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
really see it does that the tires do

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.790 
really see it does that the tires do
have<00:02:57.610> some<00:02:57.820> camera<00:02:58.180> change<00:02:58.450> oh<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:59.290> didn't<00:02:59.680> have

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
have some camera change oh I didn't have

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.340 
have some camera change oh I didn't have

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
a ton of time to work on the cars I just

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.750 
a ton of time to work on the cars I just
want<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.560> drive<00:03:02.800> around<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.280> sort<00:03:03.490> of<00:03:03.550> get<00:03:03.670> an

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
want to drive around and sort of get an

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.340 
want to drive around and sort of get an
idea<00:03:03.820> what<00:03:04.060> was<00:03:04.240> going<00:03:04.480> on<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:05.770> did<00:03:06.280> try<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:07.350> add

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
idea what was going on I did try to add

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.490 
idea what was going on I did try to add
some<00:03:08.830> caster<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.180> car<00:03:10.450> because<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.170> wasn't

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
some caster to the car because it wasn't

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.600 
some caster to the car because it wasn't
turning<00:03:11.739> out<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.370> corner<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:15.190> usually

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
turning out of the corner and usually

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.670 
turning out of the corner and usually
extra<00:03:16.450> cash<00:03:16.630> will<00:03:16.870> need<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.110> car<00:03:17.260> wrap<00:03:17.500> a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
extra cash will need the car wrap a

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.150 
extra cash will need the car wrap a
little<00:03:17.830> more<00:03:18.040> wrap<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.209> corner<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.650> in<00:03:21.010> this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
little more wrap the corner but in this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.040 
little more wrap the corner but in this
case<00:03:21.430> all<00:03:21.940> really<00:03:22.270> did<00:03:22.450> was<00:03:22.600> make<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> car

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
case all really did was make the car

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.290 
case all really did was make the car
flip<00:03:23.260> off<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.560> track<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:27.250> know<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.580> turned<00:03:28.120> in

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
flip off the track you know it turned in

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.390 
flip off the track you know it turned in
but<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.750> did<00:03:29.050> start<00:03:29.260> having<00:03:29.920> just<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.190> little

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
but it did start having just a little

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.010 
but it did start having just a little
more<00:03:30.520> steering<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.060> stuff<00:03:31.239> but<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.510> wanted<00:03:31.959> to

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
more steering and stuff but it wanted to

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.140 
more steering and stuff but it wanted to
flip<00:03:32.140> off<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.350> track<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.610> proud<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:33.880> mean

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
flip off the track so proud I mean

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.540 
flip off the track so proud I mean
really<00:03:34.660> in<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:34.959> case<00:03:35.260> then<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> should<00:03:36.520> go

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
really in that case then you should go

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.870 
really in that case then you should go
to<00:03:36.700> less<00:03:37.170> caster<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.350> try<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.280> make<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.670> car

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
to less caster and try to make the car

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.560 
to less caster and try to make the car
work<00:03:40.660> on<00:03:40.840> different<00:03:41.020> ways<00:03:41.380> I<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:43.060> know<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.180> I

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
work on different ways I you know I I

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.630 
work on different ways I you know I I
put<00:03:44.110> put<00:03:44.560> more<00:03:44.709> caster<00:03:45.100> into<00:03:45.280> an<00:03:45.370> extra

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
put put more caster into an extra

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.280 
put put more caster into an extra
product<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.060> taking<00:03:46.360> some<00:03:46.510> caster<00:03:46.930> out<00:03:49.290> but

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
product just taking some caster out but

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.250 
product just taking some caster out but
like<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.830> said<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.130> was<00:03:51.690> trying<00:03:52.690> stuff<00:03:52.900> quickly

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
like I said it was trying stuff quickly

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.720 
like I said it was trying stuff quickly
and<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.530> didn't<00:03:53.739> have<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:53.890> ton<00:03:54.100> of<00:03:54.160> time<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.610> do

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
and I didn't have a ton of time and do

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.590 
and I didn't have a ton of time and do
things<00:03:56.310> but<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.340> basically<00:03:57.850> just<00:03:58.300> felt<00:03:58.510> like

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
things but that basically just felt like

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.270 
things but that basically just felt like
you<00:03:59.100> know<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.930> car<00:04:02.140> would<00:04:02.290> turn<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:03.010> then

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
you know the car would turn in and then

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.930 
you know the car would turn in and then
just<00:04:03.910> push<00:04:04.840> out<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.470> corner<00:04:05.920> just<00:04:06.730> push

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
just push out of the corner just push

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.890 
just push out of the corner just push
and<00:04:07.120> push<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.330> push

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.470 

you<00:04:10.500> know<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.620> also<00:04:10.769> did<00:04:11.069> have<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.489> hit<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.760> short

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
this is the short light bulb ends right

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.420 
this is the short light bulb ends right
here<00:04:18.259> so<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.380> short<00:04:19.650> light<00:04:19.919> bulb<00:04:20.100> battery

here so the short light bulb battery
that<00:04:20.579> losi<00:04:21.060> cells<00:04:21.299> were<00:04:21.449> 22<00:04:21.989> so<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.800> can<00:04:22.949> you

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
that losi cells were 22 so you can you

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.249 
that losi cells were 22 so you can you
have<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.310> lot<00:04:23.430> more<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.910> know<00:04:24.080> ruining<00:04:25.080> back

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
have a lot more you know ruining back

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.740 
have a lot more you know ruining back

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
time like with the 12 scale guy is the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.540 
time like with the 12 scale guy is the
reason<00:04:32.070> why<00:04:32.160> they're<00:04:32.370> supposedly<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:34.550> making

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
reason why they're supposedly and making

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.150 
reason why they're supposedly and making
the<00:04:35.639> batteries<00:04:36.030> go<00:04:36.509> front<00:04:37.139> to<00:04:37.199> back<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.470> then

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
the batteries go front to back and then

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.980 
the batteries go front to back and then
moving<00:04:38.490> things<00:04:38.820> forward<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.780> car

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
moving things forward on the car

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.570 
moving things forward on the car
especially<00:04:42.990> on<00:04:43.320> high<00:04:43.470> bike<00:04:43.740> tracks<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.340> 12

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
especially on high bike tracks the 12

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.840 
especially on high bike tracks the 12
scale<00:04:44.760> guys<00:04:44.940> are<00:04:45.090> doing<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.500> to<00:04:46.500> try<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.850> make

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
scale guys are doing that to try to make

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.250 
scale guys are doing that to try to make
the<00:04:47.970> car<00:04:48.120> easier<00:04:48.419> to<00:04:48.510> drive<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.780> little<00:04:49.050> more

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
the car easier to drive a little more

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.230 
the car easier to drive a little more
weight<00:04:49.470> towards<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.490> nose<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.880> car<00:04:51.090> will

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
weight towards the nose the car will

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.760 
weight towards the nose the car will
make<00:04:51.389> it<00:04:51.510> easier<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.840> drive<00:04:52.050> on<00:04:52.260> high<00:04:52.410> traction

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
make it easier to drive on high traction

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.550 
make it easier to drive on high traction
so<00:04:53.699> that's<00:04:54.060> kind<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.389> like<00:04:54.510> what<00:04:54.720> i<00:04:55.020> was<00:04:55.440> trying

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
so that's kind of like what i was trying

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.159 
so that's kind of like what i was trying
to<00:04:55.680> simulate<00:04:56.419> that<00:04:58.039> may<00:04:59.039> have<00:04:59.160> been<00:04:59.370> a<00:05:00.169> problem

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
to simulate that may have been a problem

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.920 
to simulate that may have been a problem
I<00:05:01.470> don't<00:05:01.710> know<00:05:01.830> for<00:05:02.039> sure<00:05:02.099> I<00:05:02.520> mean<00:05:03.060> if<00:05:03.180> moving

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
I don't know for sure I mean if moving

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.930 
I don't know for sure I mean if moving
moving<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.010> battery<00:05:05.310> back<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.789> know<00:05:05.940> maybe

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
moving the battery back you know maybe

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.249 
moving the battery back you know maybe
hard<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.030> say<00:05:09.180> how<00:05:09.330> much<00:05:09.479> I<00:05:09.750> didn't<00:05:09.930> have<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.110> lot

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
hard to say how much I didn't have a lot

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.689 
hard to say how much I didn't have a lot
of<00:05:10.320> time<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.710> experiment<00:05:11.009> with<00:05:11.250> moving<00:05:11.610> the

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
of time to experiment with moving the

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.310 
of time to experiment with moving the
battery<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.090> was<00:05:12.330> kind<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:12.690> just<00:05:12.840> trying<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.199> get

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
battery I was kind of just trying to get

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.610 
battery I was kind of just trying to get
a<00:05:13.349> handle<00:05:13.620> on<00:05:13.860> what<00:05:14.099> the<00:05:14.250> car<00:05:14.430> was<00:05:14.460> doing<00:05:15.620> you

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
a handle on what the car was doing you

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.620 
a handle on what the car was doing you
know<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:16.740> had<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.039> couple<00:05:17.250> runs<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.910> play<00:05:18.479> with

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
know I had a couple runs to play with

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.589 
know I had a couple runs to play with
the<00:05:18.720> car<00:05:20.870> just<00:05:21.870> because<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:23.180> no<00:05:24.180> one<00:05:24.270> else<00:05:24.360> show

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
the car just because of no one else show

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.149 
the car just because of no one else show
up<00:05:24.630> with<00:05:24.810> f1<00:05:25.080> at<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.349> race<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.740> didn't<00:05:26.010> work

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
up with f1 at the race so I didn't work

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.740 
up with f1 at the race so I didn't work
on<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.430> car<00:05:26.610> until<00:05:26.789> after<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.330> race<00:05:27.510> and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
on the car until after the race and

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.270 
on the car until after the race and
there<00:05:27.870> was<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.050> ton<00:05:28.470> of<00:05:28.500> time<00:05:28.770> to<00:05:28.919> do<00:05:29.070> that

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
there was a ton of time to do that

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.100 
there was a ton of time to do that
anyway<00:05:32.120> yeah<00:05:33.120> basically<00:05:33.389> these<00:05:33.599> tires<00:05:33.900> are

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
anyway yeah basically these tires are

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.250 
anyway yeah basically these tires are
pretty<00:05:34.440> darn<00:05:34.620> hard<00:05:35.330> and<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:38.930> didn't<00:05:39.930> even<00:05:39.960> use<00:05:40.229> a

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
pretty darn hard and I didn't even use a

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.399 
pretty darn hard and I didn't even use a
stock<00:05:40.650> answer<00:05:41.039> in<00:05:41.190> here<00:05:41.400> I<00:05:41.430> used<00:05:41.639> a<00:05:42.409> softer

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
stock answer in here I used a softer

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.980 
stock answer in here I used a softer
insert<00:05:43.919> to<00:05:44.430> try<00:05:44.639> to<00:05:44.699> you<00:05:44.909> know<00:05:44.940> that<00:05:45.599> they<00:05:45.780> felt

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
insert to try to you know that they felt

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.270 
insert to try to you know that they felt
hard<00:05:46.260> right<00:05:46.440> of<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.590> packaging<00:05:47.039> who<00:05:47.130> their

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
hard right of the packaging who their

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.460 
hard right of the packaging who their
real<00:05:47.460> hard<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:51.169> don't<00:05:52.169> know<00:05:52.409> you<00:05:52.889> know<00:05:53.010> if<00:05:53.190> I

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
real hard and I don't know you know if I

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.960 
real hard and I don't know you know if I
the<00:05:55.470> thing<00:05:55.680> I<00:05:55.770> don't<00:05:55.830> like<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.340> idea<00:05:56.460> of<00:05:56.669> doing

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
the thing I don't like the idea of doing

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.909 
the thing I don't like the idea of doing
is<00:05:57.240> going<00:05:57.449> to<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.659> harder<00:05:58.020> insert<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.560> rear<00:05:58.770> to

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
is going to a harder insert the rear to

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.820 
is going to a harder insert the rear to
try<00:05:59.099> to<00:05:59.159> make<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.550> rear<00:05:59.760> tires<00:06:00.000> stiffer

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
try to make the rear tires stiffer

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.930 
try to make the rear tires stiffer
because<00:06:01.830> I<00:06:01.949> don't<00:06:02.159> think<00:06:02.460> that's<00:06:02.669> the<00:06:02.760> way<00:06:02.849> to

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
because I don't think that's the way to

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.610 
because I don't think that's the way to
go<00:06:03.210> I<00:06:03.479> mean<00:06:03.659> really<00:06:03.690> you<00:06:04.050> want<00:06:04.229> to<00:06:04.289> put<00:06:04.440> more

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
go I mean really you want to put more

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.409 
go I mean really you want to put more
traction<00:06:05.099> in<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.370> car<00:06:05.729> versus<00:06:06.090> trying<00:06:06.330> to

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
traction in the car versus trying to

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:11.060 
traction in the car versus trying to
take<00:06:06.570> it<00:06:06.599> out<00:06:08.240> so<00:06:09.240> these<00:06:09.389> fronts<00:06:09.810> are<00:06:09.990> I'm<00:06:10.889> not

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
take it out so these fronts are I'm not

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.939 
take it out so these fronts are I'm not
sure<00:06:12.139> it's<00:06:13.139> going<00:06:13.320> to<00:06:13.380> I<00:06:13.500> think<00:06:13.680> that<00:06:13.919> that

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
sure it's going to I think that that

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.589 
sure it's going to I think that that
race<00:06:14.220> is<00:06:14.370> going<00:06:14.490> to<00:06:14.580> be<00:06:14.639> a<00:06:14.669> wind<00:06:14.909> up<00:06:15.060> being<00:06:15.510> a

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
race is going to be a wind up being a

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.000 
race is going to be a wind up being a
thing<00:06:15.810> of<00:06:15.900> who<00:06:16.020> figures<00:06:16.320> out<00:06:16.440> how<00:06:16.590> to<00:06:16.620> make<00:06:16.800> the

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
thing of who figures out how to make the

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.729 
thing of who figures out how to make the
car<00:06:17.400> steel
