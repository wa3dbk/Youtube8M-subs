00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.310
 the loss 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.210
 I love 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.790
 go all 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:46.569
 at our own we build and 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.569
 look for 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:55.380
 he lost 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:59.370
 my love and my girl 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:02.370
 you stand and i 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.370
 look for 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.900
 Hello, the first two verses are played 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.319
 so much 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.860
 First, we simultaneously extract the bass 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.519
 string 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:25.050
 it means on the cord I give it 6 and the first 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.910
 then play alternately second third 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.900
 then the first second 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.200
 the third and again the first second is obtained 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.200
 So 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.809
 after which we repeat again for 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:46.249
 diversity, you can pull next time 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:46.249
 for example 5 already bass 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.289
 then sixth again 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.780
 or 5 5 years if brute force is played on 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:00.530
 a certain chord not just once but twice and 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.800
 on fingers means u for bass is responsible 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:08.469
 thumb for the first nameless for 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.469
 second middle over third index 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:17.789
 so they played it a few times and 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.129
 start singing with the last two notes 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.289
 the first and second when twitched straight 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.539
 starting with 1 i.e. the first word should 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.009
 fall on the last two notes 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.460
 busting 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.759
 This is a reference point for bass. 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.110
 strings means on the pit this is 6 if 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.139
 linger then 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:45.279
 pull the fifth one for a change on 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:54.129
 of April 5 here should be on the same 4 is such a 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:56.499
 a chord is simpler 6 c to d h7 5 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:59.589
 Further when finished the second verse 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:00.849
 finishing up the words immediately begin to play 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.490
 next guitar fight 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.860
 first do a top down blow 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.380
 the accent is strong and the sound should be 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.370
 long 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.950
 then bottom up on the lower strings and 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.590
 doing the top-down again 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.080
 strongly in accent but the sound is already less 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.960
 long compared to the first 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.240
 by movement 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.000
 and in conclusion two quick movements 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.039
 do top down and bottom up both by 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.880
 lower string after which the fight is repeated 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:35.120
 the very beginning 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.120
 it should turn out so slowly
