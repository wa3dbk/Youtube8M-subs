00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:07.110
 nissan pathfinder real SUV 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.670
 or is it a nissan family car 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.110
 second generation pathfinder at all 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.660
 the car looks brutal 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.119
 first of all I think reliable 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.119
 family car will check 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.119
 check 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.640
 pathfinder pathfinder in translation of what 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.220
 following and with what problems does this 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.579
 model Yaroslav Levashov 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.809
 auto critic evaluator 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.519
 car find used pathfinder 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.350
 factory paint on the back door 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.460
 almost unreal it is the most vulnerable 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.559
 body place 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.260
 I dealer already pasted additional 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.790
 film so as not to repaint this 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.680
 look for corrosion pay on the hood 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.519
 front racks and covered over 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.439
 windshield 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.000
 but here the body is in excellent condition 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:05.199
 the spider found only this one alive 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.939
 crack on the plastic block wig 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.740
 generic stigma patterns appear 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.200
 spontaneously before headlights changed under warranty 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.350
 now just for my money here 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.450
 There is no problem before restyling the model 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.150
 put gasoline in the atmosphere and 4 liters 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.610
 very expensive stable content 269 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.750
 horses then appeared turbodiesel 2 and 5 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.729
 how is he where economical asset 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.130
 diesel cylinder head at 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.600
 aggressive operation after only a hundred 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.909
 thousand cracks may appear 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.649
 means head it's time to change it expensive 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.030
 thoroughly check diesel 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.920
 motor on the eye is impossible not 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:46.030
 save on comprehensive diagnostics 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:48.639
 before buying optimist called 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.090
 the interior is concise but i would say he 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:51.090
 simple 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.600
 instead of overclocking to 11 6 we got 13 and 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.060
 7 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.700
 first second gear is very short 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.240
 diesel but dynamics for such a large 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.500
 body is great 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.310
 at speed the SUV starts scouring 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.140
 you have to boil it with a running gear 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.730
 parts of weak points no yes just 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.040
 overhaul suspension need 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.040
 about everything to everyone for 150 thousand run 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.790
 if the rudder on the bumps soon pounded 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.370
 just to replace kardanchik 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.170
 steering shaft 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.340
 tread wear unevenly 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.550
 urgently needs to regulate camber 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.730
 toe on the rear wheels so easy 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.980
 it is dangerous to drive all the tires for replacement 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.460
 I see you again in the city and at 12:06 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.620
 highway on the highway consumption of 8 liters 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:03:00.620
 mixed 11 half what tax on 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.890
 car per year 8000 for such a machine 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.870
 it's okay the driver is comfortable and then 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.080
 pillow back sofa flat and narrow 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.110
 the backrest is almost upright and there is little space 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:20.050
 for legs it is payback for even closer 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.050
 third row of seats or large trunk 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.370
 we easily loaded all our belongings 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.270
 trunk with such dimensions 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.590
 to maneuver and not easy 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.970
 and we will try the rear view camera 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.970
 helps a lot 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.630
 9 movements narrow driver streets under 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:04:00.340
 the fader is of course tense but not 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:04:00.340
 scare check angle of entry 25 easy 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.239
 from the first attempt pathfinder failed 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.819
 pass the crash test worked incorrectly 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.280
 nissan safety curtains modified 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.180
 design and fixed this problem on 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.759
 all released 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.769
 getting a car for safety 4 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.199
 stars 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.190
 check how the tracker reacts to dirt 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.190
 go 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.350
 all the dirt on the bumper and footboards 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.070
 take care of trousers and glasses and got 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.560
 mirrors 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.000
 under fine there is no friend very often but 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.910
 leave it unattended 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.910
 in the yard should not be obtained when running 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.040
 150,000 need to seriously invest and you 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.310
 sure that you can then ride safely 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.320
 Yes, I have already done everything and problems so far 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.320
 I know good luck thank you
