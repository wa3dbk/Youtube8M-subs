play<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.059> slide<00:00:51.989> son<00:00:53.180> because<00:00:54.180> he<00:00:54.210> basically

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
play as slide son because he basically

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.849 
play as slide son because he basically
faked<00:00:55.110> his<00:00:55.260> amnesia<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> heard<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.239> far

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
faked his amnesia is what I heard so far

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.380 
faked his amnesia is what I heard so far
but<00:00:58.859> um<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.399> game<00:00:59.609> does<00:00:59.820> come<00:01:00.030> out<00:01:00.210> it's

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
but um if this game does come out it's

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.790 
but um if this game does come out it's
going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.750> probably<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> best

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
going to be probably one of the best

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.390 
going to be probably one of the best
games<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:03.059> 2011<00:01:04.070> probably<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
games of 2011 probably one of the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.390 
games of 2011 probably one of the
top-rated<00:01:05.760> also<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.979> I'm<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.280> doing

bunch of walkthroughs on and all kind of
other<00:01:16.619> videos<00:01:17.270> but<00:01:18.270> yeah<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.140> far

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
other videos but yeah that's so far

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260 
other videos but yeah that's so far
Sucker<00:01:19.740> Punch<00:01:20.070> hasn't<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:20.640> confirmed<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
Sucker Punch hasn't really confirmed it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
Sucker Punch hasn't really confirmed it
yet<00:01:21.479> you're<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.470> kind<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.710> leaving<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.130> out

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
yet you're just kind of leaving it out

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
yet you're just kind of leaving it out
there<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> guess<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.080> see<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.380> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
there is like a guess and see if you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.960 
there is like a guess and see if you
actually<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:26.310> they're<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> make<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
actually think they're going to make it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.719 
actually think they're going to make it
or<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.380> but<00:01:28.380> uh<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.770> believe<00:01:29.070> they're<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.670> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
or not but uh I believe they're going to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
or not but uh I believe they're going to
make<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.750> been<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> while<00:01:31.200> when

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
make it because it's been a while when

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.890 
make it because it's been a while when
they<00:01:31.560> haven't<00:01:31.799> finished<00:01:32.100> up<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.310> story<00:01:32.729> so

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
they haven't finished up the story so

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.560 
they haven't finished up the story so
it's<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.960> good<00:01:34.079> news<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.570> I'm

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's a good news for you and me but I'm

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.690 
it's a good news for you and me but I'm
apart<00:01:37.200> from<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> storyline<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.100> want<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.490> talk

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.389 
going to be like a story based game when
you<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.740> missions<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.369> stuff

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you just have to do missions and stuff

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.850 
you just have to do missions and stuff
like<00:01:50.729> slide<00:01:51.030> 2<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.420> 3<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> other

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.550 
like slide 2 and 3 and all the other
ones<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.509> hoping<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.020> becomes<00:01:55.380> an

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
ones but I'm really hoping it becomes an

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.170 
ones but I'm really hoping it becomes an
open-world<00:01:55.979> game<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:56.729> I'd<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.000> really

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
background on a roof and it looked like

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.620 
background on a roof and it looked like
a<00:02:28.140> bottle<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.489> flashlight<00:02:30.030> guards<00:02:30.330> are<00:02:30.450> back

and the rooftop enemies are back and I

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.309 
and the rooftop enemies are back and I
heard<00:02:34.230> they<00:02:34.349> might<00:02:34.560> add<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.739> few<00:02:35.069> new<00:02:35.250> enemies

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
heard they might add a few new enemies

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.400 
heard they might add a few new enemies
like<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.500> flashlight<00:02:38.010> guards<00:02:38.430> armed<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
like the flashlight guards armed and the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.780 
like the flashlight guards armed and the
rooftop<00:02:40.890> guard<00:02:41.160> there's<00:02:41.519> going<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> be

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
rooftop guard there's going to be

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.180 
rooftop guard there's going to be
different<00:02:42.060> types<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.540> enemies<00:02:42.860> not<00:02:43.860> sure<00:02:44.040> what

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
different types of enemies not sure what

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.619 
different types of enemies not sure what
they<00:02:44.310> are<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.790> they'll<00:02:44.970> probably<00:02:45.150> be<00:02:45.330> heavily

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
they are but they'll probably be heavily

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.229 
they are but they'll probably be heavily
armored<00:02:46.080> or<00:02:46.170> something<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:47.090> but<00:02:48.090> you

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
armored or something like that but you

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.000 
armored or something like that but you
apart<00:02:48.569> from<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.780> gameplay<00:02:49.349> never<00:02:49.650> all<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
apart from the gameplay never all the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.300 
apart from the gameplay never all the
storyline<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.760> everything<00:02:51.180> um<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.890> game<00:02:53.130> is

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
storyline and everything um this game is

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.250 
storyline and everything um this game is
probably<00:02:53.549> going<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:53.910> multiplayer<00:02:54.569> but

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
probably going to have a multiplayer but

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.569 
probably going to have a multiplayer but
I'm<00:02:55.410> not<00:02:55.530> sure<00:02:55.590> how<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> turn<00:02:56.400> out

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
I'm not sure how it's going to turn out

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.830 
I'm not sure how it's going to turn out
of<00:02:59.579> course<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.030> can't<00:03:00.239> have<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.390> first<00:03:00.660> person

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
of course you can't have a first person

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.600 
of course you can't have a first person
shooter<00:03:01.079> sly<00:03:01.620> game<00:03:01.890> because<00:03:02.130> I'd<00:03:02.250> be<00:03:02.400> just

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
retarded it'll probably be like a

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.460 
retarded it'll probably be like a
assassin's<00:03:06.510> creed<00:03:06.750> brotherhood<00:03:06.959> when<00:03:07.410> you
