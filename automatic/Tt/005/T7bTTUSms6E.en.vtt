00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 very good condition 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.139
 Now let's read a minimum but 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.440
 It's pretty cool I 've commented 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.170
 many after the last of the last mode 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.439
 Many people told me that they will try this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 theme is pretty good and the truth is only 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.260
 add a little thing is here you have a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.140
 temple after being more camouflaged than is 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.760
 a temple nÃ­jar and he is not bad not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.460
 I was in very little mode 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.660
 obviously just add a few things 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.329
 but it's pretty cool as you see the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.309
 rummage is this gold iron and diamond 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.489
 three diamonds that I do not like anymore but 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.600
 ok and let's see let's put this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.559
 here is here is here and this is the one of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 this plan on the dubstep gun or something 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.350
 well I do not know but the truth that the design 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.350
 it's fucking great, yes 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.670
 same too big 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.970
 but this one is very pretty more with the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.520
 album there is like playing the musical to 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.640
 the question and is that if we click 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.640
 straight 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.310
 the same life 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.450
 the issue is that it sounds apart that they sound 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.140
 there come out very cool particles 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.180
 you see what they do as weird triangles 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 it sounds music I do not know if youtube bass see 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.520
 because of this it is possible but good 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.840
 it's not bad is that he is very cool apart 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.090
 I want to investigate this for later 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.580
 we will investigate and I want to prove it with 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.800
 some saying I want to prove it 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.700
 to see if it takes away much and such andres 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.290
 tested with villager pigs also and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.020
 you kill him you kill him from an explosion 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.980
 apart it exploits that that cool exploits of 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.320
 true even if it does not seem and does not break anything 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.479
 or 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.580
 but it does not break any block that too 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.229
 cool and good let's try some 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.229
 bug we're going to try it 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 Estevez 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.510
 loneliness 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.430
 of help half line and now you can 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.430
 take it off 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.100
 it's just really I'm going to try it 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.100
 now 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.620
 0 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.310
 it does not seem that the 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.310
 particles that are leaving 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.680
 it does not seem to be quite white 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:55.810
 but well let's look at let's you 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.810
 by gossip this 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.220
 protection against projectiles those of the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.800
 cerricos 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.100
 It's very good I've put it but 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.100
 good if someone is interested in spanish 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.700
 Palau 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.150
 since I really am not much of 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.370
 you but the one that he put together the web or 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.680
 whatever length is cojonuda is 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.120
 tremendous but good this is the mode of 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.360
 this plan is pretty good I 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.240
 I expected less the fact of music with 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.400
 firing the eggs 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.400
 it's supposed to be taken out of the saints row 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.410
 I think I think I think it's taken 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.510
 from saints row 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.890
 and because there is land here 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.200
 it seems strange to me good god 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.440
 this is the mod I hope that I have 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.980
 liked it is weird Chinese Communist 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.980
 or 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.100
 I have a luck sometimes male 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.200
 hello good as the cell sit all 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.510
 case the seed I put in case you want 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.400
 see someone is pretty cool I think 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.810
 you know not far away either of 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.740
 all shapes here you have the coordinates 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:31.180
 Well, if you want to come, I do not know, I think 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:33.100
 for something we liked seed and mod 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.419
 good amount in the particles that 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.009
 they wear their people and when they collide 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:41.909
 always leaves particles up 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.419
 Spain is very cool but good this is 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.879
 the mod 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.879
 I hope you liked it from out 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.600
 out of curiosity more samples of things 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.150
 rare 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.840
 maybe he could take a position 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.000
 night version but those that are already 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.000
 enrique 3a triki triki triki 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.960
