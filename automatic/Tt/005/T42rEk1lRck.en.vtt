00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.430 

here's<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.829> Capcom<00:00:02.449> 1942<00:00:03.449> PCB<00:00:04.020> that's<00:00:04.290> been

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
here's a Capcom 1942 PCB that's been

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.710 
here's a Capcom 1942 PCB that's been
sent<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.799> me<00:00:04.950> as<00:00:05.190> it<00:00:05.460> arrived<00:00:05.790> no<00:00:06.210> I'm<00:00:06.270> working

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
sent to me as it arrived no I'm working

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.910 
sent to me as it arrived no I'm working
with<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.830> bias<00:00:08.370> i'm<00:00:08.639> just<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.970> fire<00:00:09.840> up

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.279 

ok<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.490> game<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.759> running<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.540> think<00:00:15.870> that's

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
ok so the game is running I think that's

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.900 
ok so the game is running I think that's
just<00:00:16.410> quietly<00:00:17.539> yeah

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.180 

no<00:00:22.910> he<00:00:23.210> actually<00:00:23.480> yeah<00:00:24.080> it<00:00:24.230> is<00:00:24.350> ill<00:00:24.470> sprites<00:00:24.890> it

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
no he actually yeah it is ill sprites it

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.850 
no he actually yeah it is ill sprites it
just<00:00:25.340> seems<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.640> background<00:00:26.180> is<00:00:26.860> background

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
just seems the background is background

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.330 
just seems the background is background
and<00:00:28.330> characters<00:00:29.330> are<00:00:29.570> mess<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.590> have<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.250> look

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
and characters are mess so have a look

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.830 
and characters are mess so have a look
at<00:00:31.460> those<00:00:31.580> circuits<00:00:32.150> there<00:00:32.480> on<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.690> bottom

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
at those circuits there on the bottom

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.369 
at those circuits there on the bottom
board<00:00:34.180> well<00:00:35.180> my<00:00:35.450> initial<00:00:35.900> thoughts<00:00:36.200> were

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
board well my initial thoughts were

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.460 
board well my initial thoughts were
actually<00:00:36.860> wrong<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.480> I<00:00:38.480> assume<00:00:39.140> that<00:00:39.350> the

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
actually wrong and I assume that the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.840 
actually wrong and I assume that the
background<00:00:39.739> graphics<00:00:40.070> would<00:00:40.370> be<00:00:40.460> on<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.670> be

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
background graphics would be on the be

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.640 
background graphics would be on the be
bored<00:00:41.150> but<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:41.720> seems<00:00:42.050> that<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.260> be<00:00:42.379> boards

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
bored but it seems that the be boards

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.200 
bored but it seems that the be boards
actually<00:00:42.920> mostly<00:00:43.220> responsible<00:00:43.430> for<00:00:43.910> sprites

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
actually mostly responsible for sprites

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.690 
actually mostly responsible for sprites
so<00:00:45.080> background<00:00:45.830> graphics<00:00:46.010> gonna<00:00:46.430> be<00:00:46.520> around

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
so background graphics gonna be around

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.240 
so background graphics gonna be around
here<00:00:47.059> I<00:00:47.239> suspect<00:00:47.750> this<00:00:47.989> area<00:00:48.379> on<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:48.830> board

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
here I suspect this area on the a board

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.690 
here I suspect this area on the a board
I've<00:00:50.000> actually<00:00:50.150> swapped<00:00:50.510> in<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.960> good<00:00:51.890> be<00:00:52.340> bored

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
I've actually swapped in a good be bored

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.870 
I've actually swapped in a good be bored
and<00:00:52.970> getting<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.300> same<00:00:53.540> fault<00:00:53.930> I've<00:00:54.530> also

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
and getting the same fault I've also

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.770 
and getting the same fault I've also
eliminated<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:56.060> ribbon<00:00:56.390> cables<00:00:56.750> by

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
eliminated the ribbon cables by

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.500 
eliminated the ribbon cables by
replacing<00:00:57.170> those<00:00:57.560> so<00:00:58.460> I'm<00:00:58.910> going<00:00:59.060> to<00:00:59.090> sort<00:00:59.360> of

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
replacing those so I'm going to sort of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.150 
replacing those so I'm going to sort of
start<00:00:59.720> probing<00:00:59.960> around<00:01:00.140> this<00:01:00.350> area<00:01:00.620> see<00:01:01.040> if<00:01:01.100> I

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
start probing around this area see if I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.290 
start probing around this area see if I
can<00:01:01.250> find<00:01:01.399> where<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.670> background<00:01:02.149> graphics

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
can find where the background graphics

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.999 
can find where the background graphics
coming<00:01:02.870> from<00:01:04.059> ok<00:01:05.059> i'm<00:01:05.330> looking<00:01:05.840> at<00:01:05.899> my<00:01:06.140> logic

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
coming from ok i'm looking at my logic

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.310 
coming from ok i'm looking at my logic
data<00:01:07.220> book<00:01:07.640> for<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.450> ls<00:01:09.910> 367<00:01:10.910> as<00:01:11.060> i<00:01:11.899> found<00:01:12.140> in

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
data book for the ls 367 as i found in

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.920 
data book for the ls 367 as i found in
the<00:01:12.380> last<00:01:12.530> 367<00:01:13.460> over<00:01:13.820> here<00:01:14.119> where<00:01:16.630> fans<00:01:17.630> inside

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
the last 367 over here where fans inside

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.490 
the last 367 over here where fans inside
it's<00:01:18.110> hard<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.410> do<00:01:18.530> on<00:01:18.560> camera<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:19.509> pin<00:01:20.509> 13<00:01:21.140> is

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
it's hard to do on camera a pin 13 is

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.600 
it's hard to do on camera a pin 13 is
showing<00:01:22.190> hi<00:01:22.520> now<00:01:23.509> I've<00:01:24.380> tried<00:01:24.770> logic<00:01:25.160> pulsing

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
showing hi now I've tried logic pulsing

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.660 
showing hi now I've tried logic pulsing
that<00:01:25.789> and<00:01:26.119> it<00:01:26.270> stays<00:01:26.600> high<00:01:27.250> indicating<00:01:28.250> that

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
that and it stays high indicating that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.809 
that and it stays high indicating that
it's<00:01:28.850> actually<00:01:29.030> shorted<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:30.050> 5<00:01:30.289> volts<00:01:30.789> so<00:01:31.789> I

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
it's actually shorted to 5 volts so I

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:32.889 
it's actually shorted to 5 volts so I
think<00:01:31.910> there's<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.119> very<00:01:32.240> good<00:01:32.390> chance<00:01:32.509> that's

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
think there's a very good chance that's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.050 
think there's a very good chance that's
the<00:01:33.140> problem<00:01:33.440> so<00:01:33.709> I'm<00:01:33.770> just<00:01:33.860> going<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.100> get<00:01:34.850> my

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
the problem so I'm just going to get my

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.210 
the problem so I'm just going to get my
my<00:01:35.479> trusty<00:01:35.810> metcal<00:01:36.200> he's<00:01:36.530> holding<00:01:36.860> on<00:01:36.979> and

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
my trusty metcal he's holding on and

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.520 
my trusty metcal he's holding on and
remove<00:01:38.030> such<00:01:38.270> if<00:01:38.479> I'm<00:01:38.660> testing<00:01:38.990> out<00:01:39.080> so<00:01:39.289> I<00:01:39.319> can

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
remove such if I'm testing out so I can

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.960 
remove such if I'm testing out so I can
see<00:01:39.770> what<00:01:39.890> it's<00:01:39.979> like<00:01:40.539> ok<00:01:41.539> i<00:01:41.569> removed<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.319> ls

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
see what it's like ok i removed the ls

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.600 
see what it's like ok i removed the ls
367<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.119> put<00:01:44.300> it<00:01:44.390> into<00:01:44.479> my<00:01:44.750> leaper<00:01:45.229> tester<00:01:45.830> if

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
367 and put it into my leaper tester if

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.340 
367 and put it into my leaper tester if
i<00:01:46.850> press<00:01:47.000> also<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.569> should<00:01:47.690> detect<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.170> chick

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
i press also it should detect the chick

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.740 
i press also it should detect the chick
what's<00:01:48.590> matically<00:01:49.090> which<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.209> doesn't<00:01:50.450> it

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
what's matically which it doesn't it

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.139 
what's matically which it doesn't it
says<00:01:50.929> not<00:01:51.170> found<00:01:51.440> now<00:01:52.190> when<00:01:52.759> you're<00:01:52.910> doing

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
says not found now when you're doing

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.850 
says not found now when you're doing
also<00:01:53.420> tests<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:53.929> not<00:01:54.110> found<00:01:54.319> it<00:01:54.590> basically

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
also tests is not found it basically

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.050 
also tests is not found it basically
means<00:01:55.039> that<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.280> tester<00:01:55.610> cannot<00:01:55.910> identify

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
means that the tester cannot identify

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.270 
means that the tester cannot identify
what<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:56.959> chip<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.349> usually<00:01:57.950> because<00:01:58.009> it's

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
what this chip is usually because it's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.639 
what this chip is usually because it's
got<00:01:58.399> a<00:01:58.429> fault<00:01:58.670> on<00:01:58.849> it<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.690> that<00:01:59.929> ties<00:02:00.259> in<00:02:00.530> with

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
got a fault on it so that ties in with

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.249 
got a fault on it so that ties in with
my<00:02:00.860> previous<00:02:01.160> finding<00:02:01.810> another<00:02:02.810> test<00:02:03.170> to

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
my previous finding another test to

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.190 
my previous finding another test to
confirm<00:02:03.470> we<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:04.039> do<00:02:04.190> is<00:02:04.490> by<00:02:04.910> checking<00:02:05.240> pin<00:02:05.660> 14

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
confirm we can do is by checking pin 14

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.440 
confirm we can do is by checking pin 14
with<00:02:06.619> my<00:02:06.860> logic<00:02:07.429> probe<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.849> can<00:02:08.000> see<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.330> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
with my logic probe I can see that the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.880 
with my logic probe I can see that the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
signal is now floating rather than

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
shorted to ground that indicator that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.589 
shorted to ground that indicator that

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
chip was actually the default causing

the<00:02:14.690> short<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:16.580> new<00:02:16.819> 367<00:02:17.780> has<00:02:17.870> been<00:02:18.020> fitted

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
the short and a new 367 has been fitted

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.460 
the short and a new 367 has been fitted
and<00:02:19.010> as<00:02:19.640> if<00:02:19.819> by<00:02:19.849> magic<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.930> game<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.290> now

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
and as if by magic the game is now

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:34.200 
and as if by magic the game is now
working

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.640 

checking<00:02:35.210> all<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.360> controls<00:02:35.750> sprites<00:02:36.470> or

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
checking all the controls sprites or

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.440 
checking all the controls sprites or
look<00:02:36.950> fine<00:02:40.840> excellent<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.030> me<00:02:44.180> just

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
look fine excellent and this is me just

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.280 
look fine excellent and this is me just
checking<00:02:44.870> back<00:02:45.050> on<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.380> board<00:02:45.620> an<00:02:45.920> hour<00:02:46.070> later

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
checking back on the board an hour later

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.420 
checking back on the board an hour later
it's<00:02:48.290> still<00:02:48.440> running<00:02:48.920> fine<00:02:51.040> just<00:02:52.040> get<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.280> bit

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
it's still running fine just get a bit

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.140 
it's still running fine just get a bit
warm<00:02:52.700> but<00:02:52.820> not<00:02:53.300> hot<00:02:53.360> anything<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:55.850> seems

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
warm but not hot anything so that seems

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.690 
warm but not hot anything so that seems
to<00:02:56.330> be<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.690> fault<00:02:57.350> fixed<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.040> board<00:02:58.459> working

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
to be the fault fixed and board working

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.510 
to be the fault fixed and board working
reliably<00:02:59.120> now
