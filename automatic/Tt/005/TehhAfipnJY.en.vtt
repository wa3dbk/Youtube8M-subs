percent<00:01:12.540> battery<00:01:12.990> life<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> played<00:01:13.680> with

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
percent battery life and I played with

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.280 
percent battery life and I played with
it<00:01:13.979> mildly<00:01:14.430> throughout<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> day<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.049> tried

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it mildly throughout the day but I tried

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.780 
it mildly throughout the day but I tried
to<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.530> use<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> whole<00:01:17.100> lot<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.580> wouldn't

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
to not use it a whole lot so it wouldn't

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.460 
to not use it a whole lot so it wouldn't
wear<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> battery<00:01:18.229> but<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.439> about

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
wear out the battery but it's at about

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.490 
wear out the battery but it's at about
thirty<00:01:19.830> percent<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.659> 138

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
thirty percent and right now it is 138

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
thirty percent and right now it is 138
p.m.<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> good<00:01:26.369> watch<00:01:27.180> but

thought it was going to be a lot a lot
bigger<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.890> it's<00:03:31.310> honestly<00:03:31.730> not<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:32.150> whole<00:03:32.570> lot

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.830 
bigger and it's honestly not a whole lot
bigger<00:03:32.989> than<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.859> Moto<00:03:34.040> 360<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.660> let's

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
bigger than the Moto 360 and so let's

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.180 
bigger than the Moto 360 and so let's
let's<00:03:36.260> see<00:03:36.440> how<00:03:36.560> am<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.680> going<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:36.890> get<00:03:36.950> on<00:03:37.100> my

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
let's see how am I going to get on my

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.020 
let's see how am I going to get on my
arm<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:39.109> a<00:03:39.380> leather<00:03:39.680> band<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.250> isn't

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
arm so this is a leather band it isn't

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.599 
arm so this is a leather band it isn't
as<00:03:41.150> rigid<00:03:41.540> as<00:03:41.630> people<00:03:42.109> said<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.680> was<00:03:42.859> it's<00:03:43.280> it's

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
honestly not that rigid I thought it was

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.460 
honestly not that rigid I thought it was
gonna<00:03:45.440> be<00:03:45.530> way<00:03:45.769> more<00:03:45.799> rigid<00:03:46.250> than<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.519> um<00:03:47.470> you

360 now although I do like the Moto 360
better<00:04:22.109> that's<00:04:22.470> because<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.919> the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
better that's because of the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.090 
better that's because of the
construction<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:23.880> all<00:04:24.270> metal<00:04:24.449> design

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
the bottom part of it which is the clasp

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.700 
the bottom part of it which is the clasp
area<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:30.090> kind<00:04:30.449> of<00:04:30.540> bugs<00:04:30.840> me<00:04:31.020> now<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.410> don't<00:04:31.560> know

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
area it kind of bugs me now I don't know

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.610 
area it kind of bugs me now I don't know
if<00:04:31.740> I'll<00:04:31.889> get<00:04:32.010> used<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.780> but<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:34.080> kind<00:04:34.500> of

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
if I'll get used to it but it kind of

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.500 
if I'll get used to it but it kind of
kind<00:04:35.010> of<00:04:35.190> bugs<00:04:35.370> me<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.790> don't<00:04:36.030> like<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.360> whole

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
kind of bugs me I don't like it a whole

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.409 
kind of bugs me I don't like it a whole
lot<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:37.160> like<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.280> charging<00:04:38.669> style<00:04:38.880> of<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.270> I

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
lot I like the charging style of it I

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.770 
lot I like the charging style of it I
like<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.990> customization<00:04:40.740> now<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
like the customization now the the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.990 
like the customization now the the
reason<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.250> Moto<00:04:44.370> 360<00:04:44.850> is

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
reason that I like the Moto 360 is

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.700 
reason that I like the Moto 360 is
because<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.600> does<00:04:45.750> design<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.500> all<00:04:46.560> that

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
because of the does design and all that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.260 
because of the does design and all that
and<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.830> told<00:04:47.039> you<00:04:47.190> but<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.630> feels<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:50.960> LG<00:04:52.100> watch

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
and I told you but it feels the LG watch

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.290 
and I told you but it feels the LG watch
feels<00:04:54.270> more<00:04:54.690> plasticky<00:04:55.440> so<00:04:55.710> it's<00:04:56.490> got<00:04:56.729> plastic

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
feels more plasticky so it's got plastic

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.980 
feels more plasticky so it's got plastic
on<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.449> back<00:04:57.690> it's<00:04:58.560> got<00:04:58.830> plastic<00:04:59.639> a<00:04:59.990> plasticky

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
on the back it's got plastic a plasticky

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.779 
on the back it's got plastic a plasticky
feeling<00:05:02.720> leather<00:05:03.720> even<00:05:04.260> though<00:05:04.380> it<00:05:04.500> says

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
feeling leather even though it says

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.159 
feeling leather even though it says
genuine<00:05:05.789> leather<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.419> don't<00:05:06.840> think<00:05:06.900> it's

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
genuine leather I don't think it's

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.350 
genuine leather I don't think it's
actually<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.860> mean<00:05:08.280> it's<00:05:08.820> probably<00:05:09.000> leather

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
actually I mean it's probably leather

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.500 
actually I mean it's probably leather
but<00:05:09.780> it's<00:05:10.650> not<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.889> best<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.820> LG<00:05:12.210> could<00:05:12.389> have

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
but it's not the best that LG could have

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.370 
but it's not the best that LG could have
put<00:05:12.690> into<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.080> watch<00:05:13.260> if<00:05:13.650> they<00:05:14.250> both<00:05:14.460> run<00:05:14.760> a

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
put into the watch if they both run a

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.850 
put into the watch if they both run a
android<00:05:16.380> wear<00:05:17.479> this<00:05:18.479> screen<00:05:18.900> is<00:05:19.050> smaller<00:05:19.320> this

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
android wear this screen is smaller this

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.430 
android wear this screen is smaller this
screen<00:05:20.160> is<00:05:20.190> bigger<00:05:20.490> I<00:05:20.820> don't<00:05:21.570> mind<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.050> line

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
screen is bigger I don't mind the line

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.339 
screen is bigger I don't mind the line
at<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.770> bottom<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.510> this<00:05:25.020> just<00:05:25.260> feels

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
at the bottom the it this just feels

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.460 
at the bottom the it this just feels
like<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.800> better<00:05:26.099> watch<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.700> it<00:05:27.450> it<00:05:27.900> has
