00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:15.070
 Yes then I would like to explain the setting of the new sequence 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.760
 It is usually also but did you say First is I sequence from here drag and drop 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.910
 is not it 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.509
 Sequences are created automatically 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.240
 It is to choose a say with a new sequence from here file 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.630
 c You can customize and choose a little bit 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.040
 Contact the crust the crust the crust the crust the crust the crust the crust 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.329
 Yes like this New sequence called window is appearing 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.710
 There are various presets available near you like this 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.760
 Well various presets are prepared, but this side is your camera 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.490
 By 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.040
 The big point is to pick out the presets 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:52.660
 For example, there is a camera, and avc member Tora-to-ma-ma 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.220
 There is a format but 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:00.050
 Assuming that the camera could be used if it was avca c format 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 Need to choose 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.670
 Here, for example, dslr digital is different 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.840
 For example, here is 1080 p 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:16.010
 In Please see the people here just it is to say this Why Pick'll selfish 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.040
 Just what size is the file embedded in the project panel 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.040
 You can see where this movie is called 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.620
 1929 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:31.680
 If it is here here if it is this 1920 times 1080 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:36.000
 It's 1080 It's a straight leaf p. 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.060
 That to you when the preset number of preset on the right side is not there is an explanation that'm doing 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.329
 Enter the name of a sequence If you have can be selected here 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.329
 I will 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:54.050
 Yes and Well a black form that Tteyuu and so the sequence and press ok 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.820
 But here be ready to drag and that is Yes This sequence is made to drop in 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.820
 It means that 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.630
 By the way, let's take a look at the c category setting that is above Shiihiro Shido dslr now 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.000
 It is in edit mode to say 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.440
 That is, to say things that were made in the new sequence are reflected in and this c right setting 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.610
 That's why 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.240
 Of course here is the preview of the video, which is reflected here 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.350
 There are a lot of things that are frozen here in editing mode now 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:28.230
 For example , if you live in avc intra avc intra and preview 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.220
 Will form file be integrated in the form of avc intra same thing was Tsu made 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.430
 That's why 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.280
 So it is here 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:40.540
 First of all , I confirmed what kind of format the camera captured 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.019
 I think that is first a big point say that'll make a new sequence from 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.400
 is not it 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:50.420
 It is important whether the tracks in the set of sequences This is the track of sound 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:56.090
 Well it refers to the number of tracks eg you want to add the number of audio here 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.390
 Or from this preset you can select each in the form of 5.1 round channel monaural 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.390
 I can do it
