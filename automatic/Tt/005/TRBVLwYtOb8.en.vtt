master<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.150> long<00:00:12.389> haul<00:00:12.690> here<00:00:14.059> right<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:16.369> right<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
master a long haul here right so right I

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.060 
master a long haul here right so right I
better<00:00:17.730> start<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.380> scrapper<00:00:19.380> then<00:00:19.650> cities

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
better start with scrapper then cities

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.810 
better start with scrapper then cities
at<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.279> front<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> line<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.109> fold<00:00:22.820> his

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
at the front of the line so you fold his

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.890 
at the front of the line so you fold his
shovel<00:00:24.269> over<00:00:24.480> his<00:00:24.779> hood<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.880> pull<00:00:27.240> back<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.870 
shovel over his hood and pull back that
there<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.500> clip<00:00:31.859> devastate<00:00:32.700> his

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
there and then you clip devastate his

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.319 
there and then you clip devastate his
hand<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:35.850> bit<00:00:36.120> unlike

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
hand on like that and this bit unlike

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.250 
hand on like that and this bit unlike
that<00:00:36.750> originally<00:00:37.410> had<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> super<00:00:38.190> battle<00:00:38.520> droid

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
that originally had a super battle droid

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.540 
that originally had a super battle droid
arm<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> lost<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.600> he's<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.550> got

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
arm but I lost that one so he's now got

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.010 
arm but I lost that one so he's now got
battle<00:00:45.059> droid<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.760> scrapper<00:00:48.020> now

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
