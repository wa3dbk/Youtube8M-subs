00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
you how to put the two data curve

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.920 
you how to put the two data curve
together<00:05:41.950> to<00:05:42.790> do<00:05:42.940> comparison<00:05:43.690> analysis<00:05:44.729> first

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
together to do comparison analysis first

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.430 
together to do comparison analysis first
realize<00:05:46.930> that<00:05:47.260> two<00:05:47.710> curve<00:05:48.040> scale<00:05:48.400> gap<00:05:48.729> is

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
realize that two curve scale gap is

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.690 
realize that two curve scale gap is
30,000<00:05:50.610> so<00:05:51.610> at<00:05:52.200> 30,000<00:05:53.200> to<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:53.979> smaller<00:05:54.370> input

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
30,000 so at 30,000 to the smaller input

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.090 
30,000 so at 30,000 to the smaller input
pain<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:57.820> input<00:05:58.270> a<00:05:58.419> and<00:05:58.810> output<00:05:59.590> and<00:05:59.800> one

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
pain the input a and output and one

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.540 
pain the input a and output and one
curve<00:06:00.430> will<00:06:00.910> be<00:06:01.030> on<00:06:01.210> same<00:06:01.570> dimension<00:06:02.200> now<00:06:02.550> then

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
curve will be on same dimension now then

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.050 
curve will be on same dimension now then
multiply<00:06:04.360> the<00:06:04.419> input<00:06:04.990> a<00:06:05.380> value<00:06:05.410> by<00:06:06.250> five<00:06:06.550> for

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
multiply the input a value by five for

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.420 
multiply the input a value by five for
example<00:06:08.100> to<00:06:09.100> enlarge<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:09.820> input<00:06:10.479> a<00:06:10.600> value<00:06:11.430> in

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
example to enlarge the input a value in

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.969 
example to enlarge the input a value in
this<00:06:12.760> way<00:06:13.000> you<00:06:13.540> can<00:06:13.690> see<00:06:13.900> that<00:06:14.110> two<00:06:14.410> data<00:06:14.650> curve

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
this way you can see that two data curve

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.230 
this way you can see that two data curve
can<00:06:15.550> be<00:06:15.700> compared<00:06:16.180> more<00:06:16.540> clearing<00:06:17.729> finally<00:06:18.729> we

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
can be compared more clearing finally we

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.930 
can be compared more clearing finally we
can<00:06:19.390> also<00:06:19.630> zooming<00:06:20.350> a<00:06:20.530> shot<00:06:20.979> data<00:06:21.280> to<00:06:21.820> do

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
can also zooming a shot data to do

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.409 
can also zooming a shot data to do
analysis<00:06:23.010> how<00:06:24.010> the<00:06:24.070> data<00:06:24.430> will<00:06:24.729> help<00:06:25.030> you<00:06:25.210> to

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
analysis how the data will help you to

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.120 
analysis how the data will help you to
analyze<00:06:25.780> some<00:06:26.050> problems<00:06:26.530> you<00:06:26.740> can<00:06:26.950> have

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
analyze some problems you can have

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.919 
analyze some problems you can have
feeling<00:06:27.669> a<00:06:27.760> flight<00:06:28.030> thanks<00:06:28.900> for<00:06:29.470> watching
