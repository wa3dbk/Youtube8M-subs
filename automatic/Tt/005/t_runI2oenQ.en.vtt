so<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:54.259> then<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.399> wall<00:01:55.640> at<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.759> bottom

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:09.930 

and<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.729> water<00:02:04.000> goes<00:02:04.330> here<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.789> is

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
and the water goes here I see that is

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
doing the Pistons in the piston the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.740 
doing the Pistons in the piston the
piston<00:02:17.890> should<00:02:18.400> become<00:02:18.760> an<00:02:18.910> answer<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:19.540> stop

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
piston should become an answer so stop

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.940 
piston should become an answer so stop
the<00:02:19.870> water

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.010

let's just they go and i do this

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.100 
let's just they go and i do this
got<00:02:37.489> some<00:02:37.819> it's<00:02:38.239> time<00:02:38.890> i'm<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.099> can<00:02:40.280> use<00:02:40.430> a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
got some it's time i'm you can use a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.870 
got some it's time i'm you can use a
repeater<00:02:42.110> there<00:02:42.800> but<00:02:43.280> i'll<00:02:43.459> just<00:02:43.489> do<00:02:43.730> that

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
repeater there but i'll just do that

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.290 
repeater there but i'll just do that
like<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.870> works<00:02:45.110> like<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.880> doesn't<00:02:47.120> go

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
like that it works like this doesn't go

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.160 
like that it works like this doesn't go
like<00:02:47.330> this<00:02:47.660> every<00:02:48.110> walk<00:02:49.330> there<00:02:50.330> we<00:02:50.390> go<00:02:53.170> that's

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
like this every walk there we go that's

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.830 
like this every walk there we go that's
done<00:02:54.410> I<00:02:56.170> can<00:02:57.170> just

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.220 
that's what seems to think so
let's<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.299> build<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.750> sign<00:03:07.080> on<00:03:08.659> the<00:03:09.659> wall<00:03:09.840> of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
let's just build a sign on the wall of

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:22.180 
let's just build a sign on the wall of
the<00:03:10.560> toilet

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.540 

feel<00:03:22.850> me<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.270> one's<00:03:23.570> us<00:03:23.720> more<00:03:23.960> than<00:03:24.020> my<00:03:24.230> one

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
feel me this one's us more than my one

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.030 
feel me this one's us more than my one
the<00:03:25.550> walls<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:25.880> mind<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.180> think<00:03:26.240> was<00:03:26.480> bit<00:03:26.660> there

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
the walls in mind I think was bit there

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:41.839 
the walls in mind I think was bit there
fine<00:03:28.040> available<00:03:28.490> doesn't<00:03:28.640> matter

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:48.709 

all<00:03:42.299> right<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:44.340> floor<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:47.389> then<00:03:48.389> we<00:03:48.540> take

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:48.719 
all right and the floor and then we take

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:54.500 
all right and the floor and then we take
the<00:03:49.019> wrist<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.829> over<00:03:50.269> here<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:52.670> then<00:03:53.670> she

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
the wrist on over here and then she

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.949 
the wrist on over here and then she
peasant<00:03:54.840> lever<00:03:55.019> over<00:03:55.980> here<00:03:56.569> so<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.749> still

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
peasant lever over here so you still

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.030 
peasant lever over here so you still
redstone<00:03:58.379> over<00:03:58.680> here

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
redstone over here

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.879

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
harder this just takes less than a

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.520 
harder this just takes less than a
minute<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.800> make<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:01.240> okay<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.199> pull<00:05:02.410> the

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
minute to make so okay you pull the

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.189 
minute to make so okay you pull the
lever<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:03.400> actually<00:05:04.120> just<00:05:04.300> goes<00:05:04.419> up<00:05:04.570> really

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
lever and actually just goes up really
