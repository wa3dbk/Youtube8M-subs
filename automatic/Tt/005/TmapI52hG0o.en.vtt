that skill is always useful for

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
that skill is always useful for
filtering<00:01:10.560> out<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.799> triggers<00:01:11.100> gettin<00:01:11.640> your

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.270 
that would be really really complicated
we<00:03:36.419> have<00:03:36.569> him<00:03:36.750> he<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.410> there<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.650> filter<00:03:38.160> out

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
we have him he is there to filter out

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.710 
we have him he is there to filter out
all<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.519> grade<00:03:38.730> 3<00:03:38.880> units<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.299> we<00:03:39.389> don't<00:03:39.569> need

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
all the grade 3 units that we don't need

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.390 
all the grade 3 units that we don't need
so<00:03:40.019> extra<00:03:40.620> CEOs<00:03:41.010> pitch<00:03:41.609> them<00:03:42.109> borrowers<00:03:43.400> we

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
so extra CEOs pitch them borrowers we

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.860 
so extra CEOs pitch them borrowers we
could<00:03:44.549> possibly<00:03:44.849> pitch<00:03:45.030> them<00:03:45.239> mana<00:03:45.540> Witten's

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
could possibly pitch them mana Witten's

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.930 
could possibly pitch them mana Witten's
if<00:03:46.049> we're<00:03:46.260> getting<00:03:46.530> way<00:03:47.310> too<00:03:47.370> many<00:03:47.579> we<00:03:47.819> can

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
if we're getting way too many we can

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.319 
if we're getting way too many we can
pitch<00:03:48.090> those<00:03:48.299> as<00:03:48.450> well<00:03:49.819> now<00:03:50.819> moving<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.239> the

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
can't because there's not a third set so

him in the first turn we could possibly

him in the first turn we could possibly

search out the grade two warmer

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.000 
search out the grade two warmer
which<00:04:27.840> will<00:04:27.960> make<00:04:28.080> things<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.440> lot<00:04:28.620> easier<00:04:28.680> for

which will make things a lot easier for

which will make things a lot easier for

us for the rest of the game this allows

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.330 
us for the rest of the game this allows
us<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:31.050> not<00:04:31.500> only<00:04:31.620> quickly<00:04:32.010> fill<00:04:32.160> out<00:04:32.220> the

us to not only quickly fill out the

us to not only quickly fill out the

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
field but this effect in itself

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.530 
field but this effect in itself
searching<00:04:35.280> out<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.490> grade<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:35.910> Mortimer<00:04:36.210> is<00:04:36.419> a

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
searching out the grade to Mortimer is a

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.430 
searching out the grade to Mortimer is a
plus<00:04:36.810> one<00:04:37.080> which<00:04:37.260> allows<00:04:37.770> us<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:39.440> potentially

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
plus one which allows us to potentially

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.379 
plus one which allows us to potentially
increase<00:04:40.740> our<00:04:40.950> defenses<00:04:41.490> for<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.180> rest<00:04:42.330> of

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
increase our defenses for the rest of

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.970 
increase our defenses for the rest of
the<00:04:42.480> game<00:04:42.630> considering<00:04:43.169> that<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.740> deck<00:04:43.950> is

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
the game considering that this deck is

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.280 
the game considering that this deck is
not<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.220> perfect<00:04:44.490> shields<00:04:45.110> most<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.200> our

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
not a perfect shields most of our

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.860 
not a perfect shields most of our
defense<00:04:46.410> comes<00:04:47.040> from<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.580> triggers<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.270> by

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
defense comes from the triggers so by

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.190 
defense comes from the triggers so by
filtering<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.889> units<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:51.660> are<00:04:51.870> not

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
filtering the units that are not

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.409 
filtering the units that are not
triggers<00:04:52.610> we<00:04:53.610> have<00:04:53.730> a<00:04:53.760> higher<00:04:53.940> chance<00:04:53.970> of

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
triggers we have a higher chance of

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.000 
triggers we have a higher chance of
pulling<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.990> units<00:04:55.230> that<00:04:55.350> are<00:04:55.380> triggers<00:04:55.770> thus

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
pulling the units that are triggers thus

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.180 
pulling the units that are triggers thus
giving<00:04:56.520> us<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.760> higher<00:04:57.180> defense<00:04:57.540> so<00:04:58.190> basically

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
giving us a higher defense so basically

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.430 
giving us a higher defense so basically
the<00:04:59.610> entire<00:04:59.820> concept<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.419> this<00:05:00.540> deck<00:05:00.720> is<00:05:00.900> get

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
the entire concept of this deck is get

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.370 
the entire concept of this deck is get
the<00:05:01.560> CEO<00:05:01.890> filter<00:05:02.430> triggers<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:03.060> then<00:05:03.390> attack

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
the CEO filter triggers and then attack

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.220 
the CEO filter triggers and then attack
attack<00:05:04.980> attack<00:05:05.010> attack<00:05:05.300> aight<00:05:06.300> crits<00:05:06.660> which

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
attack attack attack aight crits which

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.080 
attack attack attack aight crits which
also<00:05:07.410> serve<00:05:07.740> as<00:05:07.950> a<00:05:08.010> nice<00:05:08.430> defense<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:12.000> know

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
also serve as a nice defense you know

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.640 
also serve as a nice defense you know
it's<00:05:12.240> pretty<00:05:12.390> much<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.720> gained<00:05:12.960> as<00:05:13.140> much<00:05:13.169> free

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
it's pretty much it gained as much free

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.650 
it's pretty much it gained as much free
advantage<00:05:14.010> as<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:14.250> possibly<00:05:14.610> can<00:05:14.790> and<00:05:15.060> attack

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
advantage as you possibly can and attack

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.770 
advantage as you possibly can and attack
so<00:05:16.640> like<00:05:17.640> i<00:05:17.730> said<00:05:17.760> this<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.300> not<00:05:18.450> a<00:05:18.510> deck<00:05:18.750> that

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
so like i said this is not a deck that

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.600 
so like i said this is not a deck that
you<00:05:19.020> want<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.350> buy<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.830> cards<00:05:20.280> and<00:05:20.430> play

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
you want to buy the cards and play

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.310 
you want to buy the cards and play
competitively<00:05:21.450> this<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:21.870> more<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:22.080> a<00:05:22.169> deck

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
competitively this is more of a deck

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.630 
competitively this is more of a deck
that<00:05:22.350> you<00:05:22.530> can<00:05:22.650> proxy<00:05:23.070> have<00:05:23.250> fun<00:05:23.430> with<00:05:23.550> your

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
that you can proxy have fun with your

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.120 
that you can proxy have fun with your
