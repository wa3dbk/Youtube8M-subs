Ward<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.620> she<00:00:34.739> said<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.309> her

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
Ward and she said this one was her

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.100 
Ward and she said this one was her
favorite<00:00:35.760> both<00:00:35.940> because<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.360> very<00:00:36.600> powerful

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
favorite both because it's very powerful

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.240 
favorite both because it's very powerful
and<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.260> doesn't<00:00:37.500> give<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.710> very<00:00:37.890> many<00:00:38.010> hit

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and it doesn't give you very many hit

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
and it doesn't give you very many hit
markers<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.059> also<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> built-in

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
markers but also because as a built-in

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889 
markers but also because as a built-in
ballistic<00:00:41.309> CPU<00:00:41.579> which<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.450> kind<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> see

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
ballistic CPU which you can kind of see

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.170 
ballistic CPU which you can kind of see
on<00:00:43.050> top<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> sniper<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.129> apparently<00:00:45.059> this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
on top of the sniper and apparently this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.690 
on top of the sniper and apparently this
thing<00:00:45.239> compensates<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.289> recoil<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.610> up

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
thing compensates for recoil for for up

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.610 
thing compensates for recoil for for up
to<00:00:47.850> four<00:00:48.059> kills<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.989> know<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.260> this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to four kills so you know I think this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.380 
to four kills so you know I think this
thing<00:00:49.860> might<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.489> kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> head

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
thing might be kind of like the head

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990 
thing might be kind of like the head
honcho<00:00:51.660> sniper<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.739> Call<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> Duty<00:00:53.670> ghosts<00:00:53.940> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
honcho sniper in Call of Duty ghosts you

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
to switch it out for a different primary

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.630 
to switch it out for a different primary
weapon<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> pistol<00:02:26.070> if<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.250> rank<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.580> up

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
weapon but the pistol if you rank it up

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.940 
weapon but the pistol if you rank it up
correctly<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.270> actually<00:02:27.900> very<00:02:28.170> very<00:02:28.350> good

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
correctly is actually very very good

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.320 
correctly is actually very very good
like<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.250> shoots<00:02:29.460> really<00:02:29.730> really<00:02:30.120> quickly

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
like it shoots really really quickly

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.060 
like it shoots really really quickly
there's<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.720> really<00:02:31.050> high<00:02:31.260> fire<00:02:31.590> rate<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
there's a really high fire rate on that

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.050 
there's a really high fire rate on that
thing<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> good<00:02:32.880> trigger

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
very quickly which is very very

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.940
