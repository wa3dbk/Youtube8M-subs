00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840 

I<00:00:00.560> got<00:00:01.560> something<00:00:01.890> on<00:00:01.979> here<00:00:02.220> not<00:00:02.399> sure<00:00:02.460> what<00:00:02.760> it

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
I got something on here not sure what it

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.180 
I got something on here not sure what it
is

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.190 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:21.020 

about<00:00:06.970> 30

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:42.150 

Oh

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.980 

pretty<00:00:43.160> sure<00:00:43.430> would<00:00:44.300> be<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.450> little<00:00:44.720> bit<00:00:44.780> too

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
pretty sure would be a little bit too

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:59.830 
pretty sure would be a little bit too
big<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:45.230> he's<00:00:45.770> going<00:00:46.010> back<00:00:58.240> back<00:00:59.510> so<00:00:59.720> they

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
big so he's going back back so they

00:00:59.840 --> 00:03:07.100 
big so he's going back back so they
just<00:01:00.020> kind<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.320> get<00:01:00.470> Mysterio

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:05:37.830 

very<00:03:08.110> well

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.840 

when<00:05:38.840> you<00:05:39.040> and<00:05:40.040> there's<00:05:40.250> some<00:05:40.400> courage<00:05:40.700> on<00:05:40.820> the

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
when you and there's some courage on the

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.600 
when you and there's some courage on the
other<00:05:41.000> side<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:42.169> bouncer<00:05:42.620> comes<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:43.100> lay<00:05:43.220> flat

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
other side the bouncer comes to lay flat

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.270 
other side the bouncer comes to lay flat
and<00:05:43.910> starts<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.660> spin<00:05:45.020> gets<00:05:45.590> caught<00:05:45.830> up<00:05:46.010> in<00:05:46.160> the

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
and starts to spin gets caught up in the

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.730 
and starts to spin gets caught up in the
line<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.700> it<00:05:46.820> all<00:05:46.940> twists<00:05:47.360> together<00:05:47.680> can<00:05:48.680> be

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
line and it all twists together can be

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.530 
line and it all twists together can be
fixed<00:05:49.040> but<00:05:49.340> you<00:05:49.520> didn't<00:05:49.790> have<00:05:49.880> this<00:05:50.120> swivel

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
fixed but you didn't have this swivel

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.110 
fixed but you didn't have this swivel
here<00:05:50.660> you<00:05:50.840> just<00:05:51.050> had<00:05:51.260> the<00:05:52.250> hook<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:52.610> on<00:05:52.880> here

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
here you just had the hook I on here

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.790 
here you just had the hook I on here
that<00:05:53.300> would<00:05:53.630> be<00:05:53.720> just<00:05:53.960> perfect<00:05:54.020> but<00:05:54.590> this

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
that would be just perfect but this

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.970 
that would be just perfect but this
swivel<00:05:55.070> kind<00:05:55.430> of<00:05:56.169> creates<00:05:57.169> the<00:05:57.260> problem

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
swivel kind of creates the problem

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.100 
swivel kind of creates the problem
another<00:05:58.580> thing<00:05:58.820> with<00:05:59.000> this<00:05:59.120> swivel<00:05:59.600> is<00:05:59.780> I've

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
another thing with this swivel is I've

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.050 
another thing with this swivel is I've
seen<00:06:00.410> it<00:06:00.560> where<00:06:00.710> it<00:06:00.800> bends<00:06:01.310> over<00:06:01.669> like<00:06:01.820> this

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
seen it where it bends over like this

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.960 
seen it where it bends over like this
and<00:06:02.390> you<00:06:03.169> go<00:06:03.320> and<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.590> bend<00:06:03.800> it<00:06:03.980> back<00:06:04.190> you<00:06:04.820> do

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
and you go and you bend it back you do

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.130 
and you go and you bend it back you do
that<00:06:05.120> a<00:06:05.150> couple<00:06:05.270> of<00:06:05.510> times<00:06:05.600> and<00:06:06.050> then

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
that a couple of times and then

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.690 
that a couple of times and then
eventually<00:06:06.169> it'll<00:06:06.740> just<00:06:06.950> break<00:06:07.070> off<00:06:07.370> you<00:06:07.550> lose

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
eventually it'll just break off you lose

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.700 
eventually it'll just break off you lose
your<00:06:08.030> slick<00:06:08.600> stick<00:06:08.840> in<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.080> bottom<00:06:09.230> of<00:06:09.530> a<00:06:10.300> lake

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
your slick stick in the bottom of a lake

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.930 
your slick stick in the bottom of a lake
other<00:06:12.710> than<00:06:12.830> that<00:06:12.919> it's<00:06:13.160> great<00:06:13.370> I<00:06:13.550> like<00:06:13.790> the

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
other than that it's great I like the

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.430 
other than that it's great I like the
way<00:06:14.060> it<00:06:14.180> Telegraph's<00:06:14.660> the<00:06:14.930> bottom

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
way it Telegraph's the bottom

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.260 
way it Telegraph's the bottom
way<00:06:16.070> better<00:06:16.250> than<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.520> bottom<00:06:16.850> bouncer

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
way better than the bottom bouncer

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.270 
way better than the bottom bouncer
doesn't<00:06:18.080> get<00:06:18.200> snagged<00:06:18.500> as<00:06:18.740> often<00:06:19.070> as<00:06:19.190> the

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
doesn't get snagged as often as the

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.310 
doesn't get snagged as often as the
bottom<00:06:19.550> bouncer<00:06:19.880> does<00:06:20.060> all<00:06:20.540> in<00:06:20.750> all<00:06:20.900> it's

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
bottom bouncer does all in all it's

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.730 
bottom bouncer does all in all it's
great<00:06:21.470> I'd<00:06:21.800> continue<00:06:22.310> to<00:06:22.430> use<00:06:22.550> it
