this is a buffet r-13 green line with
silver-plated<00:00:19.429> keys<00:00:20.289> so<00:00:21.289> basically<00:00:21.800> if<00:00:22.159> you

this for my neck strap and you might
think<00:01:39.260> it's<00:01:39.500> kind<00:01:39.620> of<00:01:39.710> weird<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.040> play<00:01:40.190> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
think it's kind of weird that I play the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.120 
think it's kind of weird that I play the
neck<00:01:40.580> strap<00:01:40.909> but<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.750> injured<00:01:42.440> my<00:01:42.560> wrist<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.920> few

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
neck strap but I injured my wrist a few

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.430 
neck strap but I injured my wrist a few
years<00:01:43.400> ago<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.390> it's<00:01:44.659> just<00:01:44.990> not<00:01:45.110> as<00:01:45.229> strong

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
years ago and so it's just not as strong

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.830 
years ago and so it's just not as strong
as<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:45.770> was<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.390> sometimes<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.630> gets<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.810> little

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
as it was and sometimes it gets a little

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.990 
as it was and sometimes it gets a little
heavy<00:01:48.080> after<00:01:48.380> long<00:01:48.590> periods<00:01:48.830> of<00:01:49.250> playing<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:49.790> I

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
heavy after long periods of playing so I

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.399 
heavy after long periods of playing so I
do<00:01:50.119> play<00:01:50.390> with<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.540> neck<00:01:50.690> strap<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.229> find

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
do play with a neck strap and I find

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.030 
do play with a neck strap and I find
that<00:01:51.470> that<00:01:51.650> helps<00:01:51.950> with<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:52.909> hook

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
that that helps with the hook

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
that that helps with the hook
another<00:01:55.040> thing<00:01:55.190> I<00:01:55.250> like<00:01:55.400> about<00:01:55.430> this<00:01:55.670> clarinet

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
another thing I like about this clarinet

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.880 
another thing I like about this clarinet
is<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.240> resistance<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.140> keys<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:57.770> it's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
is the resistance in the keys and it's

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.890 
is the resistance in the keys and it's
due<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.159> these<00:01:58.310> blue<00:01:59.060> steel<00:01:59.270> springs<00:01:59.630> here

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
due to these blue steel springs here

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.250 
due to these blue steel springs here
they<00:02:00.890> have<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.400> nice<00:02:02.119> resistance<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.900> helps

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
they have a nice resistance and helps

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.960 
they have a nice resistance and helps
you<00:02:03.350> really<00:02:03.530> feel<00:02:04.430> what<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.760> know<00:02:04.850> what

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
you really feel what you know what

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.600 
you really feel what you know what
you're<00:02:05.060> putting<00:02:05.210> down<00:02:06.070> along<00:02:07.070> with<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.369> I

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
you're putting down along with that I

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.660 
you're putting down along with that I
like<00:02:07.850> how<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.289> silver<00:02:09.289> plate<00:02:09.590> silver<00:02:10.369> plated

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
like how the silver plate silver plated

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.089 
like how the silver plate silver plated
Keys<00:02:10.849> gives<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> lot<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.569> grip<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.770> had<00:02:12.950> an

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
nickel-plated and I just felt like my

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.030 
nickel-plated and I just felt like my
fingers<00:02:16.080> are<00:02:16.170> slipping<00:02:16.349> all<00:02:16.560> over<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.860> place

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040

thing<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.799> don't<00:02:46.860> like<00:02:47.099> are<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.819> logos<00:02:48.530> I'm<00:02:49.530> a

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
thing I don't like are the logos I'm a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.589 
thing I don't like are the logos I'm a
little<00:02:50.280> bit<00:02:50.370> look<00:02:50.489> fine<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.239> durability

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
little bit look fine but the durability

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.059 
little bit look fine but the durability
of<00:02:51.780> them<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.230> mean<00:02:52.500> it's<00:02:52.620> not<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.739> big<00:02:52.920> deal

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
of them I mean it's not a big deal

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.890 
of them I mean it's not a big deal
doesn't<00:02:53.370> affect<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.670> sound<00:02:53.849> but<00:02:54.209> they<00:02:54.840> do

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
doesn't affect the sound but they do

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.039 
doesn't affect the sound but they do
wear<00:02:55.290> off<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.739> as<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:55.950> can<00:02:56.099> see<00:02:56.840> but<00:02:57.840> that's

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
wear off the as you can see but that's

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.780 
wear off the as you can see but that's
again<00:02:58.319> not<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> big<00:02:58.650> deal<00:02:59.930> my<00:03:00.930> con<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.650> tone<00:03:02.459> and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
again not a big deal my con is tone and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.850 
again not a big deal my con is tone and
the<00:03:02.849> fluid<00:03:03.209> even<00:03:03.420> upper<00:03:04.049> register<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.560> just

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
the fluid even upper register is just

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.339 
the fluid even upper register is just
not<00:03:05.010> how<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> would<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.329> be<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.569> past

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
not how I would like it to be like past

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.020 
not how I would like it to be like past
a<00:03:07.650> high<00:03:07.980> D<00:03:08.040> or<00:03:08.340> E<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.940> just<00:03:09.299> gets<00:03:09.480> really

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
a high D or E it just gets really

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.039 
a high D or E it just gets really
pinched<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.150> guess<00:03:12.299> but<00:03:12.450> that's<00:03:12.569> probably<00:03:12.900> my

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
pinched I guess but that's probably my

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.300 
pinched I guess but that's probably my
arm<00:03:13.260> shirt<00:03:13.880> not<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.000> clarinet<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.950> so<00:03:16.950> that

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
arm shirt not the clarinet and so that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.390 
arm shirt not the clarinet and so that
