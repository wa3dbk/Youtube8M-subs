concept which is another Z car which is
the<00:01:34.399> convertible<00:01:34.970> which<00:01:35.119> sits<00:01:35.390> over<00:01:35.660> there

the convertible which sits over there
which<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.229> effectively<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.700> tried<00:01:38.060> and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
which is effectively the tried and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.080 
which is effectively the tried and
tested<00:01:38.840> formula<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.619> successful<00:01:40.220> 370<00:01:40.880> SN

without<00:01:41.660> a<00:01:41.690> roof<00:01:41.930> on<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.440> we<00:01:42.979> think<00:01:43.280> this

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
without a roof on it and we think this

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.610 
without a roof on it and we think this
is<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:43.910> design<00:01:44.240> study<00:01:44.899> at<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.110> moment<00:01:45.409> but

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
is a design study at the moment but

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.530 
is a design study at the moment but
maybe<00:01:45.680> if<00:01:46.400> there's<00:01:46.700> enough<00:01:46.909> interest<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.450> the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
maybe if there's enough interest in the

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.120 
maybe if there's enough interest in the
car<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:48.229> can<00:01:48.380> be<00:01:48.470> coming<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:48.830> dealership

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
car it can be coming to a dealership

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.960 
car it can be coming to a dealership
near<00:01:49.400> you<00:01:49.460> soon<00:01:49.760> question<00:01:50.750> with<00:01:50.870> that<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:51.350> it

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
near you soon question with that is it

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.280 
near you soon question with that is it
significantly<00:01:52.970> beefed<00:01:53.240> up<00:01:53.420> over<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.900> regular

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
significantly beefed up over the regular

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.110 
significantly beefed up over the regular
roadster<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:55.159> can<00:01:55.370> handle<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.729> much<00:01:55.880> more

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
roadster so can handle that much more

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.060 
roadster so can handle that much more
torque<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.510> power<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.960> performance<00:01:57.049> yeah<00:01:58.040> I

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
torque and power and performance yeah I

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.280 
torque and power and performance yeah I
think<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:59.119> chassis<00:01:59.540> anyway<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.049> very

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
think that the chassis anyway is very

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.440 
think that the chassis anyway is very
very<00:02:00.590> strong<00:02:01.010> in<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.700> disease<00:02:02.000> we've<00:02:02.240> seen

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
very strong in the in disease we've seen

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.230 
very strong in the in disease we've seen
that<00:02:02.570> over<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.869> generation<00:02:03.380> from<00:02:03.590> 240<00:02:04.549> 350

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
that over the generation from 240 350

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.930 
that over the generation from 240 350
and<00:02:05.330> 370<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.200> again<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.400> just<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.640> design

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
and 370 and again this is just a design

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.310 
and 370 and again this is just a design
study<00:02:08.179> at<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.450> moment<00:02:08.720> but<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.899> course<00:02:09.080> if<00:02:09.229> it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
study at the moment but of course if it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.900 
study at the moment but of course if it
goes<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.590> production<00:02:09.890> we<00:02:10.489> will<00:02:10.519> be<00:02:10.729> putting

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
goes to production we will be putting

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.420 
goes to production we will be putting

that<00:02:35.750> I've<00:02:35.840> known<00:02:36.110> ever<00:02:36.880> well<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:37.910> think<00:02:38.170> people

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
that I've known ever well I think people

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.660 
that I've known ever well I think people

talk about their brand and they talk
about<00:02:41.860> marketing<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:43.280> know<00:02:43.400> we<00:02:43.700> say<00:02:44.030> we're

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
about marketing you know we say we're

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.360 
about marketing you know we say we're
about<00:02:44.510> innovation<00:02:45.019> egg-sized<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.799> this<00:02:46.160> is

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
about innovation egg-sized and this is

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.819 
about innovation egg-sized and this is
innovation<00:02:47.209> we<00:02:47.720> looked<00:02:47.930> at<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.140> rules<00:02:48.290> we

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
innovation we looked at the rules we

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.410 
innovation we looked at the rules we
think<00:02:49.130> we've<00:02:49.370> got<00:02:49.489> an<00:02:49.550> advantage<00:02:49.819> by<00:02:50.150> putting

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
think we've got an advantage by putting

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.309 
think we've got an advantage by putting
the<00:02:50.480> engine<00:02:50.720> at<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.840> front

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
the engine at the front

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.630 
the engine at the front
yes<00:02:51.530> that's<00:02:51.739> different<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.190> what<00:02:52.310> everyone

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
yes that's different to what everyone

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.280 
yes that's different to what everyone
else<00:02:52.760> does<00:02:52.970> but<00:02:53.599> we<00:02:53.690> think<00:02:53.870> there's<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.140> big

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
else does but we think there's a big

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.059 
else does but we think there's a big
advantage<00:02:54.560> there

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
advantage there

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.250 
advantage there
and<00:02:55.159> we<00:02:55.519> can<00:02:55.670> explain<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.360> great<00:02:56.750> detail<00:02:57.110> at

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
and we can explain in great detail at

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.319 
and we can explain in great detail at
some<00:02:57.439> other<00:02:57.620> point<00:02:57.860> why<00:02:58.099> that<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.430> but<00:02:58.939> what<00:02:59.150> we

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
some other point why that is but what we

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.849 
some other point why that is but what we
love<00:02:59.659> is<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.019> fact<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.409> fans<00:03:00.650> have

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859
