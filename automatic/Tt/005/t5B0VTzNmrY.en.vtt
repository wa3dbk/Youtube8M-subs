00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 to make the stairs really 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.910
 durable need the following components 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.700
 silicone 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:16.549
 manganese magnesium 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.549
 have it all puts in a huge oven 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.770
 aluminum is also sent there 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.950
 for unloading the bottom I open the door 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.579
 the worker opens the oven in a protective screen 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.129
 for face 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.129
 because the temperature is 700 degrees 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.820
 after that the rest is added to the oven 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.100
 ingredients and heat turns them into liquid 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.780
 mass 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.769
 it flows out of the oven through the gutters and 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.610
 gets into the molds there is metal 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:58.680
 cools and freezes as a result 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.910
 7-liter bars are obtained length 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.550
 special hydraulic lift 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.220
 takes the bars out of shape and puts and in 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.360
 another mechanism 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.229
 at this stage you need to act 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.259
 Caution 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.259
 each timber weighs about 500 kilograms 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.720
 so if it falls may occur 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.240
 trouble 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.980
 now saw cut the size of the pieces 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.520
 which depends on the model of the future 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.590
 stairs 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.510
 lift carry hot parts 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.250
 on the press and the piston moves them to 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.660
 hole 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.890
 the matrix disk is ready for work 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.220
 piston pushes parts through 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.800
 hole in the matrix drives as a result 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:44.850
 peculiar rails of length 40 are obtained 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:47.100
 meters they move to the table where they 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.729
 permanently cooled and solidified 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.660
 and then our rails are cut 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.080
 circular saw 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.610
 On 6 meter moments the end of such 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.470
 fragment installs into the system 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.470
 clamps where straighten 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.560
 then the items are sent to the next 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.560
 mechanism 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.610
 at the end of the future legs of the stairs puts on 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.440
 peculiar plastic galoshes which 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.930
 protect of course not from moisture from 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.570
 slip also stick on the leg 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.130
 safety information 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.970
 then the ladder is literally collected 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.970
 step by step 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.460
 each of them places in the recess on 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.460
 legs and firmly fixes 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.890
 we have a future front 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.180
 stairs 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.290
 workers install diagonal 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.630
 struts then the ladder turns over a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.020
 steps fixes on the other hand it 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.020
 already harder 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.350
 now moving on to the rear end 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.350
 stairs 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.770
 to connect the two halves will require 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.770
 plastic part 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.269
 then mounts the mechanism for 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.269
 unfolding 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.450
 now our stairs are ready 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.180
 by the way in this factory do and 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.680
 sliding stairs for greater 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.990
 strengths they use 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.970
 cylindrical bars each 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.180
 comb with a special machine that 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.470
 narrows its ends 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.060
 the mechanism attaches to each end 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.060
 on aluminum ring 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.110
 thanks to this crossbar easily get up 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.180
 in the hole of the sliding stairs are special 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.320
 hydraulic devices inserts 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.320
 crossbar in the side 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.450
 finally rubber is installed on the leg 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.830
 laying thanks to them the ladder will 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.250
 stand up 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.620
 more precisely on the ground 3 stairs are also ready 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.990
 they will help you rise above the world 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.310
 only when this happens do not lose 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.310
 head and not confess
