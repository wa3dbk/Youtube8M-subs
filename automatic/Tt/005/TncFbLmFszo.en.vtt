00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.230
 good look at 2 5 is a company that is dedicated to doing that does not happen in 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.240
 Alternative fuels 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.980
 at this moment we are working on what it feels like and Celtic says gas 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.500
 we are working with natural gas with compressed natural gas and with gpl 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.519
 At this moment we are going to show you the operation of the equipment 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.119
 in a cummins engine 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.249
 This is a generator 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.119
 this is rather I'm designed for all are stationary engines 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.170
 as much as it is generator sets irrigation pump is just that it breaks 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.540
 and sky that are stationary engines 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.640
 percent the all-electronic equipment 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.960
 this was commanded by electronics which percent read all parameters 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.500
 originals which means that we do not make any vote change 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.740
 yes we do not put our equipment 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.870
 in which 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.540
 It contemplates voting the original parameters and in our program it 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.030
 We set the original parameters for the vote to be bovine 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.940
 factory the fat man with what pressure to spend on working and how his 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.289
 Olympic engine regime implications 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.480
 outside the area 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.150
 an advantage that the team has is that it can work with twenty recorded of aspe 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.210
 Pressure 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.479
 therefore we can place it in any part of what is 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.680
 argentina oo in the world for him 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.640
 by the low pressure that can work the equipment the operation of the dl 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.570
 wife motors behave much better because they lower the decibels 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.700
 of noise this 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.160
 the emanation of degas and also much cleaner the engine lasts longer and good 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.500
 we build also down to the block is the desire for 11 or 12 coal 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.830
 So much trouble based on one 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.690
 This device is ready to test with 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.790
 mario also says yes yes yes we have tested with biodiesel we have done 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.320
 has been given today with the fuels that you said today 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.720
 the device working perfectly 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.700
 good finally the theme of love that seals quillota interest are the team 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.180
 let's say it's good how much time can be done because the costs 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.780
 well actually work to be very fast 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.400
 the engine that this one is working for say six hours a day the 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.740
 motivation assured kemtuz 90 days in advance the team 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.119
 the man kind of facilities of this placement we go insituciÃ³n 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:16.129
 we put the equipment jim expand the team in real time that is very 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.169
 important because not all engines behave in a way
