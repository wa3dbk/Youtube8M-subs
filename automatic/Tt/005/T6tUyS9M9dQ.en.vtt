00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:33.019

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.410
 just the next no place 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.510
 in front 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.510
 the noodles cook even now 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.159
 a few minutes I will bio shelf 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.480
 pesto with tofu in extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:52.809
 ingredients and the solid lexan 33 percent 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.809
 preparation triggered basil 29 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.489
 basil 48 percent so in parentheses 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.500

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.250

 salt should the medium e330 yes what now 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.610
 has happened 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.340
 interesting, I found no traces of 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.679
 milk included 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.470
 yes, that was always a matter of discussion 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.119
 is now the products so what 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.910
 it sounds like milk can play 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:38.300
 and so on the vegan while he only 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:43.340
 means that the production facility too 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.500
 thing with milk created so interesting 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.310
 that something also usually box 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.170
 is available 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.830
 This reports a bit of usage and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.750
 Do not cook or reheat 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.590
 once opened with olive oil cover and 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.590
 store the refrigerator 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.830
 OK 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.780
 I'm curious she tastes few 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:23.150
 Girls still need noodles now 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:24.230
 meat noodles away so far I have now 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.000
 no spaghetti taken but 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.000
 fossils are not there right now 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.260
 I agree now I guess 1 2 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.680
 teaspoon from the pastor on that should 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.660
 actually enough teaspoons more 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.680
 made pure 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:49.660
 I think it was a little bit less 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.660
 made friends so try 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.360
 but we wanted to taste like that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.110
 Real person really do not know 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.880
 with the meeting I would think now 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.450
 that passers-by maybe at small 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.870
 No Madison I do not know but the ones 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.230
 consistency is okay maybe 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.030
 Crumbly from the parmesan and for what 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.030
 actually perfectly imitation 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:51.500
 europacup super after basil easy 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.380
 Yummy I had thought of the price now 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.000
 while a bit stabbed I 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.620
 Now if I do not think so 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.620
 but five euros were the bundestrainers 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.720
 Try vegetation they worth it 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.400
 really 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:13.430
 which I would like to try again 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:16.850
 to rent the imitation with tofu 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.109
 write down times and then when times 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.300
 our basil again a bit 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.780
 that has grown again 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.300
 imitate 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:33.890
 with office exactly how to do it but that 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:38.000
 is definitely delicious 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:43.450
 if you are too you stand or pesto 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.600
 just missed then that would be great 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.510
 so just a little as I said 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.800
 little bit of fire 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.720
 he thinks they are with these little ones 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:00.620
 product test the clutter tofu so this 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:05.890
 short mix for this project is 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.890
 still out and otherwise you are this time 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.539
