I'd<00:01:56.570> like<00:01:56.840> people<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.230> realize<00:01:57.740> where<00:01:57.980> their

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
I'd like people to realize where their

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.700 
I'd like people to realize where their
food<00:01:58.280> comes<00:01:58.460> from<00:01:58.730> because<00:01:58.880> increasingly

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
food comes from because increasingly

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.350 
food comes from because increasingly
over<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.800> years<00:02:00.950> has<00:02:01.100> been<00:02:01.250> this<00:02:01.400> gap<00:02:01.760> or<00:02:02.210> this

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
over the years has been this gap or this

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.630 
over the years has been this gap or this
lack<00:02:02.540> of<00:02:02.690> knowledge<00:02:02.870> between<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.640> consumer

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
lack of knowledge between the consumer

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.390 
lack of knowledge between the consumer
and<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.880> producer<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.660> if<00:02:06.050> we<00:02:06.200> can<00:02:06.440> inform

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
and the producer and if we can inform

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.250 
and the producer and if we can inform
the<00:02:07.610> consumer<00:02:07.820> about<00:02:08.330> how<00:02:08.660> we<00:02:08.720> produce<00:02:08.930> the

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
the consumer about how we produce the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.710 
the consumer about how we produce the
pigs<00:02:09.500> what<00:02:09.890> goes<00:02:10.130> on<00:02:10.340> in<00:02:10.550> getting<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:11.000> pork<00:02:11.390> to

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
pigs what goes on in getting the pork to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.270 
pigs what goes on in getting the pork to
the<00:02:11.750> table<00:02:12.230> as<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.440> where<00:02:12.560> they<00:02:12.770> can<00:02:12.950> make<00:02:13.100> more

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the table as it where they can make more

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.610 
the table as it where they can make more
informed<00:02:13.430> choices<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.540> think<00:02:15.260> it's<00:02:15.380> better<00:02:15.530> for

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
informed choices I think it's better for

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.110 
informed choices I think it's better for
the<00:02:15.800> British<00:02:16.070> pig<00:02:16.310> industry<00:02:16.460> cos<00:02:16.820> they<00:02:16.970> can

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
the British pig industry cos they can

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.300 
the British pig industry cos they can
see<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:18.050> farm<00:02:18.320> i<00:02:18.440> pixel<00:02:18.800> highest<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.220> as

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
see that we farm i pixel highest and as

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.830 
see that we farm i pixel highest and as
welfare<00:02:19.670> they're<00:02:19.880> now<00:02:20.060> continental

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
welfare they're now continental

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.040 
welfare they're now continental
neighbors

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.960 

I<00:02:24.080> think<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.010> privilege<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.460> be<00:02:25.490> at<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> farm

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
I think it's a privilege to be at a farm

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.790 
I think it's a privilege to be at a farm
like<00:02:26.240> this<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:27.020> be<00:02:27.110> able<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.260> look<00:02:27.380> after<00:02:27.530> those

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
like this to be able to look after those

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.460 
like this to be able to look after those
in<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:28.100> high<00:02:28.640> welfare<00:02:29.150> way<00:02:29.660> it's<00:02:30.050> a<00:02:30.110> chance<00:02:30.320> I

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
in a high welfare way it's a chance I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.990 
in a high welfare way it's a chance I
mean<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.680> find<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.010> that's<00:02:31.100> what<00:02:31.340> gets<00:02:31.730> me<00:02:31.790> up<00:02:31.910> in
