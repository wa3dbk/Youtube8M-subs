were<00:02:15.739> never<00:02:16.189> quite<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.790> same<00:02:16.819> for<00:02:17.239> me<00:02:17.390> after

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
were never quite the same for me after

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.020

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
things my world at home seemed kind of

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.030 
things my world at home seemed kind of
flat<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:23.170> decided<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.470> was<00:02:24.590> time<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.799> make<00:02:25.010> a

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
flat I decided it was time to make a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.149 
flat I decided it was time to make a
change<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:26.480> two<00:02:26.629> things<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.170> decided<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.920> I

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
change the two things I decided that I

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.280 
change the two things I decided that I
was<00:02:28.370> going<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.640> start<00:02:28.909> with<00:02:29.060> was<00:02:29.629> first<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.170> all

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
was going to start with was first of all

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.530 
was going to start with was first of all
creating<00:02:30.799> my<00:02:31.069> own<00:02:31.099> music<00:02:31.790> from<00:02:31.909> now<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.269> and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
creating my own music from now on and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.080 
creating my own music from now on and
second<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.500> all<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.860> was<00:02:34.310> going<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.760> capture

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
second of all I was going to capture

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.869 
second of all I was going to capture
some<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.019> exotic<00:02:36.560> beautiful<00:02:37.129> sound<00:02:37.519> that

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
some of that exotic beautiful sound that

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.869 
some of that exotic beautiful sound that
experienced<00:02:38.599> on<00:02:38.720> my<00:02:38.810> trip<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:40.370> course<00:02:40.459> making

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
experienced on my trip of course making

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.210 
experienced on my trip of course making
a<00:02:41.090> change<00:02:41.329> like<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.569> it's<00:02:41.840> no<00:02:41.959> small<00:02:42.260> feat<00:02:42.620> at

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
a change like that it's no small feat at

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.610 
a change like that it's no small feat at
the<00:02:43.430> time<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.909> actually<00:02:44.060> had<00:02:44.329> no<00:02:44.810> idea<00:02:45.260> how<00:02:45.590> I

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
the time I actually had no idea how I

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.190 
the time I actually had no idea how I
was<00:02:45.859> going<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.190> go<00:02:46.340> about<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.819> on<00:02:47.750> top<00:02:48.019> of<00:02:48.049> that

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
was going to go about it on top of that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.440 
was going to go about it on top of that
it<00:02:48.920> probably<00:02:49.159> meant<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.790> nobody<00:02:50.209> was<00:02:50.299> gonna

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
it probably meant that nobody was gonna

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.819 
it probably meant that nobody was gonna
want<00:02:50.629> to<00:02:50.750> play<00:02:50.900> with<00:02:51.049> me<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:51.260> quite<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.620> while

want to play with me for quite a while
at<00:02:52.220> least<00:02:52.459> until<00:02:52.909> I<00:02:53.030> developed<00:02:53.629> some<00:02:53.780> skill

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
at least until I developed some skill

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
people and I began to figure out how to

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.640 
people and I began to figure out how to
make<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.859> sound<00:03:43.160> that<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.489> was<00:03:43.699> after<00:03:43.879> and<00:03:44.650> at

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
make that sound that I was after and at

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.229 
make that sound that I was after and at
the<00:03:45.769> same<00:03:45.980> time<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.280> began<00:03:46.579> creating<00:03:47.090> my<00:03:47.209> own

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
the same time I began creating my own
