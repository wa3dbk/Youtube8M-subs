00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.459 

in<00:01:37.009> this<00:01:37.159> game<00:01:37.280> we<00:01:37.579> had<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.909> valley<00:01:38.119> on<00:01:38.469> pretty

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
in this game we had the valley on pretty

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.889 
in this game we had the valley on pretty
convincingly<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.700> I<00:01:40.789> think<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.240> we<00:01:41.749> maybe

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
convincingly and I think that we maybe

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.899 
convincingly and I think that we maybe
just<00:01:42.140> slacked<00:01:42.350> up<00:01:42.469> a<00:01:42.619> little<00:01:42.859> bit<00:01:43.009> shots<00:01:43.670> that

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
just slacked up a little bit shots that

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.120 
just slacked up a little bit shots that
usually<00:01:44.359> would<00:01:44.840> fall<00:01:45.109> in<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.469> form<00:01:45.740> for<00:01:45.920> us<00:01:45.979> in

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
usually would fall in and form for us in

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.730 
usually would fall in and form for us in
that<00:01:46.250> last<00:01:46.429> quarter<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.350> instead<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:48.469> getting

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
that last quarter and instead of getting

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.289 
that last quarter and instead of getting
our<00:01:48.829> heads<00:01:49.039> down<00:01:49.159> about<00:01:49.399> that<00:01:49.609> really<00:01:49.969> need<00:01:50.119> to

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
our heads down about that really need to

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.389 
our heads down about that really need to
just<00:01:50.829> remember<00:01:51.829> that<00:01:51.950> we<00:01:52.009> are<00:01:52.039> doing<00:01:52.250> the

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
just remember that we are doing the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.889 
just remember that we are doing the
right<00:01:52.520> things<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:52.969> I'll<00:01:53.209> keep<00:01:53.509> doing<00:01:53.689> them

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
right things and I'll keep doing them
