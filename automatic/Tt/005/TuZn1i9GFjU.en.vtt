00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.060
 you walk through the project by entering 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.700
 Pope by building understanding of the 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.700
 of the volumes you are gradually creating 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.680
 a new spatial relationship is not equal to 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.680
 light and with the city with the cel 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.980
 it's this project we'll order from the woods 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.809
 which already has already had an atelier and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.590
 bought a plot of land to make a new one 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.390
 tele 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.629
 so our idea is to make a volume 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 that was her office another 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.260
 volume was by volume a volume that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 was the service and then a shell of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.920
 structure that was the atelier 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.629
 her 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.089
 We joked about how it was 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.640
 reproduced from the city within the lot 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:00.000
 mega and the city entering into the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.159
 space, then each program is a 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.839
 small building we generate a 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.729
 Continuity opening parade 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.400
 total with the street in that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.130
 city from inside the studio but 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.850
 at the same time we create situations let's 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.799
 to say of is micro internal climates 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.290
 'in the courtyards that connect 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.650
 through these glasses with the program 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.650
 internally 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.140
 are closed volumes of concrete boxes 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.200
 Concrete concrete prisms very 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.700
 hermetic in a certain sense nÃ© duros 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.680
 very primitive in geometric forms 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.890
 establishes a limit in almost 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.590
 impenetrable in a certain sense volumes is 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.990
 occupying space and void spaces are 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.960
 the courtyards of the nations free spaces and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.420
 just do are talk to the sky 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.080
 open that patio that connects them to 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.090
 has a green wall and is a bench that 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.120
 from within a volume up to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.910
 the end of the other is born 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.149
 in the atelier of the courtyard and 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.740
 bcm of tcm but in each place he 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.270
 has a different character 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.030
 for example in the office and 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.220
 a place where you put a book on the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.840
 patio it is the place to sit in the studio 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.170
 is a place where she can put the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.170
 painting the wash tank 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.740
 was fundamental to her in the sense 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.240
 have a natural light to paint but a 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.070
 light that is thin 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.280
 there is no strong light so we made the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.810
 large facade looking south is who 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.870
 is the installation - them and create your 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.480
 valos is quite soft to try on the wall 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.150
 just a few other times it is that 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.010
 are not those of painting and are also a light 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.100
 diffuse but through another resource 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.120
 a little more to hurt the musical is 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.030
 on the stairs there is that light that goes down and goes 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.060
 washing the wall until low 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.540
 as they are volumes that are released if not 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.370
 have two tracks only snows and have 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.580
 they all have three faults 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.900
 this creates a natural ventilation a 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.900
 very cool cross motivation 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.020
 so the faÃ§ade is not done with the door 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.330
 the right double foot of iron that when 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.030
 completely closed 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.580
 the ball allowed to hear penetrate 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:37.860
 also enters a concrete 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:44.430
 glass iron is good lots of vegetation 1 to the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:52.290
 pebble rolled to the parallelepiped uepb 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:55.650
 in the entrance to down under it has a 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.200
 constant search for this relationship between 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.380
 man and nature, that's how it is 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.030
 he composes himself and there he has a sentence that 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.940
 I think it is very emblematic that our 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.319
 His first homes wanted to create a 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.260
 internal patio 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.900
 he jokes that he is filling the interior with 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.799
 exterior put the maximum of nature 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.930
 possible within this project to 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.650
 people are an important reference music 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.650
 A little bit, eh
