recording<00:00:17.789> at<00:00:17.880> different<00:00:18.270> times<00:00:18.480> because<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
recording at different times because I

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.580 
recording at different times because I
just<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.939> didn't<00:00:21.210> like<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> quality<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
just I didn't like the quality of the

other<00:00:23.039> Cyrus<00:00:23.580> fight<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.300> thought<00:00:25.080> I'd<00:00:25.199> go

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
other Cyrus fight so thought I'd go

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
crit because if he gets a credit that

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.090 
crit because if he gets a credit that
pearlies<00:02:11.670> out<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:13.650> course<00:02:13.860> does<00:02:14.069> have

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
pearlies out of here of course does have

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.979 
pearlies out of here of course does have
some<00:02:14.400> kind<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.730> berry<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.780> don't

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
some kind of a berry on it but I don't

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:16.940 
some kind of a berry on it but I don't
think<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.200> makes<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.440> much<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.860> difference

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
think it makes that much of a difference

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.190 
think it makes that much of a difference
anyway<00:02:17.489> because<00:02:17.520> one<00:02:18.000> more<00:02:18.180> body<00:02:18.390> slam<00:02:18.810> and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
anyway because one more body slam and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.660 
anyway because one more body slam and
it's<00:02:19.530> as<00:02:19.770> good<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.100> screwed<00:02:20.760> over<00:02:22.220> I'm<00:02:23.220> I'm

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
it's as good as screwed over I'm I'm

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.610 
it's as good as screwed over I'm I'm
sorry<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.330> about<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.690> good<00:02:24.840> as<00:02:24.930> dead<00:02:25.230> pretty

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
sorry it's about as good as dead pretty

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.090 
sorry it's about as good as dead pretty
much<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.880> much<00:02:27.300> shadow<00:02:27.750> for<00:02:28.230> me<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:28.800> think

much so much shadow for me and I think

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.570 
much so much shadow for me and I think
Chomper<00:02:29.519> can<00:02:29.700> take<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.880> hit<00:02:30.209> yeah<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.680> our

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.560 
earthquake knowing that it will probably
knock<00:02:34.950> out<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> stun<00:02:35.640> tank<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> know<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.510> a

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
knock out the stun tank and I know it a

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.020 
knock out the stun tank and I know it a
bit<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> /<00:02:36.959> ugly<00:02:37.290> either<00:02:37.470> way<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:38.760> I'm<00:02:38.820> sorry

if<00:02:39.150> you've<00:02:39.300> already<00:02:39.420> seen<00:02:39.690> part<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.380> but

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
if you've already seen part of this but

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.360 
if you've already seen part of this but
I<00:02:41.900> think<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.440> was<00:02:43.620> about<00:02:43.800> as<00:02:43.950> close<00:02:44.160> as

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
I think that this was about as close as

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.630 
I think that this was about as close as
I<00:02:44.489> could<00:02:44.550> get<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:46.400> yeah<00:02:47.400> I'm<00:02:47.580> pretty

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
I could get to it so yeah I'm pretty

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.220 
I could get to it so yeah I'm pretty
sure<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.120> its<00:02:48.239> head<00:02:48.360> takes<00:02:48.600> does<00:02:48.900> probably

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
sure that its head takes does probably

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.890 
sure that its head takes does probably
take<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.739> gun<00:02:50.100> tank<00:02:50.340> out<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.390> may<00:02:51.630> take

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
take this gun tank out and it may take

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.250

somewhat helpful okay so the munchlax

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.080 
somewhat helpful okay so the munchlax
goes<00:03:19.560> down<00:03:19.860> which<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.280> really<00:03:20.519> nice<00:03:21.030> because

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
goes down which is really nice because

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.530 
goes down which is really nice because

now we stand somewhat of a fighting
chance

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
chance

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.930 
chance
since<00:03:25.950> out<00:03:26.100> go<00:03:26.400> back<00:03:28.190> I'm<00:03:29.190> probably<00:03:29.549> like<00:03:29.760> I'm

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
since out go back I'm probably like I'm

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.970 
since out go back I'm probably like I'm
gonna<00:03:30.209> let<00:03:30.390> his<00:03:30.600> staraptor<00:03:30.900> take<00:03:31.500> care<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.829> the

gonna let his staraptor take care of the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.789 
gonna let his staraptor take care of the
golbat<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:34.459> that's<00:03:35.780> that's<00:03:36.780> life<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.590> know

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
golbat and that's that's life you know

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:48.300 
golbat and that's that's life you know
good<00:03:38.100> who<00:03:38.370> knows

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.020 

I'm<00:03:48.520> going<00:03:49.210> to<00:03:49.570> probably<00:03:49.900> go<00:03:50.380> with<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:51.030> another

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
I'm going to probably go with a another

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.680 
I'm going to probably go with a another
EQ<00:03:53.130> just<00:03:54.130> to<00:03:54.280> get<00:03:54.460> that<00:03:54.610> scon<00:03:55.000> tank<00:03:55.270> out<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.480> the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
EQ just to get that scon tank out of the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.590 
EQ just to get that scon tank out of the
way<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.370> course<00:03:57.580> that's<00:03:57.760> gonna<00:03:57.970> use<00:03:58.300> air

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
way and of course that's gonna use air

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.510 
way and of course that's gonna use air
cutter<00:03:58.990> and<00:03:59.380> it<00:03:59.500> really<00:04:00.010> doesn't<00:04:00.250> do<00:04:00.430> that

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
cutter and it really doesn't do that

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.760 
cutter and it really doesn't do that
much<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.760> stop<00:04:01.210> there<00:04:01.690> now<00:04:01.810> chopper<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.590> might

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
much to stop there now chopper it might

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.260 
much to stop there now chopper it might
be<00:04:02.890> something<00:04:03.100> too<00:04:03.430> now<00:04:03.670> I<00:04:03.700> didn't<00:04:03.970> want<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.150> do

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
be something too now I didn't want to do

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.590 
be something too now I didn't want to do
that<00:04:04.300> much<00:04:05.190> star<00:04:06.190> pieces<00:04:06.520> take<00:04:06.850> down<00:04:07.120> on<00:04:07.450> the

that much star pieces take down on the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.540 
that much star pieces take down on the
spun<00:04:07.900> tank<00:04:08.170> which<00:04:08.350> really<00:04:08.620> weakens<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.310> makes

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
spun tank which really weakens it makes

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.740 
spun tank which really weakens it makes
it<00:04:09.760> easy<00:04:10.390> for<00:04:10.540> me<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.900> just<00:04:11.050> KO<00:04:12.480> even<00:04:13.480> though<00:04:13.600> it

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
it easy for me to just KO even though it

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.120 
it easy for me to just KO even though it
hits<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.020> with<00:04:14.140> Rico<00:04:14.500> which<00:04:14.650> probably<00:04:14.890> wasn't

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
hits it with Rico which probably wasn't

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.390

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.050 
the main purpose of this I know I
probably<00:04:26.320> could<00:04:26.650> have<00:04:26.740> used<00:04:26.920> dig<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.880> been
