of<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.789> only<00:00:24.090> got<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.420> see<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.810> character

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
of it you only got to see one character

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
of it you only got to see one character
inside<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.949> entire<00:00:26.250> trailer<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.849> I'm

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
inside the entire trailer and I'm

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.279 
inside the entire trailer and I'm

of noragami crispy animation we got this
current<00:00:38.219> season<00:00:38.399> now<00:00:39.180> judging<00:00:39.960> how<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
current season now judging how this is a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.350 
current season now judging how this is a
preview<00:00:40.890> teaser<00:00:41.309> trailer<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> animation

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
preview teaser trailer the animation

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
preview teaser trailer the animation
could<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.629> exaggerated<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.920> pretty

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
could be exaggerated a little bit pretty

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.740 
could be exaggerated a little bit pretty
much<00:00:44.579> how<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.730> production<00:00:45.270> company<00:00:45.420> probably

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
much how the production company probably

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.940 
much how the production company probably
will<00:00:45.960> make<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> animations<00:00:46.620> best<00:00:46.800> as

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
will make the animations best as

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.639 
will make the animations best as
possible<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:48.000> trailer<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.930> probably<00:00:49.289> lack

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
possible and a trailer and probably lack

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.830 
possible and a trailer and probably lack
inside<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> actual<00:00:50.700> anime<00:00:51.090> series<00:00:51.420> but

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
inside of the actual anime series but

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450 
inside of the actual anime series but
either<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.469> think<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:53.129> serious

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
either way I think these serious

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.830 
either way I think these serious
probably<00:00:53.850> will<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> very<00:00:54.480> interesting

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
probably will be a very interesting

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.689 
probably will be a very interesting
highlight<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.800> year<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> saw
