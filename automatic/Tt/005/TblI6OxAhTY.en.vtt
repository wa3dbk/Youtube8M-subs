00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.740
 continued 6 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.279
 these three 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.140
 then comes reassured 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.610
 ouattara to note the little finger 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.610
 on the square 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 then 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.630
 yes it's a shame 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.270
 nice d 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.340
 in this tournament 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.340
 three times 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 the low-vernet 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 to be easier if we sing we will always be 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.770
 11 26 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.770
 this is the 1 challenge for 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.990
 she is the muse 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.929
 - he saws 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.779
 the world is here 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.249
 are you going to secret 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.159
 these absences 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.159
 pursuit 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.849
 that's it 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.879
 7 summer 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.929
 also the pillars 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.929
 wish it 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.809
 then reassured 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.359
 we launch 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:07.309
 we understand very well the situation 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.719
 it leaves this 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.819
 it was pretty simple 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.819
 am even more proud 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.759
 I am proud 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.620
 I always take three times 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.900
 and then I'm part of the genre as it goes three times 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.900
 twice to complicate once 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.219
 towards the end 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.219
 it's like that 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.300
 designed on a title 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.610
 France 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.229
 and so that smut in sudan 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.229
 in general to communion at Mass 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.889
 he then specifies Swiss 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.759
 a fair to do 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.759
 to have often so 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.919
 then it's the second that comes 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.900
 composed of 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.419
 flagship measurement 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.379
 same tone 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.379
 they were heading 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:15.629
 gilles 25 25 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.380
