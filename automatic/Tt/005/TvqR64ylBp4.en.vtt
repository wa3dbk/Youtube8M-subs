00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.500
- THIS SEEMS SO WEIRD,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.466
'CAUSE THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE,

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.066
WE WERE DOING
THIS EXACT SAME THING.

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.533
WE WERE SAYING GOOD-BYE TO YOU,
AND--

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.633
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:09.100
SO--SO I'LL SEE YOU
IN A COUPLE YEARS.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.100
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.100
[laughter]

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.033
- I MEAN, REALLY, THIS IS
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ON,

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.133
IS, WE WERE SAYING GOOD-BYE,

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.133
AND NOW IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.700
- IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.
- BUT THIS REALLY IS--

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.533
'CAUSE I WATCHED YOU TALK
ABOUT THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE AND--

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.700
- RIGHT.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.766
- BUT IF THEY COME BACK TO YOU
AND SAY, "HEY"--

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.333
- NO, NO, THIS--
NO, THIS TIME IT'S MY--

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.700
LAST TIME, I WAS TOLD.
THIS TIME I WAS ASKED.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.066
- UH-HUH, OKAY.
- SO THAT'S A BIT DIFFERENT.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.333
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.333
- AND HOW IS IT FOR YOU?

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.333
BECAUSE NEXT WEEK
IS YOUR FINAL WEEK, RIGHT?

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.333
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.333
WELL, I HIT THE ROAD.

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.166
I FINISH ON THURSDAY,
AND I HIT THE ROAD FRIDAY.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.033
I GOT A BUNCH
OF ONE-NIGHTERS AND...

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:40.066
I MEAN, I LIKE DOING STAND-UP.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.433
WELL, SO DO YOU, YOU KNOW.
- YEAH.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.266
- THAT'S THE REAL--
THAT'S FUN.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.266
- SO YOU'LL BE DOING
THE SAME THING.

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.666
YOU JUST WON'T BE
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE.

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.100
YOU'LL BE DOING
A LONG MONOLOGUE EVERY NIGHT.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.266
- BUT I CAN GO OUT
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT,

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.400
WHICH I HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO DO.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.400
- RIGHT.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.733
- NO, I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT
IN 22 YEARS

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.733
ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.933
- YEAH.
- IT'S LIKE, "OOH."

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.200
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING WRONG.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.400
OH, WOW...
- YEAH.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.666
- SO YOU HAVE TO GO HOME AND
WRITE JOKES EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.400
- YEAH, WELL,
AND YOU LOVE THAT.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.166
- I DO LIKE IT.
IT IS GREAT FUN.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.433
IT IS GOOD FUN.
- AND YOU LIKE JIMMY FALLON.

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.033
AND I THINK HE'S GONNA DO GREAT.
DON'T YOU?

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.300
- YOU KNOW,
I THINK HE'LL DO TERRIFIC

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.466
BECAUSE, I MEAN, THERE REALLY IS
A TRUE GENERATION GAP.

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.066
I MEAN, HE'S 23 YEARS
YOUNGER THAN I AM.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.066
- MM-HMM.

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.233
- AND, YOU KNOW,
HE KNOWS THE MUSIC.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:18.566
HE KNOW--LIKE I SAY,
WHEN I SEE HIM DO A DANCE NUMBER

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.766
WITH JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE,
IT'S LIKE,

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.333
"WELL, I CAN'T DO THAT.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.333
I GET IT."

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.333
- YEAH.
- SO YOU JUST SORT OF...

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.433
THIS SEEMS ABOUT THE RIGHT--

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:25.866
I COME FROM NEW ENGLAND.

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.233
YOU DON'T RETIRE AT 56.

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.066
WHAT, ARE YOU BETTER THAN ME?
WHAT, YOU DON'T WORK NO MORE?

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.600
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLIN' ME?
HUH?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.733
WHAT, YOU DON'T GOT TO WORK
NO MORE

00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:32.733
'CAUSE YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME?

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:36.066
SO WE'RE A 63, 64--
THAT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT AGE.

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.633
- AND NOW,
WILL YOU WATCH THE SHOW?

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:38.933
WILL IT BE--
- OH, SURE, I ENJOY THE SHOW.

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:39.933
- YOU WILL.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.033
DO YOU WATCH
OTHER LATE NIGHT SHOWS?

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.633
- I WATCH YOUR SHOW.
I WATCH OTHER LATE--

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:45.066
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO WATCH
OTHER LATE NIGHT SHOWS

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.200
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO FIND OUT--

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.900
LIKE, WE LIVE IN AN ERA NOW
WITH BLOGGING...

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.866
NOBODY EVER HAPPENS TO DO
THE SAME JOKE BY ACCIDENT.

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.833
YOU'VE ALWAYS STOLEN THE JOKE.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:55.900
- MM-HMM.
- YOU KNOW.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.666
I MEAN, IF YOU DO
CHRIS CHRISTIE'S FAT JOKE--

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.266
"HEY, A GUY
DID THAT TWO WEEKS AGO.

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.733
YOU STOLE THAT JOKE."
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:02.866
SO YOU TRY TO WATCH
THE OTHER SHOWS.

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:03.866
OKAY, THAT'S--

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:05.433
MM, THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
CRAIG FERGUSON DID.

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:06.433
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:07.533
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
DAVE DID.

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:08.533
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:10.300
SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE AWARE
OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.833
- RIGHT, AND NOW,
HOW ARE YOU GONNA FEEL

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:12.833
IF YOU GO OUT AND DO STAND-UP

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:14.033
AND YOU'RE WATCHING THE SHOWS
AT--

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.700
ARE YOU GONNA PAY ATTENTION
TO THAT AS MUCH,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.566
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA WRITE
YOUR JOKES AND DO YOUR JOKES?

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:19.566
- OH, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:21.833
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU DO LATE NIGHT TV,

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:24.133
YOU DO DIFFERENT JOKES
IN THE SAME PLACE EVERY NIGHT.

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:25.133
- MM-HMM.

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:26.433
- WHEN YOU'RE ON THE ROAD
AS A COMEDIAN,

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:28.200
YOU DO THE SAME JOKES IN
A DIFFERENT PLACE EVERY NIGHT.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.366
- YEAH, RIGHT.

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:30.766
- AND THE FUN THING--
AND YOU KNOW THIS--

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:32.300
'CAUSE YOU COME OUT HERE
AND YOU TELL A JOKE,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.833
AND THEN YOU GO HOME,
AND YOU GO, "AH.

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:36.533
YOU KNOW, THAT JOKE WAS GOOD,
BUT I COULD'VE ADDED THIS ON."

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:37.833
SO WHEN YOU WORK ON THE ROAD,

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:39.166
MONDAY NIGHT,
YOU CAN DO THE JOKE.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:40.533
TUESDAY, YOU CAN WORK ON IT.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:41.533
WEDNESDAY, YOU CAN--

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:42.600
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN CHANGE IT,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.433
AND YOU CAN TAKE WHAT WAS
A THREE- OR FOUR-SECOND JOKE

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:47.266
AND PULL IT OUT AND MAKE IT
BREATHE A LITTLE BIT,

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:48.433
SO IT'LL BE FUN.

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:50.266
- AND PEOPLE--I MEAN,
I THINK PEOPLE WILL BE THRILLED

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:54.366
THAT YOU NOW ARE REALLY ABLE
TO TRAVEL AND DO THOSE GIGS

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:55.533
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:57.733
AND THEY GET TO STILL SEE YOU
COMING TO THEM.

00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:00.166
- YEAH, I MEAN, I LIKE--
I WAS ALWAYS A ROAD COMIC.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:02.166
THAT'S WHAT I--
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS MY DAY JOB.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:04.600
SO IT WAS LIKE,
"OH, IT JUST LASTED 23 YEARS."

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600
- IT'S AMAZING.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.233
I MET JAY--
I MET JAY THE FIRST TIME

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.433
IN SAN FRANCISCO
AT THE BOARDING HOUSE.

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:11.933
- THE BOARDING HOUSE,
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH.

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:13.033
- AND WE WERE DOING STAND-UP,

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:14.033
AND I WAS BRAND-NEW,

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:15.900
AND IT WAS A BIG DEAL THAT
I WAS WORKING WITH JAY LENO

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.966
AND THAT I WAS ON THE POSTER
WITH HIM.

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:20.666
AND HE SIGNED IT,
"SEE YOU AT THE TOP."

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:21.800
- OH, THERE YOU GO.
- AND IT WAS THE--

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.233
IT MADE ME FEEL SO, LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD.

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:24.533
HE THINKS I'M GONNA MAKE IT
TO THE TOP."

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:26.433
- WELL, THE TOP CLOSED IN 1984.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.133
IT WAS A--IT WAS A--

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:31.433
IT WAS A STRIP JOINT
RIGHT OFF OF BROAD STREET.

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:33.200
BUT, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.766
BUT, SEE, IT WORKED OUT.
- YEAH, IT WORKED OUT.

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:36.533
- 'CAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE REALLY FUNNY,

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:38.133
BECAUSE COMEDY IS COMEDY.

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.933
LIKE, I ALWAYS HATED THE TERM
"COMEDIENNE."

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:42.733
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID,
THEY HAD COMEDIANS

00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:44.466
AND "COMEDIENNES,"
WHICH WERE FEMALE.

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:45.933
THAT WAS--
COMEDY IS COMEDY.

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:47.900
FUNNY IS FUNNY,
AND THAT'S--

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.900
SO THAT'S WHAT I LIKE.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.700
I ALWAYS CALLED FEMALE LIZARDS
"CHAMELE-ENNES" BECAUSE--

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.000
- "CHAMELE-ENNE?"
- YEAH.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.466
BECAUSE THEY WERE FEMALE.
