removed we can do several of these at a
time<00:01:26.420> effectively<00:01:27.420> removing<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.409> know

time effectively removing you know
several<00:01:28.799> centimeters<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> lining<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.270> the

several centimeters of the lining of the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
esophagus the procedure goes through the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.440 
esophagus the procedure goes through the
endoscopic<00:01:34.290> mucosal<00:01:35.130> layer<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
endoscopic mucosal layer as well as the

submucosal layer and the specimen that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.050 
submucosal layer and the specimen that
is<00:01:39.810> removed<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.619> sent<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.070> pathologist<00:01:41.400> for

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
is removed is sent to a pathologist for

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630 
is removed is sent to a pathologist for
interpretation<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.619> you're<00:01:44.280> able<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
interpretation so you're able to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.780 
interpretation so you're able to
actually<00:01:44.909> obtain<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.630> pathologic<00:01:46.560> report<00:01:47.490> of

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
actually obtain a pathologic report of

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.179 
actually obtain a pathologic report of
what<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.810> removed<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.710> what<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.009> patient

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
what was removed and what the patient

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.520 
what was removed and what the patient
had<00:01:50.670> which<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.270> an<00:01:51.689> advantage<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.409> this

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
had which is an advantage of this

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.120 
had which is an advantage of this
procedure<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.840> best<00:01:55.200> data<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.890> from

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
procedure and the best data we have from

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.859 
procedure and the best data we have from
this<00:01:56.280> has<00:01:56.460> actually<00:01:56.850> been<00:01:57.030> done<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.420> Germany

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
this has actually been done in Germany

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.240 
this has actually been done in Germany
where<00:01:58.079> they've<00:01:58.380> been<00:01:58.409> doing<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> procedure

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
where they've been doing the procedure

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.179 
where they've been doing the procedure
for<00:02:00.030> several<00:02:00.360> years<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.110> patients<00:02:02.100> who

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
for several years now and patients who

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.010 
for several years now and patients who
underwent<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.790> procedure<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.450> early

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
underwent this procedure for early

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.530 
underwent this procedure for early
intracoastal<00:02:04.740> cancer<00:02:05.189> were<00:02:05.729> noted<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.329> have

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
intracoastal cancer were noted to have

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.240 
intracoastal cancer were noted to have
the<00:02:06.990> same<00:02:07.640> age<00:02:08.640> adjusted<00:02:09.500> survival<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.739> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the same age adjusted survival as the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
the same age adjusted survival as the
average<00:02:11.700> German<00:02:12.000> population<00:02:12.900> over<00:02:13.200> a

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
average German population over a

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.470 
average German population over a
five<00:02:13.500> year<00:02:13.800> period<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.490> it's<00:02:14.640> quite<00:02:14.850> effective
