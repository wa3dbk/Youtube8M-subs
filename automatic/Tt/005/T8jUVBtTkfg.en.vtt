00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
want to put it on your frame so I'm just

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.190 
want to put it on your frame so I'm just

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
going to start with looping this around

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:56.740 
going to start with looping this around
the<00:03:35.290> frame<00:03:35.530> here

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.509 

well<00:03:57.750> we'll<00:03:58.019> pick<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.379> out<00:03:58.470> tonight<00:03:58.709> when<00:03:59.400> it

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
well we'll pick it out tonight when it

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.399 
well we'll pick it out tonight when it
gets<00:03:59.640> dark<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.120> see<00:04:00.870> what<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.049> looks<00:04:01.170> like<00:04:01.260> in

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
gets dark and see what it looks like in

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:12.740 
gets dark and see what it looks like in
the<00:04:01.470> dark<00:04:10.489> side<00:04:11.489> visibility<00:04:12.209> when<00:04:12.569> you're

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
the dark side visibility when you're

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.009 
the dark side visibility when you're
riding<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.349> bicycle<00:04:13.650> at<00:04:14.069> night<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.549> so

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
riding a bicycle at night is so

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.539 
riding a bicycle at night is so
incredibly<00:04:16.019> important<00:04:16.590> from<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.190> studies

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
incredibly important from the studies

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.099 
incredibly important from the studies
I've<00:04:17.669> seen<00:04:18.060> you're<00:04:18.389> more<00:04:18.539> likely<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.930> get<00:04:18.989> hit

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
I've seen you're more likely to get hit

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.659 
I've seen you're more likely to get hit
from<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.350> side<00:04:19.590> than<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.070> are<00:04:20.190> from<00:04:20.340> behind

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
from the side than you are from behind

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.749 
from the side than you are from behind
so<00:04:21.660> when<00:04:22.139> I<00:04:22.169> put<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.530> light<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:23.009> the<00:04:23.520> first

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
so when I put this light on the first

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.189 
so when I put this light on the first
day<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:23.880> notice<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.210> it's<00:04:24.449> nice<00:04:24.660> it's<00:04:25.050> a

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
day I notice is it's nice it's a

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.439 
day I notice is it's nice it's a
good-looking<00:04:25.500> light<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.460> bright<00:04:26.850> people

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
good-looking light it's bright people

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.529 
good-looking light it's bright people
can<00:04:27.720> see<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.250> is<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.639> coolest<00:04:29.910> light<00:04:30.360> out

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
can see you is it the coolest light out

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:31.550 
can see you is it the coolest light out
there<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:30.750> don't<00:04:30.900> know<00:04:31.080> there's<00:04:31.289> so<00:04:31.440> many

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
there I don't know there's so many

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.320 
there I don't know there's so many
different<00:04:31.800> site<00:04:32.190> visibility<00:04:32.550> lights<00:04:33.060> out

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
different site visibility lights out

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.990 
different site visibility lights out
there<00:04:33.539> now<00:04:33.720> that<00:04:34.130> it's<00:04:35.130> hard<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.430> say<00:04:35.610> but<00:04:35.669> for

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
there now that it's hard to say but for

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.029 
there now that it's hard to say but for
the<00:04:36.060> price<00:04:36.300> tag<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.870> haven't<00:04:37.169> seen<00:04:37.350> too<00:04:37.710> many<00:04:37.830> of

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
the price tag I haven't seen too many of

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.620 
the price tag I haven't seen too many of
them<00:04:38.130> in<00:04:38.729> fact<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:38.970> don't<00:04:39.060> think<00:04:39.150> I've<00:04:39.300> seen<00:04:39.449> any

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
them in fact I don't think I've seen any

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.870 
them in fact I don't think I've seen any
of<00:04:39.750> them<00:04:39.810> in<00:04:39.990> this<00:04:40.080> price<00:04:40.350> range<00:04:40.500> for<00:04:41.190> about<00:04:41.400> 25

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
of them in this price range for about 25

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.400 
of them in this price range for about 25
bucks<00:04:42.150> you're<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:42.930> there<00:04:43.110> with<00:04:43.139> side

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
bucks you're in there with side

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.290 
bucks you're in there with side
visibility<00:04:44.039> and<00:04:44.220> so<00:04:44.760> if<00:04:44.850> you're<00:04:44.940> on<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.060> budget

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
visibility and so if you're on a budget

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.390 
visibility and so if you're on a budget
like<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.840> am<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:46.979> might<00:04:47.100> be<00:04:47.160> worth

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
like I am this one might be worth

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.580 
like I am this one might be worth
looking<00:04:47.460> at<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.630> packaging<00:04:49.110> says<00:04:49.380> it's

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
looking at the packaging says it's

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.320 
looking at the packaging says it's
durable<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.430> works<00:04:50.639> well<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.090> rain

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
durable and it works well on the rain

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.689 
durable and it works well on the rain
and<00:04:51.690> such<00:04:51.960> I'm<00:04:52.650> not<00:04:52.949> sure<00:04:53.160> if<00:04:53.280> that's<00:04:53.400> true<00:04:53.669> or

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
and such I'm not sure if that's true or

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.360 
and such I'm not sure if that's true or
not<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:54.330> haven't<00:04:55.259> written<00:04:55.470> my<00:04:55.740> bike<00:04:56.009> in<00:04:56.310> the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
not I haven't written my bike in the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.490 
not I haven't written my bike in the
rain<00:04:56.849> with<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.419> slight<00:04:57.690> yet<00:04:57.960> but<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:58.440> will

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
rain with the slight yet but I will

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.320 
rain with the slight yet but I will
likely<00:04:59.099> do<00:04:59.340> that<00:04:59.520> over<00:04:59.759> the<00:04:59.849> next<00:04:59.910> few<00:05:00.180> months

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
likely do that over the next few months

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.120 
likely do that over the next few months
and<00:05:00.630> after<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:01.020> do<00:05:01.080> so<00:05:01.349> i'll<00:05:01.470> probably<00:05:01.680> post<00:05:01.919> a

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
and after I do so i'll probably post a
