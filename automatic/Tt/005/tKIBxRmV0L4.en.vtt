00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
first off we're taking some really big

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.700 
first off we're taking some really big
changes<00:00:17.060> to<00:00:17.090> Annie<00:00:17.420> what<00:00:18.140> are<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.290> goals<00:00:18.500> with

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
changes to Annie what are the goals with

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.950 
changes to Annie what are the goals with
that<00:00:18.860> whole<00:00:19.099> overhaul<00:00:19.610> Annie<00:00:20.210> at<00:00:20.420> level<00:00:20.630> 6<00:00:20.840> is

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
that whole overhaul Annie at level 6 is

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.210 
that whole overhaul Annie at level 6 is
probably<00:00:21.290> one<00:00:21.529> of<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.680> biggest<00:00:21.800> nightmares

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
probably one of the biggest nightmares

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.920 
probably one of the biggest nightmares
in<00:00:22.369> our<00:00:22.490> entire<00:00:22.730> game<00:00:23.029> pretty<00:00:23.390> much<00:00:23.599> from

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
in our entire game pretty much from

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.540 
in our entire game pretty much from
level<00:00:24.230> 6<00:00:24.439> on<00:00:24.650> she<00:00:24.860> gets<00:00:25.009> weaker<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:25.460> weaker

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
level 6 on she gets weaker and weaker

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.010 
level 6 on she gets weaker and weaker
towards<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.119> end<00:00:26.270> of<00:00:26.329> the<00:00:26.390> game<00:00:26.450> until<00:00:26.720> she<00:00:26.989> is

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
towards the end of the game until she is

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.530 
towards the end of the game until she is
regulated<00:00:27.770> into<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.009> really<00:00:28.460> stunned<00:00:28.820> bot<00:00:29.029> so

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
regulated into a really stunned bot so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.720 
regulated into a really stunned bot so
what<00:00:30.020> we<00:00:30.110> did<00:00:30.230> is<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:30.860> typical<00:00:31.160> want<00:00:31.579> to<00:00:31.640> make

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
what we did is the typical want to make

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.160 
what we did is the typical want to make
it<00:00:31.849> better<00:00:31.970> late-game<00:00:32.300> kind<00:00:32.780> of<00:00:32.870> changes

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
it better late-game kind of changes

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.660 
it better late-game kind of changes
which<00:00:33.320> is<00:00:33.440> lower<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:33.800> bases<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.190> little<00:00:34.489> bit

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
which is lower the bases a little bit

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.360 
which is lower the bases a little bit
and<00:00:34.820> up<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.149> ap<00:00:35.420> ratios<00:00:35.930> annie<00:00:36.739> has<00:00:36.920> really

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
and up to ap ratios annie has really

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.370 
and up to ap ratios annie has really
outdated<00:00:37.640> mana<00:00:38.000> cost<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:38.660> we<00:00:38.960> just<00:00:39.079> wanted<00:00:39.290> to

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
outdated mana cost so we just wanted to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.810 
outdated mana cost so we just wanted to
take<00:00:39.500> those<00:00:39.680> mana<00:00:39.860> costs<00:00:40.130> down<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:40.550> that<00:00:40.579> if

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
take those mana costs down so that if

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.729 
take those mana costs down so that if
you<00:00:41.000> do<00:00:41.239> burst<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:41.899> manage<00:00:42.230> to<00:00:42.320> live<00:00:42.500> through

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
you do burst and manage to live through

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:43.779 
you do burst and manage to live through
some<00:00:42.920> of<00:00:43.039> the<00:00:43.100> fight<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.399> can<00:00:43.550> contribute

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
some of the fight and can contribute

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.729 
some of the fight and can contribute
longer<00:00:44.359> you're<00:00:44.780> actually<00:00:44.929> rewarded<00:00:45.260> by<00:00:45.710> being

longer you're actually rewarded by being

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.770 
longer you're actually rewarded by being
able<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:46.370> continue<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:47.059> pump<00:00:47.210> out<00:00:47.390> damaged

way<00:01:15.320> too<00:01:15.380> much<00:01:15.470> damage<00:01:15.829> so<00:01:16.220> we<00:01:16.310> have<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.579> we

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
way too much damage so we have to we

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.580 
way too much damage so we have to we
have<00:01:17.149> to<00:01:17.270> take<00:01:17.450> those<00:01:17.570> ap<00:01:17.869> ratios<00:01:18.200> down<00:01:18.409> there

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
have to take those ap ratios down there

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.260 
have to take those ap ratios down there
really<00:01:18.770> overpowered<00:01:19.250> right<00:01:19.430> now<00:01:19.579> a<00:01:19.820> base

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
really overpowered right now a base

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.940 
really overpowered right now a base
damage<00:01:20.509> on<00:01:20.750> head<00:01:20.899> but<00:01:21.079> is<00:01:21.200> harshly<00:01:21.799> a

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
damage on head but is harshly a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.440 
damage on head but is harshly a
contributing<00:01:22.399> factor<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.790> some<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.180> early

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450

contributing factor to some of the early
game<00:01:23.600> burst<00:01:23.840> he<00:01:23.990> has<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:24.740> we<00:01:24.860> need<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.100> also

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
game burst he has so we need to also

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:26.789 
game burst he has so we need to also
take<00:01:25.579> a<00:01:25.640> little<00:01:25.850> on<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.090> base<00:01:26.329> there

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
take a little on the base there

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.990 
take a little on the base there
originally<00:01:27.799> Alistair<00:01:28.310> was<00:01:28.399> really<00:01:28.700> an

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.810 
originally Alistair was really an
initiation<00:01:29.479> CC<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.110> support<00:01:30.500> tank<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:30.979> while

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
initiation CC and support tank and while

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.980 
initiation CC and support tank and while
he's<00:01:31.939> thought<00:01:32.119> some<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.570> flavor<00:01:32.689> now

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
he's thought some of that flavor now

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.090 
he's thought some of that flavor now
that<00:01:33.140> he<00:01:33.200> actually<00:01:33.350> has<00:01:33.619> some<00:01:33.829> meaningful

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
that he actually has some meaningful

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.010 
that he actually has some meaningful
damage<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.640> damage<00:01:34.729> scaling<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.810> health

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
damage and damage scaling that health

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.219 
damage and damage scaling that health
per<00:01:36.200> level<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:37.090> unnecessary<00:01:38.090> power<00:01:38.420> that's

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
per level is unnecessary power that's

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.690 
per level is unnecessary power that's
not<00:01:39.350> providing<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.740> lot<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.979> gameplay<00:01:40.310> for<00:01:40.549> him

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
not providing a lot of gameplay for him

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.520 
not providing a lot of gameplay for him
so<00:01:41.000> we're<00:01:41.390> going<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.570> take<00:01:41.750> that<00:01:41.899> down<00:01:42.110> more<00:01:42.380> to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
so we're going to take that down more to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.550 
so we're going to take that down more to
what<00:01:42.740> you'd<00:01:42.890> see<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.189> standard<00:01:43.549> tank<00:01:43.729> a

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
what you'd see in a standard tank a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.810 
what you'd see in a standard tank a
relic<00:01:45.560> has<00:01:45.619> also<00:01:45.860> been<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.130> really<00:01:46.340> common

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
relic has also been a really common

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.940 
relic has also been a really common
topic<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:47.630> discussion<00:01:47.780> what<00:01:48.619> are<00:01:48.680> we<00:01:48.710> changing

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
topic of discussion what are we changing

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.520 
topic of discussion what are we changing
on<00:01:49.189> her<00:01:49.430> exactly<00:01:49.880> since<00:01:50.780> she<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.140> still<00:01:51.350> highly

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
on her exactly since she is still highly

on her exactly since she is still highly
sustainable<00:01:51.859> we're<00:01:52.729> going<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.000> push<00:01:53.210> some<00:01:53.420> of

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
sustainable we're going to push some of

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.969 
sustainable we're going to push some of
the<00:01:53.570> damage<00:01:53.689> on<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.079> queue<00:01:54.380> down<00:01:54.590> which<00:01:54.950> is

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
the damage on the queue down which is

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.469 
the damage on the queue down which is
contributing<00:01:55.609> to<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.729> lot<00:01:55.939> of<00:01:56.060> her<00:01:56.119> up<00:01:56.270> for<00:01:56.420> a

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
contributing to a lot of her up for a

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.480 
contributing to a lot of her up for a
burst<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.500> know<00:01:57.590> if<00:01:57.770> she's<00:01:57.920> going<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.219> stay<00:01:58.280> in

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
burst you know if she's going to stay in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.639 
burst you know if she's going to stay in
there<00:01:58.700> heal<00:01:59.270> up<00:01:59.539> sustained<00:02:00.170> have<00:02:00.439> some

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
there heal up sustained have some

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.800 
there heal up sustained have some
tankiness<00:02:01.100> have<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.490> CT<00:02:01.850> reduction<00:02:02.299> the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
tankiness have that CT reduction the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.660 
tankiness have that CT reduction the
burst<00:02:03.049> is<00:02:03.259> just<00:02:03.439> not<00:02:03.619> an<00:02:03.770> acceptable<00:02:04.159> portion

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
burst is just not an acceptable portion

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.099 
burst is just not an acceptable portion
of<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.850> whole<00:02:05.090> trifecta<00:02:05.689> there<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.020> we

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
of that whole trifecta there so we

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.139 
of that whole trifecta there so we
needed<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.439> take<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.710> burst<00:02:06.920> down<00:02:07.159> then<00:02:08.030> we

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
needed to take the burst down then we

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.669 
needed to take the burst down then we
did<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.330> lot<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.570> work<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.080> transcendent

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
did a lot of work on the transcendent

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.100 
did a lot of work on the transcendent
blades<00:02:09.770> we<00:02:10.700> want<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.090> build<00:02:11.330> offense<00:02:11.840> but

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
blades we want you to build offense but

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.480 
blades we want you to build offense but
there's<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.530> kind<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.860> couple<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.190> different

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
there's a kind of a couple of different

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.890 
there's a kind of a couple of different
build<00:02:13.640> paths<00:02:13.910> all<00:02:14.210> in<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.360> offense<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:14.810> we

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
build paths all in the offense so we

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.360 
build paths all in the offense so we
wanted<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.140> make<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.380> feel<00:02:15.560> good<00:02:15.830> for<00:02:16.040> using

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
wanted to make you feel good for using

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.100 
wanted to make you feel good for using
either<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.730> those

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
either of those

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.070 
either of those
a<00:02:17.170> key<00:02:17.470> or<00:02:17.500> ad<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.190> now<00:02:18.400> as<00:02:18.580> additive<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.300> takes

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
a key or ad so now as additive and takes

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.050 
a key or ad so now as additive and takes
your<00:02:20.200> AP<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.770> AD<00:02:21.010> together<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:21.670> add<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
your AP and AD together to add to the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.000 
your AP and AD together to add to the
damage<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.450> transcendent<00:02:22.960> blades<00:02:23.020> we<00:02:23.710> didn't

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
damage of transcendent blades we didn't

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.790 
damage of transcendent blades we didn't
like<00:02:24.160> how<00:02:24.340> much<00:02:24.580> irelia<00:02:25.330> can<00:02:25.540> essentially<00:02:25.960> get

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
like how much irelia can essentially get

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.010 
like how much irelia can essentially get
into<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.070> combat<00:02:27.400> harass<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:28.510> get<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.840> pretty

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
into a combat harass you get you pretty

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.840 
into a combat harass you get you pretty
low<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.710> she<00:02:30.100> could<00:02:30.250> use<00:02:30.370> our<00:02:30.400> ultimate

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
low and and she could use our ultimate

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.880 
low and and she could use our ultimate
to<00:02:30.970> farm<00:02:31.210> a<00:02:31.330> minion<00:02:31.660> wave<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.290> get<00:02:32.470> back<00:02:32.710> to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
to farm a minion wave to get back to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.040 
to farm a minion wave to get back to
full<00:02:33.190> health<00:02:33.420> transcendent<00:02:34.420> blades<00:02:34.510> now<00:02:34.840> does

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
full health transcendent blades now does

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.230 
full health transcendent blades now does
half<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.980> link<00:02:36.190> vs<00:02:36.550> minions<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:36.940> should<00:02:37.120> do

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
half you link vs minions it should do

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.940 
half you link vs minions it should do
the<00:02:37.450> full<00:02:37.660> damage<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.170> get<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.470> farm<00:02:38.800> with

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the full damage so you get so farm with

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.470 
the full damage so you get so farm with
it<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.310> still<00:02:39.550> use<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.910> hit<00:02:40.030> champions

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
it you can still use it to hit champions

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.390 
it you can still use it to hit champions
just<00:02:40.660> as<00:02:40.750> well<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.590> even<00:02:41.680> sell<00:02:41.920> fuel<00:02:42.250> off

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
just as well you can even sell fuel off

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.610 
just as well you can even sell fuel off
champions<00:02:42.910> we<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:43.240> don't<00:02:43.390> want<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.660> farming

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
champions we just don't want you farming

health<00:02:45.070> off<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.610> minions<00:02:45.970> will<00:02:46.060> transcend<00:02:46.450> the

health off of minions will transcend the

health off of minions will transcend the
blades<00:02:46.780> we<00:02:46.900> think<00:02:47.080> that's<00:02:47.230> kind<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.709> that's

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
blades we think that's kind of a that's

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
blades we think that's kind of a that's
kind<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.280> an<00:02:48.370> interaction<00:02:48.820> that's<00:02:48.970> not

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
kind of an interaction that's not

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.730 
kind of an interaction that's not
terribly<00:02:49.420> fun<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:49.959> also<00:02:50.230> causing<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.590> lot

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
terribly fun and is also causing a lot

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.440 
terribly fun and is also causing a lot
of<00:02:50.770> power<00:02:50.980> problems<00:02:51.430> with<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.610> real<00:02:51.820> hit<00:02:52.000> so

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
of power problems with a real hit so

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.610 
of power problems with a real hit so
when<00:02:52.570> you're<00:02:52.690> fighting<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:53.020> relly<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.500> go

how<00:03:36.340> people<00:03:36.700> are<00:03:36.790> actually<00:03:36.970> playing<00:03:37.390> kog'maw

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
how people are actually playing kog'maw

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.229 
how people are actually playing kog'maw
effectively<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.650> they're<00:03:39.130> using<00:03:39.430> proc<00:03:39.760> attack

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
effectively is they're using proc attack

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.840 
effectively is they're using proc attack
speed<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.930> heavy<00:03:41.140> magic<00:03:41.620> damage<00:03:41.830> builds<00:03:42.730> on

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
speed and heavy magic damage builds on

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.539 
speed and heavy magic damage builds on
him<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.750> we<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.380> this<00:03:44.530> armor<00:03:44.950> shred<00:03:45.280> on<00:03:45.400> his

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
him so we have this armor shred on his

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.400 
him so we have this armor shred on his
few<00:03:45.820> which<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.269> just<00:03:46.390> isn't<00:03:46.959> helping<00:03:47.260> him

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
few which really just isn't helping him

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.930 
few which really just isn't helping him
at<00:03:47.440> all<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:47.980> we<00:03:48.459> thought<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:48.700> was<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.820> pretty

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
at all so we thought it was a pretty

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.130 
at all so we thought it was a pretty
obvious<00:03:49.360> change<00:03:49.540> go<00:03:49.690> ahead<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.870> let<00:03:50.019> that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
obvious change go ahead and let that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.710 
obvious change go ahead and let that
shred<00:03:50.440> mr<00:03:50.860> instead<00:03:51.370> increase<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.360> range<00:03:52.480> by<00:03:52.690> a

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
shred mr instead increase the range by a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.509 
shred mr instead increase the range by a
little<00:03:52.930> bit<00:03:53.110> because<00:03:53.230> cog<00:03:53.620> is<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.830> very<00:03:53.980> unsafe

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
little bit because cog is a very unsafe

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.160 
little bit because cog is a very unsafe
long-range<00:03:55.150> champion<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.840> as<00:03:55.900> soon<00:03:56.080> as

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
somebody is close enough to really use

the W which we also feels really core to

the W which we also feels really core to
his<00:04:04.330> kit<00:04:04.570> he's<00:04:05.080> really<00:04:05.350> reliant<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:05.890> that<00:04:06.040> W<00:04:06.370> to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
in these magic proc builds so we wanted

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.780 
in these magic proc builds so we wanted
to<00:04:11.230> make<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.500> more<00:04:11.709> available<00:04:12.190> more<00:04:12.400> often

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
to make that more available more often

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.310 
to make that more available more often
we<00:04:13.239> widened<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:14.670> pool<00:04:15.670> for<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.180> goop<00:04:16.690> quite<00:04:17.290> a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
we widened the pool for the goop quite a

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.110 
we widened the pool for the goop quite a
bit<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:18.010> point<00:04:18.250> of<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.459> is<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.820> give<00:04:18.970> him

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
bit the point of that is to give him

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.670 
bit the point of that is to give him

on<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.900> way<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.080> come<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.440> get<00:04:23.530> him<00:04:23.680> before

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
on the way to come and get him before

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.010 
on the way to come and get him before
they<00:04:24.130> get<00:04:24.310> there<00:04:24.370> this<00:04:25.240> should<00:04:25.390> let<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.660> use

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
they get there this should let you use

they get there this should let you use
it<00:04:26.050> reactively<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.740> little<00:04:27.280> bit<00:04:27.460> better

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
it reactively a little bit better

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.800

so<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.040> newest<00:04:29.370> champion<00:04:29.610> vein<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.449> getting

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
so the newest champion vein is getting

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.510 
so the newest champion vein is getting
quite<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.080> lot<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.470> changes<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.830> her<00:04:32.040> what<00:04:32.460> are

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
quite a lot of changes to her what are

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.370 
quite a lot of changes to her what are
we<00:04:32.610> aiming<00:04:32.790> at<00:04:33.090> with<00:04:33.240> these<00:04:33.360> nerves<00:04:33.600> first

we aiming at with these nerves first

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.740 
we aiming at with these nerves first
let's<00:04:34.590> talk<00:04:34.710> about<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.040> Q's<00:04:35.310> mana<00:04:35.580> cost<00:04:35.940> right

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
let's talk about the Q's mana cost right

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.290 
let's talk about the Q's mana cost right
now<00:04:36.870> she<00:04:36.930> can<00:04:37.350> tumble<00:04:37.650> in<00:04:38.040> shoot<00:04:38.820> people<00:04:39.180> in

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
now she can tumble in shoot people in

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.150 
now she can tumble in shoot people in
her<00:04:39.540> ass<00:04:39.660> exceptionally<00:04:40.320> well<00:04:40.440> but<00:04:40.860> she<00:04:41.010> can

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
her ass exceptionally well but she can

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.800 
her ass exceptionally well but she can
do<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.370> very<00:04:41.490> often<00:04:41.760> because<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.389> low<00:04:42.570> mana

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
do it very often because that low mana

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.570 
do it very often because that low mana
cost<00:04:43.080> she's<00:04:43.320> not<00:04:43.470> using<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.919> resources<00:04:44.340> other

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
cost she's not using the resources other

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.129

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
people are to trade blows with her a lot

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.629 
people are to trade blows with her a lot
it's<00:04:46.590> hopefully<00:04:46.919> going<00:04:47.070> to<00:04:47.220> feel<00:04:47.460> really

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
it's hopefully going to feel really

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.969 
it's hopefully going to feel really
minor<00:04:48.180> for<00:04:48.449> vein<00:04:48.630> players<00:04:49.020> but<00:04:49.710> it's<00:04:49.800> going<00:04:49.889> to

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
minor for vein players but it's going to

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.409 
minor for vein players but it's going to
be<00:04:50.070> noticeable<00:04:50.520> over<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.820> course<00:04:51.030> of<00:04:51.180> five

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419

ten minutes of back-and-forth lane play
um<00:04:54.510> we<00:04:55.080> wanted<00:04:55.290> to<00:04:55.320> lower<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.650> true<00:04:55.800> damage<00:04:56.100> on

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
um we wanted to lower the true damage on

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.730 
um we wanted to lower the true damage on
w<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.639> little<00:04:57.030> bit<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.360> tree<00:04:58.050> damage<00:04:58.080> percentage

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
w a little bit of tree damage percentage

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.409 
w a little bit of tree damage percentage
health<00:04:58.949> I<00:04:59.100> don't<00:04:59.310> actually<00:04:59.460> think<00:04:59.669> it<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.360> a

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
health I don't actually think it is a

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.840 
health I don't actually think it is a
conceptual<00:05:00.960> problem<00:05:01.710> but<00:05:02.430> i<00:05:02.460> think<00:05:02.699> the

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
conceptual problem but i think the

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.219 
conceptual problem but i think the
number<00:05:02.880> might<00:05:03.360> have<00:05:03.479> just<00:05:03.660> been<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.840> little<00:05:04.020> too

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
number might have just been a little too

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.779 
number might have just been a little too
high<00:05:04.440> on<00:05:04.470> that<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:05.010> it's<00:05:05.130> basically<00:05:05.520> making

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
high on that and it's basically making

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.270 
high on that and it's basically making
it<00:05:06.000> so<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.930> know<00:05:07.050> in<00:05:07.289> the<00:05:07.410> mid<00:05:07.560> game<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.039> again

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
it so you know in the mid game and again

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.219 
it so you know in the mid game and again
that<00:05:08.520> kind<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.789> late<00:05:08.970> laning<00:05:09.389> phase<00:05:09.600> situation

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
that kind of late laning phase situation

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.900 
that kind of late laning phase situation
vein<00:05:10.470> is<00:05:10.620> actually<00:05:10.949> pumping<00:05:11.250> out<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.400> lot<00:05:11.729> of

vein is actually pumping out a lot of

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.550 
vein is actually pumping out a lot of
damage<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.389> with<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:12.630> safety<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:13.050> her<00:05:13.380> being

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
bursting just a little bit harder than

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.860 
bursting just a little bit harder than
we<00:05:20.580> wanted<00:05:20.789> to<00:05:20.940> so<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.150> was<00:05:21.270> another<00:05:21.449> place<00:05:21.720> we

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
we wanted to so I was another place we

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.939 
we wanted to so I was another place we
could<00:05:21.960> shave<00:05:22.199> a<00:05:22.229> little<00:05:22.350> bit<00:05:22.710> of<00:05:22.800> damage

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
could shave a little bit of damage

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.790 
could shave a little bit of damage
safely<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.789> for<00:05:24.330> condemn<00:05:24.780> there's<00:05:25.320> a<00:05:25.410> lot<00:05:25.590> of

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
safely and for condemn there's a lot of

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.129 
safely and for condemn there's a lot of
just<00:05:26.070> shoot<00:05:26.550> ee<00:05:26.820> at<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.090> dude<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.479> do<00:05:27.660> damage

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
just shoot ee at the dude and do damage

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.680 
just shoot ee at the dude and do damage
and<00:05:28.699> this<00:05:29.699> skill<00:05:29.970> should<00:05:30.210> be<00:05:30.330> about<00:05:30.510> that

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.240 
and this skill should be about that

together<00:05:38.729> as<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.450> whole<00:05:39.660> should<00:05:39.720> make<00:05:40.229> veins

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
together as a whole should make veins

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.010 
together as a whole should make veins
overall<00:05:41.220> pursed<00:05:41.580> feel<00:05:41.880> lower<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.599> since

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
overall pursed feel lower and since

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.540 
overall pursed feel lower and since
their<00:05:43.139> sustained<00:05:43.500> is<00:05:43.650> already<00:05:43.979> very<00:05:44.190> good<00:05:44.520> I

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
their sustained is already very good I

their sustained is already very good I
think<00:05:44.700> that's<00:05:45.030> acceptable<00:05:45.830> thanks<00:05:46.830> for
