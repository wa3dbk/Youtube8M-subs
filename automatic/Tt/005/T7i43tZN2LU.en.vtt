00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
writing the script was to create the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.710 
writing the script was to create the
same<00:01:34.280> level<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:34.759> fear<00:01:35.030> because<00:01:35.390> everyone

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
same level of fear because everyone

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.590 
same level of fear because everyone
remember<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.350> all<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.619> movie<00:01:36.920> was

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
remember that all the movie was

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:54.830 
remember that all the movie was
suspenseful<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.190> backed<00:01:40.190> intention

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.210 

for<00:01:55.840> me<00:01:55.990> Frank<00:01:56.380> was<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.799> obvious<00:01:56.979> choice

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
for me Frank was the obvious choice

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.730 
for me Frank was the obvious choice
because<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.630> way<00:01:58.869> nose<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.439> create

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
because of the way nose to create

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.850 
because of the way nose to create
tension<00:02:00.159> but<00:02:00.700> mostly<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.360> way<00:02:01.570> he<00:02:02.320> knows<00:02:02.590> to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
tension but mostly the way he knows to

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.950 
tension but mostly the way he knows to
forget<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:03.640> only<00:02:03.909> hear<00:02:04.179> about<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.509> fear<00:02:04.810> in

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
forget it's only hear about the fear in

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.200 
forget it's only hear about the fear in
the<00:02:05.080> general<00:02:05.530> but<00:02:05.679> he<00:02:05.799> can<00:02:06.009> create<00:02:06.759> character

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
the general but he can create character

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.910 
the general but he can create character
story

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.760
