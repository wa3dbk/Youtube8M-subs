have<00:00:37.760> a<00:00:37.820> lockout<00:00:38.240> provides<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:39.080> lot<00:00:39.230> of<00:00:39.380> cushion

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
have a lockout provides a lot of cushion

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.890 
have a lockout provides a lot of cushion
while<00:00:40.010> you're<00:00:40.160> riding<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:40.700> I<00:00:41.150> think<00:00:41.360> in

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
while you're riding and I think in

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.380 
while you're riding and I think in
addition<00:00:42.020> to<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.590> shock<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:43.670> seat<00:00:43.880> which

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
addition to the shock and the seat which

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.450 
addition to the shock and the seat which
also<00:00:44.600> has<00:00:44.930> some<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:45.680> these<00:00:45.770> rubber<00:00:46.010> bumpers

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
also has some of these rubber bumpers

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.690 
also has some of these rubber bumpers
just<00:00:47.030> having<00:00:47.300> these<00:00:47.390> larger<00:00:47.960> tires<00:00:48.700> compared

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
just having these larger tires compared

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.190 
just having these larger tires compared
to<00:00:49.790> some<00:00:49.940> of<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.090> other<00:00:50.240> easy<00:00:50.510> motion<00:00:50.810> bikes

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
to some of the other easy motion bikes

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.740 
to some of the other easy motion bikes
the<00:00:51.470> tires<00:00:51.710> on<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:52.160> biker<00:00:52.400> are<00:00:52.790> wider<00:00:53.600> and

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
the tires on this biker are wider and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.230 
the tires on this biker are wider and
that<00:00:54.140> extra<00:00:54.500> air<00:00:54.770> just<00:00:55.280> provides<00:00:55.640> nice<00:00:55.910> little

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
that extra air just provides nice little

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.910 
that extra air just provides nice little
cushion<00:00:56.630> when<00:00:56.780> you're<00:00:56.870> going<00:00:57.020> over<00:00:57.170> bumps<00:00:57.710> and

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
cushion when you're going over bumps and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.650 
cushion when you're going over bumps and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
then the handlebars or you can see

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.060 
then the handlebars or you can see
they're<00:00:59.810> swept<00:01:00.110> back<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.380> little<00:01:00.710> bit<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:00.980> that

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
they're swept back a little bit and that

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.890 
they're swept back a little bit and that

different it rides really well and it's
actually<00:01:45.800> not<00:01:45.920> too<00:01:46.340> heavy<00:01:46.760> and<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.180> could

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
actually not too heavy and you could

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.570 
actually not too heavy and you could
pedal<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:47.990> fine<00:01:48.229> but<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:48.979> course<00:01:49.190> having

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
pedal it just fine but of course having

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.570 
pedal it just fine but of course having
that<00:01:50.270> electric<00:01:50.810> assist<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.830> throttle<00:01:52.430> mode

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
that electric assist and throttle mode

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.820 
that electric assist and throttle mode
really<00:01:52.880> helps<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:54.200> way<00:01:54.320> it's<00:01:54.470> set<00:01:54.710> up

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
really helps so the way it's set up

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.980 
really helps so the way it's set up
you've<00:01:55.070> got<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.250> twist<00:01:56.030> throttle<00:01:56.420> right<00:01:56.720> here

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
you've got a twist throttle right here

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.230 
you've got a twist throttle right here
that<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.200> can<00:01:57.350> use<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.860> that's<00:01:58.520> if<00:01:58.729> you're<00:01:58.760> in

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
that you can use and that's if you're in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.480 
that you can use and that's if you're in
no<00:01:59.780> assist<00:02:00.229> mode<00:02:00.500> here<00:02:00.799> on<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.130> controller

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
no assist mode here on the controller

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.940 
no assist mode here on the controller
and<00:02:01.729> as<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.540> sort<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:03.049> work<00:02:03.229> your<00:02:03.409> way<00:02:03.560> up<00:02:03.590> you

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
and as you sort of work your way up you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.969 
and as you sort of work your way up you
go<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.100> eco<00:02:04.490> which<00:02:04.700> gets<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.180> best<00:02:05.390> range

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
go to eco which gets you the best range

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.570 
go to eco which gets you the best range
and<00:02:06.979> then<00:02:07.400> standard<00:02:08.319> Sport<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.470> boost<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.520> of

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
and then standard Sport and boost and of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.760 
and then standard Sport and boost and of
course<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:11.209> know<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.390> can<00:02:12.020> dial<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.470> up<00:02:12.500> that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
course you know you can dial it up that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.809 
course you know you can dial it up that
way<00:02:12.920> for<00:02:13.160> pedal<00:02:13.459> assist

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
way for pedal assist

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.179 
way for pedal assist
you're<00:02:13.939> gonna<00:02:14.030> get<00:02:14.239> more<00:02:14.569> like<00:02:15.530> torque<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
you're gonna get more like torque and

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.319 
you're gonna get more like torque and
force<00:02:16.459> when<00:02:16.730> you're<00:02:16.849> riding<00:02:16.969> but<00:02:17.239> you're

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
force when you're riding but you're

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.229 
force when you're riding but you're
gonna<00:02:17.420> wear<00:02:17.659> the<00:02:17.780> battery<00:02:17.930> down<00:02:18.609> faster<00:02:19.609> so<00:02:19.909> in

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
gonna wear the battery down faster so in

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.709 
gonna wear the battery down faster so in

kind<00:02:25.819> of<00:02:25.849> like<00:02:26.079> you<00:02:27.079> know<00:02:27.109> standard<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:27.829> would

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
kind of like you know standard I would

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.309 
kind of like you know standard I would
say<00:02:28.159> but<00:02:28.219> it's<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.549> lithium<00:02:28.969> battery<00:02:28.999> and<00:02:29.659> those

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
say but it's a lithium battery and those

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.929 
say but it's a lithium battery and those
are<00:02:30.469> the<00:02:30.620> lightest<00:02:31.010> longest<00:02:31.760> lasting

bit smaller a little bit more squat

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.640 
bit smaller a little bit more squat
you've<00:04:07.759> got<00:04:07.879> 26<00:04:08.599> inch<00:04:08.919> wheels<00:04:09.919> instead<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.400> 29

you've got 26 inch wheels instead of 29

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.559 
you've got 26 inch wheels instead of 29

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
but they do have an upgrade available

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.719 
but they do have an upgrade available
another<00:04:15.289> model<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.859> don't<00:04:16.130> know<00:04:16.190> how<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.400> take

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
another model I don't know how to take

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.569 
another model I don't know how to take
it<00:04:16.759> out<00:04:16.940> for<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.269> I'm<00:04:17.389> just<00:04:17.479> gonna<00:04:17.599> put<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:17.989> on

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
like to pedal this thing and hear the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.480 
like to pedal this thing and hear the
motor<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:25.190> everything

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
motor and everything

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:37.650 
motor and everything
okay

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.270 

lots<00:04:38.660> of<00:04:38.840> power<00:04:39.020> so<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.740> interesting<00:04:39.950> thing

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
lots of power so the interesting thing

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.950 
lots of power so the interesting thing
about<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.580> way<00:04:40.670> this<00:04:40.790> is<00:04:40.970> set<00:04:41.150> up<00:04:41.180> is<00:04:41.480> it<00:04:41.630> uses

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
about the way this is set up is it uses

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.500 
about the way this is set up is it uses
a<00:04:41.990> torque<00:04:42.350> sensor<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.790> responds<00:04:44.450> like

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
a torque sensor so it responds like

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.200 
a torque sensor so it responds like
right<00:04:44.990> when<00:04:45.200> you<00:04:45.290> push<00:04:45.530> which<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.370> nice<00:04:46.550> but<00:04:47.090> it

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
right when you push which is nice but it

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.520 
right when you push which is nice but it
kind<00:04:47.360> of<00:04:47.420> keeps<00:04:47.570> going<00:04:47.960> for<00:04:48.170> a<00:04:48.200> little<00:04:48.410> while

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
kind of keeps going for a little while

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.650 
kind of keeps going for a little while
after<00:04:48.950> you<00:04:49.040> stop<00:04:49.310> pushing<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:49.940> it's<00:04:50.420> kind<00:04:50.630> of

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
after you stop pushing and it's kind of

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.950 
after you stop pushing and it's kind of
standard<00:04:50.870> on<00:04:51.170> electric<00:04:51.590> bikes<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:52.910> got<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:53.840> don't

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
standard on electric bikes I got I don't

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.930 
standard on electric bikes I got I don't
know<00:04:54.050> just<00:04:54.320> keep<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:54.680> in<00:04:54.740> mind<00:04:55.040> it<00:04:55.790> works

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
know just keep that in mind it works

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.460 
know just keep that in mind it works
pretty<00:04:56.150> well<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:59.180> little<00:04:59.270> bit<00:04:59.480> one<00:05:00.290> of<00:05:00.410> the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
pretty well a little bit one of the

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.320 
pretty well a little bit one of the
downsides<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.310> this<00:05:01.430> design<00:05:01.910> is<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.150> you

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
downsides to this design is that you

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.420 
downsides to this design is that you
can't<00:05:02.690> use<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.200> twist<00:05:03.500> throttle<00:05:03.680> while<00:05:04.220> your

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
can't use the twist throttle while your

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.460 
can't use the twist throttle while your
pedal<00:05:04.790> assist<00:05:05.000> mode<00:05:05.150> so<00:05:05.930> you've<00:05:06.050> got<00:05:06.230> to<00:05:06.320> kind

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
pedal assist mode so you've got to kind

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.810 
pedal assist mode so you've got to kind
of<00:05:06.560> like<00:05:06.710> pull<00:05:06.950> over<00:05:07.100> and<00:05:07.430> adjust<00:05:07.490> the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
of like pull over and adjust the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.880 
of like pull over and adjust the
computer<00:05:08.240> or<00:05:08.420> or<00:05:08.960> whatever<00:05:09.290> I<00:05:09.350> kind<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.740> like

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
computer or or whatever I kind of like

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.630 
computer or or whatever I kind of like
to<00:05:10.010> be<00:05:10.040> able<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.280> do<00:05:10.430> both<00:05:11.290> but<00:05:12.290> you<00:05:12.740> know<00:05:13.460> that

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
to be able to do both but you know that

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.710 
to be able to do both but you know that
I<00:05:13.670> guess<00:05:13.880> that's<00:05:14.060> kind<00:05:14.120> of<00:05:14.270> standard<00:05:14.450> on

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
I guess that's kind of standard on

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.660 
I guess that's kind of standard on
electric<00:05:15.080> bikes<00:05:15.290> I<00:05:15.560> failed<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.580> mention

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
electric bikes I failed to mention

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.430 
electric bikes I failed to mention
earlier<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.330> you've<00:05:17.600> got<00:05:17.750> this<00:05:17.870> adjustable

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
earlier that you've got this adjustable

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.230 
earlier that you've got this adjustable
neck<00:05:18.620> which<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:18.860> nice<00:05:19.190> but<00:05:19.520> if<00:05:19.910> you're<00:05:20.120> going

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
neck which is nice but if you're going

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.540 
neck which is nice but if you're going
off-road<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:20.750> lot<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.290> to<00:05:21.530> sort<00:05:21.740> of<00:05:21.890> rough
