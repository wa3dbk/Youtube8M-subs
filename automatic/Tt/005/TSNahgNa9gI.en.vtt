little<00:00:41.940> trickle<00:00:42.270> filters<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
little trickle filters and then in the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.180 
little trickle filters and then in the
back<00:00:43.739> corner<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:45.210> set<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.960> sand<00:00:46.680> filter

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

levels<00:00:56.129> down<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.180> also<00:00:57.590> filters<00:00:58.590> out

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
levels down and then it also filters out

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.920 
levels down and then it also filters out
the<00:00:58.739> particulates<00:00:59.399> not<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> small<00:01:00.539> micron

ultimately when it reaches a certain
back<00:01:05.189> pressure<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.290> backwash<00:01:07.860> the

back pressure I go in and I backwash the
system<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> top<00:01:10.049> basically

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
system you know at the top basically

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.710 
system you know at the top basically
just<00:01:10.920> switching<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.760> around<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.330> then

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
just switching it around and then

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.109 
just switching it around and then
draining<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.380> into<00:01:13.860> our<00:01:13.979> floor<00:01:14.250> drain<00:01:14.580> now

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
draining it out into our floor drain now

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.350 
draining it out into our floor drain now
this<00:01:15.299> has<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:16.080> heavy-duty<00:01:16.950> pump<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
this has a pretty heavy-duty pump on the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.660 
this has a pretty heavy-duty pump on the
hole<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:18.990> size<00:01:19.229> pool<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.520> could

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
hole for this size pool you could

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.399 
hole for this size pool you could
probably<00:01:20.850> use<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> same<00:01:21.450> pump<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.140> two<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
probably use the same pump for two to

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.690 
probably use the same pump for two to
three<00:01:22.439> size<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.479> swimming<00:01:24.840> pool<00:01:25.700> again

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
three size the the swimming pool again

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.749 
three size the the swimming pool again
you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.810> tilapia<00:01:28.759> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
you can see in here we have tilapia the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.870 
you can see in here we have tilapia the
tilapia<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:31.100> when<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> first<00:01:32.430> put<00:01:32.610> them<00:01:32.729> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
tilapia are when I first put them in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
tilapia are when I first put them in
they<00:01:33.030> were<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.810> little<00:01:34.079> bigger<00:01:34.290> than<00:01:34.409> an

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
they were just a little bigger than an

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.800 
they were just a little bigger than an
eighth<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> an<00:01:35.700> inch<00:01:35.790> long<00:01:35.939> there<00:01:36.299> were<00:01:36.390> just

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
eighth of an inch long there were just

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
eighth of an inch long there were just
little<00:01:37.049> fry<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:38.189> they're<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.820> know

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
little fry and now they're you know

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.310 
little fry and now they're you know
anywhere<00:01:39.119> between<00:01:39.299> two<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> four<00:01:40.049> inches

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
anywhere between two and four inches

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
anywhere between two and four inches
long<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> pretty<00:01:41.100> good<00:01:41.250> size<00:01:41.600> it's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
long so that are a pretty good size it's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600 
long so that are a pretty good size it's
going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> take<00:01:42.960> about<00:01:43.049> six<00:01:43.290> months<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:44.189> get

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
going to take about six months to get

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.569 
going to take about six months to get
full<00:01:44.850> size<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.509> ultimately<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.649> goal<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:47.100> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
water now the way I have it set up right

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.620 
water now the way I have it set up right
now<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.310> couldn't<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.969> because<00:01:57.210> even

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
now I couldn't do that because even

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.120 
now I couldn't do that because even
though<00:01:57.719> there's<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> bubbling

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
though there's you can see the bubbling

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.260 
though there's you can see the bubbling
action<00:01:59.340> from<00:01:59.729> all<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> different

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
filtration system now you can see here

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.670

I've<00:02:11.370> got<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.360> actual<00:02:12.660> water<00:02:12.959> temp<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.440> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I've got the the actual water temp as a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.740 
I've got the the actual water temp as a
allô<00:02:13.890> right<00:02:14.159> now<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.579> only<00:02:14.819> seven<00:02:15.299> you<00:02:15.629> know

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
allô right now it's only seven you know

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.559 
allô right now it's only seven you know
its<00:02:15.840> around<00:02:16.079> 76<00:02:16.650> 77<00:02:17.010> degrees<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.640> try<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.329> keep

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
its around 76 77 degrees I try to keep

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.080 
its around 76 77 degrees I try to keep
it<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.870> neighborhood<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.260> around<00:02:19.530> 85<00:02:20.129> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
it in the neighborhood of around 85 the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.610 
it in the neighborhood of around 85 the
reason<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:21.540> low<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.900> because<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.439> did<00:02:22.590> a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
reason it's low is because I just did a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.500 
reason it's low is because I just did a
partial<00:02:23.040> water<00:02:23.189> change<00:02:23.609> now<00:02:24.209> what<00:02:24.390> I'm<00:02:24.480> using

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
partial water change now what I'm using

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.449 
partial water change now what I'm using
for<00:02:24.810> heaters<00:02:25.319> for<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.680> system<00:02:26.069> because<00:02:26.310> I'm

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
for heaters for this system because I'm

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.309 
for heaters for this system because I'm
trying<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.909> keep<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.299> budget<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.900> I'm

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
trying to keep this on a budget is I'm

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.459 
trying to keep this on a budget is I'm
actually<00:02:28.530> using<00:02:28.939> aquarium<00:02:29.939> heaters<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.930> you

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
actually using aquarium heaters that you

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.589 
actually using aquarium heaters that you
can<00:02:31.620> see<00:02:31.829> here<00:02:32.129> an<00:02:32.280> example<00:02:32.519> they're<00:02:33.329> just

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
can see here an example they're just

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.449 
can see here an example they're just
simple<00:02:33.900> aquarium<00:02:34.379> heaters<00:02:34.769> old<00:02:35.010> ones<00:02:35.219> I<00:02:35.340> had

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
simple aquarium heaters old ones I had

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.399 
simple aquarium heaters old ones I had
laying<00:02:35.670> around<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.540> I'm<00:02:36.659> using<00:02:36.840> them<00:02:37.049> just<00:02:37.109> to

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
laying around and I'm using them just to

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.470 
laying around and I'm using them just to
keep<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.739> water<00:02:38.250> temp<00:02:38.639> you<00:02:38.909> know<00:02:39.030> reasonably

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
keep the water temp you know reasonably

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.629 
keep the water temp you know reasonably
warm<00:02:39.840> now<00:02:40.409> because<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:40.859> is<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.219> my<00:02:41.340> basement

to keep in mind now over here you can

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.289 
to keep in mind now over here you can
see<00:03:04.469> the<00:03:04.590> air<00:03:04.709> pump<00:03:04.980> I'm<00:03:05.159> using<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.790> actually

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
see the air pump I'm using I actually

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.869 
see the air pump I'm using I actually
have<00:03:06.689> kind<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.409> larger<00:03:07.829> 70<00:03:08.400> liter<00:03:08.609> per

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
have kind of a larger 70 liter per

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.229 
have kind of a larger 70 liter per
minute<00:03:09.560> unit<00:03:10.560> because<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.669> really<00:03:12.030> want<00:03:12.180> to

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
minute unit because I really want to

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.509 
minute unit because I really want to
keep<00:03:12.419> this<00:03:12.930> water<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.409> nice<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.769> oxygenated

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
keep this water and nice and oxygenated

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.740 
keep this water and nice and oxygenated
and<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.329> things<00:03:15.569> that<00:03:15.659> I've

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
and one of the things that I've

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.349 
and one of the things that I've
discovered<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.379> over<00:03:16.620> time<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.790> bubble<00:03:18.030> rod

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
discovered is over time the bubble rod

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.149 
discovered is over time the bubble rod
you<00:03:18.629> can<00:03:18.659> see<00:03:19.019> there<00:03:19.229> isn't<00:03:19.500> even<00:03:19.709> really

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
you can see there isn't even really

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.520 
you can see there isn't even really
working<00:03:20.579> whereas<00:03:21.479> the<00:03:21.720> standard<00:03:21.959> blue<00:03:22.349> air

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
working whereas the standard blue air

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.800 
working whereas the standard blue air
stones<00:03:22.919> down<00:03:23.250> here<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.669> corner<00:03:23.849> they're

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
stones down here in the corner they're

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.979 
stones down here in the corner they're
bubbling<00:03:25.049> up<00:03:25.379> fairly<00:03:25.650> well<00:03:25.949> I<00:03:26.879> also<00:03:27.629> had<00:03:27.959> a

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
bubbling up fairly well I also had a

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.289 
bubbling up fairly well I also had a
bubble<00:03:28.379> disc<00:03:28.590> which<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.549> see<00:03:29.729> here<00:03:29.970> an

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
bubble disc which you can see here an

bubble disc which you can see here an
eight<00:03:30.419> inch<00:03:30.629> bubble<00:03:30.689> disc<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:31.379> that's<00:03:31.680> lost

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
eight inch bubble disc and that's lost

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.300 
eight inch bubble disc and that's lost
about<00:03:32.340> 7080<00:03:33.090> percent<00:03:33.540> capacity<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.069> past

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
about 7080 percent capacity in the past

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.250 
about 7080 percent capacity in the past
two<00:03:35.489> months<00:03:35.849> so<00:03:36.389> it<00:03:36.510> seems<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.870> that's<00:03:37.019> not

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
two months so it seems like that's not

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.839 
two months so it seems like that's not
going<00:03:37.409> to<00:03:37.470> really<00:03:37.530> be<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.919> good<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:38.639> in<00:03:38.760> the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
long run anyways as far as the ammonia

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.849 
long run anyways as far as the ammonia
levels<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.790> nitrate<00:03:42.209> levels<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:43.560> all<00:03:43.739> the
