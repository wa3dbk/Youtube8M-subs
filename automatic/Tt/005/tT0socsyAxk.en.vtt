00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
second page and and this is a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.830 
second page and and this is a
transaction<00:01:40.829> log<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.729> see<00:01:42.000> what<00:01:42.720> I've

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
transaction log so we can see what I've

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.740 
transaction log so we can see what I've
done<00:01:43.049> which<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.520> cool<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.659> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
done which is really really cool so if I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.749 
done which is really really cool so if I
get<00:01:45.899> rid<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.110> these<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.680> look<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.399> market

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
get rid of these and look at my market

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.450 
get rid of these and look at my market
history<00:01:48.290> which<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.439> outdated<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.189> moment

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
history which is outdated at the moment

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.039 
history which is outdated at the moment
so<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.030> again<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.840> tech

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
so if we do that again so for tech

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.100 
so if we do that again so for tech
market<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.950> three<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.869> spell<00:01:55.079> it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
market is three if you can spell it

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.289 
market is three if you can spell it
correctly<00:01:55.229> that's<00:01:55.829> er<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.670> very<00:01:56.909> important

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
correctly that's er it's very important

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
solid system works really well so there

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.630 
solid system works really well so there
is<00:02:48.810> one<00:02:49.019> more<00:02:49.200> thing<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:49.830> can<00:02:50.100> do<00:02:50.220> which<00:02:50.400> is

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
is one more thing you can do which is

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.870 
is one more thing you can do which is
actually<00:02:51.239> send<00:02:51.450> people<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.019> items<00:02:52.880> safely

actually send people and items safely

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.729 
actually send people and items safely
because<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.720> dropped<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.170> floor

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
because if I dropped it on the floor

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.860 
because if I dropped it on the floor
someone<00:02:56.130> could<00:02:56.310> run<00:02:56.549> around<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.030> take<00:02:57.660> it

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
someone could run around and take it

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.050 
someone could run around and take it
without<00:02:58.019> me<00:02:58.440> knowing<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.790> will<00:02:59.910> be

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
without me knowing and that that will be

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.470 
without me knowing and that that will be
bad<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.690> if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.870> do<00:03:00.989> mark<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:01.560> send<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.790> player

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
bad so if you do mark it send the player

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.150 
bad so if you do mark it send the player
name<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.700> amount<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.720> actually

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
name and the amount so you can actually

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.590 
name and the amount so you can actually
maybe<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.280> they<00:03:08.430> say<00:03:08.640> help<00:03:09.030> I'm<00:03:09.209> dying<00:03:09.450> of

maybe if they say help I'm dying of

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.479 
maybe if they say help I'm dying of
hunger<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.319> could<00:03:10.530> send<00:03:10.739> them<00:03:10.860> some<00:03:11.040> food<00:03:11.220> and
