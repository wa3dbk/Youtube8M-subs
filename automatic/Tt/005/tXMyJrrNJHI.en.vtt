00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 at aldi there is currently the lg spirit 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.490
 for 149 euros a very fresh android 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.019
 smartphone with android 50 lollipop and 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.700
 we once looked at what gives 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:23.130
 it for the money and what is it for that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:25.439
 money may not be at aldi nord 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.680
 is there again this smartphones 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.050
 the lg spirit for just under 150 euros 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.660
 the back comes in metal optics 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.760
 but the whole thing is deceiving 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 It is simply plastic from the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.050
 Processing is the lg spirit 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.660
 inconspicuous but what should one also 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.600
 expect a 150 euro smartphone 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 with 118 grams, it's all right 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.780
 light 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.969
 By the way, the display is slightly curved 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.390
 but you hardly see it 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.670
 a diagonal of 4.7 inches the colors 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.340
 could be stronger that is black 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.600
 It causes a very dark gray skin 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.149
 the contrast is not the viewer 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.739
 really as an operating system 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.860
 Android in the current version 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.530
 lollipop on board per wlan goes to the net 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.810
 it according to the bgb or n-standard 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.049
 On the way, they only surf along 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.500
 3g speed feature also 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.450
 ukw radio is integrated into us 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.159
 especially the battery is 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 changeable what the speed 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.689
 Most apps were fast 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.509
 enough only with graphically demanding 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.390
 Play it was once built jerky 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.100
 two cameras became a 5 megapixel 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.610
 camera behind for snapshots and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.710
 a 1 megapixel camera for 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.420
 Video calling or self ihs of the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.340
 eight gigabytes of memory are lost 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.159
 other because of the operating system only 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.920
 three gigabytes for the storage 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.210
 but can be via micro sd card 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.579
 gear up 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.130
 conclusion the lg spirit is a cheap one 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.350
 entry model who was the data turbo 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.399
 would like to use the should, however, about 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.869
 20 euros more for the lg spirit 4g lte 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.369
 beyond that, too 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.429
 even with faster processor and 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.750
 better camera equipped 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.819
 Actually, the lg spirit is aldi 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.060
 a good deal the price is right for 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.860
 the offered 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.830
 performance but i would seriously 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.080
 consider if you are not this 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.500
 manageable extra price of around 20 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.780
 Euro 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.340
 but still invested to the lg spirit 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.269
 4g was about to grab 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.650
 that does not just have the data radio 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.660
 on board but also something 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.810
 better camera and was also in the 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.130
 benchmarks the flottier so if 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.099
 like the picture 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.170
 I would recommend a bit more 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.170
 spend and then buy that
