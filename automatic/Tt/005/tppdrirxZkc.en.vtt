out<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> coin<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
out of the of the coin so it's kind of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
out of the of the coin so it's kind of
like<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> coin<00:01:53.040> within<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> coin<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:54.030> not

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
like a coin within the coin I'm not

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.969 
like a coin within the coin I'm not
going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> allow<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.869> guys<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.170> discover<00:01:55.680> that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
Space Odyssey so that's very cool so

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.219 
Space Odyssey so that's very cool so
that<00:02:06.810> was<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.429> silver<00:02:08.429> medal<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.959> 2010<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.140> then

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
that was a silver medal in 2010 and then

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.720 
that was a silver medal in 2010 and then
we<00:02:10.890> move<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> last<00:02:11.790> year<00:02:12.120> which<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.620> 2011

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
we move on to last year which is 2011

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.580 
we move on to last year which is 2011
theme<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.510> year<00:02:14.690> was<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.900> pirate<00:02:15.409> theme

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
theme for that year was a pirate theme

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.160 
theme for that year was a pirate theme
and<00:02:16.159> this<00:02:16.909> is<00:02:17.090> actually<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.780> front<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.080> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
and this is actually the front of the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.119 
and this is actually the front of the
coin<00:02:18.349> here<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:19.670> map<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.799> treasure<00:02:21.799> cash

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
coin here is a map to treasure cash

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.520 
coin here is a map to treasure cash
actually<00:02:22.970> made<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.090> video<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.599> that<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.200> so

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
actually made a video of that and so

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.490 
actually made a video of that and so
this<00:02:24.799> coin<00:02:25.489> actually<00:02:26.090> led<00:02:26.420> us<00:02:26.659> to<00:02:26.930> treasure

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
this coin actually led us to treasure

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.559 
this coin actually led us to treasure
and<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:27.830> can<00:02:27.980> see<00:02:28.220> see<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.180> there's<00:02:29.420> a

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
and you can see see that there's a

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.059 
and you can see see that there's a
little<00:02:30.849> like<00:02:31.849> code<00:02:32.599> around<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.500> edge<00:02:33.650> and

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
little like code around the edge and

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.910 
little like code around the edge and
that<00:02:34.730> corresponds<00:02:35.720> with<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:36.379> this<00:02:36.709> was<00:02:36.890> the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
that corresponds with this this was the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.759 
that corresponds with this this was the
coin<00:02:37.430> for<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.629> event<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.500> there's<00:02:39.709> a

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
coin for the event and so there's a

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.300 
coin for the event and so there's a
cipher<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.329> tells<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.410> numbers

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
cipher on it it tells you the numbers

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.610 
cipher on it it tells you the numbers
and<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.819> places<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.480> go<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.110> these<00:02:45.560> are

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
and the places to go and these are

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.309 
and the places to go and these are
actually<00:02:46.250> inside<00:02:46.400> here<00:02:47.000> these<00:02:47.750> are<00:02:47.810> actually

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
actually inside here these are actually

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.430 
actually inside here these are actually
path<00:02:48.590> tags<00:02:48.980> as<00:02:49.280> well<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.700> come<00:02:50.060> they<00:02:50.900> come<00:02:51.200> right

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
path tags as well I come they come right

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.979 
path tags as well I come they come right
out<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.549> geocoin<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.299> that's<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.660> side

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
out of the geocoin so that's that side

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.099 
out of the geocoin so that's that side
of<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.769> one<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.579> can<00:02:55.700> see<00:02:56.109> it's

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
of this one and then you can see it's

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.849 
of this one and then you can see it's
kind<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.379> a<00:02:57.530> pirate<00:02:58.099> ship<00:02:58.129> sort<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.879> thing<00:02:59.120> and

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
kind of a pirate ship sort of thing and

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.539 
kind of a pirate ship sort of thing and
so<00:03:00.859> this<00:03:01.099> year<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:02.569> we<00:03:03.079> also<00:03:03.379> got<00:03:03.859> second<00:03:04.459> but

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
so this year I we also got second but

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.220 
so this year I we also got second but
this<00:03:04.700> was<00:03:04.849> in<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.000> two-person<00:03:05.540> competition

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
this was in the two-person competition

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.400 
this was in the two-person competition
so<00:03:06.379> it's<00:03:06.500> another<00:03:06.739> silver<00:03:07.730> medal<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.359> on<00:03:09.260> the

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
so it's another silver medal and on the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.759 
so it's another silver medal and on the
other<00:03:09.440> side<00:03:09.859> is<00:03:10.629> right<00:03:11.629> here<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.560> has<00:03:12.739> a

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
other side is right here and it has a

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.809 
other side is right here and it has a
pirate<00:03:13.549> ship<00:03:13.579> on<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.980> code<00:03:16.549> to

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
pirate ship on it and so the code to

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.020 
pirate ship on it and so the code to
discover<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.450> one<00:03:17.629> will<00:03:17.900> be<00:03:17.930> right<00:03:18.590> there

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
discover that one will be right there

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.440 
discover that one will be right there
right<00:03:20.030> now<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.739> then<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.889> final<00:03:22.069> one<00:03:22.389> this<00:03:23.389> is

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
right now and then the final one this is

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.509 
right now and then the final one this is
the<00:03:23.599> one<00:03:23.690> I'm<00:03:23.870> very<00:03:24.049> proud<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.620> theme<00:03:24.889> for

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
actually and yeah this metal tube has

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.650 
actually and yeah this metal tube has
the<00:03:45.130> path<00:03:46.130> tag<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:47.690> middle<00:03:48.049> of<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.410> so

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
the path tag in the middle of it so

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.210 
the path tag in the middle of it so
that's<00:03:50.660> pretty<00:03:51.049> cool<00:03:51.139> so<00:03:51.590> that's<00:03:51.889> a<00:03:51.980> coin

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
that's pretty cool so that's a coin

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.830 
that's pretty cool so that's a coin
within<00:03:52.519> a<00:03:52.609> coin<00:03:52.819> and<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:54.829> other<00:03:55.040> side<00:03:55.340> shows

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
within a coin and the other side shows
