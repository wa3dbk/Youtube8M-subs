00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.439 

so<00:00:02.460> let's<00:00:02.670> talk<00:00:02.850> about<00:00:02.909> some<00:00:03.239> of<00:00:03.330> the

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
so let's talk about some of the

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.240 
so let's talk about some of the
differences<00:00:03.960> between<00:00:04.070> anemia<00:00:05.070> of<00:00:05.129> chronic

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
differences between anemia of chronic

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.450 
differences between anemia of chronic
disease<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:06.240> iron<00:00:06.830> deficiency<00:00:07.830> anemia

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
disease and iron deficiency anemia

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.490 
disease and iron deficiency anemia
because<00:00:08.940> really<00:00:09.750> these<00:00:09.990> two<00:00:10.170> diseases

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
because really these two diseases

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.129 
because really these two diseases
present<00:00:11.190> very<00:00:11.610> similarly<00:00:12.210> both<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.870> them<00:00:13.019> are

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
present very similarly both of them are

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.930 
present very similarly both of them are
going<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.380> patients<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.400> present<00:00:14.429> with

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
going to have patients that present with

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.510 
going to have patients that present with
signs<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.719> symptoms<00:00:16.110> of<00:00:16.320> anemia<00:00:16.530> so<00:00:16.980> patients

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
signs and symptoms of anemia so patients

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.939 
signs and symptoms of anemia so patients
that<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.820> chronically<00:00:18.750> fatigued<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
that are chronically fatigued and

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.859 
that are chronically fatigued and
feeling<00:00:20.340> weak<00:00:20.670> looking<00:00:21.060> paler<00:00:21.630> than<00:00:21.660> usual

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
feeling weak looking paler than usual

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.929 
feeling weak looking paler than usual
and<00:00:22.380> may<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.560> experiencing<00:00:23.160> some<00:00:23.430> shortness

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and may be experiencing some shortness

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.570 
and may be experiencing some shortness
of<00:00:24.090> breath<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.630> really<00:00:25.289> when<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.529> go<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> draw

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
of breath and really when you go to draw

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.150 
of breath and really when you go to draw
the<00:00:26.640> basic<00:00:27.029> anemia<00:00:27.869> labs<00:00:28.230> take<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> look<00:00:29.039> at

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the basic anemia labs take a look at

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160 
the basic anemia labs take a look at
what's<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> blood<00:00:30.689> you'll<00:00:30.960> see

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
what's going on in the blood you'll see

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.730 
what's going on in the blood you'll see
that<00:00:31.380> both<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.830> them<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:33.020> microcytic<00:00:34.020> anemias

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
that both of them are microcytic anemias

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.640 
that both of them are microcytic anemias
so<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:36.060> the<00:00:36.240> only<00:00:36.390> way<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> tell<00:00:37.140> these<00:00:37.410> two

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
so really the only way to tell these two

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.640 
so really the only way to tell these two
diseases<00:00:38.010> apart<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.300> draw<00:00:39.810> iron<00:00:40.080> studies

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
diseases apart is to draw iron studies

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.350 
diseases apart is to draw iron studies
so<00:00:41.100> let's<00:00:41.340> take<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> look<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.030> some<00:00:42.330> of

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
so let's take a look at what some of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.170 
so let's take a look at what some of
those<00:00:42.540> values<00:00:43.110> would<00:00:43.410> show<00:00:43.740> so<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.000> are<00:00:45.090> some

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
those values would show so here are some

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.640 
those values would show so here are some
of<00:00:45.240> the<00:00:45.360> values<00:00:45.720> that<00:00:45.900> you<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.230> back<00:00:46.410> when<00:00:46.560> you

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
of the values that you get back when you

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.350 
of the values that you get back when you
draw<00:00:46.830> iron<00:00:47.010> studies<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:48.000> already<00:00:48.120> went

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
draw iron studies and we already went

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.820 
draw iron studies and we already went
through<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.750> iron<00:00:49.020> deficiency<00:00:49.530> anemia

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
through this for iron deficiency anemia

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.890 
through this for iron deficiency anemia
but<00:00:49.950> let's<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.790> it<00:00:50.820> again<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.480> practice

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
but let's just do it again for practice

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.290 
but let's just do it again for practice
sake<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:53.220> iron<00:00:53.490> deficiency<00:00:53.970> anemia

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
sake so with iron deficiency anemia

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.210 
sake so with iron deficiency anemia
you'd<00:00:54.420> expect<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.900> serum<00:00:55.290> iron<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.100> be

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
you'd expect your serum iron to be

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.860 
you'd expect your serum iron to be
decreased<00:00:56.670> right<00:00:57.120> hence<00:00:57.450> the<00:00:57.630> iron

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
decreased right hence the iron

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.590 
decreased right hence the iron
deficiency<00:00:58.770> part<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.490> the<00:01:00.120> percent

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
deficiency part of it all the percent

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.650 
deficiency part of it all the percent
saturation<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.800> percentage<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.880> total

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
saturation or the percentage of total

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.630 
saturation or the percentage of total
binding<00:01:03.870> site<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.280> transferrin

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
binding site on the transferrin

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.420 
binding site on the transferrin
molecules<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.570> actually<00:01:07.020> occupied<00:01:07.800> by

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
molecules that are actually occupied by

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.180 
molecules that are actually occupied by
iron<00:01:09.030> would<00:01:09.900> also<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:11.010> decreased<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.650> total

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
iron would also be decreased the total

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.850 
iron would also be decreased the total
iron<00:01:14.400> binding<00:01:14.610> capacity<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:16.080> iron<00:01:16.350> deficiency

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
iron binding capacity in iron deficiency

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
iron binding capacity in iron deficiency
anemia<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.400> increased<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.630> said<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
anemia is increased and we said that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.110 
anemia is increased and we said that
that<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.950> body's<00:01:20.370> compensatory

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
that was the body's compensatory

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.450 
that was the body's compensatory
mechanism<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> deal<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.800> deficiency<00:01:23.400> in

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
mechanism to deal with the deficiency in

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.030 
mechanism to deal with the deficiency in
iron<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> body<00:01:24.900> does<00:01:25.260> to<00:01:25.290> deal<00:01:25.830> with

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
iron so what the body does to deal with

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.400 
iron so what the body does to deal with
the<00:01:26.160> shortage<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.610> iron<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.170> increase<00:01:28.170> its

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
the shortage of iron is increase its

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.470 
the shortage of iron is increase its
production<00:01:28.830> of<00:01:29.100> transferrin<00:01:29.640> molecules<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
production of transferrin molecules it

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.780 
production of transferrin molecules it
makes<00:01:30.870> more<00:01:31.260> transparent<00:01:31.950> puts<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.550> into

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
makes more transparent puts it out into

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
makes more transparent puts it out into
the<00:01:32.940> blood<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.020> transferrin<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.680> go

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the blood so that the transferrin can go

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280 
the blood so that the transferrin can go
out<00:01:35.010> there<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.460> bind<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.390> iron<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.900> find

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
out there and bind to more iron to find

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.710 
out there and bind to more iron to find
more<00:01:37.560> iron<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.040> bind<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.730> of<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.000> okay

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
more iron and bind to more of it okay

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.410 
more iron and bind to more of it okay
and<00:01:40.220> ferritin<00:01:41.220> which<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.580> reflective<00:01:42.120> of<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and ferritin which is reflective of the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.350 
and ferritin which is reflective of the
amount<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.870> iron<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.710> storage<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.940> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
amount of iron that's in storage in the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.850 
amount of iron that's in storage in the
body<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:46.010> decreased<00:01:47.010> in<00:01:47.250> iron<00:01:47.909> deficiency

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
body is decreased in iron deficiency

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.469 
body is decreased in iron deficiency
okay<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.430> those<00:01:50.550> are<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> values<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.180> iron

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
okay so those are the values for iron

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.420 
okay so those are the values for iron
deficiency<00:01:52.020> anemia<00:01:52.320> let's<00:01:52.950> compare<00:01:53.370> that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
deficiency anemia let's compare that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.980 
deficiency anemia let's compare that
with<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:53.790> you're<00:01:54.150> seeing<00:01:54.330> any<00:01:54.750> me<00:01:54.900> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
with what you're seeing any me of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
with what you're seeing any me of
chronic<00:01:55.320> disease<00:01:55.620> so<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:57.000> overview

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
chronic disease so just as an overview

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
chronic disease so just as an overview
once<00:01:58.049> again<00:01:58.350> anemia<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.770> chronic<00:01:58.830> disease<00:01:59.159> is

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
once again anemia of chronic disease is

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.130 
once again anemia of chronic disease is
a<00:01:59.760> disease<00:02:00.570> where<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.260> have<00:02:01.440> some<00:02:01.650> underlying

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
a disease where you have some underlying

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.860 
a disease where you have some underlying
inflammatory<00:02:04.140> condition<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.240> as<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.299> result

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
inflammatory condition and as a result

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.330 
inflammatory condition and as a result
of<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.380> an<00:02:07.500> increased<00:02:07.920> production

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
of it you have an increased production

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.210 
of it you have an increased production
of<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> molecule<00:02:09.240> called<00:02:09.509> hepcidin<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.979> what

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
the absorption

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.709 
the absorption
I'm<00:02:15.079> from<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:15.530> gut<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.849> also<00:02:17.090> decreases

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 
I'm from the gut and it also decreases

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.649 
I'm from the gut and it also decreases
the<00:02:18.230> recycling<00:02:19.099> of<00:02:19.250> iron<00:02:19.670> from<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.329> breakdown

this disease is it's trying to limit how
much<00:02:27.620> iron<00:02:27.799> is<00:02:27.980> coming<00:02:28.280> into<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:29.030> body<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.450> at

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
much iron is coming into the body and at

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.679 
much iron is coming into the body and at
the<00:02:30.079> same<00:02:30.379> time<00:02:30.980> it's<00:02:31.400> trying<00:02:31.879> to<00:02:32.090> tuck<00:02:32.480> away

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
the same time it's trying to tuck away

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.399 
the same time it's trying to tuck away

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
as much iron as possible into storage so

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.649 
as much iron as possible into storage so
that<00:02:36.439> very<00:02:36.889> little<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.489> present<00:02:38.060> in<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.420> blood

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
that very little is present in the blood

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.839 
that very little is present in the blood
in<00:02:38.870> essence<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.889> body<00:02:40.099> is<00:02:40.250> trying<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:40.609> play

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
in essence the body is trying to play

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.879 
in essence the body is trying to play
keep-away<00:02:41.180> with<00:02:41.659> the<00:02:41.780> iron<00:02:41.959> away<00:02:42.230> from

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
keep-away with the iron away from

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.160 
keep-away with the iron away from
bacteria<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:43.790> inflammatory<00:02:44.180> cells<00:02:44.810> because

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
bacteria and inflammatory cells because

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.979 
bacteria and inflammatory cells because
they<00:02:45.319> really<00:02:45.680> need<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.159> to<00:02:46.790> throw<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.629> thrive

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
they really need it to throw to thrive

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.009 
they really need it to throw to thrive
and<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.290> grow<00:02:48.579> okay<00:02:49.579> so<00:02:50.180> you'd<00:02:50.480> expect<00:02:50.930> that

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
and to grow okay so you'd expect that

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.500 
and to grow okay so you'd expect that
the<00:02:51.319> serum<00:02:51.859> iron<00:02:52.129> in<00:02:52.609> anime<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.180> chronic

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
the serum iron in anime of chronic

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.970 
the serum iron in anime of chronic
disease<00:02:53.840> would<00:02:54.109> be<00:02:54.260> decreased<00:02:54.709> that's

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
disease would be decreased that's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.589 
disease would be decreased that's
exactly<00:02:55.730> what<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:55.970> body<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.299> trying<00:02:56.419> to

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
exactly what the body is trying to

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.449 
exactly what the body is trying to
accomplish<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:57.230> wants<00:02:57.560> very<00:02:57.889> little<00:02:58.189> iron

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
accomplish it wants very little iron

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.000 
accomplish it wants very little iron
present<00:02:59.299> in<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.629> blood<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.530> percent

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
present in the blood the percent

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.369 
present in the blood the percent
saturation<00:03:01.669> which<00:03:02.329> is<00:03:02.480> again<00:03:02.719> the<00:03:02.900> percentage

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
saturation which is again the percentage

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.050 
saturation which is again the percentage
of<00:03:03.530> transparent<00:03:04.250> binding<00:03:04.609> sites<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:04.909> are

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
of transparent binding sites that are

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.149 
of transparent binding sites that are
actually<00:03:05.540> filled<00:03:05.780> up<00:03:05.930> with<00:03:06.049> iron<00:03:06.379> would<00:03:06.919> also

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
actually filled up with iron would also

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.720 
actually filled up with iron would also
be<00:03:07.879> decreased<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.739> total<00:03:10.310> iron<00:03:10.489> binding

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
be decreased the total iron binding

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.890 
be decreased the total iron binding
capacity<00:03:11.480> or<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:13.069> amount<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.180> transferrin

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
capacity or the amount of transferrin

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.530 
capacity or the amount of transferrin
that's<00:03:15.319> in<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.680> blood<00:03:15.919> in<00:03:16.159> an<00:03:16.849> email<00:03:17.030> chronic

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
that's in the blood in an email chronic

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.649 
that's in the blood in an email chronic
disease<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.370> decreased<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.669> again<00:03:20.479> this

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
disease is decreased and again this

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.050 
disease is decreased and again this
makes<00:03:20.930> sense<00:03:21.199> it<00:03:21.470> goes<00:03:21.650> totally<00:03:22.099> in<00:03:22.549> line<00:03:22.819> with

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
makes sense it goes totally in line with

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.020 
makes sense it goes totally in line with
what<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.269> body<00:03:23.510> is<00:03:23.629> trying<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.959> accomplish<00:03:24.530> it

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
what the body is trying to accomplish it

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.550 
what the body is trying to accomplish it
decreases<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.060> production<00:03:26.419> of<00:03:26.930> transferrin

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
decreases the production of transferrin

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.589 
decreases the production of transferrin
so<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.519> there's<00:03:28.729> less<00:03:28.790> transparent<00:03:29.479> out

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
so that there's less transparent out

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.969 
so that there's less transparent out
there<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.959> blood<00:03:30.169> trying<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.560> bind<00:03:30.799> to

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:30.979 
there in the blood trying to bind to

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.199 
there in the blood trying to bind to
iron<00:03:31.220> okay

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
iron okay

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.110 
iron okay
and<00:03:32.349> finally<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.680> ferritin<00:03:34.459> or<00:03:34.699> which<00:03:34.970> is

and storage in the body in anemia of
chronic<00:03:39.019> disease<00:03:39.349> is<00:03:39.879> characteristically

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
chronic disease is characteristically

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.439 
chronic disease is characteristically
increased<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.139> this<00:03:43.069> is<00:03:43.340> because<00:03:43.790> once<00:03:44.180> again

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
increased and this is because once again

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.020 
increased and this is because once again
the<00:03:45.079> body<00:03:45.319> has<00:03:45.650> tucked<00:03:46.009> away<00:03:46.220> as<00:03:46.459> much<00:03:46.669> iron<00:03:46.849> as

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
the body has tucked away as much iron as

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.689 
the body has tucked away as much iron as
possible<00:03:47.509> into<00:03:47.720> storage<00:03:48.319> okay<00:03:49.159> which<00:03:49.549> is

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
possible into storage okay which is

reflective of what you see with ferritin
so<00:03:52.459> really<00:03:52.759> there<00:03:52.939> are<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.030> couple<00:03:53.180> of

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
so really there are a couple of

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.059 
so really there are a couple of
differences<00:03:53.750> between<00:03:54.109> iron<00:03:54.530> deficiency

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
differences between iron deficiency

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.759 
differences between iron deficiency
anemia<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.699> anemia<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.209> chronic<00:03:56.269> disease

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
anemia and anemia of chronic disease

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.740 
anemia and anemia of chronic disease
firstly<00:03:57.769> iron<00:03:58.069> deficiency<00:03:58.669> anemia<00:03:59.120> is<00:03:59.239> really

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
firstly iron deficiency anemia is really

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.920 
firstly iron deficiency anemia is really
a<00:03:59.989> disease<00:04:00.829> of<00:04:00.859> total<00:04:01.609> body<00:04:01.849> depletion<00:04:02.750> of

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
a disease of total body depletion of

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.249 
a disease of total body depletion of
iron<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.829> these<00:04:04.609> lab<00:04:05.000> values<00:04:05.509> reflect<00:04:06.079> that

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:06.259 
iron and these lab values reflect that

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:07.990 
iron and these lab values reflect that
very<00:04:06.439> well<00:04:06.590> especially<00:04:06.799> the<00:04:07.370> ferritin<00:04:07.759> this

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
very well especially the ferritin this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.179 
very well especially the ferritin this
tells<00:04:08.299> you<00:04:08.419> that<00:04:08.449> there<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:08.810> no<00:04:09.229> iron<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:10.040> the

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
tells you that there is no iron in the

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.069 
tells you that there is no iron in the
body<00:04:10.370> not<00:04:10.790> even<00:04:10.849> in<00:04:11.180> storage<00:04:11.629> not<00:04:11.870> in<00:04:11.989> the

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
body not even in storage not in the

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.740 
body not even in storage not in the
blood<00:04:12.290> not<00:04:12.470> in<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.739> storage<00:04:13.009> not<00:04:13.280> anywhere

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
blood not in the storage not anywhere

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.719 
blood not in the storage not anywhere
anemia<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.780> chronic<00:04:14.840> disease<00:04:15.229> however<00:04:15.919> isn't

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
anemia of chronic disease however isn't

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.699 
anemia of chronic disease however isn't
necessarily<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.419> disease<00:04:17.840> where<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.139> have<00:04:18.440> a

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
necessarily a disease where you have a

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.580 
necessarily a disease where you have a
depletion<00:04:19.220> in<00:04:19.519> iron<00:04:19.870> instead<00:04:20.870> you'll<00:04:21.079> see<00:04:21.349> an

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
depletion in iron instead you'll see an

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.620 
depletion in iron instead you'll see an
increase<00:04:22.280> in<00:04:22.430> ferritin<00:04:22.849> so<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:23.180> tells<00:04:23.419> you

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
increase in ferritin so that tells you

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.120 
increase in ferritin so that tells you
that<00:04:23.840> there<00:04:24.289> is<00:04:24.380> iron<00:04:24.560> in<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.800> body

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
that there is iron in the body

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.750 
that there is iron in the body
it's<00:04:25.340> just<00:04:25.969> tucked<00:04:26.330> away<00:04:26.950> away<00:04:27.950> from<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.250> axe

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
it's just tucked away away from the axe

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.840 
it's just tucked away away from the axe
of<00:04:29.030> bacteria<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:29.780> inflammatory<00:04:30.140> cells<00:04:30.850> now

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
of bacteria and inflammatory cells now

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.880 
of bacteria and inflammatory cells now
also<00:04:32.690> another<00:04:33.140> difference<00:04:33.320> between<00:04:33.770> these

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
also another difference between these

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.430 
also another difference between these
two<00:04:34.100> diseases<00:04:34.370> is<00:04:34.730> that<00:04:35.300> in<00:04:35.540> a<00:04:35.690> in<00:04:35.930> iron

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
two diseases is that in a in iron

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.440 
two diseases is that in a in iron
deficiency<00:04:37.130> anemia<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.640> body<00:04:37.880> is<00:04:38.060> doing<00:04:38.270> is

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
deficiency anemia the body is doing is

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.630 
deficiency anemia the body is doing is
absolute<00:04:39.170> best<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.650> increase<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.190> amount<00:04:40.460> of

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
absolute best to increase the amount of

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.450 
absolute best to increase the amount of
iron<00:04:40.990> available<00:04:41.990> in<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.350> serum<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:42.890> you<00:04:43.250> see

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
iron available in the serum and you see

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.010 
iron available in the serum and you see
that<00:04:43.640> was<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:43.850> total<00:04:44.240> iron<00:04:44.420> binding<00:04:44.540> capacity

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
that was a total iron binding capacity

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.610 
that was a total iron binding capacity
it<00:04:45.950> increases<00:04:46.730> the<00:04:46.820> production<00:04:47.210> of

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
it increases the production of

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.110 
it increases the production of
transferrin<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.980> does<00:04:49.190> its<00:04:49.400> best<00:04:49.670> to<00:04:49.850> try<00:04:50.090> to

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
transferrin it does its best to try to

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.270 
transferrin it does its best to try to
bring<00:04:50.480> more<00:04:50.720> iron<00:04:51.020> into<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.590> body<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.040> into

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
bring more iron into the body and into

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.760 
bring more iron into the body and into
the<00:04:52.310> blood<00:04:52.900> however<00:04:53.900> an<00:04:54.230> anemia<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.680> chronic

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
the blood however an anemia of chronic

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.950 
the blood however an anemia of chronic
disease<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:56.060> body<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.420> trying<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.720> accomplish

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
disease the body is trying to accomplish

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.040 
disease the body is trying to accomplish
the<00:04:57.320> exact<00:04:57.830> opposite<00:04:58.550> it's<00:04:59.000> decreasing<00:04:59.780> its

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
the exact opposite it's decreasing its

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.810 
the exact opposite it's decreasing its
production<00:05:00.650> of<00:05:00.830> transferrin<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:01.730> you

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
production of transferrin so that you

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.030 
production of transferrin so that you
have<00:05:01.970> as<00:05:02.120> little<00:05:02.540> iron<00:05:02.930> as<00:05:03.230> possible<00:05:03.740> in<00:05:03.920> the

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
have as little iron as possible in the

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.460 
have as little iron as possible in the
serum<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.750> increased<00:05:05.750> ferritin<00:05:06.170> also

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
serum and the increased ferritin also

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.200 
serum and the increased ferritin also
reflects<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.340> body<00:05:07.520> is<00:05:07.640> trying<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:08.030> hide

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
reflects that the body is trying to hide

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.590 
reflects that the body is trying to hide
away<00:05:08.360> its<00:05:08.750> iron<00:05:09.020> in<00:05:09.320> storage<00:05:09.920> so<00:05:10.550> in<00:05:10.880> summary

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
away its iron in storage so in summary

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.850 
away its iron in storage so in summary
those<00:05:11.990> are<00:05:12.110> some<00:05:12.290> of<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.470> differences

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
those are some of the differences

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.620 
those are some of the differences
between<00:05:12.920> anemia<00:05:13.670> of<00:05:13.700> chronic<00:05:13.790> disease<00:05:14.420> and

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
between anemia of chronic disease and

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.960 
between anemia of chronic disease and
iron<00:05:14.990> deficiency<00:05:15.620> anemia<00:05:15.980> which<00:05:16.460> again<00:05:16.700> you

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
iron deficiency anemia which again you

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.090 
iron deficiency anemia which again you
really<00:05:17.330> rely<00:05:17.570> on<00:05:17.780> these<00:05:18.230> iron<00:05:18.470> studies<00:05:18.770> to

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
really rely on these iron studies to

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.950 
really rely on these iron studies to
differentiate<00:05:19.820> between<00:05:19.940> because<00:05:20.780> they

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
differentiate between because they

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.560 
differentiate between because they
present<00:05:21.470> very<00:05:21.860> similarly<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:23.060> important<00:05:23.510> to

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
present very similarly it's important to

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.940 
present very similarly it's important to
keep<00:05:23.660> in<00:05:23.780> mind<00:05:23.810> is<00:05:24.170> that<00:05:24.290> these<00:05:24.440> are<00:05:24.620> both

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
keep in mind is that these are both

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.540 
keep in mind is that these are both
microcytic<00:05:25.820> anemias
