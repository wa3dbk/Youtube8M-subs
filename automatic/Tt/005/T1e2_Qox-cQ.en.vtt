out<00:02:47.610> amongst<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> crowd<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> much<00:02:49.380> much

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
out amongst the crowd is a much much

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.210 
out amongst the crowd is a much much
harder<00:02:50.630> task<00:02:51.630> today<00:02:51.959> than<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.470> has<00:02:52.709> ever<00:02:53.100> been

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
harder task today than it has ever been

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.900 
harder task today than it has ever been
and<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.870> really<00:02:55.080> got<00:02:55.290> me<00:02:55.350> back<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.340> idea<00:02:56.790> of

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and it really got me back to the idea of

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.729 
and it really got me back to the idea of
branding<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.630> think<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.870> lot<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.080> times<00:02:58.410> in

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
branding and I think a lot of times in

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.120 
branding and I think a lot of times in
the<00:02:59.010> digital<00:02:59.790> space<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:01.260> know<00:03:01.380> Brandon<00:03:01.650> kind

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
the digital space you know Brandon kind

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.180 
the digital space you know Brandon kind
of<00:03:02.250> gets<00:03:02.430> lost<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.900> think<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:04.799> actually

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
of gets lost and I think it's actually

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.789 
of gets lost and I think it's actually
more<00:03:05.459> important<00:03:06.299> now<00:03:06.510> than<00:03:06.540> ever<00:03:06.930> because

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
more important now than ever because

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.190 
more important now than ever because
when<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:08.640> look<00:03:08.850> at<00:03:09.170> people<00:03:10.170> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
when you really look at people that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.350 
when you really look at people that
stand<00:03:10.709> out<00:03:10.950> today<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.400> don't<00:03:11.790> care<00:03:11.940> if<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.239> the

that week or that day and to me that is

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.699 
that week or that day and to me that is
a<00:04:04.590> rough<00:04:05.069> rough<00:04:05.760> road<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.480> travel<00:04:06.810> when<00:04:07.560> you're

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
a rough rough road to travel when you're

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.340 
a rough rough road to travel when you're
really<00:04:08.069> trying<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.640> be<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.329> differentiator<00:04:10.109> in

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
really trying to be a differentiator in

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.059 
really trying to be a differentiator in
your<00:04:10.470> business<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.970> have<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> few<00:04:13.069> points

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
your business so I have a few points

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.849 
your business so I have a few points
that<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.250> think<00:04:14.519> that<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.850> can<00:04:15.289> take<00:04:16.289> back<00:04:16.620> with

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
that I think that you can take back with

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.500 
that I think that you can take back with
you<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.340> are<00:04:17.489> going<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.760> that's<00:04:18.180> going<00:04:18.419> to

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
you that are going to that's going to

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.479 
you that are going to that's going to
help<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.810> differentiate<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.799> think<00:04:20.070> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
help you differentiate and I think the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.420 
help you differentiate and I think the
main<00:04:20.850> one<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:22.640> understand<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:24.620> discover

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
main one is to understand and discover

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.600 
main one is to understand and discover
you<00:04:26.699> stand<00:04:27.000> for<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:28.080> once<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:28.949> figure<00:04:29.400> that

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
you stand for and once you figure that

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.219 
you stand for and once you figure that
out<00:04:30.410> then<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:31.620> need<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:31.979> take<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.490> idea<00:04:32.789> and

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
out then you need to take that idea and

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.860 
out then you need to take that idea and
what<00:04:34.229> you<00:04:34.380> stand<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.660> communicate<00:04:36.660> that

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
what you stand for and communicate that

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.850 
what you stand for and communicate that
consistently<00:04:37.860> in<00:04:38.360> everything<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.389> you<00:04:39.570> do

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
consistently in everything that you do

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.680 
consistently in everything that you do
because<00:04:40.860> that's<00:04:41.310> going<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.789> allow<00:04:41.940> your<00:04:42.419> voice

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
because that's going to allow your voice

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.620 
because that's going to allow your voice
to<00:04:42.990> be<00:04:43.020> heard<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:43.650> people<00:04:44.460> will<00:04:44.970> be<00:04:45.120> engaged
