00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.629

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.610
 the warmth begins the summer begins 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.290
 and what do we think of the amount of 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.179
 music festivals there are festivals 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.250
 neighborhoods to which we want to go good already 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.960
 you know there is a dress code 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.550
 for these festivals and I'm going to give you 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.140
 a few tricks of how to do it with clothes 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.100
 of the store leave capital division 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.100
 let's start 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.740
 for this first look chosen the color 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.180
 front as fundamental to the look and 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.470
 I also combine it with accessories in 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.599
 black color let's start with the 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.010
 shirt a shirt that you can pick up 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.450
 for example inside a cowboy or that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.520
 if not you can also let loose 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.870
 because it's a pretty long shirt 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.030
 but I to teach you a little the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.559
 combination I've decided to put it inside 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.360
 for the head to keep the hair 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.040
 cleared and have it well collected 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.450
 chosen a handkerchief from the many there 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.430
 in the harley davison store capital and 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.470
 this time here in garnet with the 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.390
 head to finish the look chosen a 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.470
 black bag with fringes and also some 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.470
 complex black boots 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.070
 in that second we change our eyes for 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.870
 a miniskirt as you see the combined in 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.240
 a black color with a shirt that is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.040
 black and blue above 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.390
 vest this vest plus a part 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.830

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.670
 chacÃ³n milita eight hours and with the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.670

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.850
 as the chosen bag is in silver that 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.469
 you can carry it like that on one shoulder or 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.469
 cross oslo as a shoulder bag 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.380
 we go with the third of the looks in 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.210
 this case again with the miniskirt 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.800
 black but on the top in 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.480
 instead of a shirt I opted for a 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.860
 black bodice that also has 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.570
 excellent very finite with which 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.610
 perfect for the heat that usually makes 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.990
 in these festivals as accessories of 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.450
 new boots with fringes that I 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.160
 They love a little silver bag and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.110
 worn like that in the shoulder bag and then 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.850
 you know that it is usually quite hot and 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.260
 that the sun hits a lot with what is 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.360
 a good time for you to get 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.360
 for example, a cowboy hat 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.610
 I hope you liked it and see you
