00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.699
 hello backstage hello from the computex 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.920
 in taipei we are here with acer 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.539
 at the end of the press conference and what 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.019
 we showed today is under 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.499
 another that here is a smart pad 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:26.509
 great smartphone flick with s1 and that 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:29.989
 key feature is 57 inches 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.810
 large display that has 1280 x 720 pixels 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:36.170
 So is hd-ready so completely not 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.760
 keep up with the upper class of 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.560
 current smartphones that even at 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.550
 smaller display diagonal full hd 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.770
 can represent 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.280
 one would speak in pixels 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.740
 pixel density of 257 epi bettina displays 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.540
 from iphone have around the 330 that is 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.030
 Of course, more is that now 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.860
 Do not disturb here, you can not speak 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.960
 change recognize the picture also looks 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.440
 no reason to complain that 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.120
 makes a pretty decent impression 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.670
 above the display we have a 2 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.580
 megapixel camera with bsi sensor 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.430
 and an opening angle of 88 degrees that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.110
 is exactly what htc us at 8x at that time 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.759
 first introduced in windows phone 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.450
 So it's kind of a wide angle 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.700
 camera 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.770
 The idea behind it is actually quite 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.939
 just now you can see the shepherds 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.500
 and you do not just see the stefan 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.590
 but you also see a lot 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.250
 outside around because of this 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.960
 Wide angle lens captures the camera 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.920
 just more space 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.920
 you can get easier 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.680
 it is easier to take group pictures 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.660
 make or self-portraits on the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 back we have an 8 megapixel 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.670
 camera with photo led and otherwise the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.369
 from us for a short time the housing 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.080
 on the front dominates the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.850
 glass pane and parts of the display sits 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.580
 Frame can not be here 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.880
 really say the frames around the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.350
 Displays are relatively wide and big here 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.330
 pulls out a frame of plastic 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.159
 lacquered plastic in black 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.740
 shiny so a little piano lacquer 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.209
 I always have design for the material 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.100
 so a bit of the fear that will 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.050
 dull with time and if you can 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.010
 Somewhere against that comes I do that 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.870
 not now even better 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.280
 then the paint bursts and underneath 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.660
 it will be more secure 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.250
 Probably knows it looks 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.750
 probably marketed fairly quickly 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.730
 but the same applies 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.950
 Conveniently not for the back 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.650
 This was also made of plastic but it is 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.720
 a rubberized slightly rubberized black 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.799
 Surface makes you feel that way 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.580
 neat 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.930
 that made a very good impression 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.720
 besides, we still have links here and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.819
 right two elements 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.590
 that could be even metal that provide 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.690
 however, for contrast and that looks too 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.920
 very good and we have integrated 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.959
 here on the right side the joke 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.420
 switch for volume control and 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.420
 on the left the one of key 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.950
 which we unfortunately is not on 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.720
 explicit trigger for the camera 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.250
 on the top still the three 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.640
 Products millimeter jack 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.319
 on the bottom of the micro USB socket 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.300
 for the transmission of data as well as for 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.670
 Charging the battery and an intervention 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.950
 with the one akkudeckel too 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.290
 can open the battery here it is 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.390
 just white letters but that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.720
 datasheet reveals and 2400 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.160
 milliard hours that is relatively much 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.540
 compared to most others 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.090
 Of course, smartphones had to 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.709
 also say that the device is a very 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.890
 has big display and accordingly 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.970
 a decent battery hunger 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.090
 will bring 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.190
 This money has two SIM card slots 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.700
 the device will create something in germany 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.720
 should probably only have one 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.099
 otherwise the software is still available 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.420
 what to say has some serious ones 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.180
 have thought 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.019
 in android 4.2 with its own 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.380
 surface 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.910
 which is very close to vanilla 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.400
 android, for example, can be seen in the 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.829
 about there is no difference 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.110
 what for example on the next equipment so 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.319
 But he is doing what he did 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.459
 this idea that hurt that one 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.069
 to get closer 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.030
 There is this task switcher here 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.000
 I like android 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.230
 4.2 usually just the 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.300
 applications can change 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.859
 if I press that but long I have 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.889
 Below is the selection of four 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.660
 I moderate multitasking applications 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.419
 can put in the foreground that is 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.660
 So here's the camera app the map 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.290
 calculator and notepad and when 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.150
 I now, for example, one 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.620
 Calculator I have a window like 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.810
 under windows what can move 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.400
 what can use and i have 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.960
 at the same time in the background my 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.460
 normal android app on the run 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.460
 the idea is not stupid 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.090
 I do that in practice though 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.680
 I really do not need to be there yet 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.660
 so convinced because I know 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.000
 yes , just press down there and 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.670
 go directly to the calculator and 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.120
 has the then synonymous in full screen in 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.860
 foreground of the card I can 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.540
 that's not very well imagined 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.760
 in this example at betrays none 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.220
 Internet connection fair typical therefore 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.510
 you would normally have here now in 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.980
 see web that is probably even 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.210
 not stupid when you're on the go to 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.120
 navigate to also make us the 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.960
 window size can at least reduce 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.030
 a little bit 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.530
 So I would always have my card 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.960
 in the foreground and what else is there 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.880
 ingenious in the idea but in the 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.720
 Unfortunately, practice is not easy at all 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.460
 this is a note so i can go here 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.139
 just something fast in the foreground 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.830
 for example, write hello 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.780
 at 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.220
 and now I have the first hook for 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.560
 everything fully written i had one 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.230
 open a new page for the third word 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.110
 to write namely text age and me 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.670
 I do not know any nice writing though 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.710
 on the display with the fingers I do 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.150
 It's harder for me 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.950
 you write at least legibly 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.080
 Write and what else just too 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.970
 there is no pen I here 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.460
 could buy with white pen 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.290
 the one with capacitive touchscreens 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.480
 works but I want it then 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.620
 attached somewhere 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.390
 the inner values ​​are on the 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.670
 ordinary level degree core processor 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.630
 with 1 5 ghz and 1 gigabyte 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.710
 random access memory 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.910
 There are 8 GB of internal memory from 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.970
 which is probably realistic 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.130
 somewhere between 4 and a maximum of five 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.350
 gigabyte actually for the user 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.210
 usable but there is still one 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.090
 micro sd memory card slot under the 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.180
 battery cover where you have the capacity for 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.770
 videos music etc just expand 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.510
 can 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.790
 in that sense, the total makes that 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.680
 liquid is a decent one 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.810
 impression especially for the fans of 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.860
 such large displays also prevent 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.080
 already determined myself 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.640
 that has been strong in the past 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.680
 slimmed down that's what 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.440
 actually just so by that 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.700
 even normal smartphones wien galaxy s 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.550
 14 47 inches tall are the 57 inches 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.500
 of the acer liquid s1 is actually 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.500
 not so elephant anymore 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.870
 it has just reached an information 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.370
 the flick will one day come 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.790
 makes things interesting and interesting 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.320
 is the price 350 euros would like it for 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.810
 have this device when it is in 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.550
 August comes to Germany August is 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.710
 Of course a bit late is a foot 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.970
 much water the Isar sprayer eien 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.410
 and high down but nevertheless 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.970
 his 50 euro is of course one 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.950
 fight for a device with such a 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.700
 equipment of this size and with 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.700
 this display 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.490
 there is a second version with 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.110
 this is at least announced 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.300
 not yet determined which to Germany 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.110
 comes only from those without or those with or 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.729
 even both 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.860
 and unfortunately not quite so 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:43.750
 It is clear whether you donate there somewhere 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.720
 can just plug in or if he just 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.250
 as an accessory with in the carton that would be 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.050
 of course, if it is here then 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.319
 somewhere again give a thrust 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.319
 5
