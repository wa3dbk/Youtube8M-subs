00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.090
 it continues with the done or with 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.170
 the trophies and the rangers 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.990
 invisible of metro 2033 like dax and 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.500
 to get these two successes 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.980
 do you have the level the front 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.999
 repeat and on the one hand no 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.659
 kill and on the other side so for 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:31.640
 the second takes place a group of red 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:33.530
 get rid of the fascists so ride 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.030
 is here by train and then land in 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.130
 this one i have to say to myself 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.130
 am the whole on normal is called the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.930
 easiest difficulty and still 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.240
 this is a spartan mode that means me 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.870
 can sneak louder or read 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.770
 devious 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.730
 they do not know me so fast 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.350
 that's why it's easy, so to speak 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.090
 most possible variant I now 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.329
 Having chosen exactly means if you 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.320
 sneaks then you are almost silent 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.649
 they can not fit with higher ones 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.249
 turns off the light of a lamp and 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:12.049
 always sneaks along here 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:14.509
 Here I have always worked here, unfortunately 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.710
 fallen down again but I think 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.710
 that creates her get it out to her 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.090
 just here the pipes in cross-country 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:25.850
 it works as it were under the front end 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.200
 through without somehow acting in the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.200
 closeness comes to kill people 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.009
 the only thing you can do if 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.869
 it somehow gets tight you can do it 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.999
 switch off melee so I can 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.979
 on the one hand to kill with the stick and 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:44.929
 you can use the other button 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.299
 turn off that does not kill, so to speak 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.389
 but only out of combat-set the 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.189
 You are allowed to make gas mask down here 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:55.969
 sit up and watch 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.279
 These are some fall when the light 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.319
 of lamps and then it does 

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:03.549
 easier to recognize that I have 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.549
 forget it here at the beginning 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.920
 You can not be down there either 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.660
 run great because just kind of 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.530
 always green here to the yellow lights 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.569
 not after that 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.150
 these are no enemies that just 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.379
 only a few fall now I'm up 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.769
 The idea is the light 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.769
 to turn 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:35.060
 yes and so bypasses the hardest part 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:38.019
 the whole mission only a few 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.019
 switch off 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:59.390
 and then come back then again 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:03:04.060
 out there you can again your gas mask 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.800
 also settle if you are up for it 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.890
 here love makes or gets out otherwise 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.580
 easy to see and here I come 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.650
 also equal to the second success so 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.160
 rescue rain for not kill here 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.540
 but turn off square or 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.519
 at the xbox moment would have to let me 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.580
 think 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.580
 ixs to not kill those 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.400
 That's how we come to the second 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.670
 still succeed if you do not 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.019
 kills so only fights puts here 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.320
 Turn off the lights and then the stairs 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.320
 high 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.349
 you do not need the light here 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:01.670
 I have to switch it off anyway 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:05.550
 Power goes right down here 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.110
 take care that there is nobody on the top left 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.890
 then you could theoretically also in 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.890
 Sprint long 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.449
 this is where you have to pay attention 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:35.539
 in time to go to cover 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.879
 this dare just left somewhere 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:41.870
 Run in the pass and 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:43.180
 is good if you ask yourself in general 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.460
 why open it with me 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.779
 So why the video is so bright I have 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.909
 the brightness is higher with it 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.199
 the good with you it would normally 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:55.060
 be a bit darker 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:58.689
 but otherwise hardly any knowledge of the video 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.689
 so do not be surprised 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:08.080
 this is almost the place right now 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.909
 critical part 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.590
 but because I also play and normal 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.509
 it is not a spartan mode either 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.279
 problem actually here if I am myself 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.069
 been hiding something quite safe 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:22.389
 but to the emergency on normal pensions easy 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.389
 continue and it is not a problem 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.280
 So here, either waiting for the 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.140
 over or over then runs 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.090
 continue straight and then turn left 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.040
 or if you have not been that patient since 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.230
 switched off again so do not kill so 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.660
 do not press on the stick but only 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:48.490
 switch off and yes you should do that 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.440
 two have already done it 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.970
 open the doors and you get the 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:59.800
 second success of the invisible success 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.870
 or prof i hope i could you 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.580
 if yes can help me 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.760
 Subscribe or facebook 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.750
 stop by or watch the other videos 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.330
 look at 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.250
 link from facebook and from the playlist 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.610
 is in the description until the next 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.270
 times 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.270
 ciao
