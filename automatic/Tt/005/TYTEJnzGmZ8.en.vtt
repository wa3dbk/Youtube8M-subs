00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.650
 the mass principle that these 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.420
 solar type technologies to 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.400
 concentration is that we actually 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.260
 produces heat from the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.550
 sun radiation you do not take 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.230
 directly it exists and you can 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.489
 the heat and the heat ben it's 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.750
 something that is stored enough 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.190
 easily so in fact we can always 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.170
 continue to produce energy 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.930
 even when there is more sun it is 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.239
 a series of reflecting mirrors 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.520
 the light these mirrors actually rotates 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.809
 on their axis to follow exactly and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.390
 very precisely the race to the sun 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 during the whole day so that the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.899
 reflection is done perfectly on the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.489
 part to this water intake in this 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.870
 receiving part there is a tube that is 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.180
 traveled by water the water is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.829
 warmed by the rays of the sun that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.930
 focuses on and then transforms 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.199
 in steam and so we have in the end we have a 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.140
 solar steam boiler the resource 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.619
 solar will condition the production of 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.540
 the power plant 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.310
 so it's very important for them 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.700
 project developers to know 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.990
 exactly the solar potential of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.729
 some regions for everything 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.759
 implementation of project financing 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.979
 behind we are here on the clim pilot 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.080
 so from a pilot of solar power plants to 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.119
 concentration that allows us to do 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.640
 of research and development so we 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.560
 try different docks his mirror 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.310
 different receivers to optimize the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.130
 technology for the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.560
 the icare project that also flew on 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.220
 the prediction of the measure of the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 solar resource 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.799
 so it will be done especially with with 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.450
 hermine paristech our contribution in this 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.090
 project there it is in the characterization 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.640
 of the solar resource which is the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.979
 convertible into electrical energy by the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.689
 systems like this in our 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.429
 research lab from imaged 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.570
 satellites more particularly 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.030
 theological imagery 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.369
 so it's satellites that are 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.679
 placed in geostationary orbit 36 ​​km 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.240
 of the earth and which have a persistence 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.979
 observing the earth with a 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.500
 resolution currently with meteosat 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.840
 second generation a resolution of 3 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.670
 km and from this analysis of these 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.980
 images there one conducts analyzes that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.140
 allow derivatives the resource 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.180
 solar incident on the ground in every respect 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.470
 of the globe which is seen by meteosat in 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.540
 cases of solar projects 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.310
 the investment is essentially to 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.989
 part maintenance at the very beginning of 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.590
 project and so is strongly 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.030
 capitalistic financial viability 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.220
 such a project requires a certain 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.880
 number of information and in particular on 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.420
 the importance 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.560
 it is stable 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.590
 of the solar resource that is going to be 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.959
 operated a room like this so it's 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.569
 the object of the project icare for our party 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.220
 it's using instruments like 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.989
 that which measures extremely 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.550
 specifies the direct radiation so he 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.650
 this is the worst elio m and so the idea 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.450
 it's using these measures on the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.720
 short term at the project location 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.459
 selected to combine these metrics 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.260
 there and our satellite estimates 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.959
 determine correction functions 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.670
 satellite estimates to go up 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.250
 to a long-term a long-term series 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.140
 from satellites but calibrated by 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.739
 Short-term measures provided by 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.840
 this instrument solar energy 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.780
 thermodynamics implements two of 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.730
 core activities which are controlled 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.870
 by the company clean is the mechanics 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.350
 and the thermal 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.680
 there are today in the world 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.260
 nearly 3 gigawatts of this technology in 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.940
 service when we find 100 gigawatts of 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.680
 photovoltaic or singing gigawatts 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.690
 wind energy so we're on a technology 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.450
 who is becoming 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.120
 we are at the beginning of its development 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.579
 the big advantage is that we see it on 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.380
 the pilot who is behind me actually 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.739
 only materials are used 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.420
 extremely simple glass of steel 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.340
 we do not use technologies 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.660
 owners 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.850
 we are not dependent on suppliers 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.040
 outside we can develop fully 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.260
 technology at home and for 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.840
 countries that will receive it 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.760
 we can use a good part of 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.730
 local labor subcontracting 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.590
 local and that's what is a huge 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.060
 advantage over compared to 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.500
 other technologies are 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.720
 much more proprietary technologies 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.840
 where we are extremely dependent on 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.840
 imports
