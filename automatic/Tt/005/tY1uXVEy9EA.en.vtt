00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.620 
like really doesn't matter tell us ring
down<00:02:12.959> less<00:02:13.380> wet<00:02:13.590> spring<00:02:14.160> down<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.270> fold<00:02:15.480> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
down less wet spring down and I fold it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.870 
down less wet spring down and I fold it
in<00:02:15.690> half<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.110> just<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:16.470> happens<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.190> fit

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
in half and you just so happens to fit

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.020 
in half and you just so happens to fit
flat<00:02:18.180> mom<00:02:18.620> what<00:02:19.620> I'm<00:02:19.709> going<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.890> do<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.700> there's

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
flat mom what I'm going to do is there's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.100 
flat mom what I'm going to do is there's
a<00:02:21.120> simple<00:02:21.270> technique

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
a simple technique

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.620 
a simple technique
you<00:02:22.530> run<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.220> mop<00:02:23.430> along<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> perimeter<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
you run the mop along the perimeter and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.110 
you run the mop along the perimeter and
then<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.620> go<00:02:25.769> back<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.640> follow<00:02:26.880> up<00:02:26.970> with

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
then you go back and you follow up with

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.259 
then you go back and you follow up with
in<00:02:27.420> what<00:02:27.989> we<00:02:28.110> call<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> s<00:02:28.590> powder<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.790> I'll

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
in what we call the s powder so I'll

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.460 
in what we call the s powder so I'll
just<00:02:30.450> quickly<00:02:30.630> demonstrate<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.989> always<00:02:34.260> want

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
just quickly demonstrate you always want

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.540 
just quickly demonstrate you always want
to<00:02:34.590> drag<00:02:34.980> them<00:02:35.280> up<00:02:35.489> in<00:02:35.849> one<00:02:36.450> direction<00:02:37.550> never

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
to drag them up in one direction never

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:50.150 
to drag them up in one direction never
going<00:02:39.000> back<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.420> forth<00:02:48.799> we're<00:02:49.799> just<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.130> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
going back and forth we're just going to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.440 
going back and forth we're just going to
do<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.459> small<00:02:50.700> section<00:02:51.180> right<00:02:51.330> here<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:54.269> now

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
do this small section right here so now

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.089 
do this small section right here so now
I've<00:02:54.540> done<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.840> perimeter<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.709> I'm<00:02:55.860> going<00:02:56.040> to

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
I've done the perimeter and I'm going to

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.550 
I've done the perimeter and I'm going to
go<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.430> farthest<00:02:56.910> point<00:02:57.000> now<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.410> do

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
go to the farthest point now and just do

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.370 
go to the farthest point now and just do
my<00:03:01.739> S<00:03:01.950> pattern<00:03:04.250> now<00:03:05.250> before<00:03:05.880> that's<00:03:06.120> dirty<00:03:06.480> you

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
my S pattern now before that's dirty you

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.270 
my S pattern now before that's dirty you
may<00:03:07.590> have<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.920> do<00:03:08.130> this<00:03:08.840> two<00:03:09.840> times<00:03:11.570> or<00:03:12.570> three

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
may have to do this two times or three

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.710 
may have to do this two times or three
but<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> more<00:03:14.579> often<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.030> do<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:17.720> better

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
but the more often you do it the better

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:29.220 
but the more often you do it the better
your<00:03:18.959> forward<00:03:19.260> will<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:26.569> well

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
your forward will of well

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.960 
your forward will of well
and<00:03:29.739> there<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.040> have<00:03:30.099> it<00:03:30.250> that's<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.940> that's

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
and there you have it that's it that's

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.580 
and there you have it that's it that's
how<00:03:31.300> you<00:03:31.330> clean<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.720> hardwood<00:03:32.110> floors<00:03:32.349> it's

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
how you clean the hardwood floors it's

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.259 
how you clean the hardwood floors it's
pretty<00:03:32.830> simple<00:03:33.220> as<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.489> can<00:03:33.670> see<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:34.060> took

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
pretty simple as you can see that took

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.930 
pretty simple as you can see that took
literally<00:03:34.870> less<00:03:35.110> than<00:03:35.140> one<00:03:35.590> minute<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:36.069> do<00:03:36.250> you

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
literally less than one minute to do you

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.020 
literally less than one minute to do you
should<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.269> able<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.569> do<00:03:38.220> 500<00:03:39.220> feet<00:03:39.459> and

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
should be able to do 500 feet and

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.839 
should be able to do 500 feet and
without<00:03:40.360> exaggeration<00:03:40.989> in<00:03:41.920> five<00:03:42.310> minutes<00:03:42.670> or

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
without exaggeration in five minutes or

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.569 
without exaggeration in five minutes or
less<00:03:43.230> okay<00:03:44.230> thank<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:44.920> much<00:03:45.390> good<00:03:46.390> luck
