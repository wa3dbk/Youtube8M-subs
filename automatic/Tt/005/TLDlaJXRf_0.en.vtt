00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
sick in this tutorial now don't forget

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.999 
sick in this tutorial now don't forget
to<00:02:05.880> sew<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.930> sides<00:02:07.170> over<00:02:07.410> here<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.740> used<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
to sew up the sides over here I used to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.380 
to sew up the sides over here I used to
blend<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> stitch<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.970> use<00:02:09.149> of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
blend the stitch you can just use of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.600 
blend the stitch you can just use of
felt<00:02:09.660> stitch<00:02:09.899> now<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.800> rapid<00:02:10.979> thing<00:02:11.370> I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
felt stitch now for the rapid thing I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.700 
felt stitch now for the rapid thing I
decided<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.720> cut<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.020> straight<00:02:13.350> line<00:02:13.530> across

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
decided to cut a straight line across

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.950 
decided to cut a straight line across
because<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:15.150> easier<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.600> way<00:02:15.780> to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
because I think it's easier that way to

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.170 
because I think it's easier that way to
sew<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.320> on<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:17.130> no<00:02:17.310> idea<00:02:17.550> how<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
sew it on I have no idea how I got the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.240 
sew it on I have no idea how I got the
idea<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.480> making<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.350> little<00:02:19.620> sharp<00:02:20.070> edge

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
idea of making that little sharp edge

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.280 
idea of making that little sharp edge
over<00:02:20.520> them<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.880> once<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.240> cut<00:02:22.080> your

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
over them so once you have cut your

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.510 
over them so once you have cut your
piece<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.620> should<00:02:22.800> look<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.280> and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
piece it should look like that and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.100 
piece it should look like that and
you're<00:02:23.820> just<00:02:23.940> going<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> fix<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.660> using

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
you're just going to fix it on using

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.020 
you're just going to fix it on using
fell<00:02:25.680> stitches<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.340> should<00:02:26.580> stand<00:02:26.910> up

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
fell stitches and it should stand up

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.020 
fell stitches and it should stand up
straight<00:02:27.420> once<00:02:27.930> you're<00:02:28.140> done<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.880> is
