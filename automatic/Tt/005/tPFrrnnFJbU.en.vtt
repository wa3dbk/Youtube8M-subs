you're really daring on fire without the
burning<00:00:17.820> alright<00:00:18.820> for<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.150> solution<00:00:19.689> you'll

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
burning alright for the solution you'll

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.350 
burning alright for the solution you'll
need<00:00:20.290> a<00:00:20.590> half<00:00:21.070> cup<00:00:21.099> of<00:00:21.490> water<00:00:22.230> some<00:00:23.230> salt<00:00:24.360> some

need a half cup of water some salt some
rubbing<00:00:25.689> alcohol<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:26.349> weeks<00:00:26.829> since<00:00:27.040> we<00:00:27.250> use

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
rubbing alcohol and weeks since we use

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.890 
rubbing alcohol and weeks since we use
70%<00:00:28.300> we<00:00:28.900> did<00:00:29.050> 34<00:00:29.680> so<00:00:29.919> 3/4<00:00:30.730> cup<00:00:30.939> plus<00:00:31.869> 2

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
70% we did 34 so 3/4 cup plus 2

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.250 
70% we did 34 so 3/4 cup plus 2
tablespoons<00:00:32.169> a<00:00:33.840> paper<00:00:34.840> or<00:00:35.170> some<00:00:35.620> money<00:00:35.829> a

lighter metal tongs and the bowl for the

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.639 
lighter metal tongs and the bowl for the
solution<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.640> of<00:00:43.269> course<00:00:43.539> some<00:00:44.140> overflow

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
solution and of course some overflow

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.669 
solution and of course some overflow
water<00:00:44.859> in<00:00:45.190> case<00:00:45.430> anything<00:00:45.940> goes<00:00:46.090> wrong<00:00:46.679> so

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
water in case anything goes wrong so

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.000 
water in case anything goes wrong so
what<00:00:47.890> you<00:00:48.010> want<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.309> do<00:00:48.489> is<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.620> want<00:00:50.769> to<00:00:50.829> mix

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
what you want to do is you want to mix

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.970 
what you want to do is you want to mix
up<00:00:51.219> a<00:00:51.340> solution<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:53.579> take<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:56.019> money<00:00:56.440> or<00:00:56.829> the

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
up a solution and take the money or the

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.340 
up a solution and take the money or the
paper<00:00:57.160> and<00:00:57.489> soak<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.449> in<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.629> solution<00:00:58.929> until

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
paper and soak it in a solution until

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.849 
paper and soak it in a solution until
it's<00:00:59.679> pretty<00:01:00.100> pretty<00:01:00.820> soaked<00:01:01.239> in<00:01:01.420> there<00:01:01.600> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
it's pretty pretty soaked in there and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.240 
it's pretty pretty soaked in there and
then<00:01:02.859> you<00:01:03.309> can<00:01:03.429> actually<00:01:03.850> light<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:04.210> on<00:01:04.330> fire

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
then you can actually light it on fire

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.960 
then you can actually light it on fire
because<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:07.590> fire<00:01:08.590> actually<00:01:09.220> burns<00:01:09.460> off<00:01:09.730> the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
because the fire actually burns off the

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.790 
because the fire actually burns off the
alcohol<00:01:10.150> on<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.990> surface<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.680> object

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
alcohol on the surface of the object

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.530 
alcohol on the surface of the object
while<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.490> water<00:01:12.700> protects<00:01:13.240> it<00:01:13.360> from

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
while the water protects it from

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:21.770 
while the water protects it from
actually<00:01:14.140> burning<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.700> here<00:01:16.180> I'll<00:01:16.360> show<00:01:16.570> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.330 

so<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.870> want<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.080> get<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.320> soaked<00:01:23.830> in<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:27.190> just

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
so you want to get it soaked in and just

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:37.830 
so you want to get it soaked in and just
leave<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:27.700> in<00:01:27.760> there<00:01:27.910> for<00:01:27.970> a<00:01:28.180> little<00:01:28.270> bit

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.139 

you<00:01:38.840> don't<00:01:39.049> want<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.259> take<00:01:39.409> your<00:01:39.560> tongs<00:01:39.829> so<00:01:40.250> you

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
you don't want to take your tongs so you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.359 
you don't want to take your tongs so you
don't<00:01:41.299> burn<00:01:41.450> your<00:01:41.600> hand<00:01:42.040> because<00:01:43.040> your<00:01:43.189> hands

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
don't burn your hand because your hands

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.130 
don't burn your hand because your hands
will<00:01:43.610> have<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.820> solution<00:01:44.240> on<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.390> too<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:44.990> that

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
will have the solution on it too so that

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.800 
will have the solution on it too so that
could<00:01:45.290> catch<00:01:45.500> on<00:01:45.649> fire<00:01:46.329> and<00:01:47.329> you<00:01:47.420> want<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.659> hold

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
could catch on fire and you want to hold

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.219 
could catch on fire and you want to hold
it<00:01:47.960> over<00:01:48.110> until<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:48.979> lights<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.899> see<00:01:50.899> how<00:01:51.049> it's

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
it over until it lights and see how it's

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.139 
it over until it lights and see how it's
on<00:01:51.380> fire<00:01:51.619> but<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.159> paper<00:01:52.369> isn't<00:01:52.820> actually

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
on fire but the paper isn't actually

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.510 
on fire but the paper isn't actually
burning<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.659> you<00:01:54.380> can<00:01:54.530> toss<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.280> water

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
burning and you can toss it in the water

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.320 
burning and you can toss it in the water
but<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.210> alcohol<00:01:56.360> will<00:01:56.899> eventually<00:01:57.530> burn<00:01:57.740> off

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
but the alcohol will eventually burn off

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.940 
but the alcohol will eventually burn off
after<00:01:59.330> this<00:01:59.509> happens<00:01:59.960> don't<00:02:00.470> put<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.920> money

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
after this happens don't put the money

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.340 
after this happens don't put the money
back<00:02:01.340> because<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.880> alcohol<00:02:02.329> has<00:02:02.539> already<00:02:03.049> dry

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
back because the alcohol has already dry

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.850 
back because the alcohol has already dry
has<00:02:03.799> already<00:02:04.250> burned<00:02:04.549> off<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:06.649> money

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
has already burned off and the money

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.070 
has already burned off and the money
will<00:02:07.039> actually<00:02:07.429> light<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.939> go<00:02:08.630> up<00:02:08.720> in<00:02:08.840> flames

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
will actually light and go up in flames

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.830 
will actually light and go up in flames
so<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:12.140> hope<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.530> enjoyed<00:02:12.799> my<00:02:12.830> tutorial<00:02:13.040> and
