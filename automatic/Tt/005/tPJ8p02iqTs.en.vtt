00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
form of fire-making I don't care if it's

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.809 
form of fire-making I don't care if it's
the<00:02:22.909> lighter<00:02:23.209> matches<00:02:23.870> anything<00:02:24.829> magnesium

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
you're going into the woods because you

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.069
