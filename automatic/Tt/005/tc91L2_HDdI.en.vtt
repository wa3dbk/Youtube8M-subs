00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.150
 the outermost, the farthest from the sun of terrestrial horror-type planets 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.119
 show zero cost 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.119
 dominate essentially rocks the city car 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.530
 Mars 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 a little smaller picture of the earth 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.290
 larger than mercury and about one third of the earth both in size and as 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.100
 severity 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 unlike the land and Venus 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.800
 te ahahah an atmosphere 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.420
 it was much much longer 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.590
 because honestly it does not have a magnetic field 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.070
 mumble novara a magnetic field bearing the main thing that shields it 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.740
 very little from the wind 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.180
 solar wind then 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.180
 responsible partly for ablation 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070
 then a month of 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.140
 elimination 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.260
 and i lady atmospheric part part photo atomos tera 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.310
 and for a high revenge of ionizing radiation on the surface 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.310
 of mars itself 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.720
 situation therefore of a very tenuous atmosphere 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.720
 hey there 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.320
 the distance from the sun 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.280
 not that the the fact that the sila sahin art very similar to that of the earth 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.620
 they make various effects from the appearance that the seasons have on Mars 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.600
 seasons, however, must take into account the fact that the Martian year aldo 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.670
 they will vote terrestrial because they hate mars 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.290
 the movies in fold for twice the time compared to earth for I run a soave 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.200
 around the sun 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 and at the same time makes the temperatures 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.410
 minimum maximums are much lower than that of the earth 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.859
 maximum temperatures r rise to some grateful above zero 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.139
 in the Martian summer in the areas 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.260
 equatorial 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.639
 milano fish 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.249
 way around - 100 degrees celsius 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.620
 and during the winter and also 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.260
 over up to at least 142 143 polar people 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.920
 newborn mars to two polar couples 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.790
 in fact it is a little flat with the terrestrial ones of annual coaches in particular 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.879
 the southern polar cotta and that is the + freezer and 2 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.519
 reaches winter temperatures sufficiently low so even the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.519
 years of cv2 arborio 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.279
 prisci life in the form of old condenses 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:53.479
 forming a layer of ice from what I know of dry ice 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.719
 on the surface of ice water above 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.149
 when it appears 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:03.319
 that approaches the sharp spring the Martian summer this part 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.949
 you like it subliminal evaporates to be more precise 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.799
 that fits sim and - evening 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.620
 for these moments when the atmospheres of mars change quite sufficiently 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.859
 sudden 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.669
 which matches 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:19.919
 more or less 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.919
 at the beginning of the sea sand storm season 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.230
 but it is still not very clear 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.080
 the mechanism does not yet know enough about the mechanism after these 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.059
 dust storms are generated 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:37.589
 we know that 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.409
 re may also have global scale to fill first across the planet 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:48.449
 part peoples know that they are very high or are sands that do not remain 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.829
 at the height of his illness, mosfet a Martian is very alternated 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:53.670
 why 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.630
 despite the fact that in the end 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.810
 at least one optical observation totally shields the surface of mars 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.019
 observation 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.749
 despite this the end to 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:03.759
 it's a lot 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:04.939
 very thin 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.469
 and therefore and therefore also very high 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.839
 we know little of moretti and indeed one of the main arguments 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:16.459
 of study in the next space missions in particular in the first one 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.069
 of the two missions 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.019
 die somar sector to characterize 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.059
 mars during 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:26.819
 tropical storms because of lamellas to see how much they are also 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:27.990
 dangerous 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.240
 compared to a landing on the surface sticks
