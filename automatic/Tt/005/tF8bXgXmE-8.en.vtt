just turn the burner down the heat
diminishes<00:01:22.280> instantly<00:01:22.940> so<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:23.750> saves<00:01:24.049> on

a standard gas flame cooktop you're only

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.600 
a standard gas flame cooktop you're only
getting<00:01:35.360> about<00:01:35.630> 35<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.710> 40<00:01:37.010> percent<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.460> that

induction application you're actually

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.670

radiant burners one reason on why you

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.229 
radiant burners one reason on why you
may<00:02:10.879> look<00:02:11.060> for<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.299> hybrid<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:12.400> cost<00:02:13.400> induction

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
may look for a hybrid is cost induction

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.149 
may look for a hybrid is cost induction
cooktops<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.019> tendency<00:02:15.409> to<00:02:15.439> run<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.920> little

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
cooktops have a tendency to run a little

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.460 
cooktops have a tendency to run a little
bit<00:02:16.340> more<00:02:16.489> expensive<00:02:16.879> so<00:02:17.689> doing<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.049> hybrid

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
bit more expensive so doing the hybrid

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.210 
bit more expensive so doing the hybrid
makes<00:02:18.769> it<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.069> little<00:02:19.370> more<00:02:19.489> cost<00:02:20.209> effective

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
makes it a little more cost effective

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.470 
makes it a little more cost effective
the<00:02:22.220> only<00:02:22.400> thing<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.670> need<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.849> look<00:02:23.000> for<00:02:23.060> when

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
the only thing you need to look for when

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.660 
the only thing you need to look for when
you're<00:02:23.630> cooking<00:02:23.780> with<00:02:24.020> induction<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:25.069> that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
you're cooking with induction is that

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.830 
you're cooking with induction is that
you<00:02:25.790> have<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.300> proper<00:02:26.569> cooking

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
you have the proper cooking

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.590 
you have the proper cooking
this<00:02:28.290> needs<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.160> ferrous<00:02:29.610> metal<00:02:30.030> the

this needs to be of a ferrous metal the

easiest way to shop for a pan is take a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.910 
easiest way to shop for a pan is take a
magnet<00:02:33.870> with<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.140> when<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.320> go<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.590> store
