00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.180 

here<00:00:11.169> when<00:00:11.289> I<00:00:11.349> first<00:00:11.589> started<00:00:11.860> fishing<00:00:12.039> the

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
here when I first started fishing the

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.730 
here when I first started fishing the
Florida<00:00:12.519> Keys<00:00:12.670> we<00:00:12.969> didn't<00:00:13.150> have<00:00:13.269> GPS<00:00:13.509> and<00:00:14.080> GPS

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
Florida Keys we didn't have GPS and GPS

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.439 
Florida Keys we didn't have GPS and GPS
is<00:00:14.889> something<00:00:15.190> that's<00:00:15.340> become<00:00:15.580> very<00:00:16.000> common

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
is something that's become very common

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.850 
is something that's become very common
on<00:00:16.570> all<00:00:16.779> boats<00:00:17.080> because<00:00:17.289> it's<00:00:17.500> just<00:00:17.650> so<00:00:17.829> easy

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
on all boats because it's just so easy

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.670 
on all boats because it's just so easy
and<00:00:18.550> it's<00:00:18.700> so<00:00:18.939> accurate<00:00:19.240> we<00:00:20.169> had<00:00:20.289> to<00:00:20.380> learn<00:00:20.500> how

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
and it's so accurate we had to learn how

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.920 
and it's so accurate we had to learn how
to<00:00:20.710> navigate<00:00:20.980> with<00:00:21.400> line<00:00:21.610> of<00:00:21.759> sight<00:00:22.029> and<00:00:22.390> with

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
to navigate with line of sight and with

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.779 
to navigate with line of sight and with
a<00:00:22.960> map<00:00:23.199> and<00:00:23.230> a<00:00:23.410> compass<00:00:23.439> and<00:00:23.980> in<00:00:24.310> my<00:00:24.430> opinion

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
a map and a compass and in my opinion

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.299 
a map and a compass and in my opinion
that<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:24.939> best<00:00:25.270> way<00:00:25.599> but<00:00:26.200> no<00:00:26.529> one<00:00:26.770> can<00:00:27.040> go

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:27.309 
that the best way but no one can go

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:29.339 
that the best way but no one can go
without<00:00:27.669> GPS<00:00:27.910> technology<00:00:28.750> now<00:00:28.899> because<00:00:29.230> it

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
without GPS technology now because it

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.319 
without GPS technology now because it
just<00:00:29.379> makes<00:00:29.739> it<00:00:29.890> so<00:00:30.219> easy<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.879> it<00:00:30.969> makes<00:00:31.000> your

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
just makes it so easy and it makes your

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.290 
just makes it so easy and it makes your
fishing<00:00:31.750> so<00:00:32.020> efficient<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:32.950> also<00:00:33.489> very<00:00:33.969> safe

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
fishing so efficient and also very safe

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.970 
fishing so efficient and also very safe
well<00:00:34.840> there's<00:00:34.989> another<00:00:35.230> situation<00:00:35.500> where<00:00:35.950> I

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
well there's another situation where I

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.529 
well there's another situation where I
like<00:00:36.219> to<00:00:36.340> have<00:00:36.460> technology<00:00:36.850> to<00:00:37.090> give<00:00:37.390> me<00:00:37.480> a

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
like to have technology to give me a

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.090 
like to have technology to give me a
little<00:00:37.690> helping<00:00:38.050> hand<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.469> that<00:00:38.890> is

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
little helping hand and that is

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.279 
little helping hand and that is
navigating<00:00:39.640> in<00:00:39.879> the<00:00:40.030> dark<00:00:40.390> in<00:00:40.629> a<00:00:40.809> blinding

high I install it in my boat and I'm

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.680 
high I install it in my boat and I'm
going<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.770> be<00:01:26.890> able<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:27.100> see<00:01:27.340> everything<00:01:27.970> it's

going to be able to see everything it's
going<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.230> let<00:01:29.740> me<00:01:29.860> see<00:01:30.130> anything<00:01:30.640> that's<00:01:30.730> out

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
going to let me see anything that's out

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.400 
going to let me see anything that's out
there<00:01:31.240> but<00:01:31.420> it's<00:01:31.540> also<00:01:31.840> going<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.230> do

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
there but it's also going to do

there but it's also going to do
something<00:01:32.740> really<00:01:32.950> cool<00:01:33.250> I'm<00:01:33.490> going<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.670> be

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
something really cool I'm going to be

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.640 
something really cool I'm going to be
able<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.910> see<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.480> rain<00:01:34.690> storms<00:01:35.080> coming<00:01:35.500> and

I'm<00:01:36.070> also<00:01:36.370> going<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.760> be<00:01:36.910> able<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.180> find<00:01:37.540> the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
I'm also going to be able to find the

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.440 
I'm also going to be able to find the
best<00:01:38.350> path<00:01:38.710> out<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.520> rainstorms<00:01:40.150> because

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
best path out of the rainstorms because

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.990 
best path out of the rainstorms because
often<00:01:40.930> when<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.650> look<00:01:41.980> at<00:01:42.220> an<00:01:42.400> enveloping

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
often when you look at an enveloping

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.810 
often when you look at an enveloping
rainstorm<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:44.260> darkest<00:01:44.950> part<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.610> part

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
rainstorm the darkest part is the part

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.340 
rainstorm the darkest part is the part
that<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.090> avoid<00:01:46.390> but<00:01:46.600> when<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.810> look<00:01:47.080> on<00:01:47.230> the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
that you avoid but when you look on the
