00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
between like a flatbread and the pizza

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.089 
between like a flatbread and the pizza
bread<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.449> super<00:00:28.109> tasty<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.680> light<00:00:28.949> and

fluffy<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:30.269> tried<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.660> check<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:30.960> out

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
fluffy so we tried it out check this out

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.840 
fluffy so we tried it out check this out
I'm<00:00:31.859> thinking<00:00:32.340> there's<00:00:32.460> three<00:00:32.700> main

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
I'm thinking there's three main

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.880 
I'm thinking there's three main
components<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.350> bread<00:00:34.620> itself

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
components so there's the bread itself

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.590 
components so there's the bread itself
so<00:00:35.489> we're<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> make<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.000> first<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
so we're going to make that first and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.520 
so we're going to make that first and
then<00:00:36.840> we're<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> marinate<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.500> chicken

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
then we're going to marinate the chicken

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770 
then we're going to marinate the chicken
and<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:38.730> there's<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> sauce<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and then there's a sauce and then it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.330 
and then there's a sauce and then it
should<00:00:39.989> all<00:00:40.110> come<00:00:40.140> together<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.100> sauce

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
should all come together with a sauce

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
should all come together with a sauce
and<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.120> I'm<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> make<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> romesco<00:00:43.110> so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
straight into a larger bowl if we can

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
straight into a larger bowl if we can
get<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:41.390> half<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.509> lemon<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.979> salt<00:01:44.460> you're

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
get it out half a lemon so salt you're

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.480 
get it out half a lemon so salt you're
going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> go<00:01:45.390> 1<00:01:45.570> clove<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.930> garlic<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.380> well

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
going to go 1 clove of garlic as well

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
going to go 1 clove of garlic as well
let's<00:01:47.490> give<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> mix<00:01:47.939> together<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
let's give that a mix together the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.450 
let's give that a mix together the
treble<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.500> sort<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.130> little<00:01:50.310> bit

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
treble is sort of like a little bit

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.300 
treble is sort of like a little bit
bouncy<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.479> chewy<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.710> will<00:01:52.829> it'll<00:01:53.070> hold

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
bouncy and chewy and it will it'll hold

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.580 
bouncy and chewy and it will it'll hold
together<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
together so that's what I think and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.200 
together so that's what I think and
acids<00:01:56.070> obviously<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> nice<00:01:56.909> flavor

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
acids obviously it was a nice flavor

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.580 
acids obviously it was a nice flavor
with<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> garlic<00:01:57.750> through<00:01:57.930> there<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.140> well<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
with a garlic through there as well so

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.209 
with a garlic through there as well so
I'm<00:01:59.369> not<00:01:59.700> 100%<00:02:00.060> sure<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.770> let's<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:02.009> if<00:02:02.100> it's

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
I'm not 100% sure but let's see if it's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.950 
I'm not 100% sure but let's see if it's
works<00:02:04.040> so<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.189> add<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:05.430> sugar<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:06.000> use<00:02:06.270> okay

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
works so just add your sugar to use okay

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.139 
works so just add your sugar to use okay
so<00:02:07.020> while<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.610> while<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.729> yeast<00:02:08.970> is

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so while that's while that yeast is

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.210 
so while that's while that yeast is
activating<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:10.530> needs<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:10.830> bit<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.039> time

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
activating it needs a little bit of time

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.070 
activating it needs a little bit of time
I'm<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> turn<00:02:11.760> these<00:02:11.910> stoves<00:02:12.180> on

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
I'm going to turn these stoves on

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.570 
I'm going to turn these stoves on
and<00:02:13.290> we're<00:02:13.380> going<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.530> start<00:02:13.709> charring<00:02:14.310> our

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
and we're going to start charring our

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.610 
and we're going to start charring our
capsicum<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.150> our<00:02:15.300> source<00:02:15.600> capsicum<00:02:16.290> -<00:02:16.440> going

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
capsicum to our source capsicum - going

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.980 
capsicum to our source capsicum - going
directly<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:17.850> color<00:02:18.120> because

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
directly on there what color because

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.090 
directly on there what color because
that<00:02:19.110> skin<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> fall<00:02:19.740> off<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.010> we

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
that skin is going to fall off and we

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.680 
that skin is going to fall off and we
have<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> smoky<00:02:20.790> beautiful<00:02:21.120> flesh<00:02:21.330> which<00:02:21.540> going

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
have a smoky beautiful flesh which going

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.360 
have a smoky beautiful flesh which going
to<00:02:21.750> turn<00:02:21.840> into<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.050> smoky<00:02:22.470> beautiful<00:02:22.860> sauce<00:02:23.069> in

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
to turn into a smoky beautiful sauce in

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.790 
to turn into a smoky beautiful sauce in
the<00:02:23.459> end<00:02:23.580> keep<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.240> these<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.750> I'll<00:02:25.620> go

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the end keep it on these because I'll go

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.500

on slow and then turn it up you whack it
on<00:02:52.920> football<00:02:53.280> straightaway<00:02:53.730> obviously

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
on football straightaway obviously

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.790 
on football straightaway obviously
everything<00:02:54.300> siz<00:02:54.450> going<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.630> go<00:02:54.690> make<00:02:55.440> complete

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
everything siz going to go make complete

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.170 
everything siz going to go make complete
mess<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.489> that's<00:02:56.670> probably<00:02:56.850> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> take

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
mess so that's probably going to take

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.009 
mess so that's probably going to take
about<00:02:57.739> maybe<00:02:58.739> five<00:02:59.100> eight<00:02:59.580> minutes<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.870> keep

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
about maybe five eight minutes so keep

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.660 
about maybe five eight minutes so keep
you<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.650> idea<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.310> want<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.519> work

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
you on it the idea is you want to work

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.699 
you on it the idea is you want to work
that<00:03:02.910> gluten<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.050> bread<00:03:04.290> comes<00:03:04.530> together

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
that gluten so the bread comes together

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.500 
that gluten so the bread comes together
I<00:03:05.130> mean<00:03:05.519> use<00:03:05.760> your<00:03:05.880> senses<00:03:06.209> you're<00:03:06.330> going<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
I mean use your senses you're going to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.059 
I mean use your senses you're going to
look<00:03:06.569> at<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.900> can<00:03:06.930> hear<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.440> we<00:03:07.590> touch<00:03:07.830> it

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
look at it you can hear it we touch it

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.190 
look at it you can hear it we touch it
and<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:08.970> become<00:03:09.090> springy<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:09.959> really

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
and it can become springy so you really

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.720 
and it can become springy so you really
want<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.350> work<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.650> gluten<00:03:11.040> then<00:03:11.640> you're

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
want to work that gluten then you're

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.610 
want to work that gluten then you're
gonna<00:03:11.819> put<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> bowl<00:03:12.300> wrap<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.260> up

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
gonna put it in a bowl wrap it up

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.470 
gonna put it in a bowl wrap it up
