UTMB how have the previous three gone
well<00:00:26.119> that<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.289> guess<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:30.380> plan

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
well that is like I guess to plan

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.630 
well that is like I guess to plan
everything<00:00:31.590> out<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.160> perform<00:00:32.520> really

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
everything out and not perform really

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.709 
everything out and not perform really
well

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.619 

pretty<00:00:36.719> rough<00:00:36.840> Quixote<00:00:37.290> drops<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.270> DNFs<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
pretty rough Quixote drops and DNFs and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.299 
pretty rough Quixote drops and DNFs and
then<00:00:39.719> last<00:00:39.960> year<00:00:40.079> finally<00:00:40.379> finished<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.040> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
then last year finally finished but it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.470 
then last year finally finished but it
was<00:00:41.430> pretty<00:00:41.610> rough<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.390> those

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
was pretty rough because one of those

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.000 
was pretty rough because one of those
things<00:00:42.690> where<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:42.930> got<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:43.950> to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
things where I just got it out to get to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.569 
things where I just got it out to get to
the<00:00:44.129> finish<00:00:44.280> line

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the finish line

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.439 
the finish line
battled<00:00:45.090> problems<00:00:49.399> it<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> tough<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.910> so

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
battled problems it was a tough go so

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.060 
battled problems it was a tough go so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the race yeah I definitely have trained

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
the race yeah I definitely have trained
more<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.469> altitude<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.010> race<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.969> me

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
more for altitude this race for me

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.289 
more for altitude this race for me
coming<00:01:03.539> from<00:01:03.719> Seattle<00:01:04.159> sea<00:01:05.159> level<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:06.090> been

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
coming from Seattle sea level has been

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090 
coming from Seattle sea level has been
tough<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.930> even<00:01:07.320> though<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> trained<00:01:07.860> over

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
tough and even though I trained over

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800 
tough and even though I trained over
here<00:01:08.250> about<00:01:08.430> month<00:01:08.610> before<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> race<00:01:09.180> no<00:01:09.570> way

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
here about month before the race no way

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.260 
here about month before the race no way
I<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.470> didn't<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> lot<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.549> altitude

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
I just didn't get a lot of altitude

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.420 
I just didn't get a lot of altitude
training<00:01:12.590> after<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.220> also<00:01:15.950> know<00:01:16.950> there's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
training after and I also know there's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.370 
training after and I also know there's
just<00:01:17.460> too<00:01:17.670> many<00:01:17.790> great<00:01:18.150> miles<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.869> mountains

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
just too many great miles and mountains

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
just too many great miles and mountains
to<00:01:19.560> run<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.670> ended<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.030> overdoing<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
to run and just ended up overdoing it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.420 
to run and just ended up overdoing it
I've<00:01:22.200> got<00:01:22.320> an<00:01:22.439> injury<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.189> leading

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
I've got an injury it kind of leading

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.179 
I've got an injury it kind of leading
into<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.810> big<00:01:24.990> thing<00:01:25.189> I've

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
into it so I think the big thing I've

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.560 
into it so I think the big thing I've
learned<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.580> yeah<00:01:26.729> altitude<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.360> really

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
learned is yeah altitude is really

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.170 
learned is yeah altitude is really
important<00:01:27.930> training<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> relief<00:01:28.740> steep

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
important training the relief steep

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.569 
important training the relief steep
ascents<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.270> descents<00:01:30.360> has<00:01:30.990> been<00:01:31.579> excellent

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
ascents and descents has been excellent

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.010 
ascents and descents has been excellent
so<00:01:32.880> that's<00:01:33.180> why<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.450> Boulder<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:33.900> now

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
so that's why I'm in Boulder right now

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020 
so that's why I'm in Boulder right now

Hunter<00:03:30.340> milers<00:03:30.730> but<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.810> know<00:03:31.900> just<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.859> is

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
Hunter milers but you know just this is

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.330 
Hunter milers but you know just this is
where<00:03:33.519> it's<00:03:33.639> at<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:34.090> mean<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:35.290> competition<00:03:35.769> and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
where it's at I mean the competition and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.930 
where it's at I mean the competition and
just<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.910> atmosphere

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
just the atmosphere

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.270 
just the atmosphere
here<00:03:38.330> it's<00:03:39.050> pretty<00:03:39.200> incredible<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.890> can't

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
here it's pretty incredible I can't

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.590 
here it's pretty incredible I can't
explain<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.880> little<00:03:40.910> bit<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.180> mean<00:03:41.360> in

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
explain that a little bit I mean in

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.960 
explain that a little bit I mean in
terms<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:42.740> very<00:03:43.580> from<00:03:43.760> what<00:03:43.850> I've<00:03:43.910> heard

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
terms of it's very from what I've heard

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.370 
terms of it's very from what I've heard
it's<00:03:44.210> much<00:03:44.390> different<00:03:44.570> than<00:03:44.780> American

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
it's much different than American

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.410 
it's much different than American
hundred-mile<00:03:46.130> what's<00:03:46.610> that<00:03:46.790> what<00:03:47.240> was<00:03:47.330> the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
hundred-mile what's that what was the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.750 
hundred-mile what's that what was the
atmosphere<00:03:47.570> out<00:03:48.020> there<00:03:48.170> on<00:03:48.320> race<00:03:48.620> day<00:03:48.950> it

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
atmosphere out there on race day it

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.520 
atmosphere out there on race day it
means<00:03:49.880> just<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.300> numbers<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.930> people<00:03:51.140> that

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
means just the numbers of people that

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.900 
means just the numbers of people that
are<00:03:51.620> out<00:03:51.710> in<00:03:51.740> the<00:03:51.950> course<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.550> just<00:03:52.700> don't

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
are out in the course so you just don't

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.450 
are out in the course so you just don't
see<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.360> in<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.720> mountainous<00:03:54.170> trail<00:03:54.560> under<00:03:55.340> my

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
see that in a mountainous trail under my

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.860 
see that in a mountainous trail under my
event<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:59.500> guess<00:04:00.500> it's<00:04:01.100> just<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.870> people

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
event and I guess it's just the people

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.290 
event and I guess it's just the people
that<00:04:03.740> you<00:04:04.280> go<00:04:04.430> through<00:04:04.640> these<00:04:04.790> towns<00:04:05.090> and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
that you go through these towns and

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.570 
that you go through these towns and
villages<00:04:05.450> there<00:04:08.800> this<00:04:09.800> is<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.070> other<00:04:10.190> mile

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
villages there this is the other mile

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.690 
villages there this is the other mile
trail<00:04:10.880> up<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.210> trail<00:04:11.600> style<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.680> yeah<00:04:13.520> I<00:04:13.550> think

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
trail up a trail style and yeah I think

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.250 
trail up a trail style and yeah I think
there's<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.300> know<00:04:14.420> even<00:04:14.690> though<00:04:14.810> yeah<00:04:15.050> there

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
there's you know even though yeah there

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.530 
there's you know even though yeah there
are<00:04:15.410> some<00:04:15.680> differences<00:04:16.250> overall<00:04:16.790> it's<00:04:17.030> quite

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
are some differences overall it's quite

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.140 
are some differences overall it's quite
similar<00:04:18.280> for<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.310> lot<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.519> people<00:04:19.850> they're

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
similar for a lot of people they're

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.580 
similar for a lot of people they're
gonna<00:04:20.330> see<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.930> know<00:04:21.019> there's<00:04:21.230> twenty<00:04:21.470> five

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
gonna see you know there's twenty five

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.870 
gonna see you know there's twenty five
hundred<00:04:21.620> people<00:04:22.070> on<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.250> course<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:22.700> that's

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
hundred people on the course so that's

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.500 
hundred people on the course so that's
kind<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.210> new<00:04:23.360> thing<00:04:24.310> but<00:04:25.310> I<00:04:26.000> think<00:04:26.390> in

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
kind of a new thing but I think in

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.540 
kind of a new thing but I think in
general<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:28.300> trails<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:31.040> ascents<00:04:31.490> and

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
general the trails and the ascents and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.010 
general the trails and the ascents and
descents<00:04:31.640> it's<00:04:32.150> interesting<00:04:32.420> and<00:04:32.780> they<00:04:32.840> just

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
descents it's interesting and they just

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.710 
descents it's interesting and they just
don't<00:04:33.350> switch<00:04:33.680> back<00:04:33.890> things<00:04:34.160> as<00:04:34.340> much<00:04:34.490> so<00:04:35.300> even

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
don't switch back things as much so even

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.450 
don't switch back things as much so even
though<00:04:35.840> on<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.080> profile<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.800> might<00:04:37.010> only<00:04:37.220> are

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
though on the profile it might only are

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.130 
though on the profile it might only are
the<00:04:37.580> total<00:04:37.880> elevation<00:04:38.000> gain<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:38.780> still<00:04:38.960> have

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
the total elevation gain and still have

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.920 
the total elevation gain and still have
some<00:04:39.320> broth<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.910> feel<00:04:41.210> yeah<00:04:41.390> there's<00:04:41.600> a<00:04:41.690> lot

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
some broth you feel yeah there's a lot

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.230 
some broth you feel yeah there's a lot
of<00:04:42.110> relatively<00:04:42.710> flat<00:04:42.950> ground<00:04:43.370> -<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.180> you

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
of relatively flat ground - and so you

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.930 
of relatively flat ground - and so you
pack<00:04:44.810> in<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.140> elevations<00:04:45.710> very<00:04:46.580> short

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
pack in the elevations very short

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.610 
pack in the elevations very short
distance<00:04:47.419> so<00:04:48.020> it's<00:04:48.169> kind<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.380> deceiving

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
distance so it's kind of deceiving

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.740 
distance so it's kind of deceiving
creeps<00:04:49.280> up<00:04:49.430> on<00:04:49.580> yours<00:04:49.790> well<00:04:50.390> best<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.660> luck

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
creeps up on yours well best of luck

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.390 
creeps up on yours well best of luck
