opening<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.500> didn't<00:00:07.770> play<00:00:07.980> so<00:00:08.040> well<00:00:08.309> he<00:00:08.550> got

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
opening I didn't play so well he got

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.230 
opening I didn't play so well he got
some<00:00:09.120> good<00:00:09.809> advantage<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.349> think<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:11.309> he

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
some good advantage I think and he

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.310 
some good advantage I think and he
sacrificed<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.019> phone<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:14.690> ya<00:00:15.690> later<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.170> I

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
sacrificed the phone and ya later on I

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.730 
sacrificed the phone and ya later on I
could<00:00:16.740> get<00:00:17.490> some<00:00:17.760> many<00:00:18.330> perpetual<00:00:18.930> checks<00:00:19.170> but

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
could get some many perpetual checks but

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.910 
could get some many perpetual checks but
he<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.520> wanted<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> win<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.800> yeah<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.859> think

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
he really wanted to win so yeah I think

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.630 
he really wanted to win so yeah I think
he<00:00:23.310> sacrificed<00:00:23.910> some<00:00:24.330> more<00:00:24.630> exchange<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.740> an

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
he sacrificed some more exchange as an

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.480 
he sacrificed some more exchange as an
eco<00:00:26.939> still<00:00:27.210> true<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:27.949> it's<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.070> moment<00:00:29.400> he

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
eco still true but it's a moment he

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
eco still true but it's a moment he
played<00:00:29.699> for<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:30.090> meat<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.330> luckily<00:00:31.019> i<00:00:31.170> found
