00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and there's a meeting tomorrow and I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.700 
and there's a meeting tomorrow and I
think<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.430> there<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:38.730> something<00:00:39.059> about

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
think that there was something about

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.200 
think that there was something about
dressing<00:00:40.710> well<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.250> looking<00:00:42.710> you<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:44.210> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
dressing well and looking you know and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.639 
dressing well and looking you know and
it<00:00:45.420> may<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.660> said<00:00:45.809> professional<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.469> there

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it may have said professional in there

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.510 
it may have said professional in there
so<00:00:47.160> um<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:48.530> figured<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.649> should<00:00:49.890> try<00:00:50.250> something

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
so um I figured I should try something

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.510 
so um I figured I should try something

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.619 
Chile or how I'd like to work in forcing
environmental<00:02:08.550> laws<00:02:08.700> or<00:02:09.119> changing<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
environmental laws or changing the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.140 
environmental laws or changing the
interpretation<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:11.160> anti-terrorist<00:02:11.940> law

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
interpretation of the anti-terrorist law

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.400 
interpretation of the anti-terrorist law
that<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:12.450> passed

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that was passed

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.580 
that was passed
recently<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.190> Chile<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:16.170> has<00:02:16.260> been<00:02:16.470> used

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
recently in Chile and that has been used

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.430 
recently in Chile and that has been used
primarily<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.250> suppress<00:02:17.940> direct<00:02:18.870> action<00:02:19.290> by

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
primarily to suppress direct action by

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.120 
primarily to suppress direct action by
the<00:02:19.470> Mapuche<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.610> take<00:02:20.910> back<00:02:21.920> ancestral<00:02:22.920> land

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
the Mapuche to take back ancestral land

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.250 
the Mapuche to take back ancestral land
so<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:23.970> they<00:02:24.210> can<00:02:24.420> use<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:25.080> their<00:02:25.230> own

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
so that they can use it for their own

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.380 
so that they can use it for their own
purposes<00:02:26.220> rather<00:02:26.550> than<00:02:26.880> have<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.240> be<00:02:27.420> used<00:02:27.750> to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
purposes rather than have it be used to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.440 
purposes rather than have it be used to
buy<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.450> by<00:02:31.670> logging<00:02:32.670> companies<00:02:33.360> i<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:35.450> i've

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
buy it by logging companies i think i've

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.140 
buy it by logging companies i think i've
read<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.660> little<00:02:36.870> bit<00:02:37.050> about<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
read a little bit about it so the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.300 
read a little bit about it so the
movement<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.630> Mapuche<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.860> really

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
movement of the Mapuche is really

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.040 
movement of the Mapuche is really
similar<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.700> southeast<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.450> movement<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:42.990> that

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
similar to southeast of movement in that

reacting against a free trade agreement

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.670 
reacting against a free trade agreement
they<00:02:49.620> are<00:02:50.160> angry<00:02:50.970> about<00:02:51.300> foreign<00:02:52.110> investors

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680

been taking lessons on BBC which is a
well<00:04:01.800> BBC's<00:04:02.160> website<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.610> guys<00:04:02.820> what<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.150> help

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
well BBC's website you guys what we help

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.310 
well BBC's website you guys what we help
you<00:04:03.450> see<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:05.570> I've<00:04:06.570> learned<00:04:06.930> some<00:04:07.200> very

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
you see is and I've learned some very

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:14.350 
you see is and I've learned some very
important<00:04:07.860> things<00:04:07.890> like<00:04:10.550> Gary<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.640> vice<00:04:11.910> comida

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
important things like Gary a vice comida

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.020 
important things like Gary a vice comida
um<00:04:15.360> which<00:04:16.109> is<00:04:16.290> what's<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:16.799> food<00:04:17.100> and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
um which is what's in this food and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.650 
um which is what's in this food and
that's<00:04:18.120> important<00:04:18.690> because<00:04:18.750> I'm<00:04:19.350> vegetarian

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
that's important because I'm vegetarian

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.810 
that's important because I'm vegetarian
so<00:04:21.770> i'll<00:04:22.770> probably<00:04:23.100> be<00:04:23.370> saying<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.760> lot

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
so i'll probably be saying that a lot

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.570 
so i'll probably be saying that a lot
and<00:04:24.440> i<00:04:25.440> also<00:04:25.710> learned<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.130> phrase<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.370> I

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
and i also learned a phrase that I

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.140 
and i also learned a phrase that I
didn't<00:04:26.820> know

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
didn't know
