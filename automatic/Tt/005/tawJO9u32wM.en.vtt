not only it's gonna use as many

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
not only it's gonna use as many
grasshoppers<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.780> i<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.049> i<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.439> use<00:01:16.590> like

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.410 
grasshoppers as i have i can use like
what<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.659> come<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.900> handful<00:01:23.119> now<00:01:24.119> look<00:01:24.330> at

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
what to come on a handful now look at

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.969 
what to come on a handful now look at
that<00:01:24.570> meat<00:01:24.750> over<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.170> doesn't<00:01:25.409> even<00:01:25.500> look<00:01:25.710> good

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that meat over it doesn't even look good

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
that meat over it doesn't even look good
so<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.420> grasshoppers<00:01:27.900> don't<00:01:28.140> seem<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.439> bad

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
so the grasshoppers don't seem that bad

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.670 
so the grasshoppers don't seem that bad
a<00:01:28.740> comparison<00:01:29.340> okay<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.060> think<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.450> enough

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
a comparison okay I think that's enough

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.780 
a comparison okay I think that's enough
how<00:01:31.680> many<00:01:31.829> did<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.040> put<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.310> yours<00:01:32.549> uh
