00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
and the shimano dura-ace 9000 of course

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.150 
and the shimano dura-ace 9000 of course
they're<00:00:22.170> very<00:00:22.320> similar<00:00:22.529> pedals<00:00:22.980> because

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
they're very similar pedals because

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.679 
they're very similar pedals because
you're<00:00:23.250> both<00:00:23.369> high<00:00:23.550> end<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.480> aim<00:00:24.660> for

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
you're both high end but they aim for

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.450 
you're both high end but they aim for
different<00:00:25.199> kinds<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.529> riders<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.220> kind<00:00:26.430> of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
different kinds of riders what kind of

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.550 
different kinds of riders what kind of
riders<00:00:26.789> well<00:00:27.060> let's<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> look<00:00:27.630> these

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
riders well let's have a look these

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.070 
riders well let's have a look these
people<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> aims<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> newer<00:00:30.240> style<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.869> rider

people a aims for a newer style of rider

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.930 
people a aims for a newer style of rider
whereas<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.740> Shimano<00:00:32.250> probably<00:00:32.640> aims<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
whereas the Shimano probably aims to a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.510 
whereas the Shimano probably aims to a
more<00:00:33.090> classic<00:00:33.719> more<00:00:34.280> traditional<00:00:35.280> kind<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
more classic more traditional kind of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
more classic more traditional kind of
rider<00:00:35.730> will<00:00:35.910> set<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.079> mean<00:00:37.110> by<00:00:37.290> that

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
rider will set so what do I mean by that

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900 
rider will set so what do I mean by that
well<00:00:37.590> let's<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.340> these<00:00:38.579> speed

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
well let's have a look at these speed

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180 
well let's have a look at these speed
plays<00:00:39.180> features<00:00:39.809> its<00:00:40.290> first<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:40.920> got

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
plays features its first of all it's got

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.459 
plays features its first of all it's got
double<00:00:41.550> sided<00:00:41.760> entry<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.210> means<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.690> step

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
double sided entry that means it's step

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.979 
double sided entry that means it's step
and<00:00:43.680> go<00:00:43.890> stop<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> light<00:00:44.940> put<00:00:45.750> your<00:00:45.870> foot

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and go stop it a light put your foot

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.110 
and go stop it a light put your foot
back<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:47.100> away<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
back in and you're away you have to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.459 
back in and you're away you have to
fiddle<00:00:48.300> around<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.690> little<00:00:48.840> bit<00:00:48.989> more<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
fiddle around a little bit more with the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
fiddle around a little bit more with the
dura<00:00:49.680> ace<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.100> course<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.360> get<00:00:51.510> used

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
dura ace of course but when you get used

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.819 
dura ace of course but when you get used
to<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.230> you've<00:00:52.350> done<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.649> million

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to it when you've done it a million

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.130 
to it when you've done it a million
times<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.489> any<00:00:53.640> old<00:00:53.820> timer<00:00:54.030> has<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:54.660> no

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
times like any old timer has then no

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.959 
times like any old timer has then no
problem<00:00:55.559> another<00:00:56.340> thing<00:00:56.520> that's<00:00:56.699> great<00:00:56.940> about

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
problem another thing that's great about

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
problem another thing that's great about
these<00:00:57.480> speed<00:00:58.109> played<00:00:58.260> pedals<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
these speed played pedals is that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.229 
these speed played pedals is that
they're<00:00:59.100> adjustable<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> float<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
they're adjustable the float is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
they're adjustable the float is
adjustable<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.800> adjust

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
adjustable in them so you can adjust

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.399 
adjustable in them so you can adjust
both<00:01:02.430> how<00:01:02.789> far<00:01:03.059> your<00:01:03.270> foot<00:01:03.570> rotates<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
both how far your foot rotates in and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.500 
both how far your foot rotates in and
out<00:01:04.860> which<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.430> something<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> Shimano<00:01:06.210> can't

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
out which is something the Shimano can't

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.899 
out which is something the Shimano can't
do<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.500> adjust<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.159> float<00:01:08.760> in

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
do if you want to adjust the float in

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.190 
do if you want to adjust the float in
the<00:01:08.970> SH<00:01:09.000> manos<00:01:09.360> you've<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.780> three<00:01:10.020> choices

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the SH manos you've got three choices

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
the SH manos you've got three choices
which<00:01:10.770> means<00:01:11.010> you've<00:01:11.189> got<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.400> change<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
which means you've got to change the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
which means you've got to change the
cleat<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.110> makes<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.560> better<00:01:14.040> for

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
cleat so that's what makes it better for

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
cleat so that's what makes it better for
someone<00:01:14.700> who<00:01:14.880> wants<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.299> sort<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.479> set<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
someone who wants to sort of set and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620 
someone who wants to sort of set and
forget<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.369> another<00:01:18.090> thing<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.450> great

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
forget so another thing that's great

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
forget so another thing that's great
about<00:01:18.659> these<00:01:19.229> speedplay<00:01:19.740> pedals<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
about these speedplay pedals is that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.830 
about these speedplay pedals is that
they're<00:01:20.549> very<00:01:20.759> very<00:01:20.939> light<00:01:21.210> there<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.630> 200

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
they're very very light there about 200

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.929 
they're very very light there about 200
just<00:01:22.350> over<00:01:22.530> 200<00:01:22.680> grams<00:01:23.070> which<00:01:23.250> makes<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.520> 50

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
just over 200 grams which makes them 50

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.030 
just over 200 grams which makes them 50
grams<00:01:24.180> lighter<00:01:24.450> than<00:01:24.960> these<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.770> won't<00:01:25.860> call

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
grams lighter than these we won't call

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.710 
grams lighter than these we won't call
them<00:01:26.159> boat<00:01:26.310> anchors<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.540> certainly

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
them boat anchors but they are certainly

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
here one thing that the dura ace is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.719 
here one thing that the dura ace is
really<00:01:33.570> renowned<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.710> course<00:01:34.950> aldea<00:01:35.549> race
