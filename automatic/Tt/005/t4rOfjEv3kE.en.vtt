this<00:01:31.590> wheel<00:01:31.799> bearing<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.250> bad<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:34.619> can't

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
this wheel bearing is bad so you can't

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249 
this wheel bearing is bad so you can't
really<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.759> because<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.780> only<00:01:36.810> putting

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
really see it because I'm only putting

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.850 
really see it because I'm only putting
hand<00:01:37.619> pressure<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.600> where

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
hand pressure on but you can see where

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.889 
hand pressure on but you can see where
right<00:01:40.860> there<00:01:40.890> yup<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.820> separates<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.750> that

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
right there yup it it separates at that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.350 
right there yup it it separates at that
orange<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> metal<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.310> wobbles<00:01:45.030> well

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
orange in the metal it with wobbles well

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.690 
orange in the metal it with wobbles well
when<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.540> put<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.750> tire<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:47.130> wobble

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
when you put a tire on that that wobble

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.359 
when you put a tire on that that wobble
really<00:01:48.689> magnifies<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:49.979> can't<00:01:50.220> get

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
really magnifies and they just can't get

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.010 
really magnifies and they just can't get
it<00:01:50.490> aligned<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.240> too<00:01:51.450> loose<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it aligned because it's too loose and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.170 
it aligned because it's too loose and
too<00:01:52.229> sloppy

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
too sloppy

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.709 
too sloppy
unfortunately<00:01:54.439> bigger<00:01:55.439> tires<00:01:56.240> it's<00:01:57.240> gonna<00:01:57.540> be

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
unfortunately bigger tires it's gonna be

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.550 
unfortunately bigger tires it's gonna be
a<00:01:57.750> bigger<00:01:57.960> problem<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.430> ended<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.729> buying

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
a bigger problem so I ended up buying

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.190 
a bigger problem so I ended up buying
the<00:02:01.560> more<00:02:01.770> expensive<00:02:02.189> brand<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.960> same

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the more expensive brand of the same

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.859 
the more expensive brand of the same
wheel<00:02:04.469> bearing<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.850> don't<00:02:06.540> know<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.750> it's

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
wheel bearing but I don't know if it's

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.630 
wheel bearing but I don't know if it's
gonna<00:02:06.960> make<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.200> huge<00:02:07.530> difference<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.220> I

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
gonna make a huge difference because I

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.630 
gonna make a huge difference because I
mean<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.000> guess<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.720> parts<00:02:10.020> are<00:02:10.200> clean<00:02:10.890> clean

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
mean I guess the parts are clean clean

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.570 
mean I guess the parts are clean clean
and

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.970 
and
we<00:02:12.700> clean<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.320> guess<00:02:15.780> my<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:18.070> looks<00:02:18.430> huh

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
we clean but I guess my that looks huh

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.070 
we clean but I guess my that looks huh
they<00:02:20.980> look<00:02:21.130> about<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.430> same<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:22.660> doesn't<00:02:22.840> look

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
they look about the same it doesn't look

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.600 
they look about the same it doesn't look
like<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.290> one<00:02:23.590> we<00:02:23.740> almost<00:02:23.860> bought<00:02:24.190> one<00:02:24.220> made

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
like that one we almost bought one made

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.880 
like that one we almost bought one made
in<00:02:24.760> China<00:02:25.000> what<00:02:25.270> we<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:26.020> they<00:02:26.350> showed<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.740> to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
in China what we do is they showed it to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.100 
in China what we do is they showed it to
us<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.310> we<00:02:28.210> weren't<00:02:28.360> gonna<00:02:28.510> buy<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.750> one

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
us and we weren't gonna buy that one

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.830 
us and we weren't gonna buy that one
yeah<00:02:29.920> well<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.850> know<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.450> one<00:02:31.630> made

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
yeah well and you know it the one made

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.240 
yeah well and you know it the one made
in<00:02:31.930> China<00:02:32.170> was<00:02:32.350> probably<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.920> looked<00:02:33.160> just

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
in China was probably it looked just

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.030 
in China was probably it looked just
like<00:02:33.490> this<00:02:34.000> old<00:02:34.360> one<00:02:34.570> but<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.530> quick

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
like this old one but the quick

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.040 
like this old one but the quick
differences<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.000> know<00:02:37.120> between<00:02:37.480> notice

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
differences that I know between notice

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.050 
differences that I know between notice
between<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.740> old<00:02:38.920> one<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.310> little<00:02:39.940> bit

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
between the old one and the little bit

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.380 
between the old one and the little bit
more<00:02:40.090> expensive<00:02:40.630> new<00:02:41.050> one<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.940> distance

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
more expensive new one is a the distance

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.890 
more expensive new one is a the distance
right<00:02:43.540> here<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.410> thickness<00:02:44.770> right<00:02:45.520> there

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
right here that thickness right there

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.430 
right here that thickness right there
versus<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.140> thickness<00:02:48.120> yeah<00:02:49.120> see<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.660> so

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
versus this thickness yeah see that so

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.110 
versus this thickness yeah see that so
because<00:02:50.830> this<00:02:51.070> is<00:02:51.130> thick<00:02:51.520> obviously<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
because this is thick obviously the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.460 
because this is thick obviously the
whole<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.420> same<00:02:52.690> size<00:02:52.930> what<00:02:53.200> will<00:02:53.320> make

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
whole is the same size what will make

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.050 
whole is the same size what will make
sure<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.740> is<00:02:54.010> but<00:02:54.220> I'm<00:02:54.340> pretty<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:54.700> should<00:02:54.940> be

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
sure it is but I'm pretty it should be

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.810 
sure it is but I'm pretty it should be
better<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.690> same<00:02:55.720> size<00:02:56.080> yeah<00:02:56.560> but<00:02:56.890> but

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
better be the same size yeah but but

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.600 
better be the same size yeah but but
because<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:59.110> two<00:02:59.290> differences<00:02:59.680> it<00:03:00.190> would

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
because of the two differences it would

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.760 
because of the two differences it would
stand<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.180> reason<00:03:01.240> that<00:03:01.600> even<00:03:02.260> this<00:03:02.410> thickness

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
stand to reason that even this thickness

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.170 
stand to reason that even this thickness
from<00:03:03.310> there<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.760> there

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
from there to there

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.020 
from there to there
yeah<00:03:04.750> looks<00:03:05.350> thicker<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.340> from<00:03:06.790> there<00:03:06.940> to

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
yeah looks thicker and from there to

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.690 
yeah looks thicker and from there to
there<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:07.360> maybe<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.459> beefier<00:03:09.459> more

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
there so maybe it is a beefier more

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.220 
there so maybe it is a beefier more
solid<00:03:10.180> part<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:12.190> then<00:03:12.310> here's<00:03:12.580> my<00:03:12.700> new<00:03:13.230> axle

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
solid part and then here's my new axle

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.850 
solid part and then here's my new axle
which<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.340> stronger<00:03:16.030> part<00:03:16.420> too<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.860> not

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
which is a stronger part too and not

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.229 
which is a stronger part too and not
unfortunately<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.670> fix<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:18.910> dust

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
unfortunately can you fix that dust

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.330 
unfortunately can you fix that dust
cover<00:03:19.450> why<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.720> get<00:03:19.870> up<00:03:19.900> oh<00:03:20.260> shoot<00:03:20.769> what<00:03:21.160> does

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
this is just that one that keeps sliding

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.930 
this is just that one that keeps sliding
off<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.260> there<00:03:23.530> oh<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:24.130> don't<00:03:24.220> have<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.610> do<00:03:24.730> that

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
off of there oh I don't have to do that

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.640 
off of there oh I don't have to do that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
while it's off I just put a little piece

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.470 
while it's off I just put a little piece
of<00:03:26.830> tape<00:03:26.980> on<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.310> right<00:03:27.459> there<00:03:27.670> huh<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.209> it'll

but thank you for saying dust cover

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.259 
but thank you for saying dust cover
because<00:03:31.120> this<00:03:31.300> is<00:03:31.450> also<00:03:31.630> just<00:03:31.930> over<00:03:32.290> no<00:03:33.269> that's

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
because this is also just over no that's

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.620 
because this is also just over no that's
to<00:03:34.660> block<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.500> brakes<00:03:39.209> that's<00:03:40.209> about<00:03:40.450> how

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
to block the brakes that's about how

00:03:40.630 --> 00:04:06.040 
to block the brakes that's about how
it's<00:03:40.780> gonna<00:03:40.900> work

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.350 

you<00:04:07.050> might<00:04:07.200> have<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.470> use<00:04:08.460> some<00:04:08.490> actually<00:04:09.330> I

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
you might have to use some actually I

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.700 
you might have to use some actually I
probably<00:04:09.510> don't<00:04:09.750> even<00:04:09.840> have<00:04:10.020> to<00:04:10.140> use<00:04:10.290> force

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
probably don't even have to use force

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.950 
probably don't even have to use force
there's<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.310> nuts<00:04:11.550> on<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.820> back<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.390> pull

it's actually pretty easy to do it only
took<00:04:19.799> three<00:04:20.299> three<00:04:21.299> different<00:04:21.720> tools<00:04:22.910> in

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
took three three different tools in
