00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.429
 Let's explain what an Android tablet is and what it's for 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.549

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.390
 varane 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.720
 proposals little by little 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.149
 according to víctor jackson 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.070
 Well, here we have what the table and valence 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.670
 let's show a little the buttons that this site brings the start menu 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.610
 over here by the percent percent the plus and minus volume and the menu like 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.810
 we see is the final part 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.580
 nor is it like a finger 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.900
 or so or even less 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.690
 valdés from behind has what he in the eagerness percent button 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.650
 switched on 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.510
 to understand it, it is very easy, we leave the power button for three seconds 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.660
 let's go igniting the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.430
 and they are already having the icon of the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.620
 from android 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.620
 well let's see what you expect from the percent box 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.620
 we see that 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.690
 conacyt and the what is the user manual 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.260
 well in English but it does not matter, because the cinema table is very, very, very 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.440
 intuitive 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.730
 we were going that all the direct affects of everything and what it brings are 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.340
 quite intuitive that you do not need annual mine 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.890
 then we have what is the plug in the power adapter year as you see 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.690
 Spanish according to the distributor does not send it in Spanish or English but let's go 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.020
 if you do not send it to me in English they do not send an adapter it's the same as the charge 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.920
 Sunday here absolutely nothing happens if this is what the adapter is 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.100
 for the guests 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.950

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.950
 the grill for the internet by cable rj45 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.479
 this is an evident proof as the Atlantic and Indian 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.700
 Valencia is the same 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.079
 and nothing we will see I know how much the tablet goes up 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.639
 it is a gesture to itself 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.439
 just ascending vale 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.459

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.780
