photography<00:00:10.110> today<00:00:10.769> I'm<00:00:11.309> going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.610> be

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
photography today I'm going to be

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.900 
photography today I'm going to be
reviewing<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.929> Sony<00:00:13.259> rx100<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.580> focus

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
reviewing the Sony rx100 for focus

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.210 
reviewing the Sony rx100 for focus
camera<00:00:15.150> Sony<00:00:15.900> really<00:00:16.320> went<00:00:16.500> above<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.859> beyond

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
camera Sony really went above and beyond

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.010 
camera Sony really went above and beyond
in<00:00:17.580> designing<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.180> thing<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> one-inch

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
in designing this thing with a one-inch

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.990 
in designing this thing with a one-inch
sensor<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:20.010> much<00:00:20.250> larger<00:00:20.520> than<00:00:20.789> your

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
sensor it's much larger than your

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.179 
sensor it's much larger than your
average<00:00:21.260> pocket-sized<00:00:22.260> point-and-shoot

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
average pocket-sized point-and-shoot

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.550 
average pocket-sized point-and-shoot
what<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.789> translates<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.930> much<00:00:25.380> better

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
what that translates to is much better

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.160 
what that translates to is much better
high<00:00:25.830> ISO<00:00:26.430> capabilities<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.480> better

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
high ISO capabilities and better

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.560 
high ISO capabilities and better
low-light<00:00:28.500> capabilities<00:00:29.429> good<00:00:30.179> thing<00:00:30.390> about

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
low-light capabilities good thing about

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
low-light capabilities good thing about
this<00:00:30.750> ring<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.830> program<00:00:32.099> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
this ring is that you can program it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
this ring is that you can program it
into<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.630> about<00:00:33.809> any<00:00:33.989> function<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.530> want

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
into just about any function you want

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.610 
into just about any function you want
which<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.910> great<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.110> thing<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.500> I'm

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
which is great the one thing that I'm

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.889 
which is great the one thing that I'm
not<00:00:37.829> too<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.340> love<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.570> it's

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
not too in love with it is that it's

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.479 
not too in love with it is that it's
free<00:00:40.200> rotating<00:00:40.680> now<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.010> you're<00:00:41.100> gonna<00:00:41.190> use<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
free rotating now if you're gonna use it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.639 
free rotating now if you're gonna use it
for<00:00:41.520> zoom<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.000> focus<00:00:42.329> that's<00:00:42.480> awesome<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.559> if

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
for zoom or focus that's awesome but if

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.440 
for zoom or focus that's awesome but if
I<00:00:43.739> was<00:00:43.890> gonna<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.550> an<00:00:44.700> aperture<00:00:45.270> ring

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
I was gonna use it as an aperture ring

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.260 
I was gonna use it as an aperture ring
or<00:00:45.989> maybe<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:47.010> ISO<00:00:47.460> settings<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.000> something

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
or maybe for ISO settings or something

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.880 
or maybe for ISO settings or something
like<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:49.079> might<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.410> nice<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.829> some

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
like that it might be nice to get some

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.189 
like that it might be nice to get some
tactile<00:00:50.579> feedback<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
tactile feedback so that I know that

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.580 
tactile feedback so that I know that
it's<00:00:53.010> actually<00:00:53.600> functioning<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it's actually functioning one of the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.439 
it's actually functioning one of the
problems<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.430> most<00:00:56.879> consumer

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
problems I have with most consumer

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.450 
problems I have with most consumer
wide-angle<00:00:58.050> lenses<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.770> they're<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.280> not

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
wide-angle lenses is they're just not

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.750 
wide-angle lenses is they're just not
wide<00:00:59.820> enough<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.750> Sony<00:01:00.989> rx100<00:01:01.649> has<00:01:02.340> one

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
wide enough and the Sony rx100 has one

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.009 
wide enough and the Sony rx100 has one
of<00:01:02.879> those<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.270> quite<00:01:03.719> wide<00:01:03.989> enough

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
of those not quite wide enough

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
of those not quite wide enough
wide-angle<00:01:04.890> lenses<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> price

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
wide-angle lenses but for the price

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.810 
wide-angle lenses but for the price
point<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.590> camera<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.640> nice

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
point I think this camera is really nice

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.370 
point I think this camera is really nice
one<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.570> great<00:01:09.750> things<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.110> this

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
one of the great things about this

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
one of the great things about this
camera<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.939> take<00:01:12.180> ten<00:01:12.510> pictures

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
camera is that you can take ten pictures

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
camera is that you can take ten pictures
in<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.290> second<00:01:13.830> even<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> camera<00:01:15.030> that's<00:01:15.299> got

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
in a second even for a camera that's got

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.630 
in a second even for a camera that's got
a<00:01:15.479> consumer-grade<00:01:16.080> lens<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.490> can

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
a consumer-grade lens in it you can

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.190 
a consumer-grade lens in it you can
really<00:01:17.909> push<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.299> far<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:18.810> you're<00:01:18.900> looking

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
really push in far when you're looking

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
really push in far when you're looking
at<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> files<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.100> thing<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.820> detail<00:01:21.330> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
at the files on this thing the detail is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.050 
at the files on this thing the detail is
incredible<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> resolution<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.799> great<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
incredible the resolution is great you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.490 
incredible the resolution is great you
think<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> glass<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.110> thing<00:01:25.350> would

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
think that the glass on this thing would

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.020 
think that the glass on this thing would
not<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.830> able<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> match<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.460> resolution<00:01:26.939> of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
not be able to match the resolution of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.510 
not be able to match the resolution of
the<00:01:27.090> sensor<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.770> certainly<00:01:29.040> does<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.400> but

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the sensor and it certainly does it but

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.190 
the sensor and it certainly does it but
it<00:01:29.610> holds<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.210> well<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.720> dynamic

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it holds up really well the dynamic

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
it holds up really well the dynamic
range<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:32.159> inch<00:01:32.340> sensor<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.909> Sony

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
range and this one inch sensor and Sony

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.719 
range and this one inch sensor and Sony
rx100<00:01:33.810> looks<00:01:34.320> really<00:01:34.650> good<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.700> can

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
rx100 looks really good you can

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
rx100 looks really good you can
certainly<00:01:36.060> get<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> lot<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.020> detail<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> 20

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
certainly get a lot of detail with a 20

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.069 
certainly get a lot of detail with a 20
megapixel<00:01:38.100> sensor<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:39.420> thing<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:39.840> not

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
megapixel sensor one thing that I'm not

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.010 
megapixel sensor one thing that I'm not
too<00:01:40.439> excited<00:01:40.890> about<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.720> zoom

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
too excited about is that the the zoom

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.499 
too excited about is that the the zoom
lens<00:01:43.290> has<00:01:43.590> kind<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.950> grindy<00:01:44.610> feel<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.210> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
lens has kind of a grindy feel as you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.149 
lens has kind of a grindy feel as you
zoom<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.530> feels<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.009> going

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
zoom in and out it feels like it's going

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.010 
zoom in and out it feels like it's going
