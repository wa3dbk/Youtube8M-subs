it's<00:02:13.209> probably<00:02:13.329> a<00:02:13.510> bit<00:02:13.659> more<00:02:13.809> availability

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
it's probably a bit more availability

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.539 
it's probably a bit more availability
just<00:02:14.590> because<00:02:14.829> there's<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.040> few<00:02:15.189> more<00:02:15.340> places

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
just because there's a few more places

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.519 
just because there's a few more places
to<00:02:15.760> actually<00:02:16.299> try<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.629> get<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.379> the

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:17.529 
to actually try to get it and the

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:18.030 
to actually try to get it and the
smaller

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
smaller

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.280 
smaller
those<00:02:18.640> options<00:02:19.030> just<00:02:19.269> aren't<00:02:19.540> going<00:02:19.659> to<00:02:19.870> exist

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
those options just aren't going to exist

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.800 
those options just aren't going to exist
so<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.829> think<00:02:21.219> it<00:02:21.310> kind<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.519> depends<00:02:22.239> on<00:02:22.510> where

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
so I think it kind of depends on where

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.319 
so I think it kind of depends on where
you<00:02:22.989> live<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:24.010> sort<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.310> thing<00:02:24.370> but<00:02:25.060> I

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
you live and that sort of thing but I

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.970 
you live and that sort of thing but I
say<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.689> definitely<00:02:25.989> luck<00:02:26.109> of<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.260> draw<00:02:26.530> as

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
say it's definitely luck of the draw as

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.289 
say it's definitely luck of the draw as
whether<00:02:27.459> or<00:02:27.609> not<00:02:27.730> you're<00:02:27.969> going<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.180> be<00:02:28.239> able

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
whether or not you're going to be able

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.270 
whether or not you're going to be able

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
do see it be around April but I think

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.039 
do see it be around April but I think
that's<00:03:00.639> not<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.329> annoy<00:03:01.569> too<00:03:01.840> many

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
that's not going to annoy too many

that's not going to annoy too many
people<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.620> mean<00:03:02.799> some<00:03:03.010> people<00:03:03.220> might<00:03:03.400> be

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
the other games to come out that have

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.849 
the other games to come out that have
been<00:03:10.480> delayed<00:03:10.780> until<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.349> sort<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.620> time

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
been delayed until that sort of time

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.470 
been delayed until that sort of time
like<00:03:12.099> saying<00:03:12.430> from<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.669> second<00:03:13.030> son<00:03:13.239> and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
like saying from the second son and

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.750 
like saying from the second son and
watch<00:03:14.260> dogs<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.859> sort<00:03:15.069> of<00:03:15.129> thing<00:03:15.189> so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
watch dogs and that sort of thing so

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.580 
watch dogs and that sort of thing so
maybe<00:03:16.000> it's<00:03:16.120> not<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.269> huge<00:03:16.540> deal<00:03:16.629> but<00:03:17.079> of<00:03:17.260> course

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
maybe it's not a huge deal but of course

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.470 
maybe it's not a huge deal but of course
