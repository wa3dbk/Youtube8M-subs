00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hello everyone today will be a fun design 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.400
 nails bright unusual resembling 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.340
 blots and performed it also unusual 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.769
 in a way namely blowing him varnish from 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.309
 tubules always wanted to try this 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.770
 the way 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.500
 and finally decided since this 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.769
 the way requires space then just 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.119
 it is necessary to cover the skin around the nail 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.300
 protective agent well or just 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.310
 wrap your fingers with scotch by the way me 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.219
 Recently told that means for 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.880
 Cuticle protection can be replaced with pva glue 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.290
 but to be honest I have not tried myself in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.210
 this nail design you can 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.280
 use absolutely any shades 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.800
 varnishes and in any quantity 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.320
 but as a base color is better 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.870
 use white on a white base i will 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.760
 make a small color gradation 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 using gently pink and blue varnishes 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 but you can safely skip this step 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.079
 he is completely optional i just 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.270
 I want the background to be solid and so 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.320
 I put some white on the sponge and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.390
 blue lacquer close to each other and 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:11.100
 patting movements do gradation 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.920
 on one of the marigolds then turn over 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.770
 sponge and missing one finger again 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.080
 I do gradation but from the bottom up everything 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.720
 nails will be different but as a result 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.509
 we get a complete composition 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.600
 Now I apply white and pink varnishes and 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.909
 I cover the remaining legs one 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.909
 top down another bottom up 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.540
 Now the most interesting to get 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.520
 blots we need the straw itself 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.770
 ordinary tube with a small diameter 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.799
 I recommend to enclose a file or 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.860
 plastic folder in one word what is not 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.369
 getting wet is that you don't mind getting dirty 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.030
 with a brush, type in some varnish 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.210
 do not overdo it and sharply 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.000
 blow the fret from the tube to the nail 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.789
 Immediately dip the straw in a jar with varnish 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.520
 but honestly this way too 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.429
 a lot of varnish gets into the straw and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.200
 the blot layer is very thick it turns out to me 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.500
 more like this neatly 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.060
 applied lacquer in a tube brush and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.670
 I recommend keeping the straw under 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.019
 a slight slope so that the varnish does not fly out 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.810
 one big drop 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.239
 if you need another shade then cut 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.959
 the edge of the tube with scissors or take 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.660
 new tubule don't know how it all 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.540
 looks from the outside but in practice everything 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.250
 very fun and exciting recommend 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.130
 try at least once such a design 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.500
 nails and cheer yourself up fun 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.500
 process and very beautiful result 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:03:01.660
 now add some contrast black 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:04.480
 lacquer fits perfectly without waiting 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.850
 full drying of a varnish we remove protective 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:12.100
 wrap off the skin around the nails all 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.230
 remaining flaws can be easily 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.990
 removed using a brush for liquid 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.670
 nail polish removal, in principle, the result is ready 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.890
 You can leave this option from 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.770
 four colors but since my fantasy 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.800
 gives me no peace then I will add quite 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.290
 some silver and gold in these two 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.870
 I have a thin brush and varnish with 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.060
 it needs to remove almost all so 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.850
 only the lungs will remain 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.220
 highlights they are the color itself a little gold and 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.450
 silver will give the design depth and 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.450
 visual volume 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.519
 now you can apply a transparent top 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.599
 coating try not to press on the brush 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.599
 so as not to smear the picture 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.640
 the design with blots is ready and will be 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.709
 cheering you up all day not 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.140
 be afraid to experiment with shades and 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.909
 enjoy the result if you 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.099

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.420
