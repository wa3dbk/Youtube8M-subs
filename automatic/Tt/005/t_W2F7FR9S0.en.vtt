00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
so here's my new kite camera with the

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.010 
so here's my new kite camera with the
GoPro<00:00:02.310> Hero<00:00:02.370> HD<00:00:02.970> camera<00:00:03.360> I<00:00:03.540> have<00:00:03.780> it<00:00:03.870> on<00:00:03.929> the

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
GoPro Hero HD camera I have it on the

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.550 
GoPro Hero HD camera I have it on the
back<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.380> prism<00:00:04.710> III<00:00:05.009> stunt<00:00:05.279> kite<00:00:06.560> the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
back of a prism III stunt kite the

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.259 
back of a prism III stunt kite the
camera<00:00:07.890> itself<00:00:08.130> with<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> battery<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.120> is

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
camera itself with the battery in it is

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.089 
camera itself with the battery in it is
about<00:00:09.840> 3.6<00:00:10.469> ounces

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
about 3.6 ounces

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.339 
about 3.6 ounces
I<00:00:11.130> think<00:00:11.790> with<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> rigging<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.139> about

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
I think with all the rigging is about

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.980 
I think with all the rigging is about
five<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> half<00:00:13.980> maybe<00:00:14.580> slightly<00:00:14.969> more<00:00:15.089> my

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
five and a half maybe slightly more my

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.349 
five and a half maybe slightly more my
old<00:00:16.170> rig<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.590> flip<00:00:16.890> Mino<00:00:17.340> HD<00:00:17.490> with<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
old rig with the flip Mino HD with the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.679 
old rig with the flip Mino HD with the
wide-angle<00:00:19.320> lens<00:00:19.560> was<00:00:19.830> about<00:00:20.250> eight<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:21.539> this

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
wide-angle lens was about eight so this

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.790 
wide-angle lens was about eight so this
is<00:00:21.900> much<00:00:22.289> nicer<00:00:22.320> flies<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> lot<00:00:23.189> better<00:00:24.800> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
is much nicer flies a lot better the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920 
is much nicer flies a lot better the
first<00:00:26.039> thing<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.880> our<00:00:27.240> sky<00:00:27.599> Center

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
first thing we have to our sky Center

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
first thing we have to our sky Center
T's<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.410> front<00:00:28.769> one<00:00:29.460> back<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.300> these

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
T's one front one back you can get these

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.470 
T's one front one back you can get these
at<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.080> kites<00:00:31.289> out<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.740> 250<00:00:32.219> apiece<00:00:32.480> it's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
at the kites out for 250 apiece it's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930 
at the kites out for 250 apiece it's
kind<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> pricey<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.350> need<00:00:34.730> these<00:00:35.730> our

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
kind of pricey but we need these our

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
kind of pricey but we need these our
skies<00:00:36.239> because<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> distance

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
skies because they have a distance

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
skies because they have a distance
between<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> two<00:00:38.100> barrels<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
between the two barrels here and that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.389 
between the two barrels here and that
gets<00:00:39.870> us<00:00:40.110> away<00:00:40.320> from<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> spine<00:00:40.920> far<00:00:41.219> enough

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
gets us away from the spine far enough

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.700 
gets us away from the spine far enough
that<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.850> fit<00:00:42.690> these<00:00:42.809> cross<00:00:43.110> pieces<00:00:43.379> in

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
that we can fit these cross pieces in

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.270 
that we can fit these cross pieces in
without<00:00:43.920> running<00:00:44.430> into<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.910> sail<00:00:45.120> too<00:00:45.300> much

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
without running into the sail too much

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.529 
without running into the sail too much
and<00:00:47.280> there's<00:00:47.460> two<00:00:47.640> different<00:00:47.670> styles<00:00:48.090> they

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and there's two different styles they

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.360 
and there's two different styles they
have<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.780> that's<00:00:48.899> six<00:00:49.559> five<00:00:49.770> six<00:00:50.010> six

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
have one that's six five six six

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.580 
have one that's six five six six
millimeter<00:00:51.090> by<00:00:51.239> six<00:00:51.480> millimeter<00:00:51.899> barrels<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
millimeter by six millimeter barrels and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.819 
millimeter by six millimeter barrels and
then<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.160> that's<00:00:53.190> 6<00:00:54.000> by<00:00:54.149> 7<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.719> got<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> 6<00:00:55.649> by<00:00:55.770> 7

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
then one that's 6 by 7 I got the 6 by 7

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.910 
then one that's 6 by 7 I got the 6 by 7
as<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.520> seven<00:00:56.940> millimeters<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.050> p200

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
as the seven millimeters it's a p200

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
as the seven millimeters it's a p200
tube<00:00:59.850> which<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> spine

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
tube which is what I have on the spine

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.219 
tube which is what I have on the spine
that's<00:01:02.100> nice<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.609> snug<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.870> six

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that's nice and snug and then the six

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.160 
that's nice and snug and then the six
would<00:01:04.710> fit<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> quarter<00:01:05.519> inch<00:01:05.640> dowel<00:01:06.170> really

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
would fit a quarter inch dowel really

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.850 
would fit a quarter inch dowel really
well<00:01:07.350> here

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
well here

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.260 
well here
I<00:01:07.890> had<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> drill<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.729> because<00:01:08.909> I'm<00:01:09.090> using

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I had to drill at all because I'm using

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.390 
I had to drill at all because I'm using
a<00:01:09.479> p200<00:01:10.290> tube<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.619> too<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.070> could<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
a p200 tube here too but you could use a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300 
a p200 tube here too but you could use a
quarter<00:01:12.240> inch<00:01:12.360> dowel<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.890> another

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
quarter inch dowel here and here another

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.740 
quarter inch dowel here and here another
work<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:15.000> fine<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.520> then<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.850> four

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
work just fine and then we have four

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.710 
work just fine and then we have four
stand<00:01:19.140> off<00:01:19.350> connectors<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.490> front<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.450> back

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
stand off connectors to front to back

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.090 
stand off connectors to front to back
and<00:01:22.229> these<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:24.090> 50<00:01:24.630> 60<00:01:24.810> cents<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.530> good

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and these are like 50 60 cents that good

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.210 
and these are like 50 60 cents that good
winds<00:01:26.400> calm<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:28.140> I'm<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.590> sure<00:01:28.710> what<00:01:28.860> size<00:01:29.009> to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
winds calm and I'm not sure what size to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.710 
winds calm and I'm not sure what size to
get<00:01:29.369> these<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:29.790> too<00:01:29.939> big<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.299> had<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> make<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
get these are too big I had to make it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.719 
get these are too big I had to make it
up<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:30.990> some<00:01:31.200> tape<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> get

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
up with some tape but I think if you get

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.260 
up with some tape but I think if you get
the<00:01:32.880> point

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the point

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.859 
the point
one<00:01:34.170> 7/8<00:01:35.009> inch<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.570> should

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
one 7/8 inch I think it is that should

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.330 
one 7/8 inch I think it is that should
that<00:01:37.110> should<00:01:37.320> work<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.860> might<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.159> drill

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that should work you might have to drill

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.819 
that should work you might have to drill
it<00:01:38.400> off<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.790> that's<00:01:38.880> easy<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.680> just

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
it off but that's easy to do and I just

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.340 
it off but that's easy to do and I just
cut<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> corners<00:01:41.579> off<00:01:41.729> these<00:01:41.939> sides<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
cut the corners off these sides so to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.870 
cut the corners off these sides so to
keep<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.619> from<00:01:43.770> running<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> sail<00:01:44.549> too

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
keep it from running of the sail too

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.609 
keep it from running of the sail too
much<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> reinforce<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.290> bit<00:01:46.409> con

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
much in and reinforce a little bit con

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.969 
much in and reinforce a little bit con
tape<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.360> then<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.079> four<00:01:49.439> premier

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
tape and then we have four premier

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.730 
tape and then we have four premier
Center<00:01:50.250> T's<00:01:50.600> is<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:51.810> also<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.110> good<00:01:52.290> ones<00:01:52.500> for

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
Center T's is there also a good ones for

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.330 
Center T's is there also a good ones for
like<00:01:52.890> 50<00:01:53.220> 60<00:01:53.399> cents<00:01:54.259> these<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.380> also<00:01:55.530> seven<00:01:56.100> by

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
like 50 60 cents these are also seven by

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.130 
like 50 60 cents these are also seven by
six<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.250> would<00:01:59.759> use<00:02:00.000> either<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.479> p200

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
six and so I would use either a p200

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.499 
six and so I would use either a p200
tube<00:02:01.320> or<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> fatter<00:02:01.979> Dahl<00:02:02.280> 3/8<00:02:02.909> style<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.420> you

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
tube or a fatter Dahl 3/8 style that you

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.569 
tube or a fatter Dahl 3/8 style that you
might<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> stand<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> cross

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
might have to stand on for the cross

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.359 
might have to stand on for the cross
piece<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:07.229> you'd<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.099> six

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
piece and then you'd have the six

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.350 
piece and then you'd have the six
millimeter<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.349> these<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
millimeter for these the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
millimeter for these the
because<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.050> what<00:02:12.170> I'm<00:02:12.230> using

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
because that's what I'm using

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.170 
because that's what I'm using

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.560 
also some violin caps here and here and
these<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:55.520> have<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.760> shove<00:02:56.000> through<00:02:56.300> with<00:02:56.450> the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
these you have to shove through with the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.570 
these you have to shove through with the
rod<00:02:56.780> until<00:02:57.110> this<00:02:57.200> tip<00:02:57.470> tip<00:02:57.920> sticks<00:02:58.250> out<00:02:58.430> and

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
rod until this tip tip sticks out and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.860 
rod until this tip tip sticks out and
then<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.760> cut<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.030> tip<00:02:59.209> off<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.690> just

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
then you cut the tip off and that just

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.460 
then you cut the tip off and that just
makes<00:03:00.050> up<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.410> extra<00:03:00.860> space<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.350> also

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
makes up that extra space and I also

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.260 
makes up that extra space and I also
have<00:03:03.739> some<00:03:03.980> one<00:03:04.310> layer<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.670> aluminum<00:03:05.060> tape

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
have some one layer of aluminum tape

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.060 
have some one layer of aluminum tape
just<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.750> give<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> little<00:03:06.440> more<00:03:06.560> resistance

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
just to give it a little more resistance

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.160 
just to give it a little more resistance
there<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:07.970> 2<00:03:08.150> millimeter<00:03:08.630> rod<00:03:08.840> keeps

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
there and that 2 millimeter rod keeps

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.860 
there and that 2 millimeter rod keeps
the<00:03:09.290> camera<00:03:09.500> from<00:03:09.770> doing<00:03:10.100> this<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.870> from

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
the camera from doing this and from

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.320 
the camera from doing this and from
rolling<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.890> works<00:03:13.070> really<00:03:13.310> well<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:13.790> you

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
rolling that works really well so you

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.120 
rolling that works really well so you
can<00:03:14.600> slide<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.050> camera<00:03:15.320> back<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.680> forth<00:03:15.950> the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
can slide the camera back and forth the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.270 
can slide the camera back and forth the
longest<00:03:16.489> rod<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:17.060> compensate<00:03:17.750> for<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:19.190> know

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
longest rod to compensate for you know

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.650 
longest rod to compensate for you know
the<00:03:19.400> angle<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.790> height<00:03:19.940> relative<00:03:20.239> to<00:03:20.570> the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
the angle and height relative to the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.150 
the angle and height relative to the
ground<00:03:20.780> which<00:03:21.110> will<00:03:21.320> change<00:03:21.530> depending<00:03:22.040> on

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
ground which will change depending on

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.410 
ground which will change depending on
the<00:03:22.220> wind<00:03:22.400> speed<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.790> top<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.180> window

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
the wind speed the top of the window

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.150 
the wind speed the top of the window
changes<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.200> changes<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.739> angle<00:03:24.980> of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
changes and that changes the angle of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160 
changes and that changes the angle of
the<00:03:25.220> kite<00:03:25.400> relative<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.940> ground<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:26.930> can't

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
the kite relative to ground so you can't

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.350 
the kite relative to ground so you can't
let's<00:03:27.350> say<00:03:27.470> for<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.769> by<00:03:28.040> sliding<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.150> back

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
let's say for that by sliding this back

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.810 
let's say for that by sliding this back
and<00:03:29.510> forth<00:03:29.890> but<00:03:30.890> with<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.130> camera<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.610> field

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
and forth but with this camera the field

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.970 
and forth but with this camera the field
of<00:03:31.910> view<00:03:31.970> is<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.150> wide<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:33.440> probably

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
of view is so wide that you probably

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.039 
of view is so wide that you probably
don't<00:03:34.160> need<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.370> do<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:35.000> never<00:03:35.269> move<00:03:35.959> it

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
don't need to do that I never move it

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.050 
don't need to do that I never move it
any<00:03:36.200> more<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.709> just<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:37.549> know<00:03:37.670> find<00:03:37.970> a

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
any more and you just you know find a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.060 
any more and you just you know find a
spot<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.330> works<00:03:38.810> well<00:03:39.080> for<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.680> normal

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
spot that works well for the normal

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.800 
spot that works well for the normal
speed<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.610> wind<00:03:40.790> that<00:03:40.970> you'd<00:03:41.090> fly<00:03:41.330> it<00:03:41.390> in<00:03:41.630> and

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
speed of wind that you'd fly it in and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
speed of wind that you'd fly it in and
you<00:03:41.989> don't<00:03:42.200> really<00:03:42.380> have<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.739> move<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.420> and

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
you don't really have to move it and

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.620 
you don't really have to move it and
then<00:03:45.830> for<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.459> sides<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:47.000> just<00:03:47.180> have<00:03:47.330> quarter

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
then for the sides I just have quarter

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.479 
then for the sides I just have quarter
inch<00:03:47.780> dowel<00:03:47.959> here<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.560> carved<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.220> flat

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
inch dowel here that I carved a flat

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.600 
inch dowel here that I carved a flat
spot<00:03:49.850> off<00:03:50.239> of<00:03:50.600> where<00:03:51.110> it<00:03:51.230> goes<00:03:52.100> against<00:03:52.489> the

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
spot off of where it goes against the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.970 
spot off of where it goes against the

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
in here and here and here and then along

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.660 
in here and here and here and then along
the<00:04:52.510> sides<00:04:52.840> for<00:04:53.080> this<00:04:53.200> rod<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.680> then<00:04:54.520> you're

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
the sides for this rod and then you're

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.760 
the sides for this rod and then you're
left<00:04:54.910> with<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.390> two<00:04:55.570> cross<00:04:55.810> pieces<00:04:56.110> front<00:04:56.620> and

left with the two cross pieces front and
back<00:04:56.920> and<00:04:57.190> those<00:04:57.340> are<00:04:57.520> less<00:04:57.730> than<00:04:57.940> half<00:04:58.540> and

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
back and those are less than half and

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.050 
back and those are less than half and
almost<00:04:58.960> between<00:04:59.170> them<00:04:59.470> so<00:04:59.770> I'd<00:05:00.640> leave<00:05:00.880> those

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
almost between them so I'd leave those

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.180 
almost between them so I'd leave those
in<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.420> then<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:01.600> can<00:05:01.720> just<00:05:01.810> fly<00:05:01.990> normally<00:05:02.410> so

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
in and then you can just fly normally so

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.820 
in and then you can just fly normally so
the<00:05:03.700> rig<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:04.150> really<00:05:04.450> like<00:05:04.630> it's<00:05:05.470> just<00:05:05.710> the

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
the rig I really like it's just the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.560 
the rig I really like it's just the
thing<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.550> kite<00:05:06.790> doesn't<00:05:07.090> like<00:05:07.210> to<00:05:07.300> have<00:05:07.450> them

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
thing the kite doesn't like to have them

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.560 
thing the kite doesn't like to have them
a<00:05:07.920> weight<00:05:08.920> on<00:05:09.100> its<00:05:09.250> back<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.700> that<00:05:09.910> that<00:05:10.180> that

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
a weight on its back like that that that

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.510 
a weight on its back like that that that
lowell<00:05:10.870> goes<00:05:11.410> into<00:05:11.650> a<00:05:11.710> pickie<00:05:12.040> wobble<00:05:12.370> like

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
lowell goes into a pickie wobble like

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.030 
lowell goes into a pickie wobble like
this<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:14.020> can<00:05:14.200> fix<00:05:14.410> it<00:05:14.530> if<00:05:14.620> you<00:05:14.710> can<00:05:14.830> move<00:05:14.920> the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
this you can fix it if you can move the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.070 
this you can fix it if you can move the
camera<00:05:15.220> far<00:05:15.520> enough<00:05:15.670> up<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:15.940> spine<00:05:16.210> but<00:05:16.810> I

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
camera far enough up the spine but I

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.600 
camera far enough up the spine but I
can't<00:05:17.560> with<00:05:17.710> this<00:05:17.770> camera<00:05:18.130> because<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.400> field

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
can't with this camera because the field

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.470 
can't with this camera because the field
of<00:05:18.700> view<00:05:18.790> is<00:05:18.880> so<00:05:19.210> wide<00:05:19.570> that<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:21.090> move<00:05:22.090> it<00:05:22.210> up<00:05:22.270> any

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
of view is so wide that I move it up any

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.780 
of view is so wide that I move it up any
further<00:05:22.750> I<00:05:22.870> get<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.260> kite<00:05:23.440> into<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.890> end<00:05:24.670> of

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
further I get the kite into the end of

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.970 
further I get the kite into the end of
the<00:05:24.850> shot<00:05:25.140> so<00:05:26.140> I<00:05:26.170> have<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.650> leave<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:26.890> about

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
the shot so I have to leave it about

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.430 
the shot so I have to leave it about
like<00:05:27.280> there<00:05:27.520> but<00:05:27.790> it's<00:05:28.690> so<00:05:28.930> light<00:05:29.200> that<00:05:29.230> it

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
like there but it's so light that it

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.900 
like there but it's so light that it
doesn't<00:05:29.800> really<00:05:29.890> do<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.100> much<00:05:30.370> anyway<00:05:30.640> a

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
doesn't really do that much anyway a

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.240 
doesn't really do that much anyway a
decent<00:05:31.390> wind<00:05:31.540> stabilizes<00:05:32.230> it<00:05:32.380> pretty<00:05:32.740> well<00:05:32.860> so

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
decent wind stabilizes it pretty well so

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:44.110 
decent wind stabilizes it pretty well so
I<00:05:33.550> don't<00:05:34.540> think<00:05:34.690> it's<00:05:34.810> gonna<00:05:34.900> be<00:05:35.080> an<00:05:35.169> issue

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.650 

camera<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.139> like<00:05:46.100> the<00:05:46.550> resolution<00:05:47.150> is<00:05:47.270> great<00:05:47.510> at

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
camera I like the resolution is great at

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.540 
camera I like the resolution is great at
1080p<00:05:48.080> is<00:05:48.530> great<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:48.949> colors<00:05:49.250> are<00:05:49.370> really

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
1080p is great the colors are really

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.050 
1080p is great the colors are really
nice<00:05:49.699> image<00:05:50.540> stabilization<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.350> really<00:05:51.560> nice

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
nice image stabilization is really nice

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.219 
nice image stabilization is really nice
but<00:05:53.060> I<00:05:53.120> don't<00:05:53.300> like<00:05:53.449> the<00:05:53.570> wide<00:05:53.750> field<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.169> view

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
but I don't like the wide field of view

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.050 
but I don't like the wide field of view
it's<00:05:54.590> great<00:05:54.830> for<00:05:55.100> you<00:05:55.280> know<00:05:55.310> adventure<00:05:55.790> sports

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
it's great for you know adventure sports

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.870 
it's great for you know adventure sports
stuff<00:05:56.389> down<00:05:56.690> low<00:05:56.900> but<00:05:57.650> I<00:05:57.680> don't<00:05:57.919> like<00:05:58.130> that

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
stuff down low but I don't like that

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.790 
stuff down low but I don't like that
fisheye<00:05:59.419> distortion<00:05:59.990> along<00:06:00.199> the<00:06:00.350> horizon

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
fisheye distortion along the horizon

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.530 
fisheye distortion along the horizon
when<00:06:00.949> I'm<00:06:01.040> up<00:06:01.310> high<00:06:01.580> it's<00:06:02.120> not<00:06:02.300> a<00:06:02.330> real

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
when I'm up high it's not a real

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.650 
when I'm up high it's not a real
cinematic<00:06:03.110> shot<00:06:03.580> but<00:06:04.580> I<00:06:04.820> haven't<00:06:05.240> quite<00:06:05.389> flown

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
cinematic shot but I haven't quite flown

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.560 
cinematic shot but I haven't quite flown
enough<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.169> decide<00:06:06.979> if<00:06:07.130> it's<00:06:07.250> gonna<00:06:07.370> be<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.580> real

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
enough to decide if it's gonna be a real

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.080 
enough to decide if it's gonna be a real
issue<00:06:08.720> so<00:06:09.260> we'll<00:06:09.440> see<00:06:09.729> and<00:06:10.729> I<00:06:10.940> think<00:06:11.300> that's<00:06:11.660> it
