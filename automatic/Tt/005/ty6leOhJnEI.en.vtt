00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:46.500
 combatant even if we lay files 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:50.969

 It's a marquinhos only sound of htc that is 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.180
 basically the communication drivers 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:07.339
 such windows to communicate with the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.339
 his cell phone is that if the name of the Serbian 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:16.670

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.670
 fast installed in school 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.250
 good this store giving a warning but already 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.450
 installed 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:37.850
 Okay, the second step is to enable 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:44.860
 this way of communication through 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:56.810
 on a button and navigated properties 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:02:00.830
 by the settings wagner lu programs is 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.890
 lower development and gravel that 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:09.410
 option here รณ debugging receive pass from 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.630
 jean enabled the message decide who 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.709
 It's difficult to show here but they're okay. 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.709
 here is enabled 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.180
 initially it is we will connect the cable 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:30.230
 micro usb 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:34.840
 Is every pc getting on the usb hard to 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.840
 Are you safer here? 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.010
 it is an emotion message that is connected 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.170
 and there in windows already shows that it is 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.820
 installing a large yummy software 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.410
 get well 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.940
 already acknowledged already installed means that 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.930
 so this law the driver is not 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.720
 before you open you have the baby's choice and when 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.170
 I tried micro usb cable and it is already in the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.560
 windows is ready to 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.310
 execute this file here that I 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.120
 I regretted conquering I downloaded one 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:20.430
 program we have here to give the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:23.850
 by a 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.150
 out that makes that rude way that I 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.830
 I mentioned just before you can 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.480
 to record in here are there in the system not 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.900
 support this file also since it is 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.840
 a text file click commands to 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.060
 put the basic commands to save 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.290
 the file inside the cellphone then already 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.410
 it was all one thing 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.070
 It's easier for you there then let's go 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.070
 run it 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.740
 shows a normal dose window but yes 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.750
 right none 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.110
 and you will have to confirm that 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:06.570
 pressing a key will continue to 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:12.390
 work is beginning to have made a 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.770
 very fast even though 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.930
 I already did it a little faster 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.670
 but the first time and it will take some 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.490
 seconds to something well abducts and it goes 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.730
 Putting the handset on will restart the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:31.669
 device and this window is already ok you 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.669
 You can not press any key 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.280
 demonstrates a command line 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.060

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:23.529
