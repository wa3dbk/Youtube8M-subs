00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.200
 actually thought as four players remember around here we see a little 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.550
 Tick ​​too little is difficult to access from the Manuel Frondel again 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.790
 for the opponent is where you really have so the increasing consumption 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.820

 March continues 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.740

 Advisory Board Katrin Altpeter 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.180
 Reinforced testing Random House has played extremely high levels but then 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.240
 specialized and all now have more or less the focus on 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.439
 With Cubist, Lehmann says painter percent and East again 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.910
 own information 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.049
 Rotthaus 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.430
 so and we accordingly rose here 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.230
 Percent means abstain In the evening quote blood red from in any case 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.399
 to clear up on this map of course that it is here due to the size 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.780
 just because the man once again to expect problems that I think 

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:45.709
 not that we will see a quick decision here too 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:46.590
 easy for her 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.830
 Much too big ours is so reflected that the atomic nerve and smoke were located 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.560
 almost Xpansion 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.610
 still growing before the first 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 that's just as sick people 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.360
 Now the cracks can be Pechstein. "I find that the most direct 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.440
 or to success 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.149
 Red there must be fast 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.030
 Otherwise, war is not the worst thing here 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.880
 Percent for now, the pool is now missing even Gomez but dry 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.139
 Darnell some economists here Unique pressure will of course we know 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.790
 that the experiment always welded 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.100
 2 beaten 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.150
 like history, especially since he still misplaced this little bit 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.889
 Needles is so the stones will be 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.989
 and I think that's also growing with Babbel 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.849
 and vice versa, to have said what criticism given to people 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.149
 played more there

 Booth saw the saw, however, in any case, extremely funny to look excited 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.959
 how this plays she develops 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.829
 Of course there is now percent 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.309
 Rear room only for 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.059
 Ill chance you had to do that quickly 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.059
 for the stony on the way and they should inform themselves

 Paderborn at least so really picture 4 that is of course extremely hectic so 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:31.149
 I think I've got mountains to play that's what I've got that's a fact 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:32.830
 a wrong passport data

 11 three issues relatively often seen but also Stalker 2 patzte mix 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:41.369
 This magic strategy usually does not make sense 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.709
 At the same time, Obama expects her flight here once percent 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.109

 the air is also a very interesting game wants four Rex 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.909
 after the command center of the lecture is also very sick so really 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:16.030
 for alternative game I'm always happy when I can buy something because 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.459
 he always promises that percent 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.539
 Tension or unconventional measure 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.539
 of course, require unconventional countermeasures 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:27.400
 also on the ferries also überörtliche 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.979
 funny action of both players 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.979
 currently 44 60 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.809
 and the first contracts we are 2 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.059
 respectable Viebrock percent Sedo with the fastest with self-developed 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.059
 also important 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.319
 inflowing benefit to their post

 Preview of the Conny with 32 25 of course has 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.579
 WebFOCUS put a lot of pressure and percent down 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.669
 not bad 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.919
 you do not have to lie to you and me like that 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.919
 of course I mean 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.009
 I think so whether he is currently running second expenses 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.650
 cyclist 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.650
 that is too early 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.289
 Laura still Fanta to reinforce her 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.550
 effectively pursued at first often far ways mined 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.380
 1407 67 at this stage of the game is just totally sick 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.789
 because the money can be well done 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.789
 a homage to the bed 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.110
 they occupy 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.520
 Mirror she is forced to find very violent bio picture 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.220
 has no area we quickly have fast lizards 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.309
 with 10 2 percent clearly on the way 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:07.419
 because he was happy that I also soon in the wm evaluation occupied 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.710
 now actually the first in the book you try at the forest on the 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:14.030
 Papers from Beiersdorf 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.990
 the letter postage 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.760
 much more effective caregivers Theo Walcott 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.360
 who is planned beforehand that this results in «4 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.379
 that in turn with 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.409
 rek / afp 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:28.930
 it is of little value 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.310
 for comparison for the second quarter
