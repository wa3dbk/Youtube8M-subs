drunk them these are exclusives which is
very<00:01:15.990> cool<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.470> at<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.490> store<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:18.150> had

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
very cool I think at the store they had

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.359 
very cool I think at the store they had
a<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.600> sign<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:18.979> for<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.250> these

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
a little sign there for all of these

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.070 
a little sign there for all of these
exclusives<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.180> had<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> table<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.810> different

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
exclusives they had a table of different

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.770 
exclusives they had a table of different
ones<00:01:22.670> they<00:01:23.670> were<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:24.000> limit<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.750> per

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
ones they were all limit one per

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
ones they were all limit one per
customer<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.710> obviously<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:27.000> an

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
customer so obviously I don't have an

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.319 
customer so obviously I don't have an
extra<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> here's<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> wampas<00:01:29.340> arm<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
extra one and here's the wampas arm that

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.080 
extra one and here's the wampas arm that
loop<00:01:30.600> cuts<00:01:30.930> off<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.490> pretty<00:01:32.670> cool<00:01:32.909> I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
loop cuts off I think it's pretty cool I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
loop cuts off I think it's pretty cool I
would<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.140> had<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
would like to have had like a way to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.340 
would like to have had like a way to
attach<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.790> back<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> could<00:01:37.140> look<00:01:37.290> like

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
attach it back so it could look like

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.260 
attach it back so it could look like
before-and-after<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.640> could<00:01:38.790> change<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.119> out

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
before-and-after you could change it out

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.140 
before-and-after you could change it out
that<00:01:39.869> would<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.079> been<00:01:40.170> cool<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.590> still<00:01:41.520> it's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that would have been cool but still it's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
that would have been cool but still it's
awesome<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> Wafaa<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.310> also<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
awesome because the Wafaa is also a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.170 
awesome because the Wafaa is also a
bobble<00:01:45.420> head<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:46.049> he's<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> lot<00:01:47.310> heavier<00:01:47.909> than

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
bobble head and he's a lot heavier than

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.929 
bobble head and he's a lot heavier than
I<00:01:48.240> expected<00:01:48.390> him<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.280> but<00:01:50.280> he's<00:01:50.520> also<00:01:50.700> quite
