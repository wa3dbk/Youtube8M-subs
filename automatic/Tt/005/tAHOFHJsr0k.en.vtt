equipment you have investing in lighting

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.480 
equipment you have investing in lighting
gear<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.629> probably<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.140> best<00:00:04.380> way<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.830> improve

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
gear is probably the best way to improve

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.730 
gear is probably the best way to improve
the<00:00:05.759> technical<00:00:06.240> aspects<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.720> your<00:00:06.810> film<00:00:07.049> so

products which I've mentioned in this
video<00:00:41.710> ok<00:00:42.520> so<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.790> first<00:00:43.000> bit<00:00:43.210> of<00:00:43.270> lighting

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
video ok so the first bit of lighting

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.540 
video ok so the first bit of lighting
equipment<00:00:43.989> I<00:00:44.050> recommend<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:44.530> get<00:00:44.680> is<00:00:44.860> a

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
equipment I recommend you get is a

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.760 
equipment I recommend you get is a
fluorescent<00:00:46.090> light<00:00:46.480> head<00:00:46.720> now<00:00:47.110> these<00:00:47.559> are

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
fluorescent light head now these are

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.010 
fluorescent light head now these are
quite<00:00:47.890> difficult<00:00:47.950> to<00:00:48.430> find<00:00:48.670> in<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.000> US<00:00:49.390> so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
quite difficult to find in the US so

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.440 
quite difficult to find in the US so
what<00:00:50.590> you're<00:00:50.710> essentially<00:00:51.010> looking<00:00:51.160> for<00:00:51.640> is<00:00:51.820> a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
what you're essentially looking for is a

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.150 
what you're essentially looking for is a
light<00:00:52.900> fixture<00:00:53.110> that<00:00:53.770> has<00:00:54.010> for<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.970> 27<00:00:55.930> mount<00:00:56.170> 85

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
light fixture that has for a 27 mount 85

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.510 
light fixture that has for a 27 mount 85
watt<00:00:57.490> bulb<00:00:57.850> sockets<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:58.720> then<00:00:59.530> the<00:01:00.100> idea<00:01:00.400> is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
watt bulb sockets and then the idea is

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.460 
watt bulb sockets and then the idea is
that<00:01:00.550> you<00:01:00.730> replace<00:01:01.120> those<00:01:01.390> bulbs<00:01:01.690> that<00:01:01.960> came

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
that you replace those bulbs that came

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.940 
that you replace those bulbs that came
with<00:01:02.650> it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
with it

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.920 
with it
with<00:01:03.250> some<00:01:03.460> more<00:01:03.579> expensive<00:01:04.030> ones<00:01:04.239> which<00:01:04.720> are

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
with some more expensive ones which are

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.170 
with some more expensive ones which are
much<00:01:05.170> brighter<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.800> have<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.160> much<00:01:06.399> higher<00:01:06.700> CRI

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
much brighter and have a much higher CRI

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.050 
much brighter and have a much higher CRI
so<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.590> light<00:01:08.770> itself<00:01:09.160> is<00:01:09.310> very<00:01:09.460> inexpensive

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
so the light itself is very inexpensive

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.150 
so the light itself is very inexpensive
but<00:01:10.450> then<00:01:10.840> if<00:01:10.960> you<00:01:11.050> spend<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.530> fair<00:01:11.860> amount<00:01:11.920> on

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
but then if you spend a fair amount on

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.560 
but then if you spend a fair amount on
the<00:01:12.250> bulbs<00:01:12.610> then<00:01:12.970> you<00:01:13.090> can<00:01:13.180> have<00:01:13.300> to<00:01:13.390> get<00:01:13.540> a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
the bulbs then you can have to get a

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.240 
the bulbs then you can have to get a
really<00:01:13.899> nice<00:01:14.080> light<00:01:14.380> for<00:01:14.950> not<00:01:15.070> that<00:01:15.220> much

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
really nice light for not that much

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.219 
really nice light for not that much
money<00:01:15.580> but<00:01:16.330> again<00:01:16.479> if<00:01:16.600> you're<00:01:16.720> in<00:01:16.810> America

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
money but again if you're in America

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.780 
money but again if you're in America
then<00:01:17.680> it's<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.920> little<00:01:17.979> bit<00:01:18.160> difficult<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.550> find

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
then it's a little bit difficult to find

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.310 
then it's a little bit difficult to find
so<00:01:19.240> I<00:01:19.270> recommend<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:19.720> check<00:01:19.930> out<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.170> blog

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
so I recommend you check out the blog

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.180 
so I recommend you check out the blog
post<00:01:20.380> where<00:01:20.710> I've<00:01:20.800> got<00:01:20.920> some<00:01:20.950> more

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
post where I've got some more

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.830 
post where I've got some more
information<00:01:21.520> about<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.570> once<00:01:22.720> you've

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
information about that so once you've

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.540 
information about that so once you've
got<00:01:22.990> one<00:01:23.110> or<00:01:23.229> two<00:01:23.259> of<00:01:23.500> those<00:01:23.619> I<00:01:23.860> recommend<00:01:24.460> that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
got one or two of those I recommend that

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.510 
got one or two of those I recommend that
you<00:01:24.610> get<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.000> aperture<00:01:25.479> al<00:01:25.810> 5<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.380> 8<00:01:26.500> s<00:01:26.740> now

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
you get the aperture al 5 to 8 s now

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.310 
you get the aperture al 5 to 8 s now
this<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.850> great<00:01:28.060> because<00:01:28.240> firstly<00:01:29.170> it's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
this is great because firstly it's

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.980 
this is great because firstly it's
pretty<00:01:29.560> inexpensive<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.820> also<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.570> gives<00:01:31.840> you

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
pretty inexpensive but also it gives you

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.960 
pretty inexpensive but also it gives you
a<00:01:32.020> hard<00:01:32.530> light<00:01:32.799> source<00:01:33.100> which<00:01:33.610> is<00:01:33.760> something

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
a hard light source which is something

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.730 
a hard light source which is something
you<00:01:34.030> just<00:01:34.120> don't<00:01:34.360> get<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.510> fluorescence<00:01:35.020> now

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
you just don't get a fluorescence now

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.890 
you just don't get a fluorescence now
there<00:01:36.280> are<00:01:36.400> many<00:01:36.610> benefits<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:37.240> using<00:01:37.390> LEDs

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
there are many benefits to using LEDs

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.899 
there are many benefits to using LEDs
the<00:01:38.380> biggest<00:01:38.680> one<00:01:38.830> being<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.460> can<00:01:39.820> be

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
the biggest one being that it can be

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.300 
the biggest one being that it can be
battery-powered<00:01:40.299> so<00:01:41.140> it's<00:01:41.740> totally<00:01:41.979> portable

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
battery-powered so it's totally portable

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.280 
battery-powered so it's totally portable
totally<00:01:43.000> Wireless<00:01:43.330> which<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:43.930> pretty<00:01:44.110> nice

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
totally Wireless which is pretty nice

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.140 
totally Wireless which is pretty nice
thing<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.680> have<00:01:44.799> so<00:01:45.490> with<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.790> I'd<00:01:46.000> recommend

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
thing to have so with that I'd recommend

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.770 
thing to have so with that I'd recommend
a<00:01:46.650> 160<00:01:47.650> LED<00:01:48.159> light<00:01:48.400> this<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.060> very<00:01:49.420> small

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
a 160 LED light this is a very small

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.750 
a 160 LED light this is a very small
inexpensive<00:01:50.500> light<00:01:50.710> which<00:01:51.159> essentially<00:01:51.670> you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
inexpensive light which essentially you

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.219 
inexpensive light which essentially you
can<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:52.119> like<00:01:52.270> Chuck<00:01:52.540> in<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.689> background<00:01:53.110> of

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
can just like Chuck in the background of

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.500 
can just like Chuck in the background of
a<00:01:53.290> shot<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.890> light<00:01:54.400> up<00:01:54.580> one<00:01:54.790> particular<00:01:55.090> thing

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
a shot to light up one particular thing

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.660 
a shot to light up one particular thing
or<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.080> can<00:01:56.200> use<00:01:56.290> it<00:01:56.409> as<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> catch<00:01:56.799> light<00:01:57.100> there

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
or you can use it as a catch light there

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.980 
or you can use it as a catch light there
are<00:01:57.700> many<00:01:57.939> uses<00:01:58.119> for<00:01:58.450> them<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:58.720> they're<00:01:58.810> so

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
are many uses for them and they're so

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.289 
are many uses for them and they're so
cheap<00:01:59.260> it<00:01:59.710> makes<00:01:59.920> sense<00:02:00.100> just<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.460> have<00:02:00.640> one<00:02:01.180> or

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
cheap it makes sense just to have one or

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.960 
cheap it makes sense just to have one or
two<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:01.570> your<00:02:01.630> bag<00:02:02.010> so<00:02:03.010> to<00:02:03.040> go<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:03.340> these<00:02:03.520> LEDs

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
two in your bag so to go with these LEDs

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.510 
two in your bag so to go with these LEDs
you're<00:02:04.509> going<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.720> need<00:02:04.869> some<00:02:05.200> batteries<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
you're going to need some batteries so

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.830 
you're going to need some batteries so
recommend<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.000> get<00:02:07.090> some<00:02:07.299> third-party

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
recommend that you get some third-party

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
Sony NPF 970 batteries now these are not

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.009 
Sony NPF 970 batteries now these are not
too<00:02:12.220> expensive<00:02:12.269> again<00:02:13.269> I've<00:02:13.450> got<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.720> links

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
too expensive again I've got the links

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.900 
too expensive again I've got the links
to<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.260> ones<00:02:14.410> which<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.890> found<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.519> be<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.790> most

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
to the ones which I found to be the most

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.880 
to the ones which I found to be the most
reliable<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.750> recommend<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.260> get<00:02:17.380> at<00:02:17.650> least

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
reliable so I recommend you get at least

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.880 
reliable so I recommend you get at least
four<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.340> those<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:19.480> dual<00:02:19.870> battery<00:02:20.320> charger

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
four of those and a dual battery charger

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.319 
four of those and a dual battery charger
so<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.489> can<00:02:21.610> charge<00:02:21.760> them<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.090> quick<00:02:22.239> as

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
so that you can charge them as quick as

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.600 
so that you can charge them as quick as
possible<00:02:22.769> so<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.799> go<00:02:24.010> with<00:02:24.100> those<00:02:24.190> lights<00:02:24.489> I

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
possible so to go with those lights I

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.680 
possible so to go with those lights I
recommend<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.060> get<00:02:25.150> three<00:02:25.480> light

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
recommend that you get three light

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.360 
recommend that you get three light
stands<00:02:26.049> now<00:02:26.500> there's<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.739> choice<00:02:26.920> here<00:02:27.220> I've

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
stands now there's a choice here I've

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.880 
stands now there's a choice here I've
linked<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.570> heavy<00:02:28.870> duty<00:02:29.170> version<00:02:29.739> and

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
linked to the heavy duty version and

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.070 
linked to the heavy duty version and
light<00:02:30.489> weight<00:02:30.700> version<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.540> kind<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.900> like

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
light weight version so I kind of like

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.780 
light weight version so I kind of like
the<00:02:32.170> light<00:02:32.319> weight<00:02:32.530> ones<00:02:32.739> but<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.430> course<00:02:33.670> if

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the light weight ones but of course if

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.190 
the light weight ones but of course if
you're<00:02:33.880> going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.060> be

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you're going to be

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.199 
you're going to be
using<00:02:34.410> heavy<00:02:34.650> lights<00:02:34.980> or<00:02:35.250> you're<00:02:35.819> in<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.970> studio

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
using heavy lights or you're in a studio

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.790 
using heavy lights or you're in a studio
then<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.959> may<00:02:37.050> make<00:02:37.230> sense<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.560> get<00:02:37.739> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
then it may make sense to get the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.410 
then it may make sense to get the
heavy-duty<00:02:38.129> ones<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.209> want<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
heavy-duty ones but if you want the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.509 
heavy-duty ones but if you want the
portability<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.620> lightweight<00:02:41.010> ones<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
portability of the lightweight ones and

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.369 
portability of the lightweight ones and
you<00:02:41.849> can<00:02:41.879> just<00:02:42.269> put<00:02:42.450> some<00:02:42.599> sandbags<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.230> them

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
you can just put some sandbags on them

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.900 
you can just put some sandbags on them
and<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:43.800> are<00:02:43.830> actually<00:02:44.010> pretty<00:02:44.340> stable<00:02:44.580> and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and they are actually pretty stable and

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.000 
and they are actually pretty stable and
they're<00:02:45.300> very<00:02:45.480> inexpensive<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.769> up<00:02:46.890> to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
they're very inexpensive so it's up to

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.890 
they're very inexpensive so it's up to
you<00:02:47.129> what<00:02:47.790> kind<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.090> light<00:02:48.239> stands<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.660> get

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
you what kind of light stands you get

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.259 
you what kind of light stands you get
but<00:02:49.560> generally<00:02:49.980> they'll<00:02:50.550> be<00:02:50.700> fine<00:02:50.910> they're

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
but generally they'll be fine they're

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.000 
but generally they'll be fine they're
all<00:02:51.390> compatible<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.200> worked<00:02:52.800> really<00:02:52.920> well

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
all compatible and worked really well

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.430 
all compatible and worked really well
now<00:02:54.000> I'd<00:02:54.300> also<00:02:54.330> recommend<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.200> get<00:02:55.380> a

so versatile it essentially allows you

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.250 
so versatile it essentially allows you
to<00:03:20.130> have<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.519> baby<00:03:21.000> receiver<00:03:21.450> or<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.810> quarter

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
to have a baby receiver or a quarter

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.280 
to have a baby receiver or a quarter
twenty<00:03:22.650> thread<00:03:23.150> anywhere<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.450> room<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.230> you

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
twenty thread anywhere in a room so you

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.930 
twenty thread anywhere in a room so you
could<00:03:25.440> put<00:03:25.620> multiple<00:03:26.040> lights<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.640> stand

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
could put multiple lights on one stand

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.240 
could put multiple lights on one stand
or<00:03:27.180> attach<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.989> microphone<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> door<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
or attach a microphone to a door the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.309 
or attach a microphone to a door the
possibilities<00:03:29.849> really<00:03:30.030> are<00:03:30.120> endless<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:31.260> the

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
possibilities really are endless so the

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.949 
possibilities really are endless so the
next<00:03:31.500> thing<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.610> swivel<00:03:33.209> head<00:03:33.299> now<00:03:33.810> these

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
next thing is a swivel head now these

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.050 
next thing is a swivel head now these
are<00:03:34.170> great<00:03:34.260> for<00:03:34.380> particularly<00:03:35.370> LEDs<00:03:35.790> which

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
are great for particularly LEDs which

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.880 
are great for particularly LEDs which
don't<00:03:36.299> have<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.540> tilting<00:03:37.019> feature<00:03:37.349> built<00:03:37.739> in

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
don't have a tilting feature built in

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.740 
don't have a tilting feature built in
and<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.069> one<00:03:38.430> from<00:03:38.549> Manfrotto<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.299> super

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
and the one from Manfrotto is super

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.569 
and the one from Manfrotto is super
super<00:03:40.049> well<00:03:40.170> built<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.010> recommend<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.489> you

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
super well built so I recommend that you

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.759 
super well built so I recommend that you
totally<00:03:42.060> avoid<00:03:42.299> those<00:03:42.569> cheaper<00:03:43.200> alternatives

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
totally avoid those cheaper alternatives

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.309 
totally avoid those cheaper alternatives
now<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.370> can<00:03:44.519> be<00:03:44.609> paired<00:03:44.910> with<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.690> reflector

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
now it can be paired with a reflector

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.690 
now it can be paired with a reflector
clip<00:03:46.530> which<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:46.799> something<00:03:47.040> else<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.310> recommend

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
clip which is something else I recommend

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.180 
clip which is something else I recommend
you<00:03:47.819> get<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.660> allows<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.380> attach<00:03:50.100> a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
you get and this allows you to attach a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.819 
you get and this allows you to attach a
reflector<00:03:50.730> onto<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> light<00:03:51.359> stand<00:03:51.630> or<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.019> combi

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
reflector onto a light stand or a combi

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.539 
reflector onto a light stand or a combi
camp<00:03:53.069> or<00:03:53.780> AC<00:03:54.780> stand<00:03:55.049> okay<00:03:55.829> so<00:03:55.889> lastly<00:03:56.250> we<00:03:56.430> have

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
camp or AC stand okay so lastly we have

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.970 
camp or AC stand okay so lastly we have
the<00:03:56.700> absolute<00:03:57.120> essentials<00:03:57.690> gaffer<00:03:58.530> tape<00:03:58.560> and

the absolute essentials gaffer tape and
black<00:03:59.819> wrap<00:04:00.030> gaffer<00:04:00.870> tape<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.200> great<00:04:01.380> because

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
black wrap gaffer tape is great because

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.490 
black wrap gaffer tape is great because
it<00:04:02.220> has<00:04:02.340> billions<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:03.120> uses<00:04:03.510> we<00:04:03.989> all<00:04:04.109> know<00:04:04.290> this

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500

is<00:04:08.790> great<00:04:09.000> for<00:04:09.209> flagging<00:04:09.720> lights<00:04:09.959> or<00:04:10.230> blocking

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
is great for flagging lights or blocking

already got some of this stuff so I'm
going<00:04:24.539> to<00:04:24.599> do<00:04:24.690> some<00:04:24.840> extra<00:04:25.020> things<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.680> first

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
going to do some extra things the first

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.240 
going to do some extra things the first
thing<00:04:26.160> is<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.820> digital<00:04:27.210> juice<00:04:27.479> flag<00:04:28.260> kit<00:04:28.680> now

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
thing is the digital juice flag kit now

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.370 
thing is the digital juice flag kit now
this<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.639> pretty<00:04:30.270> expensive<00:04:30.690> I'll<00:04:31.050> say<00:04:31.229> that

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
this is pretty expensive I'll say that

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.740 
this is pretty expensive I'll say that
right<00:04:31.410> now<00:04:31.650> but<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.580> can't<00:04:33.479> really<00:04:33.599> get

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
right now but you can't really get

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.670 
right now but you can't really get
anything<00:04:33.990> else<00:04:34.229> like<00:04:34.440> it

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
anything else like it

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.500 
anything else like it
it's<00:04:35.099> essentially<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.940> kit<00:04:36.720> with<00:04:37.080> flags<00:04:37.560> and

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
it's essentially a kit with flags and

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.810 
it's essentially a kit with flags and
nets<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.810> all<00:04:40.320> sorts<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.710> different

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
nets and all sorts of different

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.649 
nets and all sorts of different
accessories<00:04:41.820> which<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.090> can<00:04:42.240> put<00:04:42.450> in<00:04:42.539> front

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
accessories which you can put in front

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.930 
accessories which you can put in front
of<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.900> lights<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.740> comes<00:04:43.979> with<00:04:44.099> frames

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
of the lights and it comes with frames

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.170 
of the lights and it comes with frames
which<00:04:45.539> can<00:04:45.750> then<00:04:45.840> be<00:04:45.900> very<00:04:46.200> easily<00:04:46.409> attached

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
which can then be very easily attached

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.790 
which can then be very easily attached
to<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.330> c-stand<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.289> this<00:04:48.410> is<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.560> really

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
to a c-stand so this is a really

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.770 
to a c-stand so this is a really
professional<00:04:49.250> bit<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.699> kit<00:04:49.910> I've<00:04:50.120> heard<00:04:50.539> a<00:04:50.600> lot

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
professional bit of kit I've heard a lot

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.840 
professional bit of kit I've heard a lot
of<00:04:50.810> people<00:04:50.990> who<00:04:51.350> swear<00:04:51.740> by<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:52.039> and<00:04:52.250> say<00:04:52.699> it's

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
of people who swear by it and say it's

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.640 
of people who swear by it and say it's
totally<00:04:53.120> worth<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.300> money<00:04:53.570> but<00:04:54.139> it<00:04:54.289> is<00:04:54.410> quite

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
totally worth the money but it is quite

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.219 
totally worth the money but it is quite
expensive<00:04:54.889> and<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.820> second<00:04:56.180> one<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.449> a<00:04:56.720> 40

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
expensive and the second one is a 40

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.830 
expensive and the second one is a 40
inch<00:04:57.380> C's<00:04:57.650> dent<00:04:57.889> now<00:04:58.460> this<00:04:58.639> is<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:59.030> c-stand

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
which can reach 10 feet tall so you can

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.070
