just going to talk about what I think
about<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> m16<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.180> black<00:00:24.359> ops<00:00:25.070> my<00:00:26.070> first

about the m16 in black ops my first

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.920 
about the m16 in black ops my first
thoughts<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.180> definitely

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
thoughts of it is that it's definitely

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.349 
thoughts of it is that it's definitely
not<00:00:28.140> as<00:00:28.320> good<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.789> m16<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.939> modern<00:00:30.210> call

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
not as good as the m16 for modern call

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.200 
not as good as the m16 for modern call
of<00:00:30.449> duty's<00:00:30.750> arm<00:00:31.790> definitely<00:00:32.790> doesn't<00:00:33.000> match

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
of duty's arm definitely doesn't match

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.049

pretty much have no competition because

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.460 
pretty much have no competition because

just<00:01:15.210> read<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.479> post<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.110> m16<00:01:16.890> ACOG<00:01:17.720> plus

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
just read this post that m16 ACOG plus

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.310 
just read this post that m16 ACOG plus
cqb<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.650> mean<00:01:20.330> CQC<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.689> close<00:01:21.930> quarters

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
cqb I mean CQC which is close quarters

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.760 
cqb I mean CQC which is close quarters
combat<00:01:22.490> equals<00:01:23.490> M<00:01:23.729> 16<00:01:24.210> equals<00:01:24.540> fail<00:01:24.900> well<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
combat equals M 16 equals fail well to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.890 
combat equals M 16 equals fail well to
that<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.130> laugh<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> use<00:01:27.509> dual

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that I laugh because if you use dual

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.550 
that I laugh because if you use dual
wield<00:01:28.350> pythons<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.909> are<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.509> beast<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
wield pythons then you are a beast and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
wield pythons then you are a beast and
for<00:01:31.920> some<00:01:32.130> reason<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.759> use<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.540> dual

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
for some reason if you use on the dual

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170 
for some reason if you use on the dual
wield<00:01:34.049> python<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.770> takes<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.189> way<00:01:36.119> too

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
wield python so it takes like way too

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
wield python so it takes like way too
long<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> pull<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.380> you're<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.770> cuz<00:01:38.040> it's

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
long to pull out if you're you cuz it's

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
long to pull out if you're you cuz it's
a<00:01:38.220> pistol<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> should<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.110> quick<00:01:40.110> whip

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
a pistol it should be like quick whip

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.620 
a pistol it should be like quick whip
and<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:41.340> some<00:01:41.520> reason<00:01:41.549> when<00:01:42.030> i<00:01:42.060> use<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.420> gun

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and for some reason when i use this gun

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.719 
and for some reason when i use this gun
it<00:01:42.810> feels<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> has<00:01:43.350> no<00:01:43.649> recoil<00:01:44.220> cuts<00:01:44.579> it's

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it feels like it has no recoil cuts it's

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.530 
it feels like it has no recoil cuts it's
an<00:01:44.820> m16<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.560> m16s<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.710> no<00:01:47.130> recoil<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.939> it's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
an m16 and m16s have no recoil and it's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.590 
an m16 and m16s have no recoil and it's
an<00:01:48.659> acog<00:01:49.110> m-16<00:01:49.710> which<00:01:49.740> reduces<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> recoil<00:01:50.759> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
an acog m-16 which reduces the recoil so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.899 
an acog m-16 which reduces the recoil so
herp<00:01:51.960> derp<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> math<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.070> has<00:01:53.189> no<00:01:53.490> recoil

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
herp derp do the math it has no recoil

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.399 
herp derp do the math it has no recoil
and<00:01:54.320> when<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> use<00:01:55.590> my<00:01:55.850> m16<00:01:56.850> um<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.810> kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.200> make

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and when I use my m16 um I kind of make

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.620 
and when I use my m16 um I kind of make
it<00:01:58.619> make<00:01:59.040> sure<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.490> my<00:01:59.909> engagements<00:02:00.509> are

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
it make sure that my engagements are

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
from medium to long range because that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.240

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.040 
watch but the way that small beans uses
his<00:04:56.430> color<00:04:56.669> correction<00:04:57.180> makes<00:04:57.419> it<00:04:57.659> so<00:04:58.020> that

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050

to speed this chopper gunner up as soon

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.580 
to speed this chopper gunner up as soon
as<00:06:47.669> I<00:06:47.789> open<00:06:48.300> through<00:06:48.509> the<00:06:48.539> door<00:06:48.810> so<00:06:49.409> the

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
as I open through the door so the

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.170 
as I open through the door so the
gameplay<00:06:49.949> is<00:06:50.069> pretty<00:06:50.099> much<00:06:50.460> over<00:06:50.699> right<00:06:51.150> now

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
gameplay is pretty much over right now

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.540 
gameplay is pretty much over right now
we<00:06:51.960> have<00:06:52.050> a<00:06:52.080> chopper<00:06:52.440> gunner<00:06:52.470> up<00:06:52.800> I<00:06:53.009> think<00:06:53.460> we

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
we have a chopper gunner up I think we

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.430 
we have a chopper gunner up I think we
had<00:06:53.669> a<00:06:53.699> black<00:06:54.030> grid<00:06:54.300> up<00:06:54.419> as<00:06:54.599> well<00:06:54.810> and<00:06:55.080> we<00:06:55.349> have

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
had a black grid up as well and we have

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.559 
had a black grid up as well and we have
my<00:06:55.560> dogs<00:06:55.830> up<00:06:56.129> so<00:06:56.340> the<00:06:56.490> enemy<00:06:56.759> team<00:06:56.940> has<00:06:57.180> no

00:06:57.559 --> 00:06:57.569 
my dogs up so the enemy team has no

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:01.279 
my dogs up so the enemy team has no
chance<00:06:57.990> of<00:06:58.259> survival<00:06:59.569> so<00:07:00.569> the<00:07:00.780> gameplay<00:07:01.139> is

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.289 
chance of survival so the gameplay is

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:03.290 
chance of survival so the gameplay is
pretty<00:07:01.319> much<00:07:01.680> done<00:07:01.949> right<00:07:02.190> about<00:07:02.370> now<00:07:02.669> if<00:07:03.090> you

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
pretty much done right about now if you
