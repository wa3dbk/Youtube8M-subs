00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.560
 far as I show I know how my genius 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.109
 his room is what we need 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.670
 Of course you can get dried chilies 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.559
 but also dry yourself but they are 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.110
 already dry to buy such a 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.369
 schale here I think 50 grams are that 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.369
 Although costs and salt needed only 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:33.780
 machines thereby the debts and in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:43.559
 we do these dry parts 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 but the machine is not too full 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.590
 otherwise that does not apply too 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.590
 size 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:31.960
 Now I have my chilli salt here 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:35.619
 once huge so you can see right now 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.440
 that very fine chilli salt say better 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.380
 I would like to take that and the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.390
 then chili flakes to cook 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.619
 But I like doing that so that I am in 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:53.350
 the chili flakes and the fine salt 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:56.100
 together user then I still go 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 more salt on it 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:21.030
 and if you and why others are beautiful 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.030
 Time
