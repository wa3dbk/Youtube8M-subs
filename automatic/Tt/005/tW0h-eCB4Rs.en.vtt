00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.519
 every person as they are is because they are 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.710
 very good here just giovanni and good 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.770
 welcome to a new tutorial in this 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.500
 tutorial of origins let's try 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.980
 teach them how to build what would be 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.720
 the purple or lightning rod good as 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.609
 what we have to do is use the tank 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.769
 to be able to transport we were going to 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.750
 find three of the pieces good the 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.129
 entry to get the three pieces 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.350
 of what would be the cane being 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.110
 Well the first one we have here in 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.950
 this part d 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.360
 of the path of the tank is a little 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.580
 later this is after a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.030
 bridge of which we have that we have 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.720
 here the piece looks and to the right I 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.660
 you just have to jump to this 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.309
 platform is sometimes a little bull and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.380
 I recommend that they try 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.060
 several times if they can not 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.470
 it's easy already after grabbing the 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.559
 practice and good so here we have what 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.130
 that would be this piece ok now the second 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.630
 Well, I'll have to go where the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.490
 truck and turn it on again and it would be in 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.650
 what would the pack to punch in this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.720
 need is very simple to upload to this and 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.190
 to the next so do not get complicated 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.950
 much now they just have to 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.570
 enter this this tunnel cited and they grab 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.070
 what would be the next piece and it 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.380
 they have to come back because I tried 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.660
 and you can not be out there so that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.910
 it's just to see the piece now 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.950
 the next ones on this one so 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.380
 if they are two perfect and if they are one 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.119
 they would have to give all the back have 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.369
 to jump around here to get into what 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.130
 would be the church for this ramp 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.290
 wood and then they will see what will be 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.080
 the last piece now communicated with 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.180
 we would be the disc the disc 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.770
 has according to me two blocks sessions one 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.390
 would be the one where it seemed to me 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.970
 here they can be next to the machine 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.119
 from Peru 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.450
 random other would be right here but 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.409
 within the place of the crazy place in 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.420
 all this area you can find 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.970
 I do not remember the position well that's why I 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.550
 I put an image of 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.380
 from all over the place so they can 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.200
 find but it's within the area of 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.540
 juger not now since we have this 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.900
 we have to go from this under 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.329
 of what it would be 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.329
 this mine to create the portal 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.510
 the purple portal as it takes a long time 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.100
 so then let's cut a little bit 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.750
 so we can in this create the portal 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.550
 and now what we have to do is 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.830
 just enter and go for our 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.680
 for our crystal they always have to 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.300
 enter through the glass door that 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.320
 touched for example if they want the 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.630
 purple have to enter through the door 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.210
 abode that would be below the estate and 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.500
 so it's substantively here we have the 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.360
 glass we just grabbed it with 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.610
 Equis and go to what would be to 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.710
 capons below where are the bases of 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.950
 those of the canes and we have to go to 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.620
 the purple base and press x to 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.170
 create the lightning bolt beam or 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.460
 purple as they are called and well I think 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.780
 that would be everything I hope you like 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.730
