progressive a progressive rock band if

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.420 
progressive a progressive rock band if
you<00:01:01.050> really<00:01:01.289> want<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> call<00:01:01.710> them<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.980> I'm

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you really want to call them that I'm

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.850 
you really want to call them that I'm
really<00:01:02.780> somewhat<00:01:03.780> leaning<00:01:04.229> more<00:01:04.439> toward<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
really somewhat leaning more toward the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.370 
really somewhat leaning more toward the
idea<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.549> progressive<00:01:06.119> alternative<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:07.049> prog

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
idea of progressive alternative or prog

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
idea of progressive alternative or prog
turn<00:01:07.710> ative<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.220> don't<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
turn ative but they don't do this in the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.170 
turn ative but they don't do this in the
same<00:01:09.540> way<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.920> band<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.580> coheed<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
same way as a band like coheed and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
same way as a band like coheed and
cambria<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> bridges<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> gap<00:01:13.619> by

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
cambria that kind of bridges the gap by

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.399 
cambria that kind of bridges the gap by
being<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.520> little<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.119> too<00:01:15.360> technical<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
being a little bit too technical for the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.820 
being a little bit too technical for the
the<00:01:16.740> alternative<00:01:17.729> side<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.150> things<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.830> maybe

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the alternative side of things but maybe

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
the alternative side of things but maybe
just<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.250> quite<00:01:20.490> progressive<00:01:20.820> enough<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
just not quite progressive enough to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
just not quite progressive enough to
fully<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.530> immersed<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.220> idea<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.850> clone

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
fully be immersed in that idea a clone

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.080 
fully be immersed in that idea a clone
is<00:01:24.570> definitely<00:01:25.259> more<00:01:26.070> than<00:01:26.130> immersed<00:01:26.820> within

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
is definitely more than immersed within

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.990 
is definitely more than immersed within
the<00:01:27.299> progressive<00:01:27.810> side<00:01:28.110> however<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the progressive side however they have a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
the progressive side however they have a
very<00:01:30.360> different<00:01:31.020> approach<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> they<00:01:32.100> have

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
very different approach to it they have

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
very different approach to it they have
an<00:01:32.460> approach<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.790> reminds<00:01:33.509> me<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:34.079> more

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
an approach that reminds me a lot more

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.530 
an approach that reminds me a lot more
of<00:01:34.680> alternative<00:01:35.490> music<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> way<00:01:36.420> in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
of alternative music and the way in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.690 
of alternative music and the way in
which<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.960> represented<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.490> comes

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
which it's represented and here comes

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.359 
which it's represented and here comes
the<00:01:38.909> sun<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.299> certainly<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.619> much<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.220> an

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the sun is certainly not that much of an

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.190 
the sun is certainly not that much of an
exception<00:01:42.030> however<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.570> leans<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.899> little<00:01:42.930> bit

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
exception however it leans a little bit

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.690 
exception however it leans a little bit
more<00:01:43.350> toward<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.740> prog<00:01:44.009> side<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.549> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
more toward that prog side this is a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
more toward that prog side this is a
really<00:01:45.149> tough<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.630> ladies<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.110> gentlemen

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
really tough one ladies and gentlemen

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.620 
really tough one ladies and gentlemen
and<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.710> why<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> think<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:48.329> enjoy

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and that's why I think I really enjoy

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.539 
and that's why I think I really enjoy
these<00:01:48.840> guys<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.439> much<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.100> think<00:01:50.369> that's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
these guys so much and I think that's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.460 
these guys so much and I think that's
the<00:01:50.640> reason<00:01:51.060> why<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> people<00:01:51.750> would<00:01:52.320> as

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the reason why a lot of people would as

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.759 
song that I'm thinking about
specifically<00:03:46.299> on<00:03:46.510> this<00:03:46.660> album<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:47.019> grim<00:03:47.380> dance

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
specifically on this album is grim dance

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.430 
specifically on this album is grim dance
grim<00:03:48.579> dance<00:03:48.880> really<00:03:49.359> has<00:03:49.599> that<00:03:49.630> element

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
grim dance really has that element

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.940 
grim dance really has that element
reminds<00:03:50.739> me<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.069> immaculate<00:03:51.700> desire<00:03:52.290> from<00:03:53.290> the
