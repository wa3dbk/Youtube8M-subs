is<00:00:33.420> one<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> things<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.620> like

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
is one of the things that I really like

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410 
is one of the things that I really like
about<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.309> lock<00:00:35.610> versus<00:00:36.090> some<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> other

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
about this lock versus some of the other

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.530 
about this lock versus some of the other
locks<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> market<00:00:38.540> like

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
locks that are out in the market like

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.119 
locks that are out in the market like
for<00:00:39.750> example<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.140> quick-set<00:00:40.379> lock<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.950> just

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
for example the quick-set lock you just

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.880 
for example the quick-set lock you just
type<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.700> your<00:00:41.730> number<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.500> once<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.649> hit<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
type in your number and once you hit the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
type in your number and once you hit the
right<00:00:44.520> number<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> door<00:00:45.120> unlocks<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.629> don't

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
right number the door unlocks you don't

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.010 
right number the door unlocks you don't
have<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.440> opt<00:00:46.950> into<00:00:47.370> submitting<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.600> number

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
have to opt into submitting that number

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.000 
have to opt into submitting that number
to<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.660> lock<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.899> test<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
to the lock to test it so this is

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.910 
to the lock to test it so this is
actually<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> more<00:00:53.760> secure<00:00:54.239> system<00:00:54.800> setting<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
actually a more secure system setting it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.189 
actually a more secure system setting it
up<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.190> well<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.489> having<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:59.030> full<00:01:00.199> numeric

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
up as well as having a full numeric

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.009 
up as well as having a full numeric
keypad<00:01:01.410> versus<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:03.359> four<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:03.719> five

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
keypad versus the I know four or five

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.200 
keypad versus the I know four or five
keys<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> quick-set<00:01:04.979> block<00:01:05.460> one

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
keys that are on the quick-set block one

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.090 
keys that are on the quick-set block one
nice<00:01:06.390> thing<00:01:06.420> about<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:07.020> guy<00:01:07.229> too<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.860> if

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
nice thing about this guy too is that if

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.850 
nice thing about this guy too is that if
you<00:01:08.900> try<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:11.909> put<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> wrong<00:01:12.659> number

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
you try to put in the wrong number

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:24.160 
you try to put in the wrong number
enough<00:01:13.860> times<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.689> end<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.140> locking<00:01:22.590> out

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
enough times it will end up locking out

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.350 
enough times it will end up locking out
the<00:01:25.170> door<00:01:25.409> lock<00:01:25.619> let<00:01:26.250> me<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.520> keep<00:01:26.909> banging

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the door lock let me just keep banging

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.010 
the door lock let me just keep banging
them<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.720> until<00:01:32.420> Center<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.750> now

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
them in until Center you can see now

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.690 
them in until Center you can see now
here<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> bottom<00:01:34.650> its<00:01:34.950> flashing<00:01:35.520> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
here in the bottom its flashing and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.960 
here in the bottom its flashing and
basically<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.810> deactivates<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> keypad<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
basically it deactivates the keypad to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.359 
basically it deactivates the keypad to
keep<00:01:39.180> people<00:01:39.540> from<00:01:39.619> trying<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.860> lock<00:01:41.100> until

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
keep people from trying the lock until

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.120 
keep people from trying the lock until
it<00:01:42.979> unlocks<00:01:44.119> eventually<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.869> after<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it unlocks eventually so after this is a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
it unlocks eventually so after this is a
programmable<00:01:47.640> feature<00:01:48.060> how<00:01:48.329> long<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
programmable feature how long you can it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.370 
programmable feature how long you can it
will<00:01:50.180> deactivate<00:01:51.180> itself<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.049> course<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
will deactivate itself of course you can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.120 
will deactivate itself of course you can
always<00:01:52.500> use<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.829> key<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.009> unlock<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.670> you

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
always use the key to unlock it if you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.039 
always use the key to unlock it if you
that<00:01:56.130> finger<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.549> enough<00:01:56.790> times<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> have

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that finger it enough times but I have

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.450 
that finger it enough times but I have
it<00:01:58.140> set<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.439> right<00:01:58.619> now<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.100> after<00:01:59.340> about

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it set up right now so that after about

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.980 
it set up right now so that after about
60<00:02:00.000> seconds<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.689> will<00:02:01.880> turn<00:02:02.880> its<00:02:03.060> turn<00:02:03.780> this

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
60 seconds it will turn its turn this

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.850 
60 seconds it will turn its turn this
feature<00:02:04.170> off<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.619> make<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.860> active<00:02:05.040> again<00:02:06.860> so

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
feature off and make it active again so

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:30.080 
feature off and make it active again so
let's<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.280> wait<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> bit

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.679 

see<00:02:31.090> here<00:02:31.239> we<00:02:31.329> go

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
see here we go

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.289 
see here we go
now<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.109> the<00:02:32.290> door<00:02:32.709> can<00:02:33.670> be<00:02:33.819> unlocked<00:02:34.090> again

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
now that the door can be unlocked again

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.349 
now that the door can be unlocked again
