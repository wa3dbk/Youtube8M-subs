Welcome to a new video of the maemo Programs: series!

00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:17.683
This video is about JoikuSpot for the N900!

00:00:19.084 --> 00:00:26.584
JoikuSpot is a program which transforms the N900 in a mobile, battery-driven, WiFi-Hotspot!

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:47.125
This makes sense, if you want to connect more than one devices to your N900, sharing it's internet connection over 3G.

00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:34.393
Here you can open a quick guide - a quide^^

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:51.409
Many, many settings!

00:02:32.538 --> 00:02:38.037
Lets start!

00:02:57.422 --> 00:03:03.332
Nice UI :-D

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:16.450
There you can see, which devices are connected, an which connection is used.

00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:33.174
Lets connect a Nokia N810

00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:45.822
There we have now an ad-hoc internet connection available

00:03:51.987 --> 00:03:58.945
Now we are connected, and we can use the internet

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:50.706
Here you can now see the connection speed, and the transferred data amount (download and upload)

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:37.040
Sometimes JoikuSpot still crashes (it's the first beta, so what do you expect?)

00:05:56.284 --> 00:06:24.114
You can install JoikuSpot through the Joiku website, or by adding a new repository, as you can see here.
