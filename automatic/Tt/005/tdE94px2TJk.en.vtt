00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
noticed at least in connectivity I we

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.920 
noticed at least in connectivity I we
took<00:01:59.640> us<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> while<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.450> particular

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
took us a while to get this particular

took us a while to get this particular
call<00:02:01.110> connected<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:04.009> some<00:02:05.009> takes<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.610> few

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790

seconds<00:02:06.240> few<00:02:06.509> more<00:02:06.630> seconds<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
seconds few more seconds you think it

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.020 
seconds few more seconds you think it
probably<00:02:07.710> should<00:02:07.979> ask<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.970> press<00:02:09.209> t<00:02:09.390> know

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
probably should ask you press t know

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.580 
probably should ask you press t know

this<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.840> as<00:04:43.960> close<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.289> the<00:04:44.889> 11-inch<00:04:45.220> MacBook

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
this is as close to the 11-inch MacBook

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.850 
this is as close to the 11-inch MacBook
Airs<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.120> close<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.600> a<00:04:46.870> netbook<00:04:47.350> as<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:47.680> think

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
Airs is close to a netbook as I think

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.879 
Airs is close to a netbook as I think
we're<00:04:47.949> gonna<00:04:48.039> see<00:04:48.280> from<00:04:48.460> apple<00:04:50.639> yeah<00:04:52.889> he's

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
we're gonna see from apple yeah he's

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.020 
we're gonna see from apple yeah he's
pretty<00:04:54.070> good<00:04:54.310> with<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.490> Lebanese<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:54.850> think

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
pretty good with the Lebanese I think

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
pretty good with the Lebanese I think
that's<00:04:55.150> part<00:04:55.300> would<00:04:55.510> be<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.600> best<00:04:55.840> selling

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
that's part would be the best selling

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.650 
that's part would be the best selling
one<00:04:56.320> yeah<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:57.400> price<00:04:57.610> but<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:58.090> think<00:04:58.479> it's<00:04:58.600> that

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
one yeah the price but I think it's that

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.570 
one yeah the price but I think it's that
small<00:04:59.199> that<00:04:59.740> I<00:04:59.949> mean<00:05:00.160> you<00:05:00.220> don't<00:05:00.370> need

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
small that I mean you don't need

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.460 
small that I mean you don't need
anything<00:05:01.419> bigger<00:05:01.990> than<00:05:02.050> that<00:05:02.169> really

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
anything bigger than that really

each individual one in the app store in

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.600 
each individual one in the app store in
the<00:06:25.720> mac<00:06:25.930> app<00:06:26.169> store<00:06:26.199> with<00:06:26.889> technology<00:06:27.370> not

the mac app store with technology not
true<00:06:28.030> five<00:06:28.630> applications<00:06:29.110> and<00:06:29.440> other<00:06:29.500> you<00:06:29.650> two

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
true five applications and other you two

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.350 
true five applications and other you two
dollars<00:06:30.070> tripping<00:06:30.759> sensors<00:06:31.090> like<00:06:31.210> you're

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
dollars tripping sensors like you're

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.879 
dollars tripping sensors like you're
doing<00:06:31.539> with<00:06:31.630> I<00:06:31.780> work<00:06:32.050> and<00:06:32.259> you<00:06:32.410> know<00:06:32.440> all<00:06:32.710> that

doing with I work and you know all that

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.469 
doing with I work and you know all that
so<00:06:33.130> that<00:06:33.430> made<00:06:33.580> sense<00:06:33.789> so<00:06:33.970> that's<00:06:34.120> prob<00:06:34.270> with

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
so that made sense so that's prob with

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:35.580 
so that made sense so that's prob with
the<00:06:34.600> putting<00:06:35.080> overcome<00:06:35.320> you<00:06:35.380> doing<00:06:35.530> that's

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
the putting overcome you doing that's

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.900 
the putting overcome you doing that's
one<00:06:35.740> reason<00:06:35.919> I<00:06:36.039> can<00:06:36.160> think<00:06:36.190> of<00:06:36.400> that<00:06:36.580> name<00:06:36.729> boss

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
one reason I can think of that name boss

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.450 
one reason I can think of that name boss
more<00:06:37.150> than<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:37.389> solar<00:06:37.600> program<00:06:38.280> fair<00:06:39.280> enough

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
more than the solar program fair enough

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.890 
more than the solar program fair enough
all<00:06:39.639> right<00:06:39.789> well<00:06:39.940> I'll<00:06:40.030> let<00:06:40.120> you<00:06:40.180> get<00:06:40.570> back<00:06:40.630> to
