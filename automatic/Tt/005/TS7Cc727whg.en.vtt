00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
of course that all of the lunar waves

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.820 
of course that all of the lunar waves
are<00:02:19.459> caused<00:02:19.730> by<00:02:20.000> aircraft<00:02:20.320> necessarily<00:02:21.320> but

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
are caused by aircraft necessarily but

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.080 
are caused by aircraft necessarily but
I'm<00:02:21.980> certainly<00:02:22.430> saying<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.880> they<00:02:23.030> are

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
I'm certainly saying that they are

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.780 
I'm certainly saying that they are
caused<00:02:23.360> by<00:02:23.600> atmospheric<00:02:23.810> refraction<00:02:24.790> local

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
caused by atmospheric refraction local

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.270 
caused by atmospheric refraction local
to<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> observer<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.860> there's<00:02:28.040> another

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
to the observer but there's another

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.790 
to the observer but there's another
interesting<00:02:28.640> thing<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:29.930> notice<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.680> this

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
interesting thing that we notice in this

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.390 
interesting thing that we notice in this
video<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:31.430> we<00:02:31.580> turn<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.910> sound<00:02:32.090> back<00:02:32.269> on<00:02:32.630> and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
video if we turn the sound back on and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.830 
video if we turn the sound back on and
hopefully<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.880> won't<00:02:35.090> be<00:02:35.209> too<00:02:35.390> loud<00:02:35.600> when

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
hopefully this won't be too loud when

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.270 
hopefully this won't be too loud when
you<00:02:35.959> play<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.320> back<00:02:36.350> but<00:02:36.799> what<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.010> encourage

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
you play it back but what I encourage

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.479 
you play it back but what I encourage
you<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.760> do<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:39.110> go<00:02:39.650> directly<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.340> this

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
you to do is to go directly to this

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.210 
you to do is to go directly to this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
200 by defender of the town and I'll put

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.350 
200 by defender of the town and I'll put
a<00:02:45.709> link<00:02:45.890> in<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> description<00:02:46.610> area<00:02:46.790> for<00:02:47.209> you

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
a link in the description area for you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.080 
a link in the description area for you
so<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.049> easy<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.470> find<00:02:48.880> but<00:02:49.880> have<00:02:50.060> a

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
so that it's easy to find but have a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.740 
so that it's easy to find but have a
listen<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.720> what<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:51.049> hear<00:02:51.560> after<00:02:52.360> we<00:02:53.360> see<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
listen to what we hear after we see the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.050 
listen to what we hear after we see the
lunar<00:02:53.900> wave<00:02:54.230> now<00:02:54.920> I'll<00:02:55.190> just<00:02:55.220> step<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:55.760> board

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
lunar wave now I'll just step this board

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.340 
lunar wave now I'll just step this board
a<00:02:56.150> little<00:02:56.330> bit<00:02:56.480> because<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.870> know<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.230> bit

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
a little bit because I know it's a bit

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.880 
a little bit because I know it's a bit
further<00:02:57.620> on<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.900> let's<00:02:59.900> ever<00:03:00.320> listen<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.739> what

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
further on and let's ever listen to what

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:26.790 
further on and let's ever listen to what
we<00:03:01.010> hear

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.740 

now<00:03:27.800> if<00:03:27.950> I'm<00:03:28.460> not<00:03:28.640> mistaken<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.300> was<00:03:29.570> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
now if I'm not mistaken that was the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.750 
now if I'm not mistaken that was the
drone<00:03:30.020> of<00:03:30.350> an<00:03:30.500> aircraft<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.100> we<00:03:31.310> could<00:03:31.490> hear

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
drone of an aircraft that we could hear

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.000 
drone of an aircraft that we could hear
I<00:03:31.910> live<00:03:32.390> very<00:03:32.540> close<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:33.050> original<00:03:33.230> Airport

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
I live very close to original Airport

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.630 
I live very close to original Airport
and<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:35.420> certainly<00:03:35.780> sounds<00:03:36.200> like<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.640> small

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
and that certainly sounds like a small

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.520 
and that certainly sounds like a small
aircraft<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.480> certainly<00:03:38.840> doesn't<00:03:39.350> sound

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
aircraft that certainly doesn't sound

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.670 
aircraft that certainly doesn't sound
like<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:39.890> jet<00:03:40.160> aircraft<00:03:41.230> but<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.350> sounds<00:03:42.620> like

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
like a jet aircraft but it sounds like

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.940 
like a jet aircraft but it sounds like
an<00:03:42.830> aircraft<00:03:42.980> all<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:43.580> same<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:45.350> may<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.740> be

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
an aircraft all the same it may not be

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.790 
an aircraft all the same it may not be
the<00:03:46.160> aircraft<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:47.240> caused<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.110> lunar<00:03:48.620> wave

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
the aircraft that caused the lunar wave

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.720 
the aircraft that caused the lunar wave
in<00:03:49.070> this<00:03:49.220> case<00:03:49.430> but<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.480> also<00:03:50.660> tells<00:03:51.050> me<00:03:51.200> that

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
in this case but it also tells me that

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.900 
in this case but it also tells me that
this<00:03:52.730> observer<00:03:53.150> defender<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:54.050> the<00:03:54.230> town

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
this observer defender of the town

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.940 
this observer defender of the town
likely<00:03:55.910> lives<00:03:56.150> nearby<00:03:56.810> any<00:03:57.350> airport<00:03:57.680> and

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
likely lives nearby any airport and

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.250 
likely lives nearby any airport and
maybe<00:03:58.610> he<00:03:58.850> can<00:03:58.940> comment<00:03:59.210> on<00:03:59.480> that<00:03:59.540> maybe<00:03:59.990> he

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
maybe he can comment on that maybe he

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.460 
maybe he can comment on that maybe he
can<00:04:00.470> confirm<00:04:00.710> how<00:04:01.580> far<00:04:01.880> away<00:04:02.150> he<00:04:02.180> is<00:04:02.660> from<00:04:03.080> his

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
can confirm how far away he is from his

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.670 
can confirm how far away he is from his
local<00:04:03.920> airport<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.640> he's<00:04:04.790> near<00:04:05.030> one<00:04:05.680> now

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
local airport if he's near one now

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.630 
local airport if he's near one now
there's<00:04:06.920> something<00:04:07.070> else<00:04:07.280> we're<00:04:07.460> going<00:04:07.580> to

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
there's something else we're going to

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.890 
there's something else we're going to
look<00:04:07.760> at<00:04:08.290> before<00:04:09.290> we<00:04:09.410> go<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:10.450> again<00:04:11.450> in

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
look at before we go and again in

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.640 
look at before we go and again in
previous<00:04:12.410> videos<00:04:12.800> I've<00:04:13.220> pointed<00:04:13.610> out<00:04:13.880> that<00:04:14.650> if

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
previous videos I've pointed out that if

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.670 
previous videos I've pointed out that if
we<00:04:15.710> look<00:04:16.489> at<00:04:16.670> how<00:04:17.540> big<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.049> moon<00:04:18.200> is<00:04:18.470> in<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
we look at how big the moon is in the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.380 
we look at how big the moon is in the
sky<00:04:18.859> because<00:04:19.250> we've<00:04:19.820> all<00:04:19.970> seen<00:04:20.209> these

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
sky because we've all seen these

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.080 
sky because we've all seen these
enormous<00:04:20.660> moon<00:04:21.109> rise<00:04:21.350> videos<00:04:21.859> we<00:04:22.160> we<00:04:22.760> see<00:04:22.970> the

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
enormous moon rise videos we we see the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.450 
enormous moon rise videos we we see the
moon<00:04:23.270> on<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.570> horizon<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:24.830> looks<00:04:25.010> huge

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
moon on the horizon and it looks huge

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.330 
moon on the horizon and it looks huge
but<00:04:26.300> actually<00:04:26.900> how<00:04:27.140> big<00:04:27.380> is<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.710> moon<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.190> the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
but actually how big is the moon and the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.060 
but actually how big is the moon and the
sky<00:04:28.610> when<00:04:28.880> we<00:04:29.000> look<00:04:29.180> at<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.480> well<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.590> moon<00:04:30.770> is

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
sky when we look at it well the moon is

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.200 
sky when we look at it well the moon is
half<00:04:31.400> of<00:04:31.700> one<00:04:32.000> degree<00:04:32.320> so<00:04:33.320> how<00:04:33.470> big<00:04:33.650> is<00:04:33.830> that

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
half of one degree so how big is that

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.750 
half of one degree so how big is that
it's<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:35.540> big<00:04:35.750> okay<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:37.070> is<00:04:37.280> how<00:04:37.490> big<00:04:37.730> the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
it's that big okay that is how big the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.490 
it's that big okay that is how big the
moon<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.419> in<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.750> sky

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
moon is in the sky

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.760 
moon is in the sky
we've<00:04:39.890> got<00:04:40.070> 180<00:04:40.610> degrees<00:04:41.080> half<00:04:42.080> of<00:04:42.260> one<00:04:42.470> degree

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
we've got 180 degrees half of one degree

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.430 
we've got 180 degrees half of one degree
is<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:43.250> big<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:44.060> as<00:04:44.720> I've<00:04:44.900> pointed<00:04:45.200> out

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
is that big and as I've pointed out

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.980 
is that big and as I've pointed out
before<00:04:45.890> you<00:04:46.340> can<00:04:46.370> in<00:04:46.910> fact<00:04:47.150> view<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.750> full

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
before you can in fact view the full

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.680 
before you can in fact view the full

straw<00:04:51.310> now<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.760> make<00:04:52.940> matters<00:04:53.270> worse<00:04:53.530> when

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
straw now to make matters worse when

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.090 
straw now to make matters worse when
we're<00:04:54.710> looking<00:04:55.310> at<00:04:55.610> videos<00:04:56.600> such<00:04:57.080> as<00:04:57.110> this<00:04:57.890> one

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
we're looking at videos such as this one

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.240 
we're looking at videos such as this one
here<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.850> let's<00:04:59.720> find<00:05:00.470> where<00:05:00.710> we<00:05:00.830> can<00:05:00.950> see<00:05:01.130> the

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
here and let's find where we can see the

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.190 
here and let's find where we can see the
edge<00:05:01.340> of<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.550> moon<00:05:01.730> you<00:05:01.970> see<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.020> next

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
edge of the moon you see the next

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.409 
edge of the moon you see the next
problem<00:05:03.410> we're<00:05:03.980> not<00:05:04.010> even<00:05:04.460> seeing<00:05:04.730> all<00:05:05.060> of<00:05:05.120> the

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
problem we're not even seeing all of the

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.080 
problem we're not even seeing all of the
moon<00:05:06.040> so<00:05:07.040> let's<00:05:07.250> do<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.460> little<00:05:07.610> experiment

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
moon so let's do a little experiment

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.540 
moon so let's do a little experiment
here<00:05:08.600> here's<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:09.020> nice<00:05:09.290> high<00:05:09.560> resolution<00:05:10.220> image

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
here here's a nice high resolution image

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.330 
here here's a nice high resolution image
of<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.820> full<00:05:11.030> moon<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.840> I'm<00:05:12.140> gonna<00:05:12.380> layer<00:05:12.919> in

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
of the full moon and I'm gonna layer in

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.630 
of the full moon and I'm gonna layer in
a<00:05:13.669> screenshot<00:05:14.390> from<00:05:15.190> defender<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.400> town's

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
a screenshot from defender of the town's

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.570 
a screenshot from defender of the town's
video<00:05:17.540> of<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.290> moon<00:05:18.740> that<00:05:18.980> we<00:05:19.130> saw<00:05:19.310> in<00:05:19.430> his

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
video of the moon that we saw in his

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.000 
video of the moon that we saw in his
video<00:05:22.540> okay<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:24.260> I'm<00:05:24.410> just<00:05:24.470> going<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.800> move

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
video okay so I'm just going to move

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.680 
video okay so I'm just going to move
this<00:05:25.190> down<00:05:25.250> here<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:26.060> I'm<00:05:26.419> going<00:05:26.570> to<00:05:26.600> adjust

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
this down here and I'm going to adjust

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.650 
this down here and I'm going to adjust
the<00:05:27.110> size<00:05:28.040> of<00:05:28.220> this<00:05:28.340> image<00:05:28.550> so<00:05:28.910> so<00:05:29.300> that<00:05:29.419> we<00:05:29.510> can

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
the size of this image so so that we can

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.450 
the size of this image so so that we can
try<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:29.960> match<00:05:30.140> it<00:05:30.320> up<00:05:30.440> against<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:31.070> edge<00:05:31.280> of

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
try and match it up against the edge of

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.080 
try and match it up against the edge of
the<00:05:31.580> moon<00:05:31.730> I<00:05:36.160> think<00:05:37.160> you<00:05:37.250> can<00:05:37.400> see<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.700> problem

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
the moon I think you can see the problem

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.739 
the moon I think you can see the problem
already

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:40.749 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.489 

so<00:05:41.749> it's<00:05:42.289> pretty<00:05:42.499> clear<00:05:42.830> that<00:05:43.099> although<00:05:44.499> you

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:45.499 
so it's pretty clear that although you

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:47.109 
so it's pretty clear that although you
know<00:05:45.619> it<00:05:45.830> looks<00:05:46.039> pretty<00:05:46.309> big<00:05:46.729> when<00:05:46.969> we're

00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:47.119 
know it looks pretty big when we're

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:49.119 
know it looks pretty big when we're
looking<00:05:47.209> at<00:05:47.689> the<00:05:47.839> video<00:05:48.110> here<00:05:48.559> looks<00:05:48.830> like<00:05:48.919> the

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
looking at the video here looks like the

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.999 
looking at the video here looks like the
moon<00:05:49.309> is<00:05:49.489> very<00:05:49.519> big<00:05:50.769> what<00:05:51.769> we're<00:05:51.889> actually

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
moon is very big what we're actually

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.459 
moon is very big what we're actually
seeing<00:05:52.459> is<00:05:52.789> a<00:05:52.849> very<00:05:53.209> tiny<00:05:53.689> little<00:05:54.050> piece<00:05:54.319> of

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:54.469 
seeing is a very tiny little piece of

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:59.290 
seeing is a very tiny little piece of
the<00:05:54.559> moon<00:05:54.739> and<00:05:56.529> it<00:05:57.529> would<00:05:57.679> be<00:05:57.860> very<00:05:58.099> easy<00:05:58.399> again

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
the moon and it would be very easy again

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.129 
the moon and it would be very easy again
for<00:06:00.199> an<00:06:00.289> aircraft<00:06:00.529> to<00:06:01.129> fly<00:06:01.159> right<00:06:01.909> across<00:06:02.179> the

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
for an aircraft to fly right across the

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.769 
for an aircraft to fly right across the
moon<00:06:03.379> without<00:06:04.249> actually<00:06:04.909> being<00:06:05.179> in<00:06:05.449> the<00:06:05.509> field

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
moon without actually being in the field

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:10.239 
moon without actually being in the field
of<00:06:05.989> view<00:06:06.229> of<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:07.279> telescope<00:06:08.769> thereby<00:06:09.769> causing

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:10.249 
of view of the telescope thereby causing

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:14.290 
of view of the telescope thereby causing
an<00:06:10.909> apparent<00:06:11.330> lunar<00:06:11.539> wave<00:06:12.729> without<00:06:13.729> us<00:06:14.089> seeing

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
an apparent lunar wave without us seeing

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.419 
an apparent lunar wave without us seeing
the<00:06:14.539> aircraft<00:06:14.989> but<00:06:15.289> we<00:06:15.409> certainly<00:06:15.889> seem<00:06:16.249> to

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:16.429 
the aircraft but we certainly seem to

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:19.149 
the aircraft but we certainly seem to
hear<00:06:16.819> any<00:06:17.149> aircraft<00:06:17.389> in<00:06:17.929> the<00:06:18.409> video<00:06:18.649> go<00:06:19.039> and

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
hear any aircraft in the video go and

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.790 
hear any aircraft in the video go and
check<00:06:19.369> it<00:06:19.489> out<00:06:19.579> for<00:06:19.639> yourself<00:06:20.209> but<00:06:21.019> again<00:06:21.319> the

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
check it out for yourself but again the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.909 
check it out for yourself but again the
Springs<00:06:22.099> home<00:06:22.369> the<00:06:22.550> point<00:06:22.989> that<00:06:23.989> a<00:06:24.289> lunar<00:06:24.739> wave

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
Springs home the point that a lunar wave

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.449 
Springs home the point that a lunar wave
could<00:06:25.339> be<00:06:25.489> caused<00:06:25.759> by<00:06:26.119> a<00:06:26.149> passing<00:06:26.659> aircraft

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:27.459

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:30.279 
could be caused by a passing aircraft
without<00:06:28.459> being<00:06:28.969> seen<00:06:29.300> because<00:06:29.839> it<00:06:30.050> was

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
without being seen because it was

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.040 
without being seen because it was
outside<00:06:30.889> of<00:06:31.249> the<00:06:31.789> field<00:06:32.059> of<00:06:32.209> view<00:06:32.389> of<00:06:32.809> the

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:37.519 
telescope very simple and as I pointed

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:41.949 
telescope very simple and as I pointed
out<00:06:37.639> before<00:06:39.489> you<00:06:40.489> can<00:06:40.519> view<00:06:41.329> the<00:06:41.509> full<00:06:41.689> moon

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:41.959 
out before you can view the full moon

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:44.379 
out before you can view the full moon
through<00:06:42.619> an<00:06:42.769> 8<00:06:42.919> inch<00:06:43.159> standard<00:06:43.819> drinking

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
through an 8 inch standard drinking

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.429 
through an 8 inch standard drinking
straw<00:06:44.719> because<00:06:46.209> the<00:06:47.209> full<00:06:47.419> moon<00:06:47.659> is<00:06:47.929> only<00:06:48.169> half

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:48.439 
straw because the full moon is only half

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:50.709 
straw because the full moon is only half
of<00:06:48.589> one<00:06:48.769> degree<00:06:49.099> in<00:06:49.249> the<00:06:49.369> sky<00:06:49.579> and<00:06:49.939> if<00:06:50.569> we're

looking at even less of it well it's an

looking at even less of it well it's an

even much smaller area that we're
looking<00:06:56.389> at<00:06:57.610> I'll<00:06:58.610> be<00:06:58.729> putting<00:06:59.029> these
