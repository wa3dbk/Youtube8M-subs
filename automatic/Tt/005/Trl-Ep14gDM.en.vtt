00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.849 

coolant<00:02:04.859> pipe<00:02:05.099> to<00:02:05.399> leak<00:02:06.169> down<00:02:07.169> there<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.709> can

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
coolant pipe to leak down there you can

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.889 
coolant pipe to leak down there you can
see<00:02:08.039> coolant

pipes<00:02:29.189> are<00:02:29.489> supposed<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.819> wiggle<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.450> out

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
pipes are supposed to wiggle in and out

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.300 
pipes are supposed to wiggle in and out
I<00:02:30.750> thought<00:02:31.049> they<00:02:31.230> were<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.379> threaded<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.099> but

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
I thought they were like threaded in but

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.619 
I thought they were like threaded in but
this<00:02:32.430> can't<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.790> threaded<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.269> because<00:02:33.480> this

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
this can't be threaded in because this

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.819 
this can't be threaded in because this
is<00:02:33.689> all<00:02:33.989> one<00:02:34.260> piece<00:02:35.599> so<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.959> don't<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.769> how

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
is all one piece so I don't know how

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.259 
is all one piece so I don't know how
that<00:02:38.220> works<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.670> watch<00:02:38.849> out<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.030> that

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
that works so watch out for that

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.550 
that works so watch out for that
there's<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.629> screw<00:02:39.900> here<00:02:41.900> right<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.139> that<00:02:43.500> I
