sure<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.709> they<00:02:25.160> had<00:02:25.430> people<00:02:26.000> download<00:02:26.360> this

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
sure that they had people download this

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.949 
sure that they had people download this
into<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.900> bell<00:02:27.080> curve<00:02:27.350> well<00:02:28.330> they<00:02:29.330> decided

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
into the bell curve well they decided

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.750 
into the bell curve well they decided
that<00:02:30.680> if<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.910> test<00:02:32.209> everybody<00:02:33.040> at<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
that if you test everybody at the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.170 
that if you test everybody at the
highest<00:02:35.060> level<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:36.459> severe<00:02:37.459> disabilities

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
highest level of severe disabilities

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.979 
highest level of severe disabilities
then<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:40.340> kids<00:02:40.640> with<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.000> most<00:02:41.300> severe<00:02:41.780> and

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
then the kids with the most severe and

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.550 
then the kids with the most severe and
profound<00:02:42.170> disabilities<00:02:43.160> down<00:02:43.459> here<00:02:43.940> would<00:02:44.450> be

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
profound disabilities down here would be

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.979 
profound disabilities down here would be
guaranteed<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.590> fail<00:02:46.010> thus<00:02:46.840> ensuring<00:02:47.840> you

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
guaranteed to fail thus ensuring you

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.009 
guaranteed to fail thus ensuring you
have<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.230> bell<00:02:48.620> curve<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.670> don't<00:02:50.019> have

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
have a bell curve and you don't have

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.270 
have a bell curve and you don't have
something<00:02:51.620> like<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:51.799> or<00:02:52.540> goodness<00:02:53.540> sakes

something like this or goodness sakes

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.590 
something like this or goodness sakes
something<00:02:55.280> like<00:02:55.459> this<00:02:55.730> where<00:02:56.000> everybody

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
something like this where everybody

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.160 
something like this where everybody
passes<00:02:57.019> we<00:02:57.860> don't<00:02:58.100> want<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.489> do<00:02:59.150> we<00:02:59.180> even

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
passes we don't want that do we even

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.170 
passes we don't want that do we even
though<00:03:00.320> that's<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.920> goal<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.400> No<00:03:01.670> Child<00:03:01.700> Left

though that's the goal of No Child Left
Behind<00:03:02.890> we<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:04.250> can't<00:03:04.579> have<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:07.150> when

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
Behind we just can't have that so when

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.660 
Behind we just can't have that so when
you're<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.360> teacher<00:03:08.630> working<00:03:09.110> with<00:03:09.470> kids<00:03:09.769> who

you're a teacher working with kids who
are<00:03:10.820> down<00:03:11.030> at<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:12.440> level<00:03:12.709> which<00:03:13.070> let's<00:03:13.579> say

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
are down at this level which let's say

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.319 
are down at this level which let's say
you<00:03:13.820> have<00:03:14.090> an<00:03:14.180> 11<00:03:14.600> year<00:03:14.750> old<00:03:15.010> who<00:03:16.010> has<00:03:16.370> breached

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
you have an 11 year old who has breached

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.710 
you have an 11 year old who has breached
the<00:03:17.570> developmental<00:03:18.260> level<00:03:18.739> of<00:03:19.239> one<00:03:20.239> year<00:03:20.510> old

the developmental level of one year old

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.440 
the developmental level of one year old
that's<00:03:21.230> something<00:03:21.650> that's<00:03:22.030> pretty<00:03:23.030> common

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
that's something that's pretty common

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.910 
that's something that's pretty common
for<00:03:23.660> kids<00:03:24.019> with<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.290> most<00:03:24.470> severe<00:03:24.769> and

kids with severe and profound

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.810 
kids with severe and profound
disabilities<00:03:44.350> who<00:03:44.770> don't<00:03:45.010> have<00:03:45.190> very<00:03:45.670> high

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
disabilities who don't have very high

disabilities who don't have very high
intelligences<00:03:46.810> in<00:03:47.020> several<00:03:47.860> different<00:03:47.980> areas

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
intelligences in several different areas

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.230 
intelligences in several different areas
specifically<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.560> most<00:03:50.800> important<00:03:51.370> I've

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
specifically the most important I've

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.790 
specifically the most important I've
found<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.840> these<00:03:52.960> kids<00:03:53.200> with<00:03:53.470> severe

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
found that these kids with severe

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.440 
found that these kids with severe
disabilities<00:03:53.830> have<00:03:54.640> very<00:03:54.910> high<00:03:55.000> intelligence

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
disabilities have very high intelligence

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.900 
disabilities have very high intelligence
when<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.020> comes<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.410> spirituality<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.459> they

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
when it comes to spirituality and they

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.330 
when it comes to spirituality and they
have<00:03:58.060> all<00:03:58.270> these<00:03:58.630> incredible<00:03:59.290> deep<00:03:59.680> spiritual

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
have all these incredible deep spiritual

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.420 
have all these incredible deep spiritual
lessons<00:04:00.850> that<00:04:01.690> they<00:04:01.930> want<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.290> teach<00:04:02.470> us<00:04:02.740> but

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
lessons that they want to teach us but

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.300 
lessons that they want to teach us but
of<00:04:03.550> course<00:04:03.790> us<00:04:04.540> being<00:04:04.959> concerned<00:04:05.830> with<00:04:06.070> things

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
of course us being concerned with things

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.490 
of course us being concerned with things
like<00:04:06.430> bell<00:04:06.790> curves<00:04:07.150> we<00:04:07.660> often<00:04:08.050> miss<00:04:08.230> these

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
like bell curves we often miss these

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.760 
like bell curves we often miss these
deep<00:04:08.740> lessons<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.400> they<00:04:09.520> have<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.850> teach<00:04:10.030> us

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
deep lessons that they have to teach us

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.560 
deep lessons that they have to teach us
so<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:13.120> child<00:04:13.420> is<00:04:13.690> 11<00:04:14.080> years<00:04:14.200> old

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
so this child is 11 years old

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.640 
so this child is 11 years old
functioning<00:04:16.570> on<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:16.780> one-year-old

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
functioning on a one-year-old

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.099 
functioning on a one-year-old
developmental<00:04:18.310> level<00:04:18.640> is<00:04:18.840> going<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:19.989> be

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
developmental level is going to be

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.920 
developmental level is going to be
tested<00:04:20.590> at<00:04:20.829> approximately<00:04:21.730> a<00:04:21.970> four-year-old

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
tested at approximately a four-year-old

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.590 
tested at approximately a four-year-old
developmental<00:04:23.830> level<00:04:24.100> because<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:25.180> is<00:04:25.360> the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
developmental level because that is the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.770 
developmental level because that is the
the<00:04:25.840> higher<00:04:26.050> end<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.919> what<00:04:27.250> do<00:04:27.310> we<00:04:27.370> have<00:04:27.780> what

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
the higher end so what do we have what

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.960 
the higher end so what do we have what
are<00:04:28.870> they<00:04:28.960> asking<00:04:29.140> of<00:04:29.560> us<00:04:29.650> teachers<00:04:29.980> take<00:04:30.850> an

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
are they asking of us teachers take an

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.060 
are they asking of us teachers take an
11<00:04:31.330> year<00:04:31.480> old<00:04:31.600> child<00:04:31.870> who's<00:04:32.230> developed<00:04:32.740> one

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
11 year old child who's developed one

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.270 
11 year old child who's developed one
year<00:04:33.460> in<00:04:33.640> those<00:04:34.540> 11<00:04:34.870> years<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.500> then<00:04:36.010> in<00:04:36.190> the

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
year in those 11 years and then in the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.640 
year in those 11 years and then in the
course<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.700> one<00:04:36.760> school<00:04:37.390> year<00:04:37.440> we're<00:04:38.440> supposed

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
course of one school year we're supposed

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.490 
course of one school year we're supposed
to<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:39.150> miracle<00:04:40.150> workers<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.810> develop<00:04:41.350> that
