00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:18.060

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.539
 with you here who said and said 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.550
 welcome to my your our channel 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 gurizada youtube 2003 you nothing 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.619
 nothing less than one more video 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.939
 talking about the next update of the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.679
 gta online 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.010
 This time just bringing 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.140
 you update day came up part 2 is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.649
 Let 's say what can ultimately be things 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.329
 speculated and good in the brain bigger forum 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.480
 games pole world is being 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.239
 discussed a topic of gta the yacht if 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.399
 those big mega boats say 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.559
 so that those who are rich and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.379
 sure we'll never get in real life 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.690
 they simply tried everything from the game 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.000
 but it is not accessible for both 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.250
 players and what they are discussing is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.820
 you can compare to use it 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.590
 mainly use it not to enjoy 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.439
 of that thing within a session 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.060
 public gta online is possible yes 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.070
 because the deal is already in the game 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.900
 and it is not even the mansions that is one 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.810
 speculated thing is something that is already 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.119
 there and oxy may be surprised us with 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.119
 update may be the next one 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.979
 future upgrade with the yacht inside 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.530
 just do not know anything about 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.390
 speculations of bread and none of this is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.840
 Do you know if it will be confirmed just before 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.640
 this context because the yacht right because 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.860
 I do not know how to talk about the day, there was something else. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.890
 because they are speculating yacht what the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.259
 diego dirty let's say so is is the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.570
 update ostentation and update 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.549
 who is going to have money of luisão already says né 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.880
 So it has to be expensive things have to 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.070
 things that will put ostentation to the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.680
 your online gta character and let's say 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.860
 that the yacht for sure and sustain 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.829
 much in public session is about the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.110
 issue to launch the platform if 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.479
 that nothing has been confirmed and only one 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.910
 with speculation we said 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.430
 a way to interpret the yacht within 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.830
 a public rockstar session can greatly 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.260
 well do this and it would be very good 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.050
 Cannes is very cool they can bring the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.880
 yacht for the session with friends and 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.040
 that we always play 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.360
 do this rack paper and stuff 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.660
 and etc 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.600
 It is also interesting to note that the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.280
 yacht has already been exploited in a way 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.290
 so there is not much to conquer 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.330
 to hide if you put it to sell that is 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.970
 a very cool thing and this is going to be 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.470
 supported by all players ok and 22 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.350
 And you liked the video I like. 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.500
 Way to khan face it and bring a 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.340
 content so it 's fun to 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.530
 You 're going to drop in for fun, said 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.910
 If you liked the video, if you like 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.000
 garbage and this helps a lot in the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.010
 comment what you think shares that 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.320
