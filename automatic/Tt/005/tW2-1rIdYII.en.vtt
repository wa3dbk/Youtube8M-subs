00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.440
 models of mini figures come for every 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:53.030
 packaging so let's start opening 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.790
 all the packets to discover this 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.340
 information 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.150
 all ready then maniacs I have finished 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.000
 to open the 60 sachets that come in 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.580
 the packaging and here we are seeing all 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.560
 the mini figures that now include them 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.950
 is going to say how many thousand figures come 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.410
 by packing the figure of Dali come 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:20.860

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:27.009

 three times four crostis ale organizes 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.720
 three times because these are all the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.009
 mini figures that come out for packaging and 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.290
 now yes we are going to the conclusion then 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.110
 what did the series seem to manic 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.600
 mini figures as already simpson 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.510
 we saw there is no figure that is 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.030
 extremely rare that two or one 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.519
 for packaging I think they all come 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.230
 distributed very evenly which 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.630
 it will not be complicated 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.210
 none of these mini figures 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.510
 for me there are two that I liked 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.250
 very much obviously it is the mini figure 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.630
 of homero simpson and rafita gordon and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.090
 these two mini figures I liked 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.910
 very much in the comments box 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.460
 as always I told me what is the mini 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.400
 figure that you like the most 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.040
 I also wanted to ask you a question 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.310
 seen some debate out there in the networks 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.980
 social and manic ego forums that 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.040
 there are many who love the figures of the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.580
 simpson and there are others who abhor them 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.710
 because those who defend them I would be 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.350
 one of them I think is one of the 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.050
 better licenses that the ego has had and 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.490
 Without a doubt, it will continue for a long time 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.770
 I really like the design 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.360
 the purists who are not liking 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.140
 the figures of the simpsons 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.450
 and that they have lost the essence of a mini 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.550
 figure of the ego for the same as those of 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.920
 carved enough are no longer the figures 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.950
 they round them 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.170
 they say that's why the mini series 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.740
 figures of the simpsons no longer the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.890
 they consider as much as the ego 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.830
 I do not know what you think that question is 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.830
 I leave them homework and also share in 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.140
 the comment box on this occasion 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.080
