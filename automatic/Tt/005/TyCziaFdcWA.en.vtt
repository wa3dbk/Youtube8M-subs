okay<00:00:08.420> this<00:00:09.020> is<00:00:09.230> a<00:00:09.560> little

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
okay this is a little

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.049 
okay this is a little
of<00:00:11.450> how<00:00:11.929> to<00:00:11.990> do<00:00:12.679> surface-mount<00:00:13.400> leads<00:00:13.670> and

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
of how to do surface-mount leads and

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.019 
of how to do surface-mount leads and
make<00:00:14.660> your<00:00:14.840> own<00:00:14.959> life<00:00:15.230> board<00:00:15.760> we've<00:00:16.760> got<00:00:17.000> a

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
make your own life board we've got a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.310 
make your own life board we've got a
piece<00:00:17.300> of<00:00:18.009> clothing<00:00:19.009> house<00:00:19.960> printed<00:00:20.960> circuit

board<00:00:21.560> this<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:22.400> number<00:00:22.550> 265<00:00:23.270> it's<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.810> little

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
board this is number 265 it's a little

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.690 
board this is number 265 it's a little
bit<00:00:24.079> thicker<00:00:24.349> I'll<00:00:24.740> use<00:00:24.919> two<00:00:25.220> sticks<00:00:25.460> three

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
bit thicker I'll use two sticks three

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.700 
bit thicker I'll use two sticks three
normally<00:00:26.060> but<00:00:26.210> I'll<00:00:26.329> just<00:00:26.599> use<00:00:26.810> your<00:00:27.380> this<00:00:27.529> one

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
normally but I'll just use your this one

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.429 
normally but I'll just use your this one
we've<00:00:28.640> got<00:00:28.669> some<00:00:29.390> resistors<00:00:29.899> which<00:00:30.110> are<00:00:30.290> one

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
we've got some resistors which are one

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.760 
we've got some resistors which are one
and<00:00:30.590> a<00:00:30.619> half<00:00:31.029> K<00:00:32.029> or<00:00:32.599> fifteen<00:00:33.260> hundred<00:00:33.559> ohms<00:00:33.820> and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
and a half K or fifteen hundred ohms and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.160 
and a half K or fifteen hundred ohms and
we've<00:00:36.770> got<00:00:37.059> some<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:38.360> 603<00:00:39.399> surface-mount<00:00:40.399> LEDs

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
we've got some so 603 surface-mount LEDs

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.270 
we've got some so 603 surface-mount LEDs
and<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.950> razor<00:00:43.160> saw<00:00:44.650> clamp<00:00:45.650> just<00:00:45.710> begun<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.130> make

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
and a razor saw clamp just begun to make

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.670 
and a razor saw clamp just begun to make
three<00:00:46.610> cuts<00:00:46.850> in<00:00:47.090> this<00:00:48.310> for<00:00:49.310> the<00:00:49.400> razor<00:00:49.610> saw

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
three cuts in this for the razor saw

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.870 
three cuts in this for the razor saw
okay<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:51.739> there's<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.220> three<00:00:52.460> cuts<00:00:52.730> that

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
okay so there's the three cuts that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.120 
okay so there's the three cuts that
we've<00:00:53.060> just<00:00:53.329> made<00:00:53.590> working<00:00:54.590> with<00:00:54.739> surface

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
we've just made working with surface

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.880 
we've just made working with surface
mount<00:00:55.370> LEDs<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.329> little<00:00:56.540> solder<00:00:57.020> pads<00:00:57.290> on

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
mount LEDs the little solder pads on

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.540 
mount LEDs the little solder pads on
each<00:00:58.489> end<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:59.060> of<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.660> lead<00:00:59.899> they<00:01:00.739> oxidize

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
each end of the of the lead they oxidize

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.520 
each end of the of the lead they oxidize
since<00:01:02.270> they<00:01:02.420> touch<00:01:02.630> that<00:01:02.840> atmosphere<00:01:03.410> they

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
since they touch that atmosphere they

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.079 
since they touch that atmosphere they
oxidize<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.250> we're<00:01:04.399> going<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.579> use<00:01:04.759> cars

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
oxidize so we're going to use cars

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.209 
oxidize so we're going to use cars
orange<00:01:05.509> flux<00:01:05.780> orange<00:01:06.619> flux<00:01:07.329> doesn't<00:01:09.070> have<00:01:10.070> the

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
orange flux orange flux doesn't have the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.709 
orange flux orange flux doesn't have the
acid<00:01:10.549> in<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:10.790> there<00:01:10.969> so<00:01:11.149> you<00:01:11.210> don't<00:01:11.360> leave<00:01:11.600> the

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
acid in it there so you don't leave the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.899 
acid in it there so you don't leave the
device<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.560> I<00:01:12.649> use<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.890> triple<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.460> paintbrush

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
device and I use a triple a paintbrush

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.000 
device and I use a triple a paintbrush
and<00:01:14.689> we<00:01:14.780> just<00:01:14.990> go<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.290> put<00:01:15.880> with<00:01:16.880> some<00:01:17.120> on<00:01:18.010> each

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
and we just go and put with some on each

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.330 
and we just go and put with some on each
of<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:21.159> either<00:01:22.159> side<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.830> cut<00:01:25.100> we've

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
of the either side of the the cut we've

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.240 
of the either side of the the cut we've
made<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:27.020> can<00:01:27.049> see<00:01:27.409> how<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.830> coppers

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
made and you can see how the coppers

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.850 
made and you can see how the coppers
being<00:01:28.460> cleaned<00:01:28.820> up<00:01:29.030> straightaway<00:01:29.680> so<00:01:30.680> we're

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
being cleaned up straightaway so we're

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.890 
being cleaned up straightaway so we're
preparing<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.460> copper<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:32.000> all<00:01:32.780> the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
preparing the copper and all the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.230 
preparing the copper and all the
oxidizing<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.710> rubbish<00:01:34.220> that's<00:01:34.369> been<00:01:34.970> on<00:01:35.119> it

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
oxidizing and rubbish that's been on it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.530 
oxidizing and rubbish that's been on it
there's<00:01:35.479> our<00:01:35.659> three<00:01:36.700> surface<00:01:37.700> mount<00:01:37.940> LEDs<00:01:38.240> and

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
there's our three surface mount LEDs and

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.690 
there's our three surface mount LEDs and
you<00:01:39.229> can<00:01:39.380> see<00:01:39.619> we've<00:01:39.890> got<00:01:39.979> an<00:01:40.130> anode<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.640> the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
you can see we've got an anode and the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.980 
you can see we've got an anode and the
cathode<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:42.369> cathode<00:01:43.369> is<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:44.090> negative<00:01:44.540> side

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
cathode the cathode is the negative side

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.109 
cathode the cathode is the negative side
and<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.470> anode<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.920> positive<00:01:46.040> so<00:01:47.000> the

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
and the anode is the positive so the

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.469 
and the anode is the positive so the
bottom<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.630> little<00:01:47.840> T<00:01:48.140> on<00:01:48.500> these<00:01:49.479> service

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
bottom of the little T on these service

bottom of the little T on these service
mount<00:01:50.600> LEDs<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:51.290> usually<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:53.000> cafe<00:01:53.390> but

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
mount LEDs is usually the the cafe but

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.219 
mount LEDs is usually the the cafe but
you<00:01:53.689> can<00:01:53.810> check<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.200> it's<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.070> bigger<00:01:55.280> sign

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
you can check that it's a bigger sign

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.170 
you can check that it's a bigger sign
because<00:01:57.229> I'm<00:01:57.380> using<00:01:57.560> warm<00:01:57.920> White's<00:01:58.189> so

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
because I'm using warm White's so

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.550 
because I'm using warm White's so
there's<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.509> cathode<00:01:59.869> in<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.140> little<00:02:00.350> black

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
there's the cathode in that little black

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.170 
there's the cathode in that little black
area<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.159> middle<00:02:01.369> there<00:02:01.520> that's<00:02:01.759> that's

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
area in the middle there that's that's

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.350 
area in the middle there that's that's
the<00:02:02.299> green<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.810> these<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.830> that's<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.909> cathode

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
the green on these so that's the cathode

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.390 
the green on these so that's the cathode
and<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.750> anode<00:02:05.780> just<00:02:06.650> true<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.979> letters<00:02:07.280> if

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
and the anode just true to letters if

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.699 
and the anode just true to letters if
it's<00:02:07.549> positive<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.090> negative<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.780> got<00:02:09.530> my

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
it's positive and negative I got my

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.369 
it's positive and negative I got my
soldering<00:02:10.340> station<00:02:10.789> set<00:02:10.970> at<00:02:11.060> 196<00:02:12.019> degrees

centigrade<00:02:13.040> for<00:02:13.939> solving<00:02:14.390> these<00:02:15.730> okay

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
centigrade for solving these okay

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.720 
centigrade for solving these okay
I've<00:02:17.209> tinned<00:02:17.510> one<00:02:17.720> side<00:02:18.250> put<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> little<00:02:19.489> bit<00:02:19.610> of

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
I've tinned one side put a little bit of

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.940 
I've tinned one side put a little bit of
tin<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.330> there<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.900> we're<00:02:21.380> gonna<00:02:21.500> put<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.800> lid

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
tin on there and we're gonna put the lid

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.490 
tin on there and we're gonna put the lid
on<00:02:21.980> there<00:02:22.280> now

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.590 

we<00:02:24.950> don't<00:02:25.130> want<00:02:25.370> one<00:02:25.550> side<00:02:25.850> on<00:02:26.090> that's<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
we don't want one side on that's the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.630 
we don't want one side on that's the
LEDs<00:02:26.810> holding<00:02:27.170> itself<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:28.250> just<00:02:28.400> do<00:02:28.550> the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
LEDs holding itself and just do the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.480 
LEDs holding itself and just do the
other<00:02:28.790> side<00:02:32.680> there<00:02:33.680> we<00:02:33.800> go<00:02:33.920> there's<00:02:34.160> one<00:02:34.190> lid

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
other side there we go there's one lid

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.140 
other side there we go there's one lid
on<00:02:34.660> okay<00:02:35.660> we've<00:02:36.560> got<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.830> three<00:02:36.980> LEDs<00:02:37.370> are<00:02:37.910> in

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
on okay we've got the three LEDs are in

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.170 
on okay we've got the three LEDs are in
place<00:02:38.740> with<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.890> saw<00:02:40.070> cuts<00:02:40.370> across<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:40.970> we've

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
place with the saw cuts across so we've

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.590 
place with the saw cuts across so we've
got<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:42.910> positive<00:02:43.910> side<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.450> negative

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
got the the positive side the negative

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.510 
got the the positive side the negative
side<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.200> positive<00:02:45.380> side<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.980> negative<00:02:46.130> side

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
side the positive side the negative side

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.160 
side the positive side the negative side
the<00:02:46.700> positive<00:02:46.880> side<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.480> negative<00:02:47.840> side<00:02:47.990> the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
the positive side the negative side the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.740 
the positive side the negative side the
anode<00:02:48.410> cathode<00:02:48.650> I'll<00:02:49.430> put<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.700> 1500<00:02:50.540> ohm

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
anode cathode I'll put a 1500 ohm

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.340 
anode cathode I'll put a 1500 ohm
resistor<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.710> here<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:52.940> is<00:02:53.150> my<00:02:53.350> track

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
resistor in here and this is my track

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.880 
resistor in here and this is my track
power<00:02:54.620> from<00:02:54.860> my<00:02:55.010> GCC<00:02:55.670> system

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
power from my GCC system

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.180 
power from my GCC system
so<00:02:57.890> we'll<00:02:58.040> put<00:02:58.190> one<00:02:58.400> on<00:02:58.730> there<00:02:59.140> and<00:03:00.140> we'll<00:03:01.070> put

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
so we'll put one on there and we'll put

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.790 
so we'll put one on there and we'll put
one<00:03:01.370> up<00:03:01.520> here<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.270> we<00:03:02.420> get<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.630> lights<00:03:02.840> on<00:03:03.050> now

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
one up here and we get the lights on now

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.120 
one up here and we get the lights on now
we<00:03:04.130> reverse<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.790> take<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.630> one

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
we reverse this take this one

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.560 
we reverse this take this one
and<00:03:07.130> swap<00:03:07.400> them<00:03:07.580> over<00:03:07.700> won't<00:03:08.240> make<00:03:08.390> any

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
and swap them over won't make any

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.980 
and swap them over won't make any
difference<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.500> lights<00:03:12.709> will<00:03:12.890> still<00:03:13.100> come<00:03:13.280> on

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
difference the lights will still come on

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.590 
difference the lights will still come on
okay<00:03:14.990> I've<00:03:15.110> added<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.440> fourth<00:03:15.680> LED<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.459> here<00:03:16.760> and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
okay I've added a fourth LED in here and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.940 
okay I've added a fourth LED in here and
I've<00:03:17.690> gone<00:03:17.840> back<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.290> my<00:03:18.410> little<00:03:18.530> battery

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
I've gone back to my little battery

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.570 
I've gone back to my little battery
tester<00:03:19.750> just<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.840> couple<00:03:21.020> of<00:03:21.140> leads<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:21.680> you've

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
tester just a couple of leads and you've

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.650 
tester just a couple of leads and you've
got<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.820> have<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.990> resistor<00:03:23.990> in<00:03:24.110> line<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:25.660> let's

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
got to have a resistor in line so let's

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.550 
got to have a resistor in line so let's
just<00:03:26.930> check<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.260> fourth<00:03:27.680> one<00:03:27.920> works<00:03:29.560> yep

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
just check that fourth one works yep

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.930 
just check that fourth one works yep
she's<00:03:30.860> working<00:03:31.690> those<00:03:32.690> two<00:03:32.989> are<00:03:33.050> working<00:03:33.230> yep

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
she's working those two are working yep

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.650 
she's working those two are working yep
okay<00:03:37.120> put<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.209> there

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
okay put it there

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.080 
okay put it there
we're<00:03:39.200> not<00:03:39.290> getting<00:03:39.560> any<00:03:39.709> light<00:03:39.980> nine<00:03:40.700> volts

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
we're not getting any light nine volts

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.080 
we're not getting any light nine volts
is<00:03:41.209> not<00:03:41.360> enough<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.720> drive<00:03:41.959> those<00:03:42.170> four<00:03:42.470> LEDs

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
is not enough to drive those four LEDs

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
is not enough to drive those four LEDs
come<00:03:44.090> back<00:03:44.300> on<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.660> my<00:03:44.950> DCC<00:03:45.950> system<00:03:46.370> look<00:03:47.110> come

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
come back on to my DCC system look come

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.340 
come back on to my DCC system look come
back<00:03:48.290> on<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.620> my<00:03:48.739> DCC<00:03:49.459> system<00:03:50.140> connect<00:03:51.140> up<00:03:51.320> to

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
back on to my DCC system connect up to

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.430 
back on to my DCC system connect up to
the<00:03:51.650> resistor<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:53.630> we<00:03:53.750> come<00:03:53.959> down<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.200> the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
the resistor and we come down to the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.380 
the resistor and we come down to the
fourth<00:03:54.620> pass<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.370> fourth<00:03:55.580> one<00:03:55.790> I<00:03:56.000> can<00:03:56.239> get

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
fourth pass the fourth one I can get

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.610 
fourth pass the fourth one I can get
four<00:03:56.630> going<00:03:58.360> but<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.510> 9-volt<00:03:59.989> battery<00:04:00.410> won't

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
four going but the 9-volt battery won't

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.500 
four going but the 9-volt battery won't
do<00:04:00.799> it<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.070> got<00:04:01.250> out<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.519> voltage<00:04:01.940> each

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
do it you got out of the voltage each

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.120 
do it you got out of the voltage each
one<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.870> these<00:04:03.019> is<00:04:03.230> drawing<00:04:03.500> about<00:04:03.769> three

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
one of these is drawing about three

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.000 
one of these is drawing about three
volts<00:04:04.580> so<00:04:05.540> I've<00:04:05.660> got<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.019> over<00:04:06.380> 12<00:04:06.739> volts

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
volts so I've got to just over 12 volts

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.970 
volts so I've got to just over 12 volts
on<00:04:07.130> my<00:04:07.250> DCC<00:04:07.880> system<00:04:08.299> twelve<00:04:08.600> point<00:04:08.810> eight<00:04:08.980> so

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
on my DCC system twelve point eight so

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.220 
on my DCC system twelve point eight so
I'm<00:04:10.160> driving<00:04:10.670> four<00:04:10.940> LEDs<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.750> there's<00:04:11.989> four

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
I'm driving four LEDs so there's four

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.130 
I'm driving four LEDs so there's four
LEDs<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.120> want<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.420> do<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.540> coach<00:04:14.870> or

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
LEDs so you want to do a coach or

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.840 
LEDs so you want to do a coach or
something<00:04:15.320> like<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.560> fine<00:04:16.040> now<00:04:16.580> I'll<00:04:16.729> do

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
something like that fine now I'll do

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.710 
something like that fine now I'll do
another<00:04:17.030> trick<00:04:18.760> okay<00:04:19.760> now<00:04:20.060> we've<00:04:20.269> got<00:04:20.299> five

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
another trick okay now we've got five

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.530 
another trick okay now we've got five
surface-mount<00:04:21.470> LEDs<00:04:21.680> in<00:04:21.830> there<00:04:22.070> one<00:04:23.000> two

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
surface-mount LEDs in there one two

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.960 
surface-mount LEDs in there one two
three<00:04:24.110> four<00:04:24.560> five<00:04:24.919> so<00:04:25.220> we<00:04:25.340> put<00:04:25.520> this<00:04:25.610> one<00:04:25.820> down

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
three four five so we put this one down

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.210 
three four five so we put this one down
this<00:04:26.150> back<00:04:26.360> end<00:04:26.600> here<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.800> can<00:04:27.950> see<00:04:28.130> that

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
this back end here and you can see that

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.280 
this back end here and you can see that
they<00:04:28.370> just<00:04:28.400> come<00:04:28.970> on<00:04:29.150> but<00:04:29.600> notice<00:04:29.960> that<00:04:29.990> the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
they just come on but notice that the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.820 
they just come on but notice that the
the<00:04:31.250> illumination<00:04:31.940> has<00:04:31.970> dropped<00:04:32.360> right<00:04:32.630> off

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
the illumination has dropped right off

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.050 
the illumination has dropped right off
it's<00:04:33.830> sucking<00:04:34.099> more<00:04:34.340> power<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:34.820> drive<00:04:35.000> the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
it's sucking more power to drive the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.710 
it's sucking more power to drive the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
it'll still come on here's a led values

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.500 
it'll still come on here's a led values
for<00:05:09.200> testing<00:05:09.650> it's<00:05:09.830> just<00:05:10.010> a<00:05:10.160> towelette<00:05:10.790> to

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
for testing it's just a towelette to

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.470 
for testing it's just a towelette to
military<00:05:12.080> where<00:05:12.590> they<00:05:12.740> resisted<00:05:13.460> on<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:13.700> put

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
military where they resisted on it put

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.270 
military where they resisted on it put
him<00:05:14.540> onto<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.840> tracks<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.950> we<00:05:19.010> get<00:05:19.190> it

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
him onto the tracks and we get it

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.790 
him onto the tracks and we get it
lighten<00:05:19.610> up<00:05:19.730> put<00:05:20.570> up<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.750> other<00:05:20.900> way<00:05:23.800> and

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
lighten up put up the other way and

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.420 
lighten up put up the other way and
it'll<00:05:25.520> still<00:05:25.730> light<00:05:25.970> up<00:05:26.120> so<00:05:26.720> this<00:05:26.840> is<00:05:26.990> DCC<00:05:27.590> good

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
it'll still light up so this is DCC good

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.900 
it'll still light up so this is DCC good
one<00:05:28.580> for<00:05:28.760> just<00:05:29.030> testing<00:05:29.660> things
