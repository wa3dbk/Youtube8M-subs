gonna be talking about getting multiple
sounds<00:00:14.809> out<00:00:14.900> of<00:00:15.019> one<00:00:15.289> snare<00:00:15.860> drum<00:00:16.100> the<00:00:16.550> first

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
sounds out of one snare drum the first

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.600 
sounds out of one snare drum the first
example<00:00:17.240> is<00:00:17.420> your<00:00:18.290> typical<00:00:18.590> tuned<00:00:19.280> up<00:00:19.430> pretty

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
example is your typical tuned up pretty

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.240 
example is your typical tuned up pretty
high<00:00:19.850> and<00:00:20.180> wide<00:00:20.510> open<00:00:20.840> no<00:00:20.990> dampening<00:00:21.380> sounds<00:00:22.190> a

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
high and wide open no dampening sounds a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.820 
high and wide open no dampening sounds a
bit<00:00:22.370> like<00:00:22.430> this<00:00:28.840> snares<00:00:29.840> are<00:00:30.020> also<00:00:30.290> pretty

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
bit like this snares are also pretty

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.700 
bit like this snares are also pretty
tight<00:00:31.100> which<00:00:31.430> we'll<00:00:32.119> talk<00:00:32.300> about<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:33.140> little

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
tight which we'll talk about a little

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.430 
tight which we'll talk about a little
later<00:00:34.269> that<00:00:35.269> can<00:00:35.629> be<00:00:35.749> make<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.079> big<00:00:36.350> difference

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
later that can be make a big difference

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:50.169 
later that can be make a big difference
in<00:00:36.769> your<00:00:36.800> sound<00:00:48.039> okay<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:49.100> for<00:00:49.429> example<00:00:50.089> number

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
in your sound okay so for example number

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.029 
in your sound okay so for example number
two<00:00:50.420> I'm<00:00:50.929> not<00:00:51.050> gonna<00:00:51.140> change<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.589> tuning<00:00:51.920> at

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
two I'm not gonna change the tuning at

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.329 
two I'm not gonna change the tuning at
all<00:00:52.159> I'm<00:00:52.399> just<00:00:52.429> gonna<00:00:52.699> add<00:00:53.170> one<00:00:54.170> little<00:00:54.979> roll

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
all I'm just gonna add one little roll

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.540 
all I'm just gonna add one little roll
of<00:00:55.519> gaff<00:00:55.969> tape<00:00:55.999> about<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.019> half<00:00:57.260> inch<00:00:57.499> from<00:00:57.829> the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
of gaff tape about a half inch from the

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.739 
of gaff tape about a half inch from the
top<00:00:58.760> here<00:00:59.210> so<00:00:59.870> here's<00:01:00.139> the<00:01:00.289> wide<00:01:00.499> open<00:01:01.749> just

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
top here so here's the wide open just

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.370 
top here so here's the wide open just
like<00:01:02.899> before<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:04.420> here's<00:01:05.420> just<00:01:05.689> one<00:01:05.930> piece<00:01:06.229> of

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
like before and here's just one piece of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.840 
like before and here's just one piece of
gaff<00:01:06.560> tape<00:01:07.899> now<00:01:08.899> tuning<00:01:09.290> no<00:01:10.159> snare<00:01:10.430> tension

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
gaff tape now tuning no snare tension

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.990 
gaff tape now tuning no snare tension
change<00:01:11.590> just<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.770> same<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:16.520> that's<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.789> pretty

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
change just the same so that's a pretty

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.149 
change just the same so that's a pretty
simple<00:01:17.360> switch<00:01:17.719> whether<00:01:18.320> you're<00:01:18.590> recording

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
simple switch whether you're recording

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.950 
simple switch whether you're recording
or<00:01:19.640> you're<00:01:19.880> on<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.119> live<00:01:20.360> gig<00:01:20.539> and<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:20.810> can

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
or you're on a live gig and that can

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:34.330 
or you're on a live gig and that can
that<00:01:21.200> can<00:01:21.289> be<00:01:21.409> pretty<00:01:21.649> drastic<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:33.100> here<00:01:34.100> is

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
that can be pretty drastic so here is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.069 
that can be pretty drastic so here is
example<00:01:34.909> three<00:01:35.329> I've<00:01:35.570> tuned<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.930> down

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
example three I've tuned it down

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.029 
example three I've tuned it down
significantly<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:38.299> head<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.780> I've<00:01:39.109> added<00:01:39.259> a

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
significantly the head and I've added a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.880 
significantly the head and I've added a
few<00:01:40.130> more<00:01:40.729> pieces<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:41.149> tape<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:41.719> keep<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.229> head

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
few more pieces of tape to keep the head

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.090 
few more pieces of tape to keep the head
from<00:01:43.039> ringing<00:01:44.439> because<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.710> lower<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.070> gets

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
from ringing because the lower it gets

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.270 
from ringing because the lower it gets
the<00:01:46.429> uglier<00:01:46.789> its<00:01:47.780> starts<00:01:48.469> to<00:01:48.560> sound<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.100> the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
the uglier its starts to sound so the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.770 
the uglier its starts to sound so the
more<00:01:49.460> dampening<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:49.939> have<00:01:50.090> on<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.359> helps<00:01:50.659> to

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
more dampening you have on it helps to

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.969 
more dampening you have on it helps to
keep<00:01:50.899> those<00:01:51.079> overtones<00:01:51.740> at<00:01:52.070> bay<00:01:52.670> for<00:01:53.240> you

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
keep those overtones at bay for you

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.599 
keep those overtones at bay for you
so<00:01:55.979> that's<00:01:56.159> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.520> pretty<00:01:57.270> beefy<00:01:57.450> sound

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
so that's kind of a pretty beefy sound

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.999 
so that's kind of a pretty beefy sound
no<00:01:59.609> rimshots

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
no rimshots

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.669 
no rimshots
and<00:02:02.009> here's<00:02:02.280> where<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:03.319> snare<00:02:04.319> attention

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
and here's where I think snare attention

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.620 
and here's where I think snare attention
starts<00:02:04.859> to<00:02:05.039> come<00:02:05.189> into<00:02:05.340> play<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.179> here's

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
starts to come into play so here's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.639 
starts to come into play so here's
here's<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.679> snare<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:07.979> pretty<00:02:08.190> tight

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
here's what the snare is pretty tight

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.740 
here's what the snare is pretty tight
it's<00:02:10.649> almost<00:02:10.920> choked<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:12.299> you<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.569> move

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it's almost choked and then you can move

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.559 
it's almost choked and then you can move
it<00:02:12.840> back<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:17.640> almost<00:02:17.849> gives<00:02:18.000> them<00:02:18.209> kind<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
it back it almost gives them kind of a

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:37.479 
it back it almost gives them kind of a
field<00:02:18.840> drum<00:02:20.989> sound<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:25.200> here<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.620> tighter

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.569 

the<00:02:38.489> head<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:39.090> barely<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.680> super<00:02:41.430> low

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
the head is barely on it is super low

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.559 
the head is barely on it is super low
it's<00:02:42.000> really<00:02:42.299> loose<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.780> touch<00:02:44.420> I've<00:02:45.420> also

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
it's really loose to touch I've also

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.800 
it's really loose to touch I've also
added<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.430> bit<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.549> cloth<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:48.480> kind<00:02:48.780> of

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
added this bit of cloth it's kind of

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.150 
added this bit of cloth it's kind of
hanging<00:02:49.049> on<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.349> edge<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.739> just<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.010> cut

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
hanging on the edge of it just to cut

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.949 
hanging on the edge of it just to cut
out<00:02:50.190> all<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.519> your<00:02:50.730> overtones<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.780> now<00:02:51.900> you

this<00:03:00.600> drum<00:03:00.930> gets<00:03:01.769> really<00:03:02.190> fat<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.540> here's

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
this drum gets really fat and here's

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.110 
this drum gets really fat and here's
what<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.019> looser<00:03:04.290> snares<00:03:07.700> which<00:03:08.700> comes<00:03:08.970> out

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:43.430 

a<00:03:39.890> final<00:03:40.890> example<00:03:41.720> this<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:42.930> more<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.320> an

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
a final example this is just more of an
