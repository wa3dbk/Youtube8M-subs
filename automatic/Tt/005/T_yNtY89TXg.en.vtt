 natural materials paper village 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.939
 as far as possible due to the fact 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.979
 that the surface of the dome holds all 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.500
 no load inside carrier 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.140

 accuracy in terms of the heat of hulya and confusion 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:07.799
 no equal use of warm floors 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:14.079

 temperature also considers his hitman 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.699
 what's the heat comparative for the difference 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.930
 bought in that hot air 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.000

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.739
 buildings the ability to use more 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.859
 spaces at lower cost on 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.760
