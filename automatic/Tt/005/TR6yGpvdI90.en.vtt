there's<00:01:11.760> no<00:01:11.850> way<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.570> his<00:01:12.780> assistant

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
there's no way and then his assistant

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.160 
there's no way and then his assistant
sliced<00:01:13.979> her<00:01:14.100> toe<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.460> half<00:01:14.640> trying<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.720> over

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
sliced her toe in half trying that over

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
sliced her toe in half trying that over
the<00:01:16.290> lift<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.860> were<00:01:16.979> literally<00:01:17.490> terrified

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the lift so we were literally terrified

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.749 
the lift so we were literally terrified
yep<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.740> try<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.310> first<00:01:20.549> time

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
yep and then we try to the first time

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.370 
yep and then we try to the first time
and<00:01:20.970> then<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.240> nailed<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> first<00:01:21.960> time<00:01:22.049> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and then we nailed it the first time so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.950 
and then we nailed it the first time so
I<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.610> lifts<00:01:23.939> confidence<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.750> key

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
I think with lifts confidence is so key

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.570 
I think with lifts confidence is so key
and<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.409> were<00:01:25.560> confident<00:01:25.950> from<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> beginning

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
and we were confident from the beginning

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
and we were confident from the beginning
with<00:01:26.700> our<00:01:26.850> lift<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.479> definitely<00:01:28.170> helped
