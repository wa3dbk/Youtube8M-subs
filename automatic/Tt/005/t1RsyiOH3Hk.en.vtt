on<00:02:12.680> our<00:02:12.830> Vitamix<00:02:13.340> blender<00:02:13.700> if<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.390> think<00:02:14.690> that

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
on our Vitamix blender if you think that

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.140 
on our Vitamix blender if you think that
your<00:02:15.080> cheese<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> little<00:02:16.250> bit<00:02:16.400> too<00:02:16.580> liquidy

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
your cheese is a little bit too liquidy

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.780 
your cheese is a little bit too liquidy
then<00:02:17.870> add<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.530> little<00:02:18.560> bit<00:02:18.860> more<00:02:18.980> cashews<00:02:19.520> on

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
then add in a little bit more cashews on

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.640 
then add in a little bit more cashews on
the<00:02:20.239> other<00:02:20.420> side<00:02:20.750> if<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.080> think<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.440> it's<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
the other side if you think that it's a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.590 
the other side if you think that it's a
little<00:02:21.680> too<00:02:22.040> dry<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:22.640> give<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.239> little<00:02:23.330> more

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
little too dry just give a little more

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.870 
little too dry just give a little more
shot<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.319> no<00:02:24.709> big<00:02:24.860> deal<00:02:25.040> it's<00:02:25.520> gonna<00:02:25.670> go

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
shot of this no big deal it's gonna go

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.470 
shot of this no big deal it's gonna go
and<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.350> really<00:02:27.680> thick<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.880> need<00:02:29.239> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
and this is really thick so you need the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.630 
and this is really thick so you need the
tamper<00:02:30.170> or<00:02:30.500> something<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.100> stir<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.520> around

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
tamper or something to stir it around

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.910 
tamper or something to stir it around
and<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.300> might<00:02:32.510> have<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.810> process<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.470> for<00:02:33.739> a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
and you might have to process it for a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.130 
and you might have to process it for a
good<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:34.940> know<00:02:35.060> few<00:02:35.450> minutes<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.989> food

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
good you know few minutes in a food

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.290 
good you know few minutes in a food
processor<00:02:36.170> if<00:02:36.860> you're<00:02:37.010> using<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.310> right<00:02:38.120> if

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
processor if you're using that right if

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.910 
processor if you're using that right if
you<00:02:38.390> don't<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> vitamix<00:02:39.200> blender<00:02:39.290> we're

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
you don't have a vitamix blender we're

00:02:39.920 --> 00:03:11.920 
you don't have a vitamix blender we're
just<00:02:40.100> going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.250> turn<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.610> on

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.320 

okay<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.709> in<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.950> food<00:03:14.160> processor<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:15.090> would

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
okay so in a food processor this would

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.240 
okay so in a food processor this would
take<00:03:15.510> about<00:03:15.660> three<00:03:16.140> minutes<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:16.800> in<00:03:16.950> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
take about three minutes but in the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.339 
take about three minutes but in the
Vitamix<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.940> only<00:03:18.150> takes<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:18.870> know<00:03:19.020> 30

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
Vitamix it only takes you know 30

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.479 
Vitamix it only takes you know 30
seconds<00:03:19.890> or<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:21.390> then<00:03:21.480> once<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.770> process

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
seconds or so and then once you process

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.790 
seconds or so and then once you process
it<00:03:23.670> all<00:03:23.790> together<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.930> get<00:03:25.140> this<00:03:25.349> mixture

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
it all together you get this mixture

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.520 
it all together you get this mixture
that's<00:03:26.130> really<00:03:26.520> smooth<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.540> really<00:03:28.080> thick

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
that's really smooth and really thick

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.650 
that's really smooth and really thick
you<00:03:29.040> don't<00:03:29.340> want<00:03:29.459> this<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.819> be<00:03:29.970> too<00:03:30.150> runny<00:03:30.390> or

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
you don't want this to be too runny or

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.290 
you don't want this to be too runny or
else<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:32.130> know<00:03:32.280> won't<00:03:32.610> be<00:03:32.730> like<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.940> cheese

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
else you know won't be like a cheese

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.280 
else you know won't be like a cheese
we're<00:03:34.020> going<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.230> actually<00:03:34.410> transfer<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.489> to

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
we're going to actually transfer this to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.170 
we're going to actually transfer this to
some<00:03:37.290> walnuts<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:38.010> we've<00:03:38.160> crushed<00:03:38.550> up<00:03:38.880> and

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
then we're going to be rolling it in the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.130 
then we're going to be rolling it in the
walnuts<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.819> then<00:03:41.970> wrapping<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.660> plastic
