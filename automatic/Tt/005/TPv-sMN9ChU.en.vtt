here and well if I talk like this it

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.980 
here and well if I talk like this it
sounds<00:00:19.410> quite<00:00:19.770> nice<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.279> seems<00:00:20.689> but<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.810> can't

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
sounds quite nice it seems but you can't

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.380 
sounds quite nice it seems but you can't
have<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.320> know<00:00:22.410> actors<00:00:22.769> speaking<00:00:23.220> into<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.850> you

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
have you know actors speaking into a you

know<00:00:24.510> big<00:00:24.660> boom<00:00:24.990> mic<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:26.390> not<00:00:27.390> exactly<00:00:27.449> i'm

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
know big boom mic so not exactly i'm

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.900 
know big boom mic so not exactly i'm
sure<00:00:28.019> how<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.310> placement<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.490> should<00:00:29.730> be

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
sure how the placement of this should be

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.440 
sure how the placement of this should be
maybe<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:31.080> outside<00:00:32.120> see<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.180> i<00:00:33.270> talk<00:00:33.390> like

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
maybe a bit outside see if i talk like

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.130 
maybe a bit outside see if i talk like
this<00:00:33.690> doesn't<00:00:34.140> really<00:00:34.260> work<00:00:34.850> can't<00:00:35.850> really

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
this doesn't really work can't really

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.860 
this doesn't really work can't really
eat<00:00:37.140> more<00:00:37.320> wire<00:00:37.969> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.270> kind<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> okay

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
eat more wire this is kind of okay

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.590 
eat more wire this is kind of okay
actually<00:00:40.379> that's<00:00:40.860> kind<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.540> but<00:00:42.540> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
actually that's kind of all right but it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.299 
actually that's kind of all right but it
needs<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.899> under<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> frame<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.250> this

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
needs to be under the frame so at this

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.260 
needs to be under the frame so at this
point<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:47.309> would<00:00:47.370> need<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.789> top<00:00:48.059> I

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
point you would need to be on top I

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.889 
point you would need to be on top I
guess<00:00:48.770> ideally<00:00:49.789> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.270> this

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
guess ideally kind of like this this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.380 
guess ideally kind of like this this
doesn't<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:52.320> work<00:00:53.000> but<00:00:54.000> yeah<00:00:54.180> actually

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
doesn't really work but yeah actually

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.799 
doesn't really work but yeah actually
yeah<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.140> sounds<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.680> bit<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.399> kind<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
yeah it sounds a bit you can kind of

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.119 
yeah it sounds a bit you can kind of
here<00:00:59.690> but<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> need<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.199> outside<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
here but I need to be outside of the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.780 
here but I need to be outside of the
frame<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.609> put<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.879> below<00:01:03.420> me<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
frame if I put it below me like this and

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
frame if I put it below me like this and
and<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.939> talking<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.930> guess<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.380> only

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and I'm talking but I guess it only

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
and I'm talking but I guess it only
works<00:01:08.070> better<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.460> talking<00:01:08.610> downwards

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
works better if I'm talking downwards

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.340 
works better if I'm talking downwards
which<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.860> shouldn't<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.430> doing<00:01:12.350> mmm

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
which you shouldn't really be doing mmm

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.149 
which you shouldn't really be doing mmm
but<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.310> guess<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.530> like<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.799> I'm

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
but if I guess if I have like this I'm

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.050 
but if I guess if I have like this I'm
talking<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> talking<00:01:19.140> talking<00:01:19.530> wait<00:01:23.060> how

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
talking and talking talking wait how

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.010 
talking and talking talking wait how
about<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.630> no<00:01:24.960> listen<00:01:25.680> remark<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:27.020> mean

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
about this no listen remark I mean

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.210 
about this no listen remark I mean
you're<00:01:28.140> gonna<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> sound<00:01:28.770> guy<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.130> we're

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you're gonna have a sound guy so we're

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
you're gonna have a sound guy so we're
gonna<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.430> testing<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:30.259> ideally<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
gonna be testing this out ideally you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.700 
gonna be testing this out ideally you
have<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.829> closest<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:33.170> then<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> could<00:01:34.380> hear

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
have the closest and then you could hear

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.030 
have the closest and then you could hear
but<00:01:35.240> you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.930> i<00:01:36.960> guess<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:37.409> made<00:01:37.590> blogs

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
but you know so i guess if i made blogs

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.140 
but you know so i guess if i made blogs
like<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.400> would<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.700> kind<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.939> interesting

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
like this would be kind of interesting

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.660 
like this would be kind of interesting
you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.680> well<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> should<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.520> my

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you know well I should know that my

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
you know well I should know that my
vlogs<00:01:41.939> could<00:01:42.090> ever<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.420> interesting<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.500> at

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
vlogs could ever be interesting but at

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.880 
vlogs could ever be interesting but at
least<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.880> would<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.840> fuzzy<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.619> thing

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
least I would have a fuzzy little thing

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.399 
least I would have a fuzzy little thing
to<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
to that

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.730 
to that
I<00:01:49.840> would<00:01:50.840> also<00:01:50.960> keep<00:01:51.170> looking<00:01:51.439> at<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.619> monitor

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
I would also keep looking at the monitor

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:01.179 
I would also keep looking at the monitor
here<00:01:53.710> but<00:01:54.710> yes<00:01:59.020> I<00:02:00.020> finally<00:02:00.619> managed<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.950> get<00:02:01.069> it

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
here but yes I finally managed to get it

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.959 
here but yes I finally managed to get it
to<00:02:01.509> get<00:02:02.509> color<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.899> properly<00:02:03.170> know<00:02:03.319> that<00:02:03.499> so

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
to get color is properly know that so

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.789 
to get color is properly know that so
that's<00:02:04.969> good<00:02:05.149> let's<00:02:05.929> see<00:02:06.049> how<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.200> works<00:02:06.500> on

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
that's good let's see how that works on

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.369 
that's good let's see how that works on
