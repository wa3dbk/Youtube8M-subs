00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
this is pretty dumb when companies do

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.020 
this is pretty dumb when companies do
this<00:07:12.400> and<00:07:12.700> put<00:07:12.880> the<00:07:13.260> power<00:07:14.260> input<00:07:14.830> like<00:07:15.610> way<00:07:15.880> at

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
this and put the power input like way at

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.190 
this and put the power input like way at
the<00:07:16.120> top<00:07:16.270> and<00:07:16.540> sit<00:07:16.630> away<00:07:16.840> at<00:07:16.960> the<00:07:17.050> bottom

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.200 
the top and sit away at the bottom

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.070
