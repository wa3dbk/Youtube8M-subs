00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.270
 revolverlab.com with an eye on technology 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.610
 thank you stylus store for great prices 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.190
 link in the video description 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.320
 colo gg3 is a super distinctive background 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.030
 which characteristic is 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.550
 huge five-layer inch display with 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.770
 ankle resolution and camera with fast 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.240
 laser focusing these 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.650
 two functions complement each other 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.050
 agree we are watching photos 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 made the smartphone most likely the most 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.269
 smartphone we rarely downloaded to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.519
 computer 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.140
 but do it on a huge screen lg g3 with 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.149
 This camera is a pleasure for you 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.670
 probably did not notice anything but this review 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.590
 camera lg g3 we shoot it on camera 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.020
 lg g3 my name is Ivan Guchkov 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 this site revolverlab.com include 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.760
 go first what pays attention 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 lg company talking lg g3 camera 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 This function is touch and shoot. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.000
 banal opportunity to make a quick 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.530
 a photo with a regular tap on the screen would seem 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.750
 what is surprising in this is all 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.399
 smartphones can do it all 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.680
 basic focus this process 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.750
 happens just instant laser 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.030
 Focusing on the smartphone agree 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.890
 sounds like something futuristic though in this 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.570
 no wonder this technology 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.470
 used in different areas 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.430
 for example and most often use diamond 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.310
 what is the diameter 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.369
 that thrust into the metro but what 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.320
 measures the distance 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.840
 no i will call it the distance 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.509
 moments and so how does laser work 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.280
 focusing on the back of the lg g3 smartphone 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.170
 parts of smartphones near the camera is 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.090
 special sensor which is like 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.810
 refers uchida brother to the desired object 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.979
 and returns them back rays of good 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.370
 truth sounds like some religious 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.420
 Nikita will become 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:48.070
 I could see clearly 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.070
 thank you elijie thank you brother this is a miracle 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.350
 amen and yet how do laser work 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.180
 focus after the rays of good 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.070
 got to the object focus 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.990
 returned back to the sensor sensor 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.300
 analyzes the time at which it happened 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.430
 this action is thereby defining 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.170
 distance to the desired object as you already 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.820
 understood the laser has a limitation in 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.010
 range of action therefore lausanne 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.720
 Focus at lg g3 works perfectly 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.670
 at medium and close distances in 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.680
 anyway lausanna i focus 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.360
 lg g3 smartphone gives a huge 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.830
 competitive advantage issue 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.570
 focus compared to other 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.610
 smartphone optical cameras 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.020
 image stabilization was available in 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.570
 lg g2 smartphone 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.250
 natural and left in g3 floating 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.690
 The peephole of the camera of the smartphone is excellent 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.460
 manifests itself while shooting a 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.040
 stabilization improved by 20 percent 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.290
 sometimes even too stabilizes we 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.200
 compared the smooth video shot on lg g3 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.450
 on iphone 5s and galaxy s5 the difference 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.520
 visible to the naked eye I often 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.320
 mentioned came down the camera angle widgets 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.880
 makes great shots and videos 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.220
 despite the fact that it is only 2 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.120
 megapixels to some extent she too 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.160
 studies the rays of good to good all the time 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.840
 actually it was better typing 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.840
 actions are whole video and video stink on and 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.890
 It was 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.160
 Well, we will see the result when we unload 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.290
 these files this is not catch the function under 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.300
 focusing on made height that ran 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.420
 this year samsung has this function 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.550
 galaxy s5 also from htc one m8 thanks 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.190
 the second chamber and also made a 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.019
 function called its magic focus laser 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.120
 autofocus and here manifests itself with the best 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.830
 hand if samsung galaxy s5 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.480
 you have to guess the distance to 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.640
 object and stick to a certain 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.420
 distances then you are already g3 the closer the object 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.519
 all the better 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.590
 achieve bokeh is very simple 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.780
 come close to the object we take a picture 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.670
 and then we specify the focus tap on the screen 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.799
 or control this process when 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.660
 help slider nipples friends us 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.019
 definitely liked the smartphone camera 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.530
 lg g3 i hope you like the review 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.120
 cameras lg g3 shot on camera lg g3 as 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.989
 you see not a movie still is 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.640
 a state of passion blinded by the rays of good 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.799
 the action of the rays of good will end as 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.110
 Only lg g3 you have me so zaberosh 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.500
 return it please back while I 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.840
 left friends talk about photo quality 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.640
 made about the smartphone lg g3 no sense 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.470
 best see for yourself so go 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.359
 the link in the description to this leads to 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.310
 the site there will be all the sample photos 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.380
 made by milo even three over 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.150
 weeks and you can also see them 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.590
 me on Instagram friends if you want 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.570
 so Nikita comes to his normal 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.490
 state please write something in 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.960
 comments for him can then be to 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.850
 he will come to insight, he will return his 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.650
 primitive state will begin to engage 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.479
