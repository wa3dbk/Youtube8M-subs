today's<00:00:03.179> art<00:00:03.480> lesson<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:03.899> just<00:00:04.200> like<00:00:04.380> today's

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
today's art lesson is just like today's

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.730 
today's art lesson is just like today's
first<00:00:04.980> example<00:00:05.520> how<00:00:05.970> do<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.210> draw<00:00:06.390> something

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
first example how do you draw something

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
first example how do you draw something
three-dimensional<00:00:07.740> like<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> building<00:00:08.550> on<00:00:08.700> a

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
three-dimensional like a building on a

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.940 
three-dimensional like a building on a
two-dimensional<00:00:09.420> surface<00:00:09.809> like<00:00:10.320> paper<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
two-dimensional surface like paper and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.129 
two-dimensional surface like paper and
make<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.580> look<00:00:11.730> realistic<00:00:12.090> I'm<00:00:12.690> going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.019> show

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
make it look realistic I'm going to show

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.169 
make it look realistic I'm going to show
you<00:00:13.200> how<00:00:13.469> right<00:00:13.799> now<00:00:13.980> you're<00:00:14.639> going<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.000> need

a pencil a ruler and maybe a permanent
ink<00:00:21.570> pen<00:00:21.779> okay<00:00:22.560> let's<00:00:22.769> get<00:00:22.920> started<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
ink pen okay let's get started so the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.279 
ink pen okay let's get started so the
first<00:00:24.090> thing<00:00:24.390> you're<00:00:24.510> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.080> take

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
first thing you're going to do is take

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.679 
first thing you're going to do is take
your<00:00:25.410> ruler<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.970> goes<00:00:27.119> perfectly

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
your ruler so that it goes perfectly

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.019 
your ruler so that it goes perfectly
horizontal<00:00:28.189> pretty<00:00:29.189> much<00:00:29.400> anywhere<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:30.000> your

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
horizontal pretty much anywhere on your

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.730 
horizontal pretty much anywhere on your
page<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> since<00:00:30.990> we're<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.170> starting<00:00:31.470> out

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
page but I since we're just starting out

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740 
page but I since we're just starting out
I<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> start<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> center<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.059> you're

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
I want to start in the center and you're

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
I want to start in the center and you're
going<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> draw<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> light<00:00:34.469> line<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.010> then

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
going to draw a light line and then

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
going to draw a light line and then
you're<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.180> make<00:00:36.360> something<00:00:36.690> called<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you're going to make something called a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.500 
you're going to make something called a
vanishing<00:00:38.129> point<00:00:38.160> which<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.940> tiny<00:00:39.180> dot

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
vanishing point which is just a tiny dot

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.260 
vanishing point which is just a tiny dot
for<00:00:39.750> right<00:00:39.899> now<00:00:40.050> now<00:00:40.559> let's<00:00:40.770> look<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.100> our

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
for right now now let's look at our

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.340 
for right now now let's look at our
first<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.540> I've<00:00:42.690> been<00:00:42.840> working<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.230> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
first one I've been working on this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.740 
first one I've been working on this
little<00:00:43.620> cartoon<00:00:43.980> page<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.910> vanishing<00:00:45.480> point

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
little cartoon page the vanishing point

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.470 
little cartoon page the vanishing point
on<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> drawing<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.879> actually<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
on a on a drawing is actually the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.479 
on a on a drawing is actually the
furthest<00:00:48.899> point<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.280> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
furthest point that we can see it's so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.990 
furthest point that we can see it's so
far<00:00:50.760> away

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
far away

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.299 
far away
that's<00:00:51.510> where<00:00:51.719> everything<00:00:51.960> vanishes<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that's where everything vanishes so this

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.610 
that's where everything vanishes so this
is<00:00:53.489> our<00:00:53.610> vanishing<00:00:53.940> point<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:55.079> let's<00:00:55.350> start

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
is our vanishing point now let's start

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.549 
is our vanishing point now let's start
with<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> cityscape<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:57.539> next<00:00:58.350> thing<00:00:58.469> you're

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
with a cityscape the next thing you're

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.819 
with a cityscape the next thing you're
going<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:59.039> is<00:01:00.050> start<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.320> dot<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
going to do is start at your dot and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
going to do is start at your dot and
then<00:01:02.129> draw<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> line<00:01:02.670> outward<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.539> doesn't

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
then draw a line outward it doesn't

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
then draw a line outward it doesn't
matter<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.409> slope<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.799> your<00:01:04.979> ruler<00:01:05.309> but

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
matter the slope of your ruler but

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.310 
matter the slope of your ruler but
you're<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.479> repeat<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> other<00:01:07.170> side

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
you're going to repeat on the other side

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
you're going to repeat on the other side
okay<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.040> starts<00:01:11.460> our<00:01:11.670> road<00:01:12.020> then

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
okay and so that starts our road then

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
okay and so that starts our road then
you're<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> exact<00:01:14.610> thing<00:01:14.909> going

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you're going to do the exact thing going

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.179 
you're going to do the exact thing going
the<00:01:15.600> opposite<00:01:15.930> direction<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.560> notice<00:01:16.979> I'm

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the opposite direction and notice I'm

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.550 
the opposite direction and notice I'm
always<00:01:17.520> starting<00:01:18.240> my<00:01:18.390> lines<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
always starting my lines at the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.060 
always starting my lines at the
vanishing<00:01:19.860> point<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> I'm<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> show<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
vanishing point so I'm going to show you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.140 
vanishing point so I'm going to show you
just<00:01:23.460> how<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> draw<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:25.130> simple<00:01:26.130> building<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
just how to draw a simple building to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.539 
just how to draw a simple building to
get<00:01:27.299> started<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.530> buildings<00:01:28.979> go<00:01:29.159> straight<00:01:29.430> up

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
get started so buildings go straight up

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.719 
get started so buildings go straight up
and<00:01:29.700> down<00:01:29.759> we'll<00:01:30.570> start<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> skyscraper

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
and down we'll start with the skyscraper

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.310 
and down we'll start with the skyscraper
kind<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> middle<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.360> our<00:01:33.450> street<00:01:33.509> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
kind of in the middle of our street so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.719 
kind of in the middle of our street so
I'm<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.560> take<00:01:34.710> my<00:01:34.860> ruler<00:01:35.070> make<00:01:35.579> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I'm going to take my ruler make it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.690 
I'm going to take my ruler make it
perfectly<00:01:36.119> vertical<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> draw<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> line<00:01:37.770> then

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
perfectly vertical and draw a line then

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.719 
perfectly vertical and draw a line then
I'm<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> repeat<00:01:40.130> as<00:01:41.130> far<00:01:41.460> away<00:01:41.579> from

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
I'm going to repeat as far away from

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.609 
I'm going to repeat as far away from
that<00:01:42.119> first<00:01:42.360> line<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.899> want<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.290> maybe<00:01:43.500> an

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
that first line as you want so maybe an

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.530 
that first line as you want so maybe an
inch<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> half<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:45.299> draw<00:01:45.509> another

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
inch and a half and then draw another

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.560 
inch and a half and then draw another
line<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.890> starts<00:01:47.250> our<00:01:47.369> building<00:01:47.729> then

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
line and that starts our building then

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
line and that starts our building then
to<00:01:49.110> make<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> side<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> building<00:01:50.310> because

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
to make the side of the building because

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.460 
to make the side of the building because
we're<00:01:50.939> looking<00:01:51.090> down<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.600> road<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.259> we're

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
we're looking down this road like we're

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.660 
we're looking down this road like we're
standing<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.009> middle<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> street

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
standing in the middle of the street

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.910 
standing in the middle of the street
you're<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> find<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> corner<00:01:55.619> where

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you're going to find the corner where

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.100 
you're going to find the corner where
those<00:01:56.100> two<00:01:56.310> lines<00:01:56.460> meet<00:01:56.729> make<00:01:57.630> our<00:01:57.810> ruler

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
those two lines meet make our ruler

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.170 
those two lines meet make our ruler
horizontal<00:01:58.829> or<00:01:59.009> perfectly<00:01:59.460> parallel<00:01:59.729> with

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
horizontal or perfectly parallel with

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.289 
horizontal or perfectly parallel with
our<00:02:00.360> first<00:02:01.170> line<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.680> draw<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> edge<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
our first line and draw the edge and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.060 
our first line and draw the edge and
then<00:02:03.540> you're<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> repeat<00:02:04.229> at<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.890> top

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
then you're going to repeat at the top

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.630 
then you're going to repeat at the top
and<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.640> use<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:05.909> ruler<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:07.429> just<00:02:08.429> kind

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and you can use your ruler or just kind

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.279 
and you can use your ruler or just kind
of<00:02:08.729> eyeball<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.450> call<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.750> which<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.020> just

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
of eyeball it we call it which is just

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.250 
of eyeball it we call it which is just
making<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.099> look<00:02:11.250> right

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
making it look right

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.009 
making it look right
then<00:02:12.819> once<00:02:13.819> we<00:02:14.030> have<00:02:14.060> our<00:02:14.239> building<00:02:14.659> started

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
then once we have our building started

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.100 
then once we have our building started
you<00:02:15.140> can<00:02:15.349> go<00:02:15.500> back<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.390> erase<00:02:17.390> some<00:02:17.659> of<00:02:17.959> your

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
you can go back and erase some of your

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.369 
you can go back and erase some of your
lines<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.680> now<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.720> have<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> start<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.200> my

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
lines and so now I have the start of my

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.640 
lines and so now I have the start of my
building<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.689> on<00:02:26.689> buildings<00:02:27.260> we're<00:02:27.439> probably

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
building and on buildings we're probably

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.440 
building and on buildings we're probably
going<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.920> find<00:02:28.099> some<00:02:28.340> doors<00:02:28.579> and<00:02:28.790> windows<00:02:29.090> so

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
going to find some doors and windows so

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.449 
going to find some doors and windows so
how<00:02:29.659> do<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:29.870> add<00:02:30.019> those<00:02:30.260> you're<00:02:31.159> going<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.370> go

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
how do we add those you're going to go

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.920 
how do we add those you're going to go
back<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.819> your<00:02:31.940> vanishing<00:02:32.299> line<00:02:32.659> and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
back to your vanishing line and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.520 
back to your vanishing line and
everything<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.760> put<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.319> side<00:02:36.500> of

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
everything that you put on the side of

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.559 
everything that you put on the side of
your<00:02:36.680> building<00:02:36.829> is<00:02:37.159> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.489> line<00:02:37.790> up<00:02:37.819> with

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
your building is going to line up with

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.300 
your building is going to line up with
that<00:02:38.599> vanishing<00:02:39.440> line<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.920> top<00:02:40.099> of<00:02:40.129> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
that vanishing line so the top of the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.059 
that vanishing line so the top of the
door<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:41.359> need<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.540> little<00:02:41.930> I'm<00:02:42.739> just<00:02:42.799> going<00:02:43.010> to

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
door we need a little I'm just going to

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.390 
door we need a little I'm just going to
make<00:02:43.189> a<00:02:43.220> little<00:02:43.370> half-inch<00:02:43.790> mark<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.569> then

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
make a little half-inch mark and then

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.640 
make a little half-inch mark and then
the<00:02:46.400> sides<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.090> door<00:02:47.299> will<00:02:48.140> come<00:02:48.319> straight

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
the sides of the door will come straight

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.360 
the sides of the door will come straight
down<00:02:48.680> vertically<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:50.450> there's<00:02:50.659> our<00:02:50.810> door<00:02:51.079> now

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
down vertically so there's our door now

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.520 
down vertically so there's our door now
windows<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.670> same<00:02:52.909> rule<00:02:53.180> applies<00:02:53.569> come<00:02:53.930> find

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
windows the same rule applies come find

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.879 
windows the same rule applies come find
your<00:02:54.709> vanishing<00:02:55.040> point<00:02:55.430> again<00:02:56.260> draw<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> light

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
your vanishing point again draw a light

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.289 
your vanishing point again draw a light
line<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.609> you<00:02:59.480> can<00:02:59.510> kind<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.819> hand<00:03:01.819> draw<00:03:02.030> some

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
line and you can kind of hand draw some

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.140 
line and you can kind of hand draw some
of<00:03:02.420> these<00:03:02.650> elements<00:03:03.650> that's<00:03:04.489> what<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:04.730> did<00:03:05.000> to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
of these elements that's what I did to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.500 
of these elements that's what I did to
my<00:03:05.379> drawing<00:03:06.379> to<00:03:07.129> make<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.430> more<00:03:07.549> cartoony<00:03:08.090> so

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
my drawing to make it more cartoony so

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.449 
my drawing to make it more cartoony so
there's<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.870> big<00:03:09.470> window<00:03:09.829> and<00:03:10.129> I'm<00:03:10.280> going<00:03:10.430> to

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
there's a big window and I'm going to

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.420 
there's a big window and I'm going to
just<00:03:10.670> draw<00:03:10.909> the<00:03:10.970> parallel<00:03:11.359> lines<00:03:11.750> again<00:03:12.430> but

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
just draw the parallel lines again but

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.160 
just draw the parallel lines again but
then<00:03:13.579> if<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.819> want<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.239> have<00:03:14.359> panes<00:03:14.690> then

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
then if you want it to have panes then

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.479 
then if you want it to have panes then
you<00:03:15.290> need<00:03:15.470> those<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.920> line<00:03:16.040> up<00:03:16.190> with<00:03:16.220> your

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
you need those to line up with your

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.270 
you need those to line up with your
vanishing<00:03:16.819> point<00:03:17.329> as<00:03:17.620> well<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.069> you're

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
vanishing point as well so you're

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.930 
vanishing point as well so you're
learning<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:20.150> when<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.049> use<00:03:21.349> a<00:03:21.849> when<00:03:22.849> you

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
learning that when you use a when you

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.909 
learning that when you use a when you
draw<00:03:23.120> in<00:03:23.269> perspective<00:03:23.449> the<00:03:24.049> vanishing<00:03:24.650> point

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
draw in perspective the vanishing point

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.119 
draw in perspective the vanishing point
is<00:03:25.099> everything<00:03:25.669> okay<00:03:26.329> so<00:03:27.139> then<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.889> fun<00:03:28.099> part

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
is everything okay so then the fun part

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.369 
is everything okay so then the fun part
you<00:03:28.579> can<00:03:28.730> color<00:03:29.000> your<00:03:29.180> buildings<00:03:29.599> whatever

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
you can color your buildings whatever

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.720 
you can color your buildings whatever
you<00:03:30.530> want<00:03:30.769> I'm<00:03:31.370> using<00:03:31.879> these<00:03:32.260> super<00:03:33.260> cool

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
you want I'm using these super cool

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.979 
you want I'm using these super cool
brush<00:03:34.730> markers<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.389> are<00:03:35.449> almost<00:03:35.810> like

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
brush markers that are almost like

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.659 
brush markers that are almost like
painting<00:03:36.260> with<00:03:36.410> watercolor<00:03:37.099> and<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:40.489> can

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
painting with watercolor and you can

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:45.189 
painting with watercolor and you can
color<00:03:40.910> your<00:03:41.000> whole<00:03:41.299> building<00:03:41.889> and<00:03:44.169> you<00:03:45.169> can

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
color your whole building and you can

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.379 
color your whole building and you can
add<00:03:45.530> some<00:03:45.799> shading<00:03:46.099> let's<00:03:46.519> jump<00:03:46.730> over<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.090> my

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
add some shading let's jump over to my

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.599 
add some shading let's jump over to my
finished<00:03:48.139> example<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:48.799> I<00:03:48.829> can<00:03:49.040> show<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.400> few

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
you can come in here you can add a

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.689 
you can come in here you can add a
little<00:03:57.169> bit<00:03:57.290> more<00:03:57.409> to<00:03:57.799> your<00:03:57.829> road<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.549> more

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
little bit more to your road the more

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.220 
little bit more to your road the more
layers<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.209> build<00:03:59.419> up<00:03:59.540> with<00:03:59.690> these<00:03:59.780> markers

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
layers you build up with these markers

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.470 
layers you build up with these markers
the<00:04:00.470> darker<00:04:00.859> it<00:04:00.980> gets<00:04:01.159> but<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:01.909> okay<00:04:02.239> if<00:04:02.359> it

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
the darker it gets but it's okay if it

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.710 
the darker it gets but it's okay if it
looks<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.840> little<00:04:02.959> bit<00:04:03.609> brushy<00:04:04.609> we<00:04:05.329> would<00:04:05.510> say

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
looks a little bit brushy we would say

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.409 
looks a little bit brushy we would say
with<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.139> marker<00:04:06.949> texture<00:04:07.430> because<00:04:07.849> it's

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
with that marker texture because it's

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.270 
with that marker texture because it's
handmade<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.019> it's<00:04:09.229> a<00:04:09.319> cartoon<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.949> it<00:04:10.099> looks

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
handmade and it's a cartoon and it looks

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.640 
handmade and it's a cartoon and it looks
really<00:04:10.519> cool<00:04:10.669> and<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.930> could<00:04:11.989> add<00:04:12.260> some<00:04:12.500> little

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
really cool and I could add some little

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.460 
really cool and I could add some little
green<00:04:12.949> Zing's<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.909> my<00:04:14.949> flies<00:04:15.949> that<00:04:16.340> are

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
green Zing's to my flies that are

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.670 
green Zing's to my flies that are
protecting<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.650> city<00:04:19.930> so<00:04:20.930> anything<00:04:21.469> goes

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
protecting the city so anything goes

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.290 
protecting the city so anything goes
with<00:04:21.979> perspective<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.639> just<00:04:22.669> remember<00:04:23.180> the

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
with perspective and just remember the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.120 
with perspective and just remember the
closer<00:04:23.599> to<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:24.080> vanishing<00:04:24.500> point<00:04:24.650> the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
closer to the vanishing point the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.110 
closer to the vanishing point the
farther<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.639> looks

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
farther it looks

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.760 
farther it looks
way<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.479> when<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:26.960> work<00:04:27.199> in<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.440> foreground

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
way and when you work in the foreground

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.650 
way and when you work in the foreground
those<00:04:28.550> are<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.880> things<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.180> are<00:04:29.360> near

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
those are the things that are near

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.100 
those are the things that are near
that's<00:04:30.350> perspective
