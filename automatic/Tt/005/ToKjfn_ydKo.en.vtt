00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.550
 carefree bird in the street got cold and 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.740
 the wind blew out 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:39.860
 autumn came going for a walk 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:43.879
 musti put on his coat and hat oh cold 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:53.190
 leaves circling fall to the ground 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:54.739
 interestingly thought bunny who is there this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.610
 august 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.220
 hello little bridge what's new 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.619
 especial i just thought maybe you 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.670
 you want to walk with me wait 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.229
 just a minute I'll just take the carrot now 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.550
 come back when the sun for a while 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.610
 peeking out from behind the clouds 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:27.030
 let the rabbit rejoice at it 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:34.500
 warm little ray see rabbit birds 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.090
 flew south south where it legs 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.840
 warmer climes 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.179
 because we will soon come winter and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.630
 migratory birds do not bring cold under 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:50.520
 snow they could not find food and I 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.060
 I love snow and my hole is already full of carrots 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.569
 and turnips 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.709
 enough for the whole winter right some 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:01.369
 animals keep stock for the winter 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.369
 squirrels gather acorns 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.130
 hedgehogs 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.130
 looking for apples 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:20.610
 and the turtle sleeps all winter in a secluded 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:25.290
 corner of aha and birds means flies look 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:31.470
 pebbles and it's probably lost by spending 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:34.050
 bird you lost that but you 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:44.030
 stayed here all alone why didn't you 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:44.030
 flew away to warm lands like other birds i 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.250
 I understand, but winter will come soon 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.940
 you know about it and what about him 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.860
 it is snowing under snow not finding food of the field 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:05.340
 stand empty 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.340
 there are no berries in the trees 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:27.640
 no yoga are you right from hunger and thirst 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.970
 because the water will freeze and turn 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:44.650
 in ice is cold and hard as a stone 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:50.510
 it won't be able to break with a beak awful 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:53.359
 I think it's refreshing and where will you be 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.269
 sleep for you yours but ice and 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:59.439
 with snow and at night you will tremble from 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.439
 cold freezing 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.900
 is it true yes birdie 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:11.629
 it always happens in winter in that case I 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:21.550
 I will not stay in the hot edges 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:24.550
 other birds see you bye till 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.550
 of spring 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:37.090
 we really helped the birds really suit 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.090
 before the rabbit is for sure 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.669
 but
