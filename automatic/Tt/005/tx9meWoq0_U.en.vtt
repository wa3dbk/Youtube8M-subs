00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.019
 lÃ¼ jia of breast augmentation with mittens 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.999
 of increase with systems put them 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.130
 most of the time behind the 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.830
 muscle 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.550
 these breast implants there are many 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.720
 brands and there 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.880
 and many brothers that are let's say 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.890
 married to certain trademarks 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.689
 the idea is to operate with surgeons who 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.280
 have good knowledge of 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.930
 procedures and breast implants 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.930
 that they are going to use are the dishes 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.850
 preferably it seems to me with that of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.470
 fedea because nowadays it does not 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.530
 it seems that it was working very 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.530
 all right 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.699
 the incisions that are used to 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.829
 address this surgery are several 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.049
 possibilities when the breasts are not 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.120
 fallen the decision is very tiny and it 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.009
 locates in the areola has a form 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.259
 as this one is very small usually the 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.539
 scar almost not seen is a 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.350
 Short surgery does not last more than 40 to 50 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.880
 minutes 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.720
 obviously it must be done with anesthesia 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.070
 general 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.230
 in the results of this surgery 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.820
 they are usually quick and the disability 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.820
 It's short 45 days 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.310
 and prostheses or breast implants 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.010
 adequate let's say there's a lot 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.260
 controversy about what is ideal but 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.070
 with the advent of the problem of 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.070
 pib implants 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.900
 you have to look implants are that 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.390
 have a regulation and the entities 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.190
 who are in charge of regulating in the world 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.020
 whole because they have failed that we are 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.509
 seeing here in colombia what we are 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.100
 seeing in france and france has a 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.150
 entity that will rectify itself when regulating 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.150
 the implants 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.880
 at this moment entities that are 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.210
 regulating in a proper way that I 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.430
 know 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.930
 They have enough resources 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.640
 to take a plant and see if 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.160
 really the silicone that you have in your 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.440
 interior is adequate in that order of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.880
 ideas you have to search enter the page 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.920
 of the disease and see what implant are 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.480
 the tests 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.410
 the instrument there are only two 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.410
 approved implants 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.049
 risks of surgery like all surgery 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.520
 are always minimal when one meets 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.280
 with the requirement 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.800
 they are usually anesthesiologists in infor 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.570
 this is reported if the anesthesiologist 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.890
 gives us permission to really operate the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.460
 Risks are minimal 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.130
 this is a criminal 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.800
 be healthy and should be operated as 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.140
 I 've always known plastic one 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.790
 clinic 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.990
 if one meets those requirements the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.470
 chance has a complication and 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.470
 Really 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.670
 at the moment there is no consensus about 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.460
 exactly what is the time they last 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.130
 the implants 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.350
 but the recommendation of the gpda is that 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.540
 more or less before 1 year you should start 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.290
 to think about the review that consists 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.060
 simply removing the implant has been 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.440
 demonstrated that by the tenth year 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.060
 increase the possibility that there 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.040
 a break or they start to have 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.540
 problems and for this reason in this 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.570
 moment is talking about 10 years is 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.610
 possible that in the near future are 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.160
 let's say it's a longer time with that 14 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.930
 years but at the moment they are 10 years old 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.930
 there are implants that last a lifetime
