the inside of the box there it takes
about<00:01:32.880> maybe<00:01:33.840> 15<00:01:34.650> seconds<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.189> set<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:35.549> let's

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
about maybe 15 seconds to set up let's

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.520 
about maybe 15 seconds to set up let's
talk<00:01:36.329> about<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.720> construction<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
talk about the construction of the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.920 
talk about the construction of the
controller<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.970> really<00:01:39.479> tough<00:01:39.750> on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
controller I'm really really tough on

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.069 
controller I'm really really tough on
controllers<00:01:40.590> obviously<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.909> set<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.299> i

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
controllers obviously this is set up i

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.289 
controllers obviously this is set up i
would<00:01:43.350> say<00:01:43.680> Xbox<00:01:44.189> style<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
would say Xbox style so you have the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.020 
would say Xbox style so you have the
offset<00:01:46.079> joy<00:01:46.350> pads<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.310> d-pad<00:01:47.729> down

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
offset joy pads there the d-pad down

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.319 
offset joy pads there the d-pad down
here<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.189> good<00:01:50.460> quality

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
here and a really really good quality

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.539 
here and a really really good quality
controller<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.110> was<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.649> surprised<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.430> how

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
controller I was really surprised at how

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.270 
controller I was really surprised at how
light<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:55.200> paper<00:01:55.470> light<00:01:55.890> for

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
light it is it is just paper light for

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.399 
light it is it is just paper light for
controller<00:01:56.790> obviously<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.869> has<00:01:58.110> no

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
controller obviously because it has no

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.209 
controller obviously because it has no
vibrate<00:01:59.040> function<00:02:00.079> simply<00:02:01.369> put<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.890> sink

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
vibrate function simply put to the sink

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.300 
vibrate function simply put to the sink
there's<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.850> couple<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.270> buttons<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.899> know

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
can come in here and set it to your a or

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.089 
can come in here and set it to your a or
your<00:02:11.030> V<00:02:11.239> mode<00:02:11.569> in<00:02:11.870> case<00:02:12.410> there's<00:02:12.680> multiple

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
your V mode in case there's multiple

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.699 
your V mode in case there's multiple
people<00:02:13.400> playing<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.060> area<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:15.470> going<00:02:15.650> to

people playing in the area it's going to

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.500 
people playing in the area it's going to
start<00:02:15.920> flashing<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.819> will<00:02:16.940> connect<00:02:17.390> to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
start flashing and it will connect to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.150 
start flashing and it will connect to
any<00:02:18.050> device<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:19.310> have<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.670> set<00:02:19.700> up<00:02:19.910> for
