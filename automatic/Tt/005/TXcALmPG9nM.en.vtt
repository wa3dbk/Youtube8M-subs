well<00:00:38.930> I<00:00:38.960> think<00:00:39.490> the<00:00:40.490> the<00:00:40.520> success<00:00:41.390> of<00:00:41.600> such<00:00:41.810> a

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
well I think the the success of such a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.569 
well I think the the success of such a
program<00:00:42.350> is<00:00:42.760> definitely<00:00:44.860> led<00:00:45.860> by<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.130> by<00:00:46.520> the

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
program is definitely led by the by the

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.120 
program is definitely led by the by the
by<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:47.030> managers<00:00:47.600> that's<00:00:48.410> coming<00:00:48.739> from<00:00:48.950> the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
by the managers that's coming from the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.670 
by the managers that's coming from the
from<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.610> head<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:49.850> has<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.180> be<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.329> a<00:00:50.780> personal

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
from the head it has to be a a personal

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.110 
from the head it has to be a a personal
commitment<00:00:51.920> has<00:00:52.399> to<00:00:52.550> be<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.700> personal

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
commitment has to be a personal

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.790 
commitment has to be a personal
engagement<00:00:53.810> otherwise<00:00:54.170> doesn't<00:00:54.649> work

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
engagement otherwise doesn't work

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.310 
engagement otherwise doesn't work
however<00:00:55.640> having<00:00:56.149> said<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.450> it's<00:00:56.840> not<00:00:57.020> only<00:00:57.200> a

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
however having said that it's not only a

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.380 
however having said that it's not only a
one-man<00:00:57.800> show<00:00:58.040> I<00:00:58.070> mean<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:58.370> consider<00:00:58.820> myself<00:00:59.000> as

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
one-man show I mean I consider myself as

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.479 
one-man show I mean I consider myself as
a<00:00:59.420> conductor<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.260> I<00:01:00.739> have<00:01:00.950> all<00:01:01.130> the<00:01:01.280> musicians

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
a conductor and I have all the musicians

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.819 
a conductor and I have all the musicians
playing<00:01:02.090> up<00:01:02.300> there<00:01:02.809> partition<00:01:03.320> I<00:01:03.469> think<00:01:03.649> it's

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
playing up there partition I think it's

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.789 
playing up there partition I think it's
how<00:01:04.309> I<00:01:04.339> would<00:01:04.640> define<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.299> role<00:01:05.509> of<00:01:05.540> off<00:01:05.899> of<00:01:06.500> a

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
how I would define the role of off of a

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.890 
how I would define the role of off of a
GM<00:01:07.070> in<00:01:07.189> a<00:01:07.280> hotel<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.850> in<00:01:08.420> this<00:01:08.570> particular

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
GM in a hotel and in this particular

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.740 
GM in a hotel and in this particular
case<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:09.530> was<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.740> really<00:01:10.100> like<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.750> multi-level

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
case it was a really like a multi-level

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.440 
case it was a really like a multi-level
program<00:01:12.229> we<00:01:12.799> had<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.400> lot<00:01:13.610> of<00:01:13.729> commitments<00:01:14.299> from

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
program we had a lot of commitments from

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.750 
program we had a lot of commitments from
many<00:01:14.960> colleagues<00:01:15.430> starting<00:01:16.430> from<00:01:16.610> the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
many colleagues starting from the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.190 
many colleagues starting from the
engineering<00:01:17.150> of<00:01:17.420> course<00:01:17.659> because<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.020> have<00:01:18.170> a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
engineering of course because you have a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
engineering of course because you have a
lot<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.560> technical<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.950> technicality<00:01:21.950> about

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
lot of technical and technicality about

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.320 
lot of technical and technicality about
it<00:01:22.479> but<00:01:23.479> also<00:01:23.659> about<00:01:23.990> human<00:01:24.350> resource<00:01:24.860> about

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
it but also about human resource about

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.370 
it but also about human resource about
operations<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.510> think<00:01:26.720> it's<00:01:26.869> very<00:01:26.990> important

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
operations I think it's very important

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.039 
operations I think it's very important
that<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.650> all<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.909> people<00:01:29.210> relating<00:01:29.780> to

housekeeping culinary services etc also
involved<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:34.369> particular<00:01:34.880> program

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
involved in this particular program

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.480 
involved in this particular program
otherwise<00:01:35.750> doesn't<00:01:36.049> work<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.619> believe<00:01:37.460> I

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
otherwise doesn't work I believe I

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.190

strongly<00:01:37.820> believe<00:01:38.119> that<00:01:38.150> today<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.810> main

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
strongly believe that today the main

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.219 
strongly believe that today the main
problem<00:01:40.189> is<00:01:40.340> water<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.030> we're<00:01:41.570> working<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:42.020> lot

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
problem is water so we're working a lot

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.830 
problem is water so we're working a lot
on<00:01:42.500> water<00:01:43.430> protection<00:01:43.700> we're<00:01:44.210> working<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.689> lot

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
on water protection we're working a lot

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.080 
on water protection we're working a lot
on<00:01:45.110> how<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.409> make<00:01:46.159> sure<00:01:46.369> that<00:01:46.520> we<00:01:46.700> don't<00:01:46.909> waste

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
on how to make sure that we don't waste

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.480 
on how to make sure that we don't waste
it<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:47.500> for<00:01:48.500> such<00:01:48.710> what<00:01:48.950> we've<00:01:49.130> done<00:01:49.280> we've

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
it and for such what we've done we've

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.969 
it and for such what we've done we've
implemented<00:01:50.180> of<00:01:50.479> course<00:01:50.720> those<00:01:50.979> water

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
implemented of course those water

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.020 
implemented of course those water
reduction<00:01:52.610> water<00:01:52.790> reducer<00:01:53.479> in<00:01:53.689> in<00:01:53.990> terms<00:01:54.229> of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
reduction water reducer in in terms of

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.160 
reduction water reducer in in terms of
consumption<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:57.320> all<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.680> activities<00:01:58.220> are

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
consumption and all the activities are

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.820 
consumption and all the activities are
going<00:01:59.860> along<00:02:00.460> with<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:01.320> successes<00:02:02.320> was<00:02:02.590> I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
going along with it successes was I

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.590 
going along with it successes was I
think<00:02:03.280> one<00:02:03.430> of<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.640> successes<00:02:03.820> because<00:02:04.420> this

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
think one of the successes because this

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.260 
think one of the successes because this
hotel<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:05.020> only<00:02:05.170> Yana<00:02:05.439> half<00:02:05.710> hold<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.310> we<00:02:07.060> have

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
hotel is only Yana half hold and we have

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.630 
hotel is only Yana half hold and we have
managed<00:02:07.689> to<00:02:07.899> introduce<00:02:08.110> from<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.890> opening<00:02:09.340> so

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
managed to introduce from the opening so

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.070 
managed to introduce from the opening so
meaning<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.179> was<00:02:10.360> planned<00:02:10.720> from<00:02:10.989> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
meaning that it was planned from the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.630 
meaning that it was planned from the
from<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:13.200> before<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.410> opening<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:15.130> had<00:02:15.400> this

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
from the before the opening we had this

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.510 
from the before the opening we had this
this<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.450> control<00:02:16.959> in<00:02:17.440> control<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> system

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
this in control in control is a system

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.000 
this in control in control is a system
that's<00:02:18.730> gonna<00:02:18.989> detect<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.290> presence<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.860> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
that's gonna detect the presence of a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.210 
that's gonna detect the presence of a
customer<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.580> yet<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.209> room<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:23.410> that

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
customer and yet in the room so that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.870 
customer and yet in the room so that
will<00:02:24.489> adapt<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.360> AC<00:02:25.980> Co<00:02:26.980> MV<00:02:27.340> electricity

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
will adapt the AC Co MV electricity

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.640 
will adapt the AC Co MV electricity
consumption<00:02:28.300> according<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.110> presence<00:02:29.500> in

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
consumption according to the presence in

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.340 
consumption according to the presence in
the<00:02:29.830> room<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.540> will<00:02:31.540> automatically

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
the room and that will automatically

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.070 
the room and that will automatically
announce<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.160> AC<00:02:33.510> where<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.690> guest<00:02:34.900> is

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
announce the AC where the guest is

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.140 
announce the AC where the guest is
coming<00:02:35.319> in<00:02:35.560> meaning<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.370> when<00:02:36.610> he<00:02:36.700> goes<00:02:36.880> out

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
coming in meaning that when he goes out

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.970 
coming in meaning that when he goes out
it<00:02:37.480> will<00:02:38.110> automatically<00:02:38.799> reduce<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
it will automatically reduce the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.229 
it will automatically reduce the
electricity<00:02:41.980> consumption<00:02:42.340> will<00:02:42.670> stop<00:02:43.000> and

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
electricity consumption will stop and

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.210 
electricity consumption will stop and
when<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.870> comes<00:02:44.019> in<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.500> will<00:02:44.560> automatically

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
when it comes in it will automatically

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.039 
when it comes in it will automatically
detect<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.819> presence<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.390> customer<00:02:46.870> and

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
detect the presence of the customer and

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.580 
detect the presence of the customer and
goes<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.769> again<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.350> big

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
goes on again so this is this is a big

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.830 
goes on again so this is this is a big
investment<00:02:51.010> when<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.430> when<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:51.970> starts<00:02:52.360> but

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
investment when is when it starts but

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.880 
investment when is when it starts but
then<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.410> return<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.830> investment

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
then you have the return on investment

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.440 
then you have the return on investment
on<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.519> years<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.819> I<00:02:54.910> think<00:02:55.120> it's<00:02:55.239> going<00:02:55.420> to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
on the years and I think it's going to

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.360 
on the years and I think it's going to
be<00:02:55.540> like<00:02:55.690> around<00:02:56.049> two<00:02:56.560> two<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.890> half<00:02:57.069> years

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
be like around two two and a half years

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.600 
be like around two two and a half years
now<00:02:58.200> talking<00:02:59.200> about<00:02:59.410> water<00:02:59.830> consumption<00:03:00.340> and

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
now talking about water consumption and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.539 
now talking about water consumption and
water<00:03:01.090> reduction<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.840> flow<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.250> return

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
water reduction the flow the the return

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.660 
water reduction the flow the the return
on<00:03:03.670> investment<00:03:03.700> was<00:03:04.180> done<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:04.570> six<00:03:04.840> months<00:03:05.670> so

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
on investment was done on six months so

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.310 
on investment was done on six months so
that's<00:03:06.970> that's<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.359> calculation<00:03:07.840> we've<00:03:08.140> done

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
that's that's a calculation we've done

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.930 
that's that's a calculation we've done
and<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.620> next<00:03:08.650> project<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.430> that's<00:03:09.579> gonna<00:03:09.730> be

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
and the next project and that's gonna be

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.940 
and the next project and that's gonna be
on<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.870> before<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.320> end<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.739> year

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
on the on the before the end of the year

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.780 
on the on the before the end of the year
we<00:03:12.549> are<00:03:12.579> we<00:03:13.120> are<00:03:13.150> going<00:03:13.840> into<00:03:14.400> converting<00:03:15.400> all

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
we are we are going into converting all

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.289 
we are we are going into converting all
our<00:03:16.200> traditional<00:03:17.200> herbs<00:03:17.560> into<00:03:17.890> LED<00:03:18.400> lamps<00:03:18.760> so

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
our traditional herbs into LED lamps so

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.630 
our traditional herbs into LED lamps so
that's<00:03:19.480> again<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.200> huge<00:03:20.440> investment<00:03:20.799> we<00:03:21.579> are

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
that's again a huge investment we are

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.250 
that's again a huge investment we are
finalizing<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.450> figures<00:03:22.750> but<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.930> would<00:03:23.109> say

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
finalizing the figures but I would say

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.740 
finalizing the figures but I would say
that<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> year<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.310> few<00:03:24.940> months<00:03:25.269> should<00:03:25.630> be

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
that a year and few months should be

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.240 
that a year and few months should be
enough<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.780> have<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.049> return<00:03:29.320> if<00:03:30.130> I

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
enough to to to have the return if I

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.699 
enough to to to have the return if I
have<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.459> long<00:03:30.730> term<00:03:30.940> vision<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.570> would<00:03:32.140> say<00:03:32.470> that

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
have a long term vision I would say that

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.340 
have a long term vision I would say that
hotels<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.730> whatever<00:03:34.000> industry<00:03:34.750> has<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.170> have

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
hotels and whatever industry has to have

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.140 
hotels and whatever industry has to have
a<00:03:35.380> covered<00:03:35.799> footprint<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.700> inner<00:03:36.850> inner

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
a covered footprint in the inner inner

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.550 
a covered footprint in the inner inner
country<00:03:37.510> but<00:03:38.260> my<00:03:39.190> aim<00:03:39.579> would<00:03:40.030> be<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.510> try<00:03:41.500> to

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
country but my aim would be to try to

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.610 
country but my aim would be to try to
compensate<00:03:41.950> this<00:03:42.519> carbon<00:03:42.880> footprint<00:03:43.329> by<00:03:43.630> the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
compensate this carbon footprint by the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.620 
compensate this carbon footprint by the
use<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.280> customers<00:03:45.850> I'll<00:03:46.209> give<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.540> an

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
use of the customers I'll give you an

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.120 
use of the customers I'll give you an
example<00:03:46.720> if<00:03:47.230> we<00:03:47.350> have<00:03:47.500> for<00:03:47.650> example<00:03:47.709> a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
example if we have for example a

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.910 
example if we have for example a
customer<00:03:48.340> staying<00:03:48.850> with<00:03:49.030> us<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.390> spending<00:03:50.350> a

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
customer staying with us and spending a

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.050 
customer staying with us and spending a
given<00:03:51.730> amount<00:03:52.510> of<00:03:52.690> money<00:03:53.489> we<00:03:54.489> should<00:03:54.790> have

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
given amount of money we should have

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.629 
given amount of money we should have
also<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.540> possibility<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:56.500> give<00:03:57.250> him<00:03:57.459> the

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
also the possibility to give him the

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.460 
also the possibility to give him the
chance<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:58.030> compensate<00:03:58.900> his<00:03:59.079> carbon

would<00:04:06.609> be<00:04:06.639> no<00:04:06.910> tourism<00:04:07.180> there<00:04:07.599> would<00:04:07.720> be<00:04:07.750> no

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
would be no tourism there would be no

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.619 
would be no tourism there would be no
revenue<00:04:08.799> there<00:04:08.980> would<00:04:09.099> be<00:04:09.129> no<00:04:09.400> income<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.480> we

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
revenue there would be no income so we

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.700 
revenue there would be no income so we
need<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:10.959> have<00:04:11.170> this<00:04:11.319> this<00:04:11.500> is

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
need to have this this is

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.650 
need to have this this is
necessary<00:04:12.310> impact<00:04:12.970> will<00:04:13.210> have<00:04:13.330> to<00:04:13.480> have

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
necessary impact will have to have

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.340 
necessary impact will have to have
however<00:04:14.350> we<00:04:15.250> could<00:04:15.520> have<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:16.150> compensation<00:04:17.020> of

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
however we could have a compensation of

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.850 
however we could have a compensation of
our<00:04:17.650> carbon<00:04:18.040> footprint<00:04:18.460> by<00:04:18.780> reintroducing

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
our carbon footprint by reintroducing

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.460 
our carbon footprint by reintroducing
for<00:04:20.860> example<00:04:21.370> plants<00:04:21.790> and<00:04:22.000> one<00:04:22.660> of<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.990> one<00:04:23.440> of

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
for example plants and one of the one of

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.810 
for example plants and one of the one of
the<00:04:23.680> program<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:24.130> had<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.400> my<00:04:24.520> previous

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
the program I had in my previous

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.690 
the program I had in my previous
destination<00:04:25.420> in<00:04:25.570> Doha<00:04:25.840> was<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.200> tie<00:04:26.410> a

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
destination in Doha was to tie a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.450 
destination in Doha was to tie a
relationship<00:04:27.700> with<00:04:28.980> sustainable<00:04:29.980> companies

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
relationship with sustainable companies

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.850 
relationship with sustainable companies
and<00:04:30.700> in<00:04:30.910> Qatar<00:04:31.180> Foundation<00:04:31.390> at<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.960> time<00:04:32.170> to

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
and in Qatar Foundation at that time to

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.320 
and in Qatar Foundation at that time to
reintroduce<00:04:33.810> mangrove<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.910> most<00:04:37.150> we

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
reintroduce mangrove so the most we

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.730 
reintroduce mangrove so the most we
consume<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.170> more<00:04:38.320> we<00:04:38.530> would

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
consume and the more we would

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.190 
consume and the more we would
reintroduce<00:04:39.460> mangrove<00:04:40.270> in<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:40.720> country<00:04:41.050> and

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
reintroduce mangrove in the country and

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.740 
reintroduce mangrove in the country and
here<00:04:41.380> we<00:04:41.500> have<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.830> set<00:04:42.460> maybe<00:04:43.090> an<00:04:43.330> endemic

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
here we have to set maybe an endemic

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.110 
here we have to set maybe an endemic
plant<00:04:44.110> or<00:04:44.380> something<00:04:45.250> that<00:04:45.520> would<00:04:45.730> compensate

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
plant or something that would compensate

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.460 
plant or something that would compensate
the<00:04:46.570> consumption<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.260> our<00:04:47.460> carbon
