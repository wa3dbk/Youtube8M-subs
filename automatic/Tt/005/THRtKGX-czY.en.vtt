00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.560
 They call it a crawl 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.800
 I say love 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 It's the only way I have 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.840
 Paper, 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.420
 He made concessions but kept out of his reach 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.860
 I know the name of your mother and your father 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.220
 And the first pet kept him 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.360
 Know your favorite place to dine when you receive your pay every week 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.600
 Know that you are washing your clothes on Sundays and that you are separating the linens 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.480
 Your car needs a new frame because I put those nails last week 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.400
 I have a million Polaroid pictures and the date of each picture is written in red ink 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.520
 I quietly sneak into your room to hear you sleep 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.760
 You do not know this yet but you love me and I love you likewise 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.620
 Someday we'll get a nice wedding and I'll be all for you 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.480
 We will be together, for ever, we will never diverge 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.720
 Oh, you do not know this yet, darling, but I already have your heart 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.180
 Some say about him tracking, 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.680
 I say he walked only close to the back 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.900
 I am sure that if I sat and asked you, I would not really mind 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.700
 You have those eyes that drive me crazy, 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880
 I have these eyes to watch you sleep 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.900
 I brought a lunch box and some coffee for my watch (for you) on your tree 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.620
 Outside your home (ssh) 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.860
 I have to be quiet like a mouse or call the police 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.000
 My order will end for a ridiculous reason like peace 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.860
 And piece by piece I gather all the things you leave behind 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.020
 And when I do not do I dig through your trash can to see what I can find 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.240
 You do not know this yet but you love me and I love you likewise 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.220
 Someday we'll get a nice wedding and I'll be all for you 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.580
 We'll be together 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.940
 Forever 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.180
 We will never diverge 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.440
 Oh, you do not know this yet, darling, but I already have your heart 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.740
 You do not know this yet but you love me 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.540
 I love you likewise 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.420
 Someday we'll get a nice wedding and I'll be all for you 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940
 We'll be together 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.700
 Forever 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.440
 We will never be divided 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.140
 Oh, you do not know this yet, darling, I have your heart 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.880
 I already have your heart 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.180
 Do you have your heart 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.180
