00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
we have we have a flame explosive lava

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.390 
we have we have a flame explosive lava
and<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.700> Scopes<00:02:31.270> okay<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.530> how<00:02:32.890> about<00:02:32.920> we<00:02:33.220> make

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and the Scopes okay so how about we make

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:44.220 
and the Scopes okay so how about we make
two<00:02:36.400> basics<00:02:37.530> one<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:39.570> hmm<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.780> let's<00:02:43.780> do<00:02:43.990> one

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
two basics one with hmm so let's do one

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.160 
two basics one with hmm so let's do one
with<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.530> long<00:02:44.740> range<00:02:45.010> scope<00:02:45.870> I'll<00:02:46.870> show<00:02:47.080> you

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
with the long range scope I'll show you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.410 
with the long range scope I'll show you
that<00:02:47.320> one<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.890> also<00:02:48.490> let's<00:02:48.730> make<00:02:48.970> another<00:02:49.150> one

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
that one and also let's make another one

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.630 
that one and also let's make another one
with<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.530> flame<00:02:52.080> there<00:02:53.080> we<00:02:53.200> go<00:02:53.380> now<00:02:54.280> let's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
with the flame there we go now let's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.840 
with the flame there we go now let's
create<00:02:55.180> some<00:02:55.450> fully-auto

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
create some fully-auto

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.810 
create some fully-auto
where<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.120> right<00:02:58.810> here<00:02:58.960> heavy<00:02:59.200> automatic

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
where is it right here heavy automatic

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.930 
where is it right here heavy automatic
now<00:03:00.820> let's<00:03:01.000> make<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.390> with<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:02.130> basic<00:03:03.130> so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
now let's make that with a basic so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.940 
now let's make that with a basic so
that's<00:03:04.120> like<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.510> red<00:03:05.020> dot<00:03:05.230> kind<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.800> thing

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
that's like the red dot kind of thing

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.750 
that's like the red dot kind of thing
and<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.880> also<00:03:07.030> obscured<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.780> lava<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.760> an

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
and it also obscured a lava and an

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.720 
and it also obscured a lava and an
explosive<00:03:10.710> let's<00:03:11.710> say<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.890> create<00:03:12.070> crossbows

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
explosive let's say you create crossbows

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.700 
explosive let's say you create crossbows

some damage bolts so first up we have

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.460 
some damage bolts so first up we have
the<00:03:20.590> long<00:03:21.160> range<00:03:21.550> scope<00:03:21.940> diamond<00:03:22.900> now<00:03:23.200> let's

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
can zoom in on this so let's zoom in on

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.980 
can zoom in on this so let's zoom in on
the<00:03:53.620> skeleton<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.910> that<00:03:55.060> even<00:03:55.480> tells<00:03:55.780> you

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
the skeleton and that even tells you

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.190 
the skeleton and that even tells you
with<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:56.950> little<00:03:57.250> vertical<00:03:57.790> on<00:03:58.120> way<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:58.960> should

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
with a little vertical on way you should

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.740 
with a little vertical on way you should
aim<00:03:59.470> on<00:04:00.220> how<00:04:00.700> depending<00:04:01.180> on<00:04:01.270> how<00:04:01.360> far<00:04:01.510> they<00:04:01.690> are

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
aim on how depending on how far they are

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.870 
aim on how depending on how far they are
oh<00:04:03.990> we<00:04:04.990> got<00:04:05.170> this<00:04:05.350> we<00:04:05.530> got<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.800> skeleton<00:04:08.880> now

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
oh we got this we got the skeleton now

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.320 
oh we got this we got the skeleton now
this<00:04:10.240> is<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.480> basic<00:04:10.900> mechanism<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:12.400> this<00:04:13.180> is

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
this is the basic mechanism and this is

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.850 
this is the basic mechanism and this is
the<00:04:13.390> basic<00:04:13.750> mechanism<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:14.440> do<00:04:14.650> have<00:04:14.680> to

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
the basic mechanism so you do have to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.130 
the basic mechanism so you do have to
hold<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.310> back<00:04:15.460> and<00:04:15.760> then<00:04:16.570> after<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:16.960> while<00:04:17.080> you

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
hold it back and then after a while you

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.330 
hold it back and then after a while you
release<00:04:17.710> and<00:04:18.600> shoot

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
release and shoot

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.120 
release and shoot
now<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.400> next<00:04:21.669> up<00:04:21.910> we<00:04:22.030> have<00:04:22.060> we<00:04:22.990> have<00:04:23.320> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
now the next up we have we have the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.540 
now the next up we have we have the
flame<00:04:24.490> attachment<00:04:25.090> with<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
flame attachment with the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.399 
flame attachment with the
basic<00:04:25.909> mechanism<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:26.539> believe<00:04:28.840> so<00:04:29.840> there<00:04:29.990> we<00:04:30.110> go

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
basic mechanism I believe so there we go

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:34.089 
basic mechanism I believe so there we go
you<00:04:30.500> hold<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:30.860> back<00:04:32.440> wait<00:04:33.440> there<00:04:33.590> just<00:04:33.800> oh<00:04:33.889> I

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
you hold it back wait there just oh I

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:35.499 
you hold it back wait there just oh I
just<00:04:34.129> switched<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.669> a<00:04:34.699> different<00:04:34.759> crossbow

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
just switched to a different crossbow

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.710 
just switched to a different crossbow
okay<00:04:35.810> so<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:36.020> hold<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:36.349> back<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:37.190> aim<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.720> and

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
okay so you hold it back you aim it and

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.920 
okay so you hold it back you aim it and
you<00:04:39.440> shoot<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.039> then<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:40.789> creates<00:04:41.060> fire

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.450 

wow<00:04:44.930> this<00:04:45.050> is<00:04:45.199> really<00:04:45.440> slow<00:04:45.650> slow<00:04:46.190> loading

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
wow this is really slow slow loading

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.050 
wow this is really slow slow loading
basic<00:04:46.909> mechanism<00:04:47.330> here<00:04:47.740> so<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:48.800> like<00:04:49.310> lower

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
basic mechanism here so you like lower

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.659 
basic mechanism here so you like lower
your<00:04:50.300> crossbow<00:04:50.750> where<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.050> load<00:04:51.229> it<00:04:51.669> and

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
your crossbow where you load it and

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:53.499 
your crossbow where you load it and
there<00:04:52.849> we<00:04:52.940> go<00:04:53.060> again

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
there we go again

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.600 
there we go again
well<00:04:54.259> you<00:04:54.470> know<00:04:54.560> what<00:04:54.710> let's<00:04:54.740> set<00:04:55.069> that<00:04:55.220> forest

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
well you know what let's set that forest

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.010 
well you know what let's set that forest
on<00:04:55.759> fire<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:56.060> don't<00:04:56.240> like<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.479> forest

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
on fire I don't like that forest

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.189 
on fire I don't like that forest
there<00:04:57.830> we<00:04:57.889> go<00:04:58.009> it's<00:04:58.190> gonna<00:04:58.310> burn<00:04:58.580> soon<00:04:59.080> next<00:05:00.080> up

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
there we go it's gonna burn soon next up

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.770 
there we go it's gonna burn soon next up
let's<00:05:00.379> check<00:05:00.560> out<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.250> basic<00:05:02.000> scope<00:05:02.300> heavy

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
let's check out the basic scope heavy

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.140 
let's check out the basic scope heavy
mechanism<00:05:03.259> so<00:05:03.349> this<00:05:03.530> is<00:05:03.650> what<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.090> what<00:05:05.090> I

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
mechanism so this is what the what I

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.149 
mechanism so this is what the what I
said<00:05:05.389> with<00:05:05.509> all<00:05:05.690> boy<00:05:06.199> this<00:05:06.650> is<00:05:06.740> what<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:06.949> red

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
said with all boy this is what the red

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:12.010 
said with all boy this is what the red
dot<00:05:07.400> kind<00:05:07.759> of<00:05:07.940> thing<00:05:08.090> would<00:05:08.240> look<00:05:08.389> like<00:05:11.020> gonna

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
dot kind of thing would look like gonna

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.350 
dot kind of thing would look like gonna
get<00:05:12.110> some<00:05:12.259> more<00:05:12.409> chickens<00:05:12.740> up<00:05:12.860> in<00:05:12.979> here<00:05:13.360> there

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
get some more chickens up in here there

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.240 
get some more chickens up in here there
we<00:05:14.449> go<00:05:14.479> alright<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:15.080> here<00:05:15.800> we<00:05:15.889> go

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
we go alright so here we go

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.980 
we go alright so here we go
this<00:05:16.580> is<00:05:16.699> a<00:05:16.759> heavy<00:05:16.940> mechanism<00:05:17.569> this<00:05:17.750> is<00:05:17.810> the

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
this is a heavy mechanism this is the

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.249 
this is a heavy mechanism this is the
fully<00:05:18.259> auto<00:05:18.909> now<00:05:19.909> there<00:05:20.150> is<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.599> medium<00:05:21.050> and

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
fully auto now there is the medium and

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.959 
fully auto now there is the medium and
the<00:05:22.219> light<00:05:22.539> mechanism<00:05:23.539> so<00:05:24.199> it<00:05:24.229> is<00:05:24.710> slower<00:05:25.699> than

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:25.969 
the light mechanism so it is slower than

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.059 
the light mechanism so it is slower than
this<00:05:26.120> don't<00:05:26.330> remember<00:05:26.659> all<00:05:27.440> these<00:05:27.650> shots<00:05:27.830> are

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
this don't remember all these shots are

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.370 
this don't remember all these shots are
using<00:05:28.430> Diamond<00:05:28.729> bolts<00:05:29.090> and<00:05:29.270> they<00:05:29.960> are<00:05:30.050> not

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
using Diamond bolts and they are not

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.640 
using Diamond bolts and they are not
cheap<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:31.180> make<00:05:32.180> sure<00:05:32.389> to<00:05:32.539> choose<00:05:32.779> a<00:05:33.050> crossbow

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
cheap so make sure to choose a crossbow

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.649 
cheap so make sure to choose a crossbow
which<00:05:34.520> you<00:05:34.669> like<00:05:34.909> I<00:05:35.120> really<00:05:35.330> like<00:05:35.539> the

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
which you like I really like the

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:36.909 
which you like I really like the
long-range<00:05:35.960> crossbow<00:05:36.409> that's<00:05:36.500> it's<00:05:36.830> really

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
long-range crossbow that's it's really

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.589 
long-range crossbow that's it's really
cool<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.880> then<00:05:38.060> we<00:05:38.090> have<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.360> lava

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
cool and then we have the lava

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.760 
cool and then we have the lava
attachment<00:05:39.199> which<00:05:39.409> is<00:05:41.050> heavy<00:05:42.050> mechanism<00:05:42.650> oh

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
attachment which is heavy mechanism oh

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.680 
attachment which is heavy mechanism oh
boy<00:05:42.979> this<00:05:43.099> is<00:05:43.190> an<00:05:43.310> automatic<00:05:43.880> lava<00:05:44.120> attachment

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
boy this is an automatic lava attachment

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:53.339 
boy this is an automatic lava attachment
let's<00:05:46.000> let's<00:05:47.000> create<00:05:47.210> some<00:05:47.360> lava<00:05:49.210> boom<00:05:52.029> boom

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
let's let's create some lava boom boom

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.779 
let's let's create some lava boom boom
there<00:05:54.349> we<00:05:54.440> go<00:05:54.620> we<00:05:54.770> got<00:05:54.919> some<00:05:55.069> lava<00:05:55.340> all<00:05:55.550> over

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
there we go we got some lava all over

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.990 
there we go we got some lava all over
the<00:05:55.849> place<00:05:56.500> I'm<00:05:57.500> gonna<00:05:57.800> set<00:05:58.039> those<00:05:58.580> trees<00:05:58.849> on

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
the place I'm gonna set those trees on

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.080 
the place I'm gonna set those trees on
fire<00:05:59.210> right<00:05:59.479> there

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
fire right there

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.909 
fire right there
awesome<00:06:02.120> alright<00:06:02.599> I'm<00:06:02.810> next<00:06:03.139> up<00:06:03.349> we<00:06:03.500> have<00:06:03.529> the

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
awesome alright I'm next up we have the

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.869 
awesome alright I'm next up we have the
heavy<00:06:04.190> mechanism<00:06:04.819> with<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.509> explosive<00:06:06.379> shots

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:06.879 
heavy mechanism with the explosive shots

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.059 
heavy mechanism with the explosive shots
so<00:06:07.879> well<00:06:08.090> let's<00:06:08.330> check<00:06:08.479> this<00:06:08.659> out<00:06:09.069> the

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:10.069 
so well let's check this out the

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.360 
so well let's check this out the
skeleton<00:06:10.340> was<00:06:10.580> somewhere<00:06:10.819> over<00:06:10.879> there<00:06:11.150> right

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
skeleton was somewhere over there right

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.400 
skeleton was somewhere over there right
now<00:06:12.910> the<00:06:12.970> cool<00:06:13.210> thing<00:06:13.240> about<00:06:13.360> this<00:06:13.630> is<00:06:13.870> there's

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
now the cool thing about this is there's

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.320 
now the cool thing about this is there's
actually<00:06:14.650> a<00:06:14.860> little<00:06:15.100> timer<00:06:15.400> on<00:06:15.730> when<00:06:16.240> you

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
actually a little timer on when you

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.800 
actually a little timer on when you
shoot<00:06:16.540> it<00:06:16.690> so<00:06:16.810> for<00:06:17.020> example<00:06:18.090> you<00:06:19.090> shoot<00:06:19.300> it<00:06:19.449> one

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
shoot it so for example you shoot it one

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.920 
shoot it so for example you shoot it one
two<00:06:20.169> three<00:06:20.680> boom<00:06:21.160> so<00:06:22.000> it<00:06:22.090> does<00:06:22.210> not<00:06:22.360> explode<00:06:22.720> on

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
two three boom so it does not explode on
