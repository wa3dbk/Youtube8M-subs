and<00:00:33.030> dried<00:00:33.420> fruit<00:00:33.810> instead<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.380> slow<00:00:34.710> energy

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
and dried fruit instead it's slow energy

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.940 
and dried fruit instead it's slow energy
I'm<00:00:35.370> sure<00:00:35.580> you've<00:00:35.700> heard<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.970> term<00:00:36.000> GI<00:00:36.480> foods

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
I'm sure you've heard the term GI foods

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.799 
I'm sure you've heard the term GI foods
high<00:00:37.950> ones<00:00:38.280> tend<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> burn<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.360> very<00:00:39.570> quickly

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
high ones tend to burn up very quickly

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.380 
high ones tend to burn up very quickly
so<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.410> big<00:00:40.649> highs<00:00:40.920> low<00:00:41.640> ones<00:00:41.910> burn<00:00:42.120> very

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
so you get big highs low ones burn very

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.600 
so you get big highs low ones burn very
slowly<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> nice<00:00:43.890> steady<00:00:44.309> release

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
slowly so you get a nice steady release

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.520 
slowly so you get a nice steady release
of<00:00:44.820> energy<00:00:44.910> throughout<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.449> day<00:00:45.570> much<00:00:46.260> better

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
of energy throughout the day much better

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.000 
of energy throughout the day much better
for<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.809> ok<00:00:48.809> now<00:00:48.960> we've<00:00:49.110> left<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> best<00:00:49.739> for

this is desk dips using a tricep muscle
those<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.390> wobbly<00:01:09.509> bits<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.900> back<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.140> your

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
arm safe position legs apart probably

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.320 
arm safe position legs apart probably
about<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> stride<00:01:15.509> away<00:01:15.869> from<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.259> desk<00:01:17.330> grab

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
about a stride away from your desk grab

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.289 
about a stride away from your desk grab
the<00:01:18.509> back<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.869> desk<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.409> your<00:01:19.439> hands

the back of your desk with your hands

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.800 
the back of your desk with your hands
facing<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.509> way<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.630> you're<00:01:24.780> just

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
facing that way and then you're just

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.350 
facing that way and then you're just
going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.079> lower<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.680> weights<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> push

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
going to lower your weights and push

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210 
going to lower your weights and push
back<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.689> again<00:01:27.960> obviously<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.040> get

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
back up again obviously as you get

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.840 
back up again obviously as you get
stronger<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.200> can<00:01:31.200> lower<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:32.369> slightly

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
stronger you can lower just slightly

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
stronger you can lower just slightly
further<00:01:33.180> ideally<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.680> want<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.920> try<00:01:35.009> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
further ideally you want to try to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.760 
further ideally you want to try to
create<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:36.420> angle<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.899> can<00:01:37.079> 90

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
create a right angle if you can 90

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.130 
create a right angle if you can 90
degrees<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.640> back<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:38.970> again<00:01:39.180> don't<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
degrees and back up again don't do the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.060 
degrees and back up again don't do the
work<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> legs<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:40.920> that's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
work with the legs because that's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
work with the legs because that's
cheating<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.670> hope<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.540> those<00:01:42.720> exercises

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
cheating I hope one of those exercises

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.709 
cheating I hope one of those exercises
to<00:01:43.380> use<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.680> arms

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
to use your arms

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:52.310 
to use your arms
nice<00:01:46.719> and<00:01:46.930> slowly

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.780 

about<00:01:53.320> 10<00:01:53.710> dips<00:01:54.010> would<00:01:54.220> be<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.370> really<00:01:54.550> good

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
about 10 dips would be a really good

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.600 
about 10 dips would be a really good
start<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.830> can't<00:01:57.160> go<00:01:57.310> all<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.460> way<00:01:57.490> down

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
start if you can't go all the way down

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.640 
start if you can't go all the way down
that's<00:01:58.000> fine<00:01:58.270> just<00:01:58.810> go<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.350> where<00:01:59.500> you're

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
that's fine just go to where you're

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.440 
that's fine just go to where you're
comfortable<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.250> then<00:02:00.340> back<00:02:00.520> up<00:02:00.670> again<00:02:00.910> and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
comfortable and then back up again and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.090 
comfortable and then back up again and
as<00:02:01.540> you<00:02:01.690> get<00:02:01.810> stronger<00:02:02.080> you'll<00:02:02.710> be<00:02:02.740> able<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:03.040> go

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
as you get stronger you'll be able to go

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.460 
as you get stronger you'll be able to go
further<00:02:03.310> down<00:02:03.810> don't<00:02:04.810> go<00:02:04.960> past<00:02:05.110> ninety

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
further down don't go past ninety

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.140 
further down don't go past ninety
degrees<00:02:05.740> no<00:02:05.920> point<00:02:06.400> in<00:02:06.490> going<00:02:06.610> down<00:02:06.850> here

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
degrees no point in going down here

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:14.610 
degrees no point in going down here
really<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.470> hear<00:02:08.820> back<00:02:09.820> up

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.259 

should<00:02:15.250> really<00:02:15.549> be<00:02:15.670> able<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.849> feel<00:02:16.000> those<00:02:16.120> on

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
should really be able to feel those on

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.810 
should really be able to feel those on
the<00:02:16.360> back<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.510> your<00:02:16.720> arms

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the back of your arms

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.610 
the back of your arms
okay<00:02:19.820> now<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.180> another<00:02:20.420> simple<00:02:21.140> exercise

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
okay now this is another simple exercise

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.230 
okay now this is another simple exercise
but<00:02:21.920> one<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.220> actually<00:02:22.340> works<00:02:22.730> your<00:02:22.970> legs

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
but one that actually works your legs

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.750 
but one that actually works your legs
really<00:02:23.780> well<00:02:24.200> you'll<00:02:25.130> get<00:02:25.280> up<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.550> down<00:02:25.640> from

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
really well you'll get up and down from

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.520 
really well you'll get up and down from
our<00:02:25.970> seats<00:02:26.210> all<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.420> time<00:02:26.630> but<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.230> being

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
our seats all the time but this is being

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.490 
our seats all the time but this is being
a<00:02:27.560> little<00:02:27.710> bit<00:02:27.860> stricter<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.610> it's<00:02:28.850> basically

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
a little bit stricter and it's basically

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.040 
a little bit stricter and it's basically
seated<00:02:30.500> raised<00:02:31.120> if<00:02:32.120> you're<00:02:32.300> an<00:02:32.600> athlete<00:02:32.810> you'd

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
seated raised if you're an athlete you'd

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.690 
seated raised if you're an athlete you'd
probably<00:02:33.260> call<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> squat<00:02:33.980> which<00:02:34.490> means

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
probably call it a squat which means

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.150 
probably call it a squat which means
you're<00:02:34.790> using<00:02:34.970> your<00:02:35.210> quad<00:02:35.480> muscles<00:02:36.040> put<00:02:37.040> your

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
you're using your quad muscles put your

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.430 
you're using your quad muscles put your
feet<00:02:37.340> hit<00:02:37.910> with<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> park<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.900> sitting

feet hit with the park in that sitting

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.260 
feet hit with the park in that sitting
safe<00:02:39.680> position<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.340> you're<00:02:41.030> going<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.210> be

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
safe position and you're going to be

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.880 
safe position and you're going to be
standing<00:02:41.750> up<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:42.140> can<00:02:42.260> be<00:02:42.380> using<00:02:42.770> your

standing up so you can be using your

standing up so you can be using your
thigh<00:02:43.310> muscles<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:44.300> push<00:02:44.450> yourself<00:02:44.600> up<00:02:45.190> with

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
that you're confident that it's going to

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
weights now it'd be brilliant if you

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.069 
weights now it'd be brilliant if you
could<00:03:42.180> spend<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.599> little<00:03:42.720> bit<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.930> money

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
could spend a little bit of money

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.809 
could spend a little bit of money
probably<00:03:43.560> less<00:03:43.650> than<00:03:43.829> 25<00:03:44.069> pounds<00:03:44.459> these<00:03:44.579> days

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
probably less than 25 pounds these days

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.640 
probably less than 25 pounds these days
to<00:03:45.000> invest<00:03:45.299> in<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.510> couple<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.810> weights<00:03:46.079> that

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
to invest in a couple of weights that

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.839 
to invest in a couple of weights that
you<00:03:46.769> could<00:03:46.950> keep<00:03:47.069> in<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.310> top<00:03:47.489> drawer<00:03:47.640> because

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
you could keep in the top drawer because

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.399 
you could keep in the top drawer because
they'd<00:03:48.030> be<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.209> lot<00:03:48.359> easier<00:03:48.390> maybe<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.140> use

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
they'd be a lot easier maybe to use

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.710 
they'd be a lot easier maybe to use
something<00:03:50.220> as<00:03:50.730> cumbersome<00:03:51.209> as<00:03:51.359> these<00:03:51.540> but

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
something as cumbersome as these but

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.699 
something as cumbersome as these but
these<00:03:51.810> are<00:03:51.959> perfect<00:03:52.349> for<00:03:52.470> what<00:03:52.590> we<00:03:52.680> need

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
these are perfect for what we need

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.470 
these are perfect for what we need
anyway<00:03:53.159> so<00:03:53.220> if<00:03:53.640> you<00:03:53.790> haven't<00:03:54.209> got<00:03:54.329> some

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
anyway so if you haven't got some

feel the squeeze on our bicep that's
this<00:04:15.329> big<00:04:15.599> muscle<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.590> here<00:04:19.160> 10<00:04:20.160> on<00:04:20.190> each<00:04:20.310> arm

this big muscle just here 10 on each arm
would<00:04:20.789> be<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> good<00:04:21.090> number<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:22.650> as<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.919> get

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
would be a good number and as you get

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.320 
would be a good number and as you get
stronger<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:24.320> lift<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.440> heavier<00:04:25.740> weight

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
stronger you lift a heavier weight

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
doesn't really make it a big improvement

doesn't really make it a big improvement
to<00:04:30.090> do<00:04:30.530> faster<00:04:31.530> or<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:32.220> lot<00:04:32.490> more<00:04:32.759> it's<00:04:33.210> better
