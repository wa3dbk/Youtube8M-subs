00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.459 

I'm<00:00:12.620> going<00:00:13.190> back<00:00:13.370> to<00:00:13.549> former<00:00:14.000> one<00:00:14.150> I<00:00:14.180> think<00:00:14.469> the

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
I'm going back to former one I think the

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.800 
I'm going back to former one I think the
main<00:00:15.709> main<00:00:16.250> reason<00:00:16.730> was<00:00:16.910> that<00:00:16.970> I<00:00:17.210> never<00:00:17.480> really

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
main main reason was that I never really

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.950 
main main reason was that I never really
lost<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:18.830> passion<00:00:19.039> in<00:00:19.480> inviting<00:00:20.480> him<00:00:20.779> for

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
lost the passion in inviting him for

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.019 
lost the passion in inviting him for
more<00:00:21.170> one<00:00:21.320> but<00:00:21.560> maybe<00:00:21.800> older<00:00:22.430> although<00:00:22.880> the

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
more one but maybe older although the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.420 
more one but maybe older although the
things<00:00:23.270> around<00:00:23.420> it<00:00:23.750> but<00:00:23.990> when<00:00:24.950> I<00:00:25.040> did<00:00:25.099> some

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
things around it but when I did some

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.859 
things around it but when I did some
NASCAR<00:00:25.880> races<00:00:26.300> this<00:00:26.480> year<00:00:26.540> in<00:00:26.900> states<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.770> i

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
NASCAR races this year in states and i

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.210 
NASCAR races this year in states and i
will<00:00:29.869> start<00:00:30.110> to<00:00:30.230> miss<00:00:30.410> more<00:00:30.649> and<00:00:30.829> more<00:00:30.980> the

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
will start to miss more and more the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.549 
will start to miss more and more the
racing<00:00:31.640> side<00:00:31.880> do<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.570> race<00:00:32.989> against<00:00:33.470> each

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
racing side do the race against each

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.470 
racing side do the race against each
other<00:00:33.829> because<00:00:34.220> in<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.460> rally<00:00:34.640> you<00:00:34.910> race

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
other because in a rally you race

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.740 
other because in a rally you race
against<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:35.870> clock<00:00:36.680> really<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:37.640> that's<00:00:38.600> what

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
against the clock really so that's what

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.889 
against the clock really so that's what
I'm<00:00:38.930> was<00:00:39.530> missing<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.190> then<00:00:40.370> all<00:00:41.149> really<00:00:41.660> I

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.990 
was was was this team of Williamson in
the<00:01:11.260> end<00:01:11.350> everything<00:01:11.980> work<00:01:12.280> out<00:01:12.460> with<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.730> lot

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.620 
the end everything work out with a lot
different<00:01:13.390> OTP<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:15.130> we<00:01:15.370> wanted<00:01:15.730> so<00:01:15.970> that's

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
different OTP as we wanted so that's

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.850 
different OTP as we wanted so that's
really<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.990> reason

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.580 

um<00:01:20.550> I<00:01:20.940> mean<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.270> haven't<00:01:21.540> followed<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.230> formal

know anything about this gonna happen in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.840 
know anything about this gonna happen in
the<00:01:47.810> deal<00:01:48.810> will<00:01:49.050> happen<00:01:49.410> if<00:01:49.530> I'm<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.800> one<00:01:49.979> for

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the deal will happen if I'm the one for

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.320 
the deal will happen if I'm the one for
the<00:01:50.880> next<00:01:51.210> year<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.660> I<00:01:52.130> just<00:01:53.130> puts<00:01:53.400> overall<00:01:54.119> for

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
the next year so I just puts overall for

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.810 
the next year so I just puts overall for
more<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:54.900> see<00:01:55.680> some<00:01:55.860> rises<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.460> nothing

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
more one and see some rises but nothing

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090 
more one and see some rises but nothing
special

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.740 

I<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.259> tires<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:03.549> for<00:02:04.150> comparing<00:02:04.600> to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
I think the tires for for comparing to

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.950 
I think the tires for for comparing to
2009<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.680> not<00:02:05.920> coming<00:02:06.670> coming<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.689> next

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
2009 and not coming coming to the next

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.410 
2009 and not coming coming to the next
year<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:09.069> biggest<00:02:09.340> different<00:02:09.759> updated<00:02:10.209> hires

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
year the biggest different updated hires

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.920 
year the biggest different updated hires
probably<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.530> cause<00:02:11.709> I<00:02:12.360> don't<00:02:13.360> think<00:02:13.660> it's

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
probably the cause I don't think it's

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.740 
probably the cause I don't think it's
awful<00:02:14.290> different<00:02:15.360> DRS<00:02:18.120> basin<00:02:19.120> eating<00:02:19.480> but

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
awful different DRS basin eating but

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.190 
awful different DRS basin eating but
this<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.140> basically<00:02:20.800> similar<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:22.720> button

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
this is basically similar one button

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.690 
this is basically similar one button
thing<00:02:23.410> than<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.770> was<00:02:23.950> in<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.250> front<00:02:24.459> wing

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
thing than it was in the front wing

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.030 
thing than it was in the front wing
before<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.750> has<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.170> ambition<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.890> was

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
before and that has the ambition I was

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.280 
before and that has the ambition I was
delivering<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.000> really<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.110> main

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
delivering so I really the main

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.370 
delivering so I really the main
difference<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.310> tires<00:02:30.640> i<00:02:30.880> would<00:02:31.030> guess

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.990 

I<00:02:35.410> don't<00:02:35.770> know<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:36.100> I'm<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.460> better<00:02:36.850> than

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
I don't know if I'm a better than

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.090 
I don't know if I'm a better than
another<00:02:37.210> I<00:02:37.360> mean<00:02:37.630> I've<00:02:38.230> been<00:02:38.500> away<00:02:38.770> for<00:02:39.070> four

forward to come back and at least four
more<00:03:12.370> one<00:03:12.550> is<00:03:12.730> something<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:14.410> know<00:03:14.700> how

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
more one is something that I I know how

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.170 
more one is something that I I know how
everything<00:03:16.510> works<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.460> I've<00:03:18.460> been<00:03:18.730> there<00:03:19.000> for

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
everything works and I've been there for

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.210 
everything works and I've been there for
many<00:03:19.300> years<00:03:19.450> like<00:03:19.960> when<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.410> went<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.770> raleigh<00:03:21.070> i

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
many years like when I went to raleigh i

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.340 
many years like when I went to raleigh i
did<00:03:21.460> everybody<00:03:21.670> know<00:03:21.820> what<00:03:22.150> what<00:03:22.720> will<00:03:22.990> happen

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
did everybody know what what will happen

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.470 
did everybody know what what will happen
there<00:03:23.560> when<00:03:23.710> I<00:03:23.740> went<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.040> NASCAR<00:03:24.610> no<00:03:24.970> clue<00:03:25.240> one

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
there when I went to NASCAR no clue one

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.260 
there when I went to NASCAR no clue one
how<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.080> will<00:03:26.260> be<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:26.740> in<00:03:27.460> that<00:03:27.700> way<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.970> should

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
how it will be so in that way it should

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.110 
how it will be so in that way it should
be<00:03:28.300> much<00:03:28.630> much<00:03:28.840> easier<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.380> come<00:03:29.530> back<00:03:29.740> and<00:03:30.120> be

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
be much much easier to come back and be

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.700 
be much much easier to come back and be
paranormal

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.830 

the<00:03:35.400> other<00:03:35.550> training<00:03:36.060> side<00:03:36.300> I<00:03:36.330> mean<00:03:36.630> I've<00:03:36.810> been

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the other training side I mean I've been

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.720 
the other training side I mean I've been
training<00:03:37.290> all<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.590> time<00:03:37.890> for<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.250> rally<00:03:38.400> but

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
training all the time for the rally but

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.560 
training all the time for the rally but
of<00:03:38.910> course<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.930> not<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.380> physically<00:03:41.040> small

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
of course it's not so physically small

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.540 
of course it's not so physically small
the<00:03:42.570> data<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.530> whole<00:03:43.680> week<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.310> sit

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
the data is the whole week that you sit

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.540 
the data is the whole week that you sit
in<00:03:44.730> sit<00:03:45.330> in<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.600> car<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.590> rally<00:03:46.800> informal

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
in sit in the car in a rally informal

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.230 
in sit in the car in a rally informal
one<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.850> more<00:03:48.060> physical<00:03:48.630> more<00:03:48.660> short<00:03:49.260> time<00:03:49.620> so

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
one is more physical more short time so

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.990 
one is more physical more short time so
they<00:03:51.240> arrived<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.960> started<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:53.370> one<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.820> go

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
they arrived I started like one to go

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.140 
they arrived I started like one to go
the<00:03:54.330> back<00:03:54.540> end<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.200> proper<00:03:55.760> training<00:03:56.760> for

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
the back end in the proper training for

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.420 
the back end in the proper training for
four<00:03:57.330> more<00:03:57.510> one<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.050> I<00:03:58.380> mean<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.890> neck<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.130> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
four more one so I mean the neck is the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.180 
four more one so I mean the neck is the
most<00:03:59.640> most<00:04:00.330> difficult<00:04:00.840> thing<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.080> get<00:04:01.950> ready

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
most most difficult thing to get ready

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.580 
most most difficult thing to get ready
but<00:04:02.460> we<00:04:02.940> still<00:04:03.120> have<00:04:03.300> plenty<00:04:03.450> of<00:04:03.660> time<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.290> it

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
but we still have plenty of time so it

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.230 
but we still have plenty of time so it
will<00:04:04.800> not<00:04:04.830> be<00:04:05.160> an<00:04:05.250> issue

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.870 

I'm<00:04:09.630> in<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.170> if<00:04:10.800> I<00:04:11.010> think<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.400> versus

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
I'm in like if I think that versus

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.730 
I'm in like if I think that versus
probably<00:04:12.510> i<00:04:12.540> was<00:04:12.840> thinking<00:04:13.260> completely

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
probably i was thinking completely

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.550 
probably i was thinking completely
different<00:04:14.130> thing<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.340> then<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.390> rising

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
different thing and then the rising

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.710 
different thing and then the rising
understand<00:04:16.560> those<00:04:16.739> tests<00:04:17.040> but<00:04:17.330> especially<00:04:18.330> in

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
understand those tests but especially in

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.320 
understand those tests but especially in
the<00:04:18.780> last<00:04:18.930> race<00:04:19.200> but<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.950> mean<00:04:20.250> for<00:04:21.060> sure<00:04:21.209> I

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
the last race but I mean for sure I

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.420 
the last race but I mean for sure I
remember<00:04:21.959> all<00:04:22.110> that<00:04:22.140> all<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.860> breaking<00:04:23.310> and

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
remember all that all the breaking and

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.450 
remember all that all the breaking and
and<00:04:23.970> how<00:04:24.930> quick<00:04:25.530> everything<00:04:25.950> happens<00:04:26.340> so

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
and how quick everything happens so

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.270 
and how quick everything happens so
comparing<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.470> say<00:04:28.470> Raleigh<00:04:28.830> you<00:04:29.100> have<00:04:29.250> a

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
comparing to say Raleigh you have a

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.580 
comparing to say Raleigh you have a
slightly<00:04:29.640> more<00:04:29.910> time<00:04:30.210> but<00:04:30.420> then<00:04:30.660> in<00:04:31.020> raleigh

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
slightly more time but then in raleigh

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.040 
slightly more time but then in raleigh
you<00:04:31.830> don't<00:04:32.070> have<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.520> doesn't<00:04:33.000> keep<00:04:33.120> give<00:04:33.930> you

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
you don't have it doesn't keep give you

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.480 
you don't have it doesn't keep give you
a<00:04:34.080> second<00:04:34.440> chance<00:04:34.470> when<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:35.040> make<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.250> mistake

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
a second chance when you make a mistake

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.720 
a second chance when you make a mistake
you<00:04:36.050> go<00:04:37.050> there<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.590> no<00:04:37.770> runoff<00:04:38.040> areas<00:04:38.550> and

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
you go there is no runoff areas and

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.650 
you go there is no runoff areas and
there's<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.060> three<00:04:39.330> or<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:40.160> big<00:04:41.160> ditch<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:41.850> in

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
there's a three or a big ditch so in

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.800 
there's a three or a big ditch so in
informal<00:04:43.650> one<00:04:44.120> these<00:04:45.120> days<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.450> have<00:04:45.570> low<00:04:45.750> the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
informal one these days you have low the

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.750 
informal one these days you have low the
front<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.260> areas<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.160> can<00:04:47.340> run<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.520> bit

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
front of areas and you can run a bit

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.030 
front of areas and you can run a bit
wide<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.270> it's<00:04:49.020> not<00:04:49.200> such<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.530> big<00:04:49.560> deal<00:04:49.740> you

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
wide and it's not such a big deal you

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.800 
wide and it's not such a big deal you
lose<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.280> lap<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:51.150> practice<00:04:51.600> or<00:04:51.780> a

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
lose a lap in the practice or a

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.680 
lose a lap in the practice or a
qualifying<00:04:52.380> but<00:04:52.650> in<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.670> race<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.060> I've<00:04:54.540> been

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
qualifying but in the race you I've been

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.830 
qualifying but in the race you I've been
Tony<00:04:54.960> Bellew<00:04:55.350> supply<00:04:55.680> so<00:04:56.540> for<00:04:57.540> sure<00:04:57.690> the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
Tony Bellew supply so for sure the

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.280 
Tony Bellew supply so for sure the
braking<00:04:58.290> distance<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:59.730> g-force<00:05:00.240> is<00:05:00.450> the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
braking distance the g-force is the

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.280 
braking distance the g-force is the
acceleration<00:05:02.090> those<00:05:03.090> will<00:05:03.360> those<00:05:03.900> will<00:05:04.110> come

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
acceleration those will those will come

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.730 
acceleration those will those will come
very<00:05:04.470> quickly<00:05:04.680> back<00:05:05.130> so<00:05:05.370> I<00:05:05.730> mean<00:05:06.270> just<00:05:07.080> the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
very quickly back so I mean just the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.710 
very quickly back so I mean just the
biggest<00:05:08.100> thing<00:05:08.280> for<00:05:08.310> sure<00:05:08.640> will<00:05:08.850> be<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.570> get

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
biggest thing for sure will be to get

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.100 
biggest thing for sure will be to get
the<00:05:09.870> neck<00:05:10.080> neck<00:05:11.010> used<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.550> again<00:05:11.850> but<00:05:12.110> but

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
the neck neck used to it again but but

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.220 
the neck neck used to it again but but
they<00:05:13.320> all<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:14.070> rest<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:14.720> think<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.840> takes<00:05:16.080> a

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
they all the rest I think it takes a

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.080 
they all the rest I think it takes a
while<00:05:16.410> but<00:05:16.650> this<00:05:16.860> not<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.280> big<00:05:17.490> picture

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.990 

I<00:05:21.860> wouldn't<00:05:22.860> come<00:05:23.070> back<00:05:23.100> if<00:05:23.310> I<00:05:23.580> will<00:05:23.790> be

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
I wouldn't come back if I will be

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.840 
I wouldn't come back if I will be
motivated<00:05:24.660> so<00:05:25.280> there's<00:05:26.280> always<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.610> lot<00:05:26.790> of

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.659 
motivated so there's always a lot of

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
talk about the motivation and but nobody

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.450 
talk about the motivation and but nobody
really<00:05:30.020> knows<00:05:31.020> what<00:05:31.320> I<00:05:31.350> do<00:05:31.500> or<00:05:31.830> what<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.070> think

really knows what I do or what I think

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.790 
really knows what I do or what I think
but<00:05:32.850> for<00:05:33.030> myself<00:05:33.210> so<00:05:33.690> I'd<00:05:34.050> already<00:05:34.229> care<00:05:34.620> what

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800
