00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.040
 hi to all gamers and if naxos soon 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.440
 today we find ourselves still a 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.840
 times for tip number 10 that 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.189
 a lot of subscribers was waiting and that's 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.950
 for that besides that he follows me so 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.590
 I hurried to achieve so 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.360
 this tip number 10 is happening on 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.810
 any maps you just 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.239
 to be in the street and and have a robot a 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.280
 robben m so you know very well 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.470
 that once you arm both 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.650
 first relays on a map you have to 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.990
 wait for orders to pass 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.420
 to the following shutters and be able to destroy 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.550
 so the next relays so I'm going 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.820
 show you how to access the relay 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.490
 to make a street and a small 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.080
 little faster so you take your 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.530
 robot name you head to a 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.480
 relay so you absolutely have to know 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.190
 the exact place where the 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.710
 relay because it does not show up when 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.990
 you are in the forbidden zone so 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.579
 you take your robot to direct you 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.619
 to the relays you will see the 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.060
 countdown of 10 seconds and for 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.189
 to override those of the counters that's all 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.999
 simple you have to leave the robot m 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.159
 then resume it so you redo 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:20.929
 this manipulation 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.939
 until the relays are 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.700
 available and so you can 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.509
 weapons and that can it 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.369
 several is a little bit long 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.740
 so try to hide yourself for 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.139
 not get killed by an enemy so 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.069
 Here's the countdown goes back to 10 

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:38.299
 seconds every time you do 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:41.179
 manipulation and this until 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.859
 so the limit disappear and once 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.060
 that the limit is gone you will see 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.310
 that you will be able to support everything 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.709
 simply on square to be able to 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.280
 turn on their milk a very good way 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:55.119
 to realise 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.040
 to make a street in a flash so here 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.380
 I hope this tip will have pleased you 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.430
 in the meantime I tell you next time 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.360
 wear well 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.360
 ciao the gamers
