00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.160
 night here the people in the tribune shout

 to the world clapping up the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.830
 palms up the palms fix grip 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.540
 to the band of carlitos led by that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.240
 successes revolved in quarters tribe 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.369
 electric and people jumped and danced 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.950
 as if the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.530
 parade through the quartet 2 thousands of 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.340
 Cordoban and tourists danced next to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.270
 the bar the black videla the party the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.190
 band of index carts good to do 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.750
 things that maybe it was never going to be 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.480
 whatever 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.399
 I have vertigo for telling you and your path 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.170
 to visit from above become and be 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.000
 at the tip of the truck is true that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.579
 it complicated me a bit but the truth is that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.170
 with the people of all as the help of 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.519
 rodrigo surely surely that 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.659
 I was sharing capital I was saying something 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.579
 well why 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.229
 many times we do in 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.270
 different part inside our 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.770
 own and córdoba seems to be lacking 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 something an unforgettable party to be 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.929
 repeat because it is very nice what 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.520
 people live and I hope this is the 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.619
 start of a thing that lasts for 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.179
 many years because the divine to the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.250
 music of córdoba córdoba and to us the 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.500
 people that is the quartet and it's going to be a 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.390
 great party and forever stays a 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 industry to work thousands of 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.819
 people in this industry can generate 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.259
 money this is fun is of 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.420
 investments for people joy 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.920
 but they have been losing money no no in 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.689
 all the countries that have 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.299
 instrumented with a criterion 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.759
 business gives them a lot of money and they 're going 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.520
 very well and gives them a lot of work 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.439
 people who are the ones who make everything 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.659
 what is necessary for this to be a great 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.849
 party and from the artists the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.310
 programmers the producers those who 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.590
 they build the vehicles that surely 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.060
 it will be the great challenge he spoke 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.129
 with the vice mayor of the church 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.229
 we have to make our own trio 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.850
 in Cordoba told him go we do not have 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.120
 truck factory 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.550
 bodies there is the model we have 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.920
 great engineers in sound and this we 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.140
 will allow this carnival to be a 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.460
 popular festival of all years this 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.260
 first year will be deficit 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.060
 worker I do not know because we are 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.650
 Seeing the end as you know the numbers 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.380
 but even if we had to invest 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.790
 something today for example the beds of the 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.820
 hotels in the city of córdoba are 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.340
 complete there is not one that means that 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.650
 creates wealth that gives work and I think 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.120
 the mayor is a good investment 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.520
 ramón mestre declared of interest 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.410
 municipal to the cuartetero carnival 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.330
 we did not know it politically 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.850
 always from the first day we 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.190
 We proposed that Cordoba be a 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.420
 center of tourist attraction and if in the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.150
 January there is an event of these 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.290
 characteristics in the capital we 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.819
 the truth that we will be the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.090
 inconsiderate if we fail 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.420
 then each one interprets it in pain 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.739
 or your projects are legitimate the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.629
 aspirations for us we see the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.549
 point of view the culture the point of 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.620
 sight of tourism that's why we declare it 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.420
 municipal interest and that's why we support it 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.000
 and that's why we assure that they are the three 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.129
 successful nights about staying 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.180
 radical no matter how a 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.400
 event that a government organized 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.299
 Peronist of that is the coexistence 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.299
 last out there not
