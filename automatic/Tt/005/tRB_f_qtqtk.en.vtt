00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
he's in like some cave or something

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.950 
he's in like some cave or something
because<00:06:32.610> he's<00:06:32.850> like<00:06:33.030> moving<00:06:33.449> around<00:06:33.540> pretty

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
because he's like moving around pretty

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.450 
because he's like moving around pretty
quick<00:06:34.320> so<00:06:34.949> oh<00:06:35.840> ok<00:06:36.840> he's<00:06:37.020> here<00:06:37.340> what<00:06:38.340> did<00:06:38.430> he

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
quick so oh ok he's here what did he

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:45.750 
quick so oh ok he's here what did he
make

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.370 

okay<00:06:46.420> so<00:06:46.840> let's<00:06:47.230> test<00:06:47.610> it's<00:06:48.610> going<00:06:49.000> up<00:06:49.380> you're

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
okay so let's test it's going up you're

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:59.770 
okay so let's test it's going up you're
going<00:06:50.620> up<00:06:50.950> mean<00:06:51.400> skin<00:06:53.040> so<00:06:54.040> he's<00:06:54.280> up<00:06:55.890> up<00:06:56.890> here<00:06:57.190> so

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.920 

so<00:07:00.780> I'm<00:07:01.110> guessing<00:07:02.300> he's<00:07:03.300> behind<00:07:03.630> it<00:07:03.810> here

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
so I'm guessing he's behind it here

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.220 
so I'm guessing he's behind it here
somewhere<00:07:05.090> trekking<00:07:06.090> players<00:07:06.600> and<00:07:06.810> walls<00:07:06.990> can

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230 
somewhere trekking players and walls can

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.780 
somewhere trekking players and walls can
be<00:07:07.260> tricky<00:07:07.820> but<00:07:08.820> it's<00:07:09.330> easy<00:07:10.370> especially<00:07:11.370> when

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
be tricky but it's easy especially when

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.980 
be tricky but it's easy especially when
they're<00:07:11.940> underground<00:07:12.210> can<00:07:12.570> be<00:07:12.600> really

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
they're underground can be really

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.820 
they're underground can be really
annoying<00:07:13.140> but<00:07:13.590> um<00:07:14.510> six<00:07:15.510> meters<00:07:15.810> should<00:07:16.680> be

annoying but um six meters should be

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:24.500
