00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.390
 in front of you is Dutch 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.210
 full color star reasonable 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.079
 But it was not always so 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.879
 recently it was dark and cold here 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.879
 so what happened 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.370
 I have nowhere to make a decision 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580
 I who looked at her will thought that 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.690
 would not hurt another case when and by 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.720
 what price and the same and did not have time he advanced 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.570
 the king of the ocean and then I survived the parade 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.100
 the doors 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.800
 it appeared a different creature but life on 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.530
 land is a risky business 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.010
 ruler looked at our hero said 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 he should be able to protect himself 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.000
 as they say 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 someone from Yalta 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.920
 but those who survive more 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.640
 so no but made our friend 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.409
 irresistible to the opposite 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.520
 sex 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 a predator but but a completely different thing now we 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.550
 use if you're lucky 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.290
 You can certainly intimidate the enemy 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.170
 by quantity 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.170
 but it is more efficient to use kers 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.700
 ironically the first 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.110
 civilization 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.370
 but civilization is primarily a struggle 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.280
 yes absolutely 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.159
 fortunately no you came to the rescue and 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:47.640
 said 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.470
 guys stay unite at 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.470
 women that they did 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.179
 they built spaceships 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.440
 they set off to nightingale callas 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.440
 but they are never only 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.840
 also an alcoholic robot captain 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.719
 space 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.719
 no he sent every hectare 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.879
 estimated field universe create 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.989
