publicly traded company I realized that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.180 
publicly traded company I realized that
a<00:00:57.449> lot<00:00:57.750> has<00:00:57.989> changed<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> mobile<00:00:59.070> app

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
a lot has changed in the mobile app

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.979 
a lot has changed in the mobile app
space<00:00:59.460> you<00:01:00.030> look<00:01:00.180> at<00:01:00.300> Apple<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.930> Google

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
space you look at Apple and Google

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.200 
space you look at Apple and Google
passing<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.039> those<00:01:02.190> rules<00:01:02.430> making<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.910> harder

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
passing all those rules making it harder

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.609 
passing all those rules making it harder
and<00:01:03.239> harder<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.629> people<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.140> actually<00:01:04.290> get

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and harder for people to actually get

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
and harder for people to actually get
there<00:01:04.769> absent<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> store<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.119> first

there absent to the store in the first
place<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.890> doesn't<00:01:08.189> mean<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.760> it's

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
place now that doesn't mean that it's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
place now that doesn't mean that it's
impossible<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.810> still<00:01:10.200> build<00:01:10.470> cheap<00:01:10.920> quality

as<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.700> has<00:01:17.880> changed<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> what<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:19.200> need

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
as to what has changed and what we need

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.649 
as to what has changed and what we need
to<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> community<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.909> collectively

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
to do as a community to all collectively

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
to do as a community to all collectively
benefit<00:01:22.500> from<00:01:22.740> these<00:01:22.950> changes<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.670> we

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
benefit from these changes so that we

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.850 
benefit from these changes so that we
can<00:01:24.000> actually<00:01:24.150> build<00:01:24.600> apps<00:01:24.930> using<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:25.680> these

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
can actually build apps using all these

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.499 
can actually build apps using all these
builders<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.400> frameworks<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.330> out

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
builders and frameworks that are out

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.990 
builders and frameworks that are out
there<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.979> spend<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.369> lot<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
there you don't have to spend a lot to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
there you don't have to spend a lot to
make<00:01:30.210> good<00:01:30.630> apps<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> show<00:01:31.590> you

then it's always like where do I get a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.820 
then it's always like where do I get a
programmer<00:02:14.760> we're<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.540> yep<00:02:15.959> it's<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.560> just
