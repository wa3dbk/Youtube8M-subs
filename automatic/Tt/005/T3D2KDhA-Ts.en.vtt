00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
part of the extreme supernova was just

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.100 
part of the extreme supernova was just
the<00:02:00.520> rush<00:02:00.760> you<00:02:01.090> get<00:02:01.240> at<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.420> top<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.780> wasn't

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
expecting to be lifted out of my seat

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.100
