00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.170 
faster limit on well that was to live it
on<00:05:11.730> Windows<00:05:12.730> 7

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
on Windows 7

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.120 
on Windows 7
I'm<00:05:13.570> guessing<00:05:13.960> it's<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.230> limit<00:05:14.500> on<00:05:14.590> Windows<00:05:14.920> 8

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
I'm guessing it's the limit on Windows 8

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.180 
I'm guessing it's the limit on Windows 8
as<00:05:15.310> well<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.900> just<00:05:16.930> seems<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.590> stop<00:05:17.860> at<00:05:18.040> five

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
as well it just seems to stop at five

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.690 
as well it just seems to stop at five
point<00:05:18.430> nine<00:05:18.460> from<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:18.820> chemical<00:05:19.300> hard<00:05:20.290> drives

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
point nine from the chemical hard drives

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.660 
point nine from the chemical hard drives
yeah<00:05:21.730> with<00:05:22.540> Windows<00:05:22.870> 8<00:05:23.140> you<00:05:23.500> obviously<00:05:23.920> don't

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
yeah with Windows 8 you obviously don't

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.930 
yeah with Windows 8 you obviously don't
get<00:05:24.880> when<00:05:25.330> you<00:05:25.660> actually<00:05:26.370> have<00:05:27.370> Windows<00:05:27.760> say

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
get when you actually have Windows say

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.510 
get when you actually have Windows say
you<00:05:28.210> don't<00:05:28.390> have<00:05:28.690> a<00:05:28.720> Start<00:05:29.110> menu<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:30.160> you<00:05:30.220> have

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
you don't have a Start menu so you have

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.570 
you don't have a Start menu so you have
to<00:05:30.670> rush<00:05:30.820> you<00:05:31.000> install<00:05:31.510> one<00:05:31.720> I<00:05:32.100> started<00:05:33.100> off<00:05:33.220> by

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
to rush you install one I started off by

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.490 
to rush you install one I started off by
installed<00:05:34.180> in<00:05:34.330> one<00:05:34.570> called

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.920 

Windows<00:05:38.500> I<00:05:38.920> was

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.800 

start<00:05:45.650> menu<00:05:45.889> a<00:05:46.010> that's<00:05:46.490> it<00:05:46.790> just<00:05:47.270> took<00:05:47.480> a<00:05:47.600> world

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
start menu a that's it just took a world

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.379 
start menu a that's it just took a world
think<00:05:48.080> that<00:05:48.320> I've<00:05:49.190> got<00:05:49.460> another<00:05:49.699> one<00:05:49.910> on<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.150> no

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
think that I've got another one on it no

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:51.580 
think that I've got another one on it no
and<00:05:50.570> I<00:05:50.630> can't<00:05:50.870> remember<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.169> name<00:05:51.350> of<00:05:51.500> this

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
application user most are in the bottom

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.150 
application user most are in the bottom
half<00:06:05.960> of<00:06:06.229> the<00:06:07.510> bottom<00:06:08.510> half<00:06:08.630> of<00:06:09.050> the<00:06:09.380> Start

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
half of the bottom half of the Start

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.590 
half of the bottom half of the Start
menu<00:06:10.580> above<00:06:11.090> shut<00:06:11.419> down<00:06:12.729> and<00:06:13.729> when<00:06:14.000> when<00:06:14.389> you

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
menu above shut down and when when you

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.110 
menu above shut down and when when you
actually<00:06:14.750> get<00:06:15.020> Windows<00:06:15.380> 8<00:06:15.650> it<00:06:15.949> has<00:06:16.220> a<00:06:16.580> Metro

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
actually get Windows 8 it has a Metro

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.409 
actually get Windows 8 it has a Metro
screen<00:06:17.870> which<00:06:18.580> it's<00:06:19.580> more<00:06:19.910> designed<00:06:20.270> for

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
screen which it's more designed for

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.500 
screen which it's more designed for
touchscreen<00:06:20.690> devices<00:06:21.139> and<00:06:22.010> not<00:06:22.310> laptops<00:06:23.300> or

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
touchscreen devices and not laptops or

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.300 
touchscreen devices and not laptops or
desktop<00:06:23.930> computers<00:06:24.790> so<00:06:26.410> this<00:06:27.410> is<00:06:27.560> the<00:06:28.100> reason

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
desktop computers so this is the reason

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.020 
desktop computers so this is the reason
that<00:06:28.940> I<00:06:29.000> have<00:06:29.830> installed<00:06:30.830> Start<00:06:31.250> menu<00:06:31.580> 8<00:06:31.790> and

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
that I have installed Start menu 8 and

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.430 
that I have installed Start menu 8 and
then<00:06:32.150> I've<00:06:32.270> installed<00:06:32.600> another<00:06:32.840> start<00:06:33.229> many

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
then I've installed another start many

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.250 
then I've installed another start many
witches<00:06:33.710> even<00:06:34.550> better<00:06:34.729> than<00:06:34.880> Start<00:06:35.120> Menu<00:06:35.330> 8<00:06:35.360> if

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
witches even better than Start Menu 8 if

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.200 
witches even better than Start Menu 8 if
I<00:06:36.380> find<00:06:36.650> out<00:06:36.830> which<00:06:37.100> Start<00:06:37.760> menu<00:06:38.030> I've

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
I find out which Start menu I've

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.640 
I find out which Start menu I've
actually<00:06:38.389> installed<00:06:38.870> on<00:06:38.990> this<00:06:39.139> but<00:06:39.350> I<00:06:39.440> did<00:06:39.620> a

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
actually installed on this but I did a

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.800 
actually installed on this but I did a
few<00:06:39.979> weeks<00:06:40.280> ago<00:06:40.850> I'll<00:06:41.270> put<00:06:41.510> it<00:06:41.600> in<00:06:41.660> the
