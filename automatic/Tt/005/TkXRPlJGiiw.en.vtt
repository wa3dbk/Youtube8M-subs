 up to 80 years 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.359
 the main thing is to be able to recover and 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.270
 to build the training correctly 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:55.140
 process for the test you dance to 40 them 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.109
 need a different approach to their 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.899
 workouts and plan differently 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.969

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.150
 strong effectant to 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.860
 be able to overcome difficulties and develop 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.410
 will power and here the element turns on 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.569
 motivation, or the so-called willpower in 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.390
 I have to endure to overcome obstacles 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.849
 train more often and small 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.129
 the amount of time it is more efficient 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.400
 what to train once a week 4 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.400
 o'clock 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.790

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.880
 this, too, must be kept in mind and modesty 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.930
 decorates a person you need to always be 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.530
 open to some kind of innovation new 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.800
 approach exchange of experience between coaches and 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.050
 Moreover, a very important approach is not to impose 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.450
 your point of view and offer 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.860
 show that you can and be open 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.860

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.230
