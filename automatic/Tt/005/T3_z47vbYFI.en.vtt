00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
and we'll draw it out to where that

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:09.770 
and we'll draw it out to where that
comes<00:00:57.859> into<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.340> side<00:00:58.550> here<00:00:58.940> like<00:00:59.449> this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 

and<00:01:10.350> how<00:01:10.500> much<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> gap<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.220> there<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.670> we

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and how much the gap is there there we

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
and how much the gap is there there we
don't<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.150> too<00:01:12.390> much<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.810> gap<00:01:13.020> between<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
don't want too much of a gap between the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
don't want too much of a gap between the
top<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.450> broiler<00:01:16.580> we'll<00:01:17.580> take<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119

actually let's get a new mesh let's go
back<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.700> our<00:03:37.879> pops<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:39.260> i'm<00:03:39.349> going<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.560> select

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
back to our pops and i'm going to select

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.619 
back to our pops and i'm going to select
them<00:03:43.209> i'm<00:03:44.209> going<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.510> cut<00:03:44.659> them<00:03:44.780> out<00:03:46.480> I'm<00:03:47.480> going

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
them i'm going to cut them out I'm going

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.420 
them i'm going to cut them out I'm going
to<00:03:47.690> label<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:48.140> mesh<00:03:48.909> tops<00:03:51.129> I'm<00:03:52.129> going<00:03:52.340> to

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
to label this mesh tops I'm going to

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.210 
to label this mesh tops I'm going to
paste<00:03:52.579> them<00:03:52.790> in<00:03:52.909> there<00:03:53.440> just<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.590> can<00:03:54.739> you

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
paste them in there just so I can you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.610 
paste them in there just so I can you
know<00:03:56.109> keep<00:03:57.109> things<00:03:57.379> straight<00:03:58.780> then<00:03:59.780> I'm<00:04:00.379> going

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
know keep things straight then I'm going

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.619 
know keep things straight then I'm going
to<00:04:00.650> go<00:04:00.829> to<00:04:00.890> my<00:04:01.069> list<00:04:01.609> see<00:04:01.879> here<00:04:02.390> I<00:04:07.420> left<00:04:08.420> or

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
to go to my list see here I left or

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.849 
to go to my list see here I left or
right<00:04:08.870> view<00:04:09.370> i'm<00:04:10.370> going<00:04:10.549> to<00:04:10.609> say<00:04:10.700> my<00:04:10.970> left<00:04:11.299> view

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
right view i'm going to say my left view

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:17.590 
right view i'm going to say my left view
because<00:04:12.859> we're<00:04:13.280> going<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.489> mirror<00:04:13.879> this<00:04:16.600> so

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
because we're going to mirror this so

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.300 
because we're going to mirror this so
what<00:04:17.989> we're<00:04:18.169> going<00:04:18.289> to<00:04:18.380> do<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:20.949> select<00:04:21.949> our

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
what we're going to do is select our

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.350 
what we're going to do is select our
mirror<00:04:22.729> kommandantur<00:04:23.389> duplicate<00:04:25.060> make<00:04:26.060> sure

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
mirror kommandantur duplicate make sure

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.300 
mirror kommandantur duplicate make sure
it's<00:04:26.449> mirroring<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.870> Z<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.590> let's<00:04:27.830> see<00:04:28.039> if<00:04:28.070> we

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
it's mirroring the Z and let's see if we

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.180 
it's mirroring the Z and let's see if we
can't<00:04:28.580> mirror<00:04:28.849> this<00:04:29.090> over

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.930 

like<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:35.710> looks<00:04:35.920> like<00:04:36.010> it's<00:04:36.310> done<00:04:36.460> an<00:04:36.610> okay

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
like so it looks like it's done an okay

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.310 
like so it looks like it's done an okay
job<00:04:36.970> we<00:04:37.450> might<00:04:37.600> need<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.870> adjust<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:38.260> little<00:04:38.290> bit

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.280 

these<00:04:45.920> down<00:04:46.220> here<00:04:46.250> look<00:04:46.790> like<00:04:47.000> they<00:04:47.930> all<00:04:48.080> can

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
these down here look like they all can

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.150 
these down here look like they all can
use<00:04:48.440> just<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.800> tad<00:04:49.100> bit<00:04:49.130> of<00:04:49.490> adjusting<00:04:51.160> and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
use just a tad bit of adjusting and

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.650 
use just a tad bit of adjusting and
that's<00:04:52.340> not<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.550> problem<00:04:52.850> we<00:04:53.090> can<00:04:53.240> just<00:04:53.390> pull

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
that's not a problem we can just pull

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:09.320 
that's not a problem we can just pull
these<00:04:53.810> out<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.080> little<00:04:56.500> so

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
okay now we got our pops on that side we

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.780 
okay now we got our pops on that side we
got<00:05:30.040> a<00:05:30.070> pop<00:05:30.370> on<00:05:30.400> this<00:05:30.850> side<00:05:32.310> now<00:05:33.310> let's<00:05:33.639> go
