seconds out of time Scott yeah and
that's<00:03:55.359> mainly<00:03:55.540> because<00:03:55.689> like<00:03:56.169> chris<00:03:56.379> said

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
that's mainly because like chris said

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.289 
that's mainly because like chris said
they're<00:03:56.680> very<00:03:57.009> organized<00:03:57.489> charges<00:03:58.000> but<00:03:58.180> it

they're very organized charges but it

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.119 
they're very organized charges but it
then<00:03:58.479> again<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:58.930> like<00:03:59.109> both<00:03:59.439> teams<00:03:59.799> are

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
then again it's like both teams are
