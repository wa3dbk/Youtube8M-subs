00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.810
 good we are in the second lesson of 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.890
 these piano lessons and we're going to see a 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.490
 very important concept let's see the 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:18.490
 first intervals the simplest that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.310
 they are tone and halftone 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.560
 it is important these two intervals the 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.250
 tone and the halftone because with it we are going to 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.650
 learn to build our first 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.470
 musical scales that in turn are 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.710
 elements on which all the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.710
 harmony 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.550
 progressions chord construction 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.550
 etc 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.510
 let's see what a forgiveness tone is that is 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.350
 an interval an interval in music is 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.860
 the distance that exists between sounds 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.860
 musicals 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.760
 this distance is the distance there 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.280
 as to tone that is to say as soon as 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.330
 how severe or acute a sound sounds 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.330
 with respect to another 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.010
 on the other hand we have that tone goes to 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.540
 be the unit as far as 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.080
 one sound with another 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.400
 and the halftone is going to be half of a 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.460
 tone now well 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.290
 what does it mean that the good tone the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.220
 tone because we use it as a unit 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.840
 well the tone is considered as unity in 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.909
 how much distance because it is 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.810
 the reference that we use to build 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:54.670
 chords to build scales and even 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.680
 build other more complex intervals 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.210
 that the tone and the halftone properly 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.909
 saying 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.729
 Now we still have a 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.360
 question that is none other than how are we going to 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.360
 recognize 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.940
 the tones and semitones on the keyboard of the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.800
 piano 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.120
 as well 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.120
 it's very simple 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.900
 here 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.350
 I have prepared an image with several 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.590
 examples of tones and halftones 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:35.680
 as a general rule say that 22 sounds 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.910
 that are separated by a tone their 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.010
 respective keys will always be 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.130
 separated by a key for example here 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:51.460
 we have this black key in the middle 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:55.360
 of king and my then king will be a tone 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:59.650
 in this other example for example valga 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.590
 the redundancy we have my fa 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.640
 where there is no key in 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.310
 medium 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.180
 then it was half tone 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.520
 here 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.210
 we have 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.000
 E flat or sustained net not 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.060
 we know we only know what this key is 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.460
 black 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.010
 and we have 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:30.340
 we see here this key that is in the middle 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.340
 this white key is in the middle then 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.650
 between these 2 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.879
 between the sounds of these two keys 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.879
 there will be a tone 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.410
 here 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.460
 we have 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.900
 natural sun 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.900
 and flat sun 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.430
 between these two keys there is no 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.370
 other 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.360
 so 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.360
 half volume 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:09.060
 now we have these two black keys 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:14.210
 and in the middle we have sun then between 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.210
 those two black keys there is a tone 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.039
 let's listen 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.710
 these two these rain and we're going to 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:30.259
 listen to see 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.259
 the feeling that produces the tone 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.919
 Y 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.550
 that would be a tone the distance between the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.240
 king 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.240
 and me 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:51.320
 now 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.050
 if we listen to my fa we will see or 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.290
 we will perceive to the ear that distance is 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.290
 less 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.960
 me 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.960
 fa 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:17.620
 now we have this black key that is 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:22.350
 between the king I can be sustained network 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.350
 or beam emol and fa 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.460
 a tone 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:39.510
 now here we have sun and sun we see that 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.510
 it would be half tone 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.050
 Sun 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.030
 about bad 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.290
 we see we perceive that the distances more 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.290
 short half tone 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:03.539
 now we have in this chart we have 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.569
 two black keys separated by the key 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.569
 sun then between them there will be a tone 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.979
 more than assimilate 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:30.279
 the sound of a tone and a semitone 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:34.360
 the sensation that produces in our ears is 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:38.470
 better learn to build shades and 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:42.490
 Halftones on the keyboard is to say 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:45.570
 instantaneously if two keys are 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.680
 separated by a tone or a semitone 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.460
 this is going to allow us 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.460
 build 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.380
 musical scales 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.280
 that is from a musical note 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.990
 build your scale 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.990
 we will see it in the next election
