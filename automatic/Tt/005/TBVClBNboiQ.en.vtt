00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
during wrestlemania time maybe not but I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.380 
during wrestlemania time maybe not but I
think<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.489> Michael<00:00:59.489> Cole<00:00:59.640> has<00:00:59.879> become<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
think now Michael Cole has become the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.439 
think now Michael Cole has become the
voice<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> WWE<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:02.670> Jim<00:01:02.850> Ross<00:01:03.030> put<00:01:03.359> on

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
voice of the WWE I think Jim Ross put on

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.080 
voice of the WWE I think Jim Ross put on
NXT<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.290> train<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.549> don't<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:05.909> who

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090

from raw the whole Austin McMahon thing
I<00:01:58.799> don't<00:01:58.950> think<00:01:59.189> would<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.490> been<00:01:59.759> what<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
I don't think would have been what it

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.179 
I don't think would have been what it
was<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> wasn't<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.409> Jericho<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
was if it wasn't for Jericho in the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.429 
was if it wasn't for Jericho in the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
I guess you know it's not like he's been

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.350 
I guess you know it's not like he's been
on<00:02:55.860> commentary<00:02:56.430> here<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.850> there<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.239> not

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
on commentary here and there so it's not

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.990

he is technically now with the company

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.199 
he is technically now with the company
more<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.010> can<00:03:02.130> go<00:03:02.280> pursue<00:03:02.610> his<00:03:02.790> own<00:03:02.880> thing
