what the system wanted us to learn we
were<00:03:27.180> all<00:03:27.360> hackers<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.260> moment<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:28.890> were

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
were all hackers in that moment we were

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.420 
were all hackers in that moment we were
rejecting<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.209> ideas<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.900> those<00:03:31.650> around<00:03:32.130> us

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
rejecting the ideas of those around us

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.979 
rejecting the ideas of those around us
so<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:35.400> brings<00:03:35.640> me<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.940> my<00:03:36.060> second<00:03:36.450> idea<00:03:36.690> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
so that brings me to my second idea the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.260 
so that brings me to my second idea the
second<00:03:37.380> idea<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.400> idea

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.160 

you

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.410 

so<00:03:49.170> this<00:03:49.350> brings<00:03:49.560> me<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> idea<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.820> hard

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
so this brings me to the idea of hard

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.720 
so this brings me to the idea of hard
work<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:51.960> is<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.320> Borelli<00:03:52.680> fruit<00:03:53.280> man<00:03:53.520> the
