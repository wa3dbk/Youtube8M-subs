00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.540
 hello good today I'm going to prepare some 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.460
 Chicken stuffed aubergines the 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.340
 ingredients that I will use will be 2 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.550
 eggplant two chicken breasts four 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:32.320
 slices of cheese an onion an egg 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.750
 grated tomato shredded salt a 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.440
 little sugar oregano black pepper 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:42.450
 and olive oil and now we will cut the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 eggplant and we will empty them well 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.560
 I already have the empty aubergines that 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.840
 today I have not heated them or anything 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.450
 sedation with the help of a vacuum 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.110
 now we will cut the chicken breast 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.110
 to small pieces 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.640
 Well, when the oil is already a little 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.250
 hot 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.369
 the first thing that we will throw will be the onion 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.369
 grated 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.579
 and we will move it a little bit 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.860
 Well, after two and a half minutes 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.820
 we will add the breasts very short life 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.820
 new a little bit like that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.310
 I will add 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.350
 two salt tracks 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.130
 and a little black pepper 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.490
 and now the woman we have good 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.160
 well past three thousand three minutes without 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.050
 stop moving 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.050
 now we will make the aubergine 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.500
 and a little more salt 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.810
 and we will see another while until 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.810
 the aubergine is soft blandita 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.290
 Well, after a while, as many times as 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.900
 we have taken the water and have lost 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.860
 and most of the volume we 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.860
 we go back a little 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.280
 we add him 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.629
 in crushed tomato 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.230
 the idealist 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.600
 your 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.110
 a pinch of salt 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.079
 a pinch of sugar 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:28.060
 and I will also dismiss him as not the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.580
 oregano we throw a little bit of or the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.380
 oregano to the taste of each 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.380
 and now we will move it well all 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.140
 when we have it well moved 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.470
 I will throw the egg 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.700
 and I will move it well 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:03.790
 I already have the oven heated to 230 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.790
 degrees now move it well and stop it 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.829
 when we have it well moved 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.690
 all I can be to eggplants 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.330
 I've put a slice of cheese cut to 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.900
 each one in the middle and now the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.900
 we will fill 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.130
 we see with a spoon and wash 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.010
 that is well arrives 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.340
 A) Yes 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:54.190
 once you have it full 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.190
 I'll put the grated cheese on top 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.370
 and so I'll do with the three more that I 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.370
 missing 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.590
 when you arrive we have all 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.640
 we'll put them in the oven 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.230
 between 200 and 230 degrees the weather does not 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.650
 I know then I say it when the place does not 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.650
 ends 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:35.180
 then passed at the end about 35 minutes with 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.700
 the oven 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.450
 at 220 degrees 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.450
 list 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.710
 eggplant stuffed with chicken
