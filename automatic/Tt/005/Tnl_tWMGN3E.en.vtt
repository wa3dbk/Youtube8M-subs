hello<00:00:06.020> again<00:00:06.260> this<00:00:06.319> is<00:00:06.560> tubal-cain<00:00:07.040> from

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 
hello again this is tubal-cain from

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.320 
hello again this is tubal-cain from
Illinois<00:00:07.910> I<00:00:08.269> was<00:00:08.990> making<00:00:09.380> a<00:00:09.820> part<00:00:10.820> here<00:00:11.059> on<00:00:11.090> my

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
Illinois I was making a part here on my

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.860 
Illinois I was making a part here on my
lathe<00:00:11.540> and<00:00:11.840> I<00:00:11.930> was<00:00:12.200> thinking<00:00:13.010> to<00:00:13.100> myself<00:00:13.870> I

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
lathe and I was thinking to myself I

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.290 
lathe and I was thinking to myself I
better<00:00:15.320> tell<00:00:15.559> the<00:00:15.680> folks<00:00:15.860> about<00:00:16.070> backlash<00:00:16.609> and

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
better tell the folks about backlash and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.420 
better tell the folks about backlash and
what<00:00:17.449> it<00:00:17.539> is<00:00:17.689> and<00:00:17.930> why<00:00:18.109> you<00:00:18.529> need<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:18.859> avoid<00:00:19.189> it

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
what it is and why you need to avoid it

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.239 
what it is and why you need to avoid it
or<00:00:19.749> a<00:00:20.749> compensate<00:00:21.499> for<00:00:21.740> it<00:00:21.829> you<00:00:21.949> can't<00:00:22.159> really

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:22.249 
or a compensate for it you can't really

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.109 
or a compensate for it you can't really
avoid<00:00:22.730> it<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.439> in<00:00:24.439> taking<00:00:25.249> the<00:00:25.369> final<00:00:25.640> pass

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
avoid it so in taking the final pass

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.470 
avoid it so in taking the final pass
here<00:00:27.019> on<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.349> lathe<00:00:27.560> I<00:00:27.949> have<00:00:28.519> ten<00:00:28.819> thousands

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
here on the lathe I have ten thousands

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.010 
here on the lathe I have ten thousands
more<00:00:29.720> to<00:00:29.899> go<00:00:30.079> and<00:00:30.699> I<00:00:31.699> have<00:00:31.909> so<00:00:32.660> I'm<00:00:32.750> going<00:00:32.870> to<00:00:32.930> do

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
more to go and I have so I'm going to do

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.040 
more to go and I have so I'm going to do
that<00:00:33.170> in<00:00:33.350> one<00:00:33.560> pass<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.370> I've<00:00:35.060> set<00:00:35.390> my<00:00:35.720> cross

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
that in one pass and I've set my cross

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.220 
that in one pass and I've set my cross
feed<00:00:36.469> for<00:00:38.500> unto<00:00:39.500> zero<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:41.000> I<00:00:41.239> am<00:00:41.690> not<00:00:41.870> sure<00:00:41.899> how

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
feed for unto zero and I am not sure how

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.689 
feed for unto zero and I am not sure how
well<00:00:42.469> that's<00:00:42.620> going<00:00:42.829> to<00:00:42.949> show<00:00:43.280> up<00:00:43.309> in<00:00:43.640> the

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
well that's going to show up in the

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.209 
well that's going to show up in the
video<00:00:43.850> I'm<00:00:44.660> going<00:00:44.899> to<00:00:45.019> feed<00:00:45.289> it<00:00:45.440> in<00:00:45.559> exactly

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
video I'm going to feed it in exactly

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.400 
video I'm going to feed it in exactly
ten<00:00:46.640> thousandths<00:00:49.089> whoops<00:00:50.089> I<00:00:50.420> went<00:00:50.780> over<00:00:50.960> I

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
ten thousandths whoops I went over I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.880 
ten thousandths whoops I went over I
went<00:00:52.190> 12<00:00:52.609> thousands<00:00:53.269> now<00:00:53.539> this<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.379> exactly

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
went 12 thousands now this is exactly

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.400 
went 12 thousands now this is exactly
what<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:55.129> want<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.550> talk<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.969> you<00:00:56.059> about<00:00:56.179> now<00:00:57.170> it

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
what I want to talk to you about now it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.590 
what I want to talk to you about now it
will<00:00:57.559> do<00:00:57.769> absolutely<00:00:58.039> no<00:00:58.609> good<00:00:58.850> at<00:00:59.030> all<00:00:59.179> to

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
will do absolutely no good at all to

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.040 
will do absolutely no good at all to
back<00:00:59.809> that<00:01:00.170> off<00:01:00.230> just<00:01:00.879> mm<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.480> need<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.839> back

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
back that off just mm you need to back

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.880 
back that off just mm you need to back
it<00:01:03.289> way<00:01:03.649> up<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:05.059> about<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.300> half<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.690> turn<00:01:05.900> and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
it way up in about a half a turn and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.860 
it way up in about a half a turn and
then<00:01:07.040> I'm<00:01:07.159> going<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.340> bring<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.640> in<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.870> zero

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
then I'm going to bring it in to zero

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.650 
then I'm going to bring it in to zero
and<00:01:09.170> then<00:01:09.380> write<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:10.010> all<00:01:10.550> screws<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.450> nuts

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
and then write to all screws and nuts

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.950 
and then write to all screws and nuts
have<00:01:11.900> some<00:01:12.350> play<00:01:12.620> in<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.980> more<00:01:13.160> backlash<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.240> it

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
have some play in a more backlash and it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.370 
have some play in a more backlash and it
gets<00:01:15.140> even<00:01:15.440> worse<00:01:15.470> as<00:01:15.980> they<00:01:16.550> wear<00:01:16.850> but<00:01:17.380> here's

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
gets even worse as they wear but here's

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.500 
gets even worse as they wear but here's
an<00:01:18.530> illustration<00:01:19.040> using<00:01:19.580> this<00:01:19.910> bench<00:01:20.210> vise

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
an illustration using this bench vise

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
an illustration using this bench vise
here<00:01:20.980> look<00:01:21.980> at<00:01:22.100> how<00:01:22.220> much<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.610> can<00:01:22.670> move<00:01:22.970> that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
here look at how much I can move that

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.230 
here look at how much I can move that
movable<00:01:24.530> jaw<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.280> out<00:01:25.400> even<00:01:25.910> though<00:01:26.060> I'm

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
movable jaw in and out even though I'm

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.500 
movable jaw in and out even though I'm
not<00:01:26.480> rotating<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.320> screw<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.880> there's<00:01:29.270> all

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
not rotating the screw so there's all

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.390 
not rotating the screw so there's all
kinds<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:30.020> play<00:01:30.230> in<00:01:30.470> here<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.830> of<00:01:31.010> course<00:01:31.040> in<00:01:31.310> a

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
kinds of play in here and of course in a

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:43.080 
kinds of play in here and of course in a
bench<00:01:31.610> vise<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:32.120> couldn't<00:01:32.420> matter<00:01:32.570> less

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.389 

you

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.660 

now<00:01:49.399> there<00:01:49.729> are<00:01:49.969> two<00:01:50.479> screws<00:01:50.869> in<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:52.009> lei

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
now there are two screws in a lei

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.100 
now there are two screws in a lei
there's<00:01:53.090> one<00:01:53.299> here<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.610> cross<00:01:55.610> feed

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
there's one here in the cross feed

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.419 
there's one here in the cross feed
controlled<00:01:57.110> by<00:01:57.320> this<00:01:57.380> knob<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.159> then<00:01:58.250> there's

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
controlled by this knob and then there's

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:59.889 
controlled by this knob and then there's
another<00:01:58.549> one<00:01:58.939> up<00:01:59.090> here<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.450> compound

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
another one up here in the compound

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.809 
another one up here in the compound
controlled<00:02:00.439> by<00:02:00.649> this<00:02:00.710> knob<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:02.390> took<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
controlled by this knob and I took the

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.539 
controlled by this knob and I took the
little<00:02:04.819> love<00:02:05.469> compound<00:02:06.469> cross<00:02:06.829> light<00:02:07.130> off<00:02:07.369> of

little love compound cross light off of

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.729 
little love compound cross light off of
my<00:02:07.670> hardens<00:02:08.119> lathe<00:02:08.390> because<00:02:09.049> very<00:02:09.319> easy<00:02:09.530> to

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
my hardens lathe because very easy to

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.259 
my hardens lathe because very easy to
turn<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.039> upside<00:02:10.160> down<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.580> show<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.000> what

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
turn it upside down and show you what

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.759 
turn it upside down and show you what
that<00:02:11.299> looks<00:02:11.690> like<00:02:11.780> but<00:02:12.200> we<00:02:13.099> have<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.930> every

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
that looks like but we have and every

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.180 
that looks like but we have and every
lathe<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.730> Acme<00:02:17.540> screws<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.799> are<00:02:18.860> lead

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
lathe is Acme screws that are lead

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.309 
lathe is Acme screws that are lead
screws<00:02:19.579> by<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.209> way<00:02:20.360> their<00:02:20.510> left-hand<00:02:20.959> thread

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
screws by the way their left-hand thread

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.130 
screws by the way their left-hand thread
and<00:02:21.590> there's<00:02:22.579> always<00:02:22.760> brass<00:02:23.239> nuts<00:02:23.660> there<00:02:23.959> but

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
and there's always brass nuts there but

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.680 
and there's always brass nuts there but
these<00:02:24.319> where<00:02:24.650> now<00:02:25.579> this<00:02:25.849> little<00:02:26.000> hardens<00:02:26.450> laid

these where now this little hardens laid
here<00:02:27.019> there's<00:02:27.500> very<00:02:27.709> little<00:02:27.920> backlash<00:02:28.519> in

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
here there's very little backlash in

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.370 
here there's very little backlash in
there<00:02:28.970> aware<00:02:29.329> because<00:02:29.599> it's<00:02:29.810> had<00:02:29.989> very<00:02:30.200> little

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
there aware because it's had very little

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.069 
there aware because it's had very little
use<00:02:30.650> but<00:02:30.920> there's<00:02:31.069> always<00:02:31.250> some<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.569> in<00:02:32.720> older

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
use but there's always some but in older

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.559 
use but there's always some but in older
machines<00:02:33.470> again<00:02:33.799> okay<00:02:34.340> I've<00:02:34.549> mounted<00:02:34.819> a<00:02:35.060> dial

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
machines again okay I've mounted a dial

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.870 
machines again okay I've mounted a dial
indicator<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.739> lathe<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.250> it's<00:02:37.579> pushing

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
indicator on the lathe and it's pushing

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.750 
indicator on the lathe and it's pushing
up<00:02:38.150> against<00:02:38.599> the<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.560> tool<00:02:39.829> block<00:02:40.220> here<00:02:40.549> now

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
up against the the tool block here now

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.780 
up against the the tool block here now
and<00:02:41.180> I've<00:02:41.599> zeroed<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:43.069> watch<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.549> amount

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
and I've zeroed it but watch the amount

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.690 
and I've zeroed it but watch the amount
of<00:02:43.940> play<00:02:44.209> when<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.540> move<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.590> cross<00:02:45.980> slide<00:02:46.220> not

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
of play when I move the cross slide not

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.150 
of play when I move the cross slide not
the<00:02:46.849> Kanban<00:02:47.239> but<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> cross<00:02:47.720> slide<00:02:48.019> in<00:02:48.920> both

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
the Kanban but the cross slide in both

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.000 
the Kanban but the cross slide in both
directions<00:02:49.549> first<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.150> all<00:02:50.269> toward<00:02:50.630> me<00:02:50.889> and<00:02:51.889> I

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
directions first of all toward me and I

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.890 
directions first of all toward me and I
guess<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.370> already<00:02:52.639> had<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.209> way<00:02:53.389> but<00:02:53.450> if<00:02:53.780> I

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
guess I already had it that way but if I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.170 
guess I already had it that way but if I
push<00:02:54.109> it<00:02:54.260> away<00:02:54.470> now<00:02:55.299> we<00:02:56.299> have<00:02:57.010> about<00:02:58.180> 15,000

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
push it away now we have about 15,000

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.559 
push it away now we have about 15,000
sir<00:02:59.359> so<00:02:59.600> now<00:03:00.380> I'll<00:03:00.590> bring<00:03:00.769> it<00:03:00.950> back<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.569> you

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
sir so now I'll bring it back and you

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.900 
sir so now I'll bring it back and you
can<00:03:02.750> see<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.440> came<00:03:03.680> back<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.130> zero<00:03:04.400> so

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
can see that it came back to zero so

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.890 
can see that it came back to zero so
there<00:03:05.120> are<00:03:05.209> 15<00:03:05.530> thousands<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.769> play<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:08.440> that

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
there are 15 thousands of play and that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.629 
there are 15 thousands of play and that
screw<00:03:13.209> now<00:03:14.590> similarly<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.769> we<00:03:16.069> checked<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.519> on

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
screw now similarly if we checked it on

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.580 
screw now similarly if we checked it on
the<00:03:16.760> compound<00:03:17.299> we<00:03:17.540> would<00:03:17.690> have<00:03:17.930> at<00:03:18.139> least<00:03:18.170> that

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
the compound we would have at least that

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.259 
the compound we would have at least that
much<00:03:18.829> or<00:03:19.069> maybe<00:03:19.310> more<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.060> still<00:03:20.239> a

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
much or maybe more and this is still a

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.849 
much or maybe more and this is still a
lay<00:03:20.510> that's<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:20.900> pretty<00:03:21.079> good<00:03:21.290> shape

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
lay that's in pretty good shape

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.729 
lay that's in pretty good shape
and<00:03:22.569> one<00:03:23.569> other<00:03:23.720> thing<00:03:23.840> I'll<00:03:24.170> show<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.470> when

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
and one other thing I'll show you when

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.180 
and one other thing I'll show you when
you're<00:03:24.889> threading<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:26.500> I'm<00:03:27.500> going<00:03:27.859> to<00:03:27.950> throw

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
you're threading and I'm going to throw

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.870 
you're threading and I'm going to throw
the<00:03:28.430> half<00:03:28.609> nut<00:03:28.880> lever<00:03:29.180> on<00:03:30.280> engage<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.549> I<00:03:31.669> should

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
the half nut lever on engage it I should

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.849 
the half nut lever on engage it I should
say<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:34.010> engaged<00:03:34.489> but<00:03:34.910> look<00:03:35.120> at<00:03:35.239> how<00:03:35.389> much

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
say it's engaged but look at how much

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.729 
say it's engaged but look at how much
I'm<00:03:36.859> able<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.280> move<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.690> carriage<00:03:39.139> back<00:03:39.440> and

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
I'm able to move the carriage back and

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.289 
I'm able to move the carriage back and
forth<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.989> there<00:03:42.260> is<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.530> much<00:03:42.799> play<00:03:43.299> between

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
forth so there is that much play between

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.199 
forth so there is that much play between
the<00:03:44.599> half<00:03:45.079> nut<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:46.220> lead<00:03:46.400> screw<00:03:46.760> now

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
the half nut and the lead screw now

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.420 
the half nut and the lead screw now
that's<00:03:47.510> not<00:03:47.720> really<00:03:47.959> backlash<00:03:48.799> but<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.280> is

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
that's not really backlash but it is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.999 
that's not really backlash but it is
play<00:03:50.389> and<00:03:51.639> that<00:03:52.989> just<00:03:53.989> goes<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.410> show<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:54.650> that

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:55.009 
play and that just goes to show you that

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:56.710 
play and that just goes to show you that
whenever<00:03:55.190> you're<00:03:55.549> feeding<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.180> always<00:03:56.540> need

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
whenever you're feeding you always need

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.880 
whenever you're feeding you always need
to<00:03:56.750> feed<00:03:57.079> in<00:03:57.290> wonder

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890
