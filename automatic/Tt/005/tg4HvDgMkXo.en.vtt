pipes so something like this this is

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.459 
pipes so something like this this is
from<00:00:11.759> aerobic<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> foaming<00:00:13.259> root

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
from aerobic this is a foaming root

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.990 
from aerobic this is a foaming root
killer<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.190> what's<00:00:14.340> nice<00:00:14.490> about<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.940> is

they don't have any copper in this
product<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.400> also<00:00:17.580> expands<00:00:18.210> inside<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.930> main

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
product it also expands inside the main

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.200

drain<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.650> coat<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> whole<00:00:20.189> pipe<00:00:20.490> getting<00:00:21.060> all

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
drain to coat the whole pipe getting all

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
drain to coat the whole pipe getting all
the<00:00:21.330> way<00:00:21.420> around<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> joint<00:00:22.170> where<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.010> tree

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
the way around the joint where the tree

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.670 
the way around the joint where the tree
roots<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.699> find<00:00:23.939> water<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.390> nutrients<00:00:25.050> so

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
roots can find water and nutrients so

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
roots can find water and nutrients so
the<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.340> want<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.609> use<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.539> bottle

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the way we want to use this one bottle

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.270 
flush it twice and it's going to do a
fantastic<00:01:51.759> job<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.240> ruts<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:54.009> tree

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
fantastic job and ruts that the tree

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.819 
fantastic job and ruts that the tree
sends<00:01:54.670> out<00:01:54.849> they<00:01:55.209> can<00:01:55.390> be<00:01:55.539> as<00:01:55.689> tiny<00:01:56.200> as<00:01:56.349> a<00:01:56.439> human

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
sends out they can be as tiny as a human

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.370 
sends out they can be as tiny as a human
hair<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.369> when<00:01:57.849> they<00:01:57.970> find<00:01:58.239> those<00:01:58.450> joints<00:01:59.110> in

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
hair and when they find those joints in

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.809 
hair and when they find those joints in
your<00:01:59.530> main<00:01:59.709> drain<00:02:00.099> where<00:02:00.340> there's<00:02:00.489> a<00:02:00.549> little

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
your main drain where there's a little

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.359 
your main drain where there's a little
bit<00:02:00.939> of<00:02:01.060> water<00:02:01.360> seepage<00:02:01.959> they<00:02:02.590> get<00:02:02.950> into<00:02:03.189> that

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
bit of water seepage they get into that

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.609 
bit of water seepage they get into that
and<00:02:03.640> they<00:02:03.789> expand<00:02:04.239> very<00:02:04.450> quickly<00:02:04.569> in<00:02:05.259> effect

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
and they expand very quickly in effect

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.919 
and they expand very quickly in effect
because<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.459> main<00:02:06.729> drain<00:02:07.060> is<00:02:07.270> such<00:02:07.569> a<00:02:07.599> great

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
because a main drain is such a great

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.960 
because a main drain is such a great
place<00:02:08.229> for<00:02:08.259> nutrients<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.160> water<00:02:09.340> they

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
place for nutrients and water they

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.000 
place for nutrients and water they
expand<00:02:10.420> very<00:02:10.599> quickly<00:02:10.899> causing<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.500> clog<00:02:11.769> and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
expand very quickly causing a clog and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.589 
expand very quickly causing a clog and
they<00:02:12.069> can<00:02:12.220> actually<00:02:12.340> break<00:02:12.700> apart<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:13.329> pipe

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
they can actually break apart that pipe

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.289 
they can actually break apart that pipe
so<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.500> will<00:02:14.709> foam<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.370> will<00:02:15.519> go<00:02:15.700> into<00:02:15.970> that

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
so this will foam it will go into that

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.690 
so this will foam it will go into that
joint<00:02:17.079> and<00:02:17.349> it'll<00:02:17.799> actually<00:02:18.069> kill<00:02:18.340> everything

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
joint and it'll actually kill everything

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.069 
joint and it'll actually kill everything
there<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:18.970> if<00:02:19.030> there's<00:02:19.209> any<00:02:19.390> existing<00:02:19.840> roots

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
there and if there's any existing roots

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.270 
there and if there's any existing roots
it's<00:02:20.230> going<00:02:20.379> to<00:02:20.440> dry<00:02:20.680> them<00:02:20.829> out<00:02:20.950> make<00:02:21.190> them

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
it's going to dry them out make them

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.430 
it's going to dry them out make them
very<00:02:21.430> brittle<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.480> over<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.720> next<00:02:22.930> few<00:02:23.140> days

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
very brittle so over the next few days

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
break them all that way so an excellent

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.430 
break them all that way so an excellent
product<00:02:27.579> of<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.389> spawning<00:02:28.720> wood<00:02:29.019> killer<00:02:29.290> you
