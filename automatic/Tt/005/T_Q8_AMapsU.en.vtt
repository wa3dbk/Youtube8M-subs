00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.950
 Lufthansa airline plane 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.110
 made the flight from munich to warsaw 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.809
 could run into those in dangerous 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.209
 proximity drone german liner 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.950
 with 108 passengers on board went to 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.780
 landing at the airport of Warsaw 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.960
 when he was about the height 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.179
 700 meters 100 meters from it appeared 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.070
 drone previously similar 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.839
 the incident was fixed in the sky 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.689
 over north carolina crew 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.929
 passenger plane spotted bpl and on 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.090
 distance of only 30 meters on june 29 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.070
 the heathrow airport occurred even more 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.110
 dangerous case then drone 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.210
 flew less than twenty meters from 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.250
 aircraft expert in the field 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.399
 Aviation Richard Bloom believes that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.000
 uncontrolled use of bpl a 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.000
 poses a serious danger 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.750
 drones are increasingly used in 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.059
 commercial purposes or for fun 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.350
 at the same time flying bpl they are consistent with 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.390
 supervisory authorities 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.469
 even the military does not control such 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.449
 aircrafts 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.850
 that's why this problem represents 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.979
 serious danger is important here which 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.049
 dimensions can have drones what 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.729
 cargo they can transport what functions 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.680
 they may have to 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.509
 Legislatively approve these parameters 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.700
 until we have the appropriate 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:19.170
 regulatory documents drones 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.820
 pose a danger not only for 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.500
 civil aircraft airports 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.750
 us ministry of agriculture 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 recently released a poster calling not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.320
 use bpl while forest 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.360
 fires as they may encounter 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.840
 with fire helicopters drone 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.520
 pose a danger to society on 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.409
 my mind if not taken 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.659
 relevant legislation is 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.670
 including if new standards are not introduced 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.649
 international law sooner or later 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.409
 disaster will happen people will suffer 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.869
 there may be victims of the accident will inflict 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.850
 damage to infrastructure that's why 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.310
 it is necessary to develop such norms 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.840
 discussions on this topic are not stopped but 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.840
 until we reached the goal 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.329
 In addition, some civilians 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.719
 drones can be easily turned into 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.719
 fighting 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.540
 This video is published American

 teenager who set on 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.680
 drones gun as you see 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.310
 drone can produce shots 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.310
 on the fly and
