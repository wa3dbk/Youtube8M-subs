build<00:00:11.280> large<00:00:11.610> structures<00:00:12.150> by<00:00:12.330> crying<00:00:12.840> lots

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
build large structures by crying lots

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.690 
build large structures by crying lots
and<00:00:13.410> lots<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.650> cobblestone<00:00:14.160> without<00:00:14.490> you

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and lots of cobblestone without you

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.930 
and lots of cobblestone without you
having<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.360> go<00:00:15.570> mind<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.250> could<00:00:17.400> be

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
having to go mind for it so it could be

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.660 
having to go mind for it so it could be
in<00:00:18.000> big<00:00:18.270> straps<00:00:18.660> as<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:20.100> little

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
in big straps as you can with little

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.740 
in big straps as you can with little
effort<00:00:22.039> now<00:00:23.039> these<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.970> adapt<00:00:24.269> ations

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
effort now these are my adapt ations

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.870 
effort now these are my adapt ations
because<00:00:25.619> normally<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.400> don't<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.760> this

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
because normally they don't have this

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.640 
because normally they don't have this
back<00:00:27.150> bit<00:00:27.449> they<00:00:27.750> normally<00:00:28.199> have<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.349> water

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
back bit they normally have a water

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.070 
back bit they normally have a water
source<00:00:28.980> underneath<00:00:29.519> pushing<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.689> block<00:00:30.900> out

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
source underneath pushing one block out

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.560 
source underneath pushing one block out
which<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.650> had<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.980> mine<00:00:32.809> in<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.890> by<00:00:35.040> one

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
which you had to mine in like one by one

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.830 
which you had to mine in like one by one
but<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.690> one's<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.050> much<00:00:37.440> more<00:00:37.649> easier<00:00:38.840> so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
but this one's just much more easier so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.880 
but this one's just much more easier so
I'm<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.050> show<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> how<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> build<00:00:40.649> one

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
I'm going to show you how to build one

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.549 
I'm going to show you how to build one
of<00:00:40.920> these<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.719> would<00:00:42.719> do<00:00:42.899> over<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.260> but

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
of these I would do over there but

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
of these I would do over there but
paneles<00:00:43.950> socks<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.180> spawn<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.660> why<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
paneles socks from to spawn that's why I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.369 
paneles socks from to spawn that's why I
haven't<00:00:46.050> done<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> we're<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
haven't done that one so we're going to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
haven't done that one so we're going to
do<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:50.010> build<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.520> semicircle<00:00:51.120> down<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
do is build a semicircle down and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.660 
do is build a semicircle down and
another<00:00:52.320> semi<00:00:52.620> circle<00:00:53.120> there<00:00:55.550> you're<00:00:56.550> going

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
another semi circle there you're going

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.700 
another semi circle there you're going
to<00:00:56.730> build<00:00:56.879> them<00:00:57.000> free<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:58.280> dude<00:00:59.989> dude<00:01:00.989> dude

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
to build them free up dude dude dude

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.070 
to build them free up dude dude dude
dude<00:01:02.670> dude<00:01:04.040> then<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.189> put<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.240> there<00:01:06.720> one

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
dude dude then you put one now there one

in the middle and remove that one and /
cross<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.280> middle<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.299> fill<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
cross in the middle so you fill up the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
cross in the middle so you fill up the
entire<00:01:13.350> bottom<00:01:14.310> bit<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.360> won't<00:01:18.540> last

repeater<00:02:37.920> layout<00:02:38.220> now<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:41.760> make<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.030> look

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
repeater layout now to make it look

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.660 
repeater layout now to make it look
better<00:02:42.450> normally<00:02:43.110> cover<00:02:43.739> most<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.190> up<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.549> I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
better normally cover most of it up so I

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.400 
better normally cover most of it up so I
put<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:45.230> block<00:02:46.230> down<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:49.380> block<00:02:49.560> down<00:02:51.200> can<00:02:52.200> call

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
put a block down one block down can call

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.790 
put a block down one block down can call
of<00:02:52.530> some<00:02:52.709> blocks

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.690 

now<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.220> a<00:03:00.050> bill<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.080> makes<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.440> work<00:03:01.700> is

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
now this is a bill that makes it work is

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:11.449 
now this is a bill that makes it work is
the<00:03:02.910> water<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:04.350> lava<00:03:08.540> whoops<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:10.459> that

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
the water and the lava whoops that that

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.270 
the water and the lava whoops that that
doesn't<00:03:11.700> only<00:03:11.940> happen<00:03:12.240> only<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:13.280> principal

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
doesn't only happen only it principal

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.690 
doesn't only happen only it principal
sup<00:03:14.520> first<00:03:14.820> cup<00:03:15.060> song<00:03:15.300> faster<00:03:15.720> than<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.700> okay

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
sup first cup song faster than that okay

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.980 
sup first cup song faster than that okay
so<00:03:17.760> what<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.090> want<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.270> do<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.480> put<00:03:18.720> switch

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
so what you want to do is put switch

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.460 
so what you want to do is put switch
here<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:20.630> here<00:03:21.630> because<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.050> can<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.320> quite

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
here and here because it can be quite

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.890 
here and here because it can be quite
tricky<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.920> got<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.160> take<00:03:23.280> off<00:03:23.750> they're<00:03:24.750> not

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
tricky you got to take off they're not

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.330 
tricky you got to take off they're not
on<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.860> off<00:03:25.950> quite<00:03:26.340> quick<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.209> work

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
on and off quite quick for it to work

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.800 
on and off quite quick for it to work
and<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.120> see<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.360> start<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.660> produce

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
and you can see it start to produce

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.050 
and you can see it start to produce
cobblestone<00:03:31.880> so<00:03:32.880> easy<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.880> could<00:03:36.000> just

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
cobblestone so easy and you could just

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.990 
cobblestone so easy and you could just
minus<00:03:36.690> forever<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:38.070> build<00:03:38.220> whether<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.790> want

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
minus forever to build whether you want

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.840 
minus forever to build whether you want
it<00:03:41.720> does<00:03:42.720> take<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:42.989> second<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.500> uh<00:03:43.650> do<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.310> this

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
it does take a second to uh do it this

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.370 
it does take a second to uh do it this
much<00:03:45.150> more<00:03:45.390> easier<00:03:45.720> than<00:03:45.900> having<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.170> go<00:03:46.320> on

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
much more easier than having to go on

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.449 
much more easier than having to go on
wine<00:03:46.620> again<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:47.820> again<00:03:48.410> before<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:49.980> going

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
wine again and again before it and going

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.340 
wine again and again before it and going
underground<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:51.510> feel<00:03:51.720> building<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.170> like

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
underground you feel building that like

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.310 
underground you feel building that like
a<00:03:52.380> castle<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:54.150> much<00:03:54.510> easier<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.870> build<00:03:55.019> one

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
a castle it's much easier to build one

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.500 
a castle it's much easier to build one
of<00:03:55.350> these<00:03:55.530> above-ground<00:03:59.060> you<00:04:00.060> can<00:04:00.209> just<00:04:00.329> keep

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
of these above-ground you can just keep

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.640 
of these above-ground you can just keep
destroying<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.049> so<00:04:01.290> simple<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:04.320> last<00:04:04.500> thing

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650

I'll<00:04:04.799> normally<00:04:05.100> do<00:04:08.120> but<00:04:09.120> little<00:04:09.360> thing<00:04:09.510> on<00:04:09.630> top

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
I'll normally do but little thing on top

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.500 
I'll normally do but little thing on top
especially<00:04:11.070> for<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.280> lava<00:04:11.489> because<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.269> can

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
especially for the lava because it can

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
Barnea and on survival that's not Reese
