00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
in the Alpha you know if you get think

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.319 
in the Alpha you know if you get think
back<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> discussions<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.790> had<00:00:44.820> about

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
back to the discussions we had about

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.420 
back to the discussions we had about
traveling<00:00:45.780> around<00:00:46.050> systems<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.309> whole

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
traveling around systems and the whole

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.869 
traveling around systems and the whole
idea<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.820> supercruise<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.320> think<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> way

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
idea of supercruise and I think the way

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.400 
idea of supercruise and I think the way
sort<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> supercruise<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.230> actually

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
sort of supercruise now you can actually

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.139 
sort of supercruise now you can actually
play<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.190> something<00:00:53.520> has<00:00:53.640> gone<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> full

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
play it so something has gone the full

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
play it so something has gone the full
cycle<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:55.050> being<00:00:55.230> discussed<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.800> design

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
cycle from being discussed in the design

discussion<00:00:56.520> forum<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> various<00:00:57.270> different

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
discussion forum the various different

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.979 
discussion forum the various different
options<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.050> had<00:00:58.320> now<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> actually

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
options that we had now to actually

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.029 
options that we had now to actually
playing<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.379> think<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
playing it I think it's one of the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.660 
playing it I think it's one of the
beauties<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:03.140> alpha<00:01:04.140> 4<00:01:04.410> is<00:01:04.649> just<00:01:04.710> seeing<00:01:05.220> as

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
beauties of alpha 4 is just seeing as

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
beauties of alpha 4 is just seeing as
you<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.300> seeing<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.140> move<00:01:07.380> around

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
you know seeing that you move around

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.469 
you know seeing that you move around
systems<00:01:07.979> seeing<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.759> scale<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> whole

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
systems seeing a scale of the whole

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
systems seeing a scale of the whole
thing<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.619> emphasize<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> whether<00:01:11.399> you're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
thing really emphasize it whether you're

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.839 
thing really emphasize it whether you're
orbiting<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.030> star<00:01:12.539> or<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.550> complex<00:01:14.550> system

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:14.849 
orbiting a star or a complex system

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:16.790 
orbiting a star or a complex system
around<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> gas<00:01:15.660> giant<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:16.170> discovering

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
around the gas giant and discovering

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.139 
around the gas giant and discovering
other<00:01:16.920> players<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.789> that<00:01:17.910> sort

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
other players you know all of that sort

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.699 
other players you know all of that sort
of<00:01:18.179> side<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.599> things<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.050> would<00:01:19.590> have

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:19.709 
of side of things I think would have

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:21.620 
of side of things I think would have
been<00:01:19.800> quite<00:01:19.979> different<00:01:20.039> as<00:01:20.580> supercruise<00:01:21.420> not

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
been quite different as supercruise not

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.020 
been quite different as supercruise not
being<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.830> game<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.310> was

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
being in the game as it was

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.150 
being in the game as it was
so<00:01:25.630> just<00:01:26.140> talking<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.560> bit<00:01:26.680> about<00:01:26.830> some<00:01:27.040> of<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
so just talking a bit about some of the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.920 
so just talking a bit about some of the
things<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.700> I've<00:01:27.850> really<00:01:28.210> enjoyed<00:01:28.300> now<00:01:28.720> for

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
things that I've really enjoyed now for

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.570 
things that I've really enjoyed now for
for<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.350> know<00:01:29.410> feeling<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:29.980> contrast

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
for you know feeling the contrast

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.000 
for you know feeling the contrast
between<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.240> spaceships<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.990> know<00:01:32.530> there's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
between the spaceships you know there's

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.040 
between the spaceships you know there's
the<00:01:33.250> obviously<00:01:34.210> we<00:01:34.300> brought<00:01:34.479> in<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.720> eagle

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
the obviously we brought in the eagle

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.510 
the obviously we brought in the eagle
but<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.320> feels<00:01:35.590> quite<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:35.979> lot<00:01:36.160> like<00:01:36.310> the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
but that feels quite a lot like the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.370 
but that feels quite a lot like the
Sidewinder<00:01:37.240> but<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:37.570> specializing<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.260> bit

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
Sidewinder but just specializing a bit

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.830 
Sidewinder but just specializing a bit
more<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.650> combat<00:01:39.040> but<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.090> wonderful<00:01:40.330> lake<00:01:40.690> on

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
more in combat but the wonderful lake on

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.830 
more in combat but the wonderful lake on
type<00:01:41.050> 9<00:01:41.320> feels<00:01:41.950> does<00:01:42.430> feel<00:01:42.760> big<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.150> heavy<00:01:43.600> I

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
type 9 feels does feel big and heavy I

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.070 
type 9 feels does feel big and heavy I
love<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:45.430> practical<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.420> for<00:01:46.960> those

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
love the the practical and for those

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.170 
love the the practical and for those
who've<00:01:47.260> realized<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.010> multi-story<00:01:48.670> cockpit

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
who've realized the multi-story cockpit

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.080 
who've realized the multi-story cockpit
in<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.200> ship<00:01:50.440> very<00:01:50.800> very<00:01:51.040> big<00:01:51.220> ship<00:01:51.490> lots<00:01:51.940> of

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
in that ship very very big ship lots of

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.880 
in that ship very very big ship lots of
cargo<00:01:52.479> but<00:01:52.690> actually<00:01:53.050> not<00:01:53.200> brilliant<00:01:53.440> as<00:01:53.860> a

I<00:02:27.190> think<00:02:27.310> there<00:02:27.760> are<00:02:28.049> 46<00:02:29.049> different

and<00:02:34.570> more<00:02:34.840> unlikely<00:02:35.350> ones<00:02:35.650> but<00:02:36.489> I'm<00:02:36.640> sure<00:02:36.760> that

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
and more unlikely ones but I'm sure that

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.140

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
one of the things that I really love is

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.720 
one of the things that I really love is
the<00:02:42.880> feeling<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.540> scaled<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:45.310> get<00:02:45.520> in

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the feeling of scaled that you get in

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.790 
the feeling of scaled that you get in
you<00:02:46.239> get<00:02:46.390> now<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.690> alpha<00:02:46.930> for<00:02:47.140> more<00:02:47.349> so<00:02:47.590> than

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
you get now in alpha for more so than

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.220 
you get now in alpha for more so than
the<00:02:47.920> previous<00:02:48.250> alpha<00:02:48.489> phases<00:02:48.880> we've<00:02:49.840> seen<00:02:50.050> the

the previous alpha phases we've seen the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.620

Way down to a single star but also you

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.030 
Way down to a single star but also you
see<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.510> sense<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:56.050> scale<00:02:56.349> as<00:02:56.680> you're

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
see that sense of scale as you're

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.710 
see that sense of scale as you're
crossing<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.550> existing<00:02:57.970> systems<00:02:58.360> with<00:02:58.599> the

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
in size but as you approach them they

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.790

the screen going off the sides and then
you<00:03:13.900> start<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.350> see<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.799> billions<00:03:15.580> of<00:03:15.910> little

like that make up the Rings as you zoom

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.670 
like that make up the Rings as you zoom
in<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:21.940> see<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.569> they're<00:03:22.720> slowly<00:03:23.080> tumbling

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680

in you see that they're slowly tumbling
rocks<00:03:23.950> then<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.340> realized<00:03:24.730> each<00:03:25.000> Rock<00:03:25.390> is

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
rocks then you realized each Rock is

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.289 
rocks then you realized each Rock is
absolutely<00:03:26.380> huge<00:03:26.739> as<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.580> fly<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:27.970> amongst

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.949 
comes across here I it's only a backdrop
for<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.030> game<00:04:04.180> but<00:04:04.390> it's<00:04:04.540> something<00:04:04.840> that

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
for the game but it's something that

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.960 
for the game but it's something that
really<00:04:05.230> appeals<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.859> me<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.430> fact<00:04:06.579> that<00:04:06.730> that

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
really appeals to me the fact that that

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.150 
really appeals to me the fact that that
this<00:04:07.299> or<00:04:07.569> something<00:04:07.870> very<00:04:08.049> like<00:04:08.319> it<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:08.620> really

that's<00:04:28.870> something<00:04:29.139> that<00:04:29.229> I'm<00:04:29.380> very<00:04:29.410> excited

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
that's something that I'm very excited

making<00:04:44.289> a<00:04:44.530> game<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:44.950> we<00:04:45.070> can<00:04:45.190> all<00:04:45.490> be<00:04:46.000> very

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030
