probably<00:00:23.550> about<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.730> five<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.029> six<00:00:28.070> but<00:00:29.070> this

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
probably about a five or six but this

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.240 
probably about a five or six but this
video<00:00:30.029> will<00:00:30.359> only<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:31.019> Charizard<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

nine<00:02:20.400> next<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:21.519> have<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.700> reverse<00:02:22.150> holographic

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810

this<00:02:26.500> is<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.769> mint<00:02:27.040> 9<00:02:31.470> here<00:02:32.470> we<00:02:32.620> have<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.799> mint<00:02:33.130> 9

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
this is a mint 9 here we have a mint 9

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.030 
this is a mint 9 here we have a mint 9
non<00:02:34.030> holographic<00:02:34.870> charizard<00:02:35.440> from<00:02:35.680> supreme

non holographic charizard from supreme

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.539 
non holographic charizard from supreme
victors<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.620> we<00:02:41.620> have<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.830> second<00:02:42.400> one<00:02:42.430> of

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.180 
victors and we have a second one of
those<00:02:43.200> exact<00:02:44.200> same<00:02:44.230> thing<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.739> think<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.069> is

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
those exact same thing I think this is

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.030 
those exact same thing I think this is
in<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.459> newer<00:02:45.760> case<00:02:46.150> though<00:02:49.530> let's<00:02:50.530> been<00:02:50.680> right

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
in a newer case though let's been right

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.160 
in a newer case though let's been right
at<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.489> transition<00:02:52.150> because<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.630> cert

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
at the transition because the cert

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.979 
at the transition because the cert
numbers<00:02:53.530> aren't<00:02:53.739> too<00:02:54.010> far<00:02:54.310> off<00:02:54.489> maybe<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.510> five

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
numbers aren't too far off maybe a five

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.729 
numbers aren't too far off maybe a five
hundred<00:02:56.170> thousand<00:02:56.709> or<00:02:56.799> so<00:02:57.750> next<00:02:58.750> up<00:02:58.989> we<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.230> a

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
hundred thousand or so next up we have a

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.970 
hundred thousand or so next up we have a
Charizard<00:03:00.489> this<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.630> from<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.810> arceus<00:03:02.380> set

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
this is from storm front also Japanese

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:44.510 
this is from storm front also Japanese
mint<00:05:38.479> 9

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.180 

frontier<00:05:45.360> not<00:05:45.690> even<00:05:45.960> sure<00:05:46.169> what<00:05:46.560> set<00:05:46.860> that<00:05:46.889> is

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
frontier not even sure what set that is

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.680 
frontier not even sure what set that is
it<00:05:47.340> just<00:05:47.520> looks<00:05:47.699> like<00:05:47.819> the<00:05:47.940> supreme<00:05:48.150> victors

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
it just looks like the supreme victors

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:57.920 
it just looks like the supreme victors
one<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:49.020> me<00:05:49.430> Jim<00:05:50.430> meant<00:05:50.639> 10<00:05:56.659> this<00:05:57.659> one<00:05:57.840> right

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
one to me Jim meant 10 this one right

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.300 
one to me Jim meant 10 this one right
here<00:05:57.990> looks<00:05:58.379> like<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.680> boundaries<00:05:59.069> crossed

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
here looks like the boundaries crossed

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.010 
here looks like the boundaries crossed
one<00:05:59.610> but<00:05:59.789> i<00:05:59.819> guess<00:06:00.120> the<00:06:00.270> japanese<00:06:00.659> version<00:06:00.720> of

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
one but i guess the japanese version of

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.029 
one but i guess the japanese version of
that<00:06:01.080> it's<00:06:01.289> freeze<00:06:01.620> bolt<00:06:02.060> gym<00:06:03.060> in<00:06:03.240> 10<00:06:06.860> it<00:06:07.860> looks

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
that it's freeze bolt gym in 10 it looks

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.309 
that it's freeze bolt gym in 10 it looks
like<00:06:08.099> flash<00:06:08.430> fire<00:06:08.699> i<00:06:08.729> guess<00:06:09.090> this<00:06:09.419> is<00:06:09.599> mega

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
like flash fire i guess this is mega

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.159 
like flash fire i guess this is mega
battle<00:06:10.819> then<00:06:11.819> we'll<00:06:12.300> just<00:06:12.449> a<00:06:12.509> gem<00:06:12.750> mint<00:06:12.960> tin

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
battle then we'll just a gem mint tin
