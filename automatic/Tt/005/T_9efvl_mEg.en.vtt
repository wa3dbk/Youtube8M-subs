00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
broken foot injury the intuition liner

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.930 
broken foot injury the intuition liner
is<00:01:30.660> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.170> mold<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.700> really

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
is going to mold to it and that's really

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.410 
is going to mold to it and that's really
key<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.509> doesn't<00:01:33.750> matter<00:01:33.840> flatfoot<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.860> arch

key so it doesn't matter flatfoot I arch

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
key so it doesn't matter flatfoot I arch
anything<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.840> intuition<00:01:37.380> liner<00:01:37.410> is<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
anything the intuition liner is going to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.550 
anything the intuition liner is going to
be<00:01:38.460> comfortable<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.320> right

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
be comfortable for you so that right

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.230 
be comfortable for you so that right
there<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.220> reason<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.940> should<00:01:41.970> try

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
there is a reason that you should try

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330 
there is a reason that you should try
ride<00:01:42.570> boots<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.770> next<00:01:44.009> thing<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.220> to

a lot of companies really use a ton of

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.930 
a lot of companies really use a ton of
different<00:01:48.720> pieces<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:50.009> lot<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.280> glue<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
different pieces and a lot of glue and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.219 
different pieces and a lot of glue and
you<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.690> good<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you know that's not good for the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.900 
you know that's not good for the
environment<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.220> not<00:01:53.460> good<00:01:53.729> for

your wallet because boots that use a lot

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.430 
your wallet because boots that use a lot
of<00:01:56.190> glue<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.970> lot<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.300> parts<00:01:57.600> break<00:01:58.140> down<00:01:58.410> a

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
of glue and a lot of parts break down a

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.980 
of glue and a lot of parts break down a
lot<00:01:58.740> faster<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.729> as<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.210> start<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.720> flex

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
lot faster you know as you start to flex

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.260 
lot faster you know as you start to flex
them<00:02:01.259> start<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> break<00:02:02.250> them<00:02:02.460> down<00:02:02.490> they

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
them start to break them down they

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.060 
them start to break them down they
really<00:02:03.510> break<00:02:03.750> down<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.380> much<00:02:04.560> faster<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
really break down so much faster that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.670 
really break down so much faster that
glue<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.700> accelerates<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.600> process<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.650> you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
glue just accelerates the process so you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.040 
glue just accelerates the process so you
get<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.340> fight<00:02:08.670> top<00:02:08.880> construction<00:02:09.540> in<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
get that fight top construction in the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.040 
get that fight top construction in the
majority<00:02:10.350> of<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> ride<00:02:10.860> boots<00:02:11.519> out<00:02:12.450> there<00:02:12.750> so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
majority of the ride boots out there so

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.289 
majority of the ride boots out there so
you're<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.799> get<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> longer-lasting<00:02:14.640> boo

performing great at 80 days as they were
five<00:02:29.610> days<00:02:29.909> so<00:02:30.390> that's<00:02:30.510> really<00:02:30.840> important<00:02:31.260> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
five days so that's really important to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.649 
five days so that's really important to
think<00:02:31.500> about<00:02:31.909> the<00:02:32.909> other<00:02:33.030> big<00:02:33.239> thing<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.510> want

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
think about the other big thing I want

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.000

to<00:02:33.689> talk<00:02:33.840> about<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.349> new<00:02:34.470> tongue-tied

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
to talk about is the new tongue-tied

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.250 
to talk about is the new tongue-tied
technology<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:36.090> not<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.480> every<00:02:36.780> ride<00:02:37.019> boot

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
technology it's not in every ride boot

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.869 
technology it's not in every ride boot
that's<00:02:37.470> definitely<00:02:38.040> float<00:02:38.310> through<00:02:38.579> several

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
that's definitely float through several

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.789 
that's definitely float through several
models<00:02:39.390> you're<00:02:39.930> going<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.379> extra

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
models you're going to get this extra

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.080

Trident you're noticing three but this

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.399 
Trident you're noticing three but this
one<00:02:44.489> right<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> inside<00:02:45.569> actually

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
controls the inner harness so it really

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.619 
controls the inner harness so it really
sucks<00:02:49.349> down<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.980> pools<00:02:50.400> your<00:02:51.120> heel<00:02:51.390> back
