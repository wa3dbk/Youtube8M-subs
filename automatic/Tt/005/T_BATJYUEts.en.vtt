well<00:00:05.240> here<00:00:05.570> we<00:00:05.660> have<00:00:05.690> a<00:00:05.870> Cobra<00:00:06.770> 200<00:00:08.050> gTLD<00:00:09.050> X<00:00:09.350> and

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
well here we have a Cobra 200 gTLD X and

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.549 
well here we have a Cobra 200 gTLD X and
this<00:00:11.150> one's<00:00:11.389> come<00:00:11.660> to<00:00:11.690> me<00:00:11.870> a<00:00:11.900> friend<00:00:12.320> of<00:00:12.410> mine

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
this one's come to me a friend of mine

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.530 
this one's come to me a friend of mine
has<00:00:12.710> bought<00:00:12.920> this<00:00:13.130> and<00:00:14.030> he's<00:00:14.120> picked<00:00:14.360> it<00:00:14.450> up

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
has bought this and he's picked it up

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.780 
has bought this and he's picked it up
rather<00:00:14.840> cheap<00:00:15.200> and<00:00:15.440> of<00:00:16.250> course<00:00:16.430> there<00:00:16.640> is<00:00:16.760> a

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
rather cheap and of course there is a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.450 
rather cheap and of course there is a
reason<00:00:17.180> why<00:00:17.380> now<00:00:18.380> when<00:00:18.770> we<00:00:18.860> key<00:00:19.040> up<00:00:19.160> on<00:00:19.340> this

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
reason why now when we key up on this

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.430 
reason why now when we key up on this
Cobra<00:00:20.800> there<00:00:21.800> is<00:00:21.949> absolutely<00:00:22.840> no<00:00:23.840> output

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
Cobra there is absolutely no output

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.730 
Cobra there is absolutely no output
power<00:00:24.680> at<00:00:25.279> all<00:00:25.779> not<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:27.050> thing

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
power at all not a thing

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.210 
power at all not a thing
and<00:00:27.939> I<00:00:28.939> suspect<00:00:29.210> that<00:00:29.810> we<00:00:30.710> have<00:00:30.859> a<00:00:30.890> look<00:00:31.070> here

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
and I suspect that we have a look here

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.910 
and I suspect that we have a look here
on<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.460> meat<00:00:31.640> are<00:00:31.789> there<00:00:32.290> nothing<00:00:33.290> on<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:33.739> to

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
on the meat are there nothing on the to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.450 
on the meat are there nothing on the to
watt<00:00:34.100> scale<00:00:34.400> we'll<00:00:34.640> just<00:00:34.790> go<00:00:34.940> over<00:00:35.090> to<00:00:35.830> am<00:00:36.830> of<00:00:37.370> a

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
watt scale we'll just go over to am of a

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.790 
watt scale we'll just go over to am of a
look<00:00:38.290> nothing<00:00:39.290> at<00:00:39.409> all

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
look nothing at all

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.850 
look nothing at all
TX<00:00:40.159> light<00:00:40.370> is<00:00:40.519> on<00:00:40.670> nothing<00:00:41.239> on<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.449> meter<00:00:41.860> FM

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
TX light is on nothing on the meter FM

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.680 
TX light is on nothing on the meter FM
mode<00:00:43.960> yeah<00:00:45.549> nothing<00:00:46.549> nothing<00:00:47.150> on<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.479> meter

mode yeah nothing nothing on the meter

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.000 
mode yeah nothing nothing on the meter
at<00:00:48.170> all<00:00:48.409> and<00:00:49.309> I<00:00:49.400> suspect<00:00:50.379> it's<00:00:51.379> what<00:00:51.589> I<00:00:51.620> think

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
at all and I suspect it's what I think

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.979 
at all and I suspect it's what I think
it's<00:00:52.159> going<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.400> be<00:00:52.580> it's<00:00:53.299> probably<00:00:53.750> going<00:00:53.900> to

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
it's going to be it's probably going to

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.380 
it's going to be it's probably going to
be<00:00:54.080> the<00:00:54.350> RF<00:00:54.830> driver<00:00:55.129> MOSFET<00:00:55.670> in<00:00:55.879> this<00:00:56.000> radio

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
be the RF driver MOSFET in this radio

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.820 
be the RF driver MOSFET in this radio
which<00:00:56.659> is<00:00:56.690> quite<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.019> common<00:00:57.290> fault

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
which is quite a common fault

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.410 
which is quite a common fault
it's<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.580> Mitsubishi<00:00:59.119> Rd<00:01:00.110> 16<00:01:00.739> H<00:01:01.040> hf1

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
it's a Mitsubishi Rd 16 H hf1

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.160 
it's a Mitsubishi Rd 16 H hf1
so<00:01:03.379> I'm<00:01:03.650> going<00:01:03.949> to<00:01:04.129> dismantle<00:01:04.670> our<00:01:05.000> 200<00:01:05.720> do<00:01:06.140> a

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
so I'm going to dismantle our 200 do a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:17.530 
so I'm going to dismantle our 200 do a
few<00:01:06.440> tests<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.329> then<00:01:08.329> we'll<00:01:08.359> go<00:01:08.689> from<00:01:08.869> there

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:58.140 

you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.200 

okay<00:01:59.150> well<00:01:59.450> here's<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.900> Cobra<00:02:00.130> 202<00:02:01.130> GTL<00:02:01.670> DX

okay well here's the Cobra 202 GTL DX

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.740 
okay well here's the Cobra 202 GTL DX
I've<00:02:02.810> installed<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.500> new<00:02:03.910> RF<00:02:04.910> driver<00:02:05.210> MOSFET

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
I've installed a new RF driver MOSFET

I've installed a new RF driver MOSFET
down<00:02:05.960> there<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.350> very<00:02:06.380> common<00:02:06.950> full-on<00:02:07.370> these

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
down there is very common full-on these

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.880 
down there is very common full-on these
two<00:02:07.790> hundreds<00:02:08.270> on<00:02:09.020> many<00:02:09.320> of<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.590> earlier

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
two hundreds on many of the earlier

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.970 
two hundreds on many of the earlier
versions<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.900> gate<00:02:11.900> voltage<00:02:12.290> which<00:02:12.950> is

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
versions the gate voltage which is

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.150 
versions the gate voltage which is
adjusted<00:02:13.670> down<00:02:13.880> there<00:02:14.180> was<00:02:15.140> set<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.650> high<00:02:15.890> on

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
adjusted down there was set to high on

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.770 
adjusted down there was set to high on
many<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.640> earlier<00:02:16.970> ones<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:17.570> cause

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
many of the earlier ones and it's cause

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.770 
many of the earlier ones and it's cause
the<00:02:17.960> MOSFETs<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.590> burn<00:02:18.770> out<00:02:19.010> prematurely<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the MOSFETs to burn out prematurely the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.750 
the MOSFETs to burn out prematurely the
voltage<00:02:21.200> on<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.500> gate<00:02:21.530> should<00:02:22.160> be<00:02:22.370> around

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
voltage on the gate should be around

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.580 
voltage on the gate should be around
three<00:02:23.090> point<00:02:23.360> two<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.780> three<00:02:23.990> point<00:02:24.290> four

volts

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.040 
volts
I<00:02:25.430> always<00:02:25.820> set<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> gate<00:02:26.360> voltage<00:02:26.600> before

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
I always set the gate voltage before

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.080 
I always set the gate voltage before
installing<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.920> new<00:02:27.950> transistor<00:02:28.070> it's<00:02:28.850> always

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
installing a new transistor it's always

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.110 
installing a new transistor it's always
a<00:02:29.120> good<00:02:29.300> idea<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:29.960> that<00:02:30.580> any<00:02:31.580> higher<00:02:31.910> and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
a good idea to do that any higher and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.420 
a good idea to do that any higher and
the<00:02:32.570> transistor<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.500> MOSFET<00:02:33.890> itself<00:02:34.280> is

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
the transistor the MOSFET itself is

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.610 
the transistor the MOSFET itself is
going<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.610> run<00:02:34.850> hot<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.270> burn<00:02:35.450> out<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.500> is

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
going to run hot and burn out and it is

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.830 
going to run hot and burn out and it is
quite<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.920> common<00:02:37.160> fault<00:02:37.460> also<00:02:37.670> MOSFETs<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.600> very

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
quite a common fault also MOSFETs a very

quite a common fault also MOSFETs a very
static<00:02:39.350> sensitive<00:02:39.940> my<00:02:40.940> advice<00:02:41.300> is<00:02:41.570> if<00:02:41.600> you<00:02:41.810> own

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
static sensitive my advice is if you own

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.660 
static sensitive my advice is if you own
one<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.170> these<00:02:42.350> radios<00:02:42.860> or<00:02:43.010> another<00:02:43.280> radio

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
one of these radios or another radio

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.490 
one of these radios or another radio
that<00:02:43.880> uses<00:02:44.210> these<00:02:44.300> types<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.720> devices<00:02:44.990> make

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
that uses these types of devices make

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.340 
that uses these types of devices make
sure<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.120> always<00:02:47.360> unplug<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.960> antenna

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
sure that you always unplug the antenna

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.020 
sure that you always unplug the antenna
if<00:02:48.530> there's<00:02:48.710> a<00:02:48.770> storm<00:02:49.130> around<00:02:49.490> those<00:02:49.790> little

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
if there's a storm around those little

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.660 
if there's a storm around those little
bursts<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.840> static<00:02:51.110> destroy<00:02:51.830> those<00:02:52.040> MOSFETs

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
bursts of static destroy those MOSFETs

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.420 
bursts of static destroy those MOSFETs
all<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.690> time<00:02:53.930> many<00:02:54.380> people<00:02:54.500> have<00:02:55.040> found<00:02:55.280> that

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
all the time many people have found that
