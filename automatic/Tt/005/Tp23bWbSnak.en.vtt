00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
and the midfield lines is much better so

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.710 
and the midfield lines is much better so
the<00:03:39.010> team<00:03:39.220> generally<00:03:39.700> tries<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.360> hold<00:03:40.510> its

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
shape much better and it results in this

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.600 
shape much better and it results in this
