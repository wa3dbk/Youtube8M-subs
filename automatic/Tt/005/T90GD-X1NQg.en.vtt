going to add a Dino mode and they

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.650 
going to add a Dino mode and they
definitely<00:01:47.369> weren't<00:01:47.759> which<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.330> like<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
definitely weren't which is like a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.050

that<00:03:22.220> if<00:03:22.760> we<00:03:23.420> weren't<00:03:23.630> going<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.050> get<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.170> dynamo

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
that if we weren't going to get a dynamo

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.960 
that if we weren't going to get a dynamo
why<00:03:24.800> would<00:03:24.950> he<00:03:25.040> say<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.250> if<00:03:25.580> they're<00:03:25.730> not

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
why would he say that if they're not

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.880 
why would he say that if they're not
desperately<00:03:26.840> trying<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.350> figure<00:03:27.620> out<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.769> way

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
desperately trying to figure out a way

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.370 
desperately trying to figure out a way
to<00:03:27.950> happen<00:03:28.340> now<00:03:28.910> I'm<00:03:29.209> not<00:03:29.390> saying<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:30.110> it's

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
to happen now I'm not saying that it's

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.960 
to happen now I'm not saying that it's
definitely<00:03:30.950> going<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.190> happen<00:03:31.580> because<00:03:31.700> who

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
definitely going to happen because who

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.309 
definitely going to happen because who
knows<00:03:32.150> they<00:03:32.360> might<00:03:32.390> be<00:03:32.630> working<00:03:32.870> on<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.230> and

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
knows they might be working on it and

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.960 
knows they might be working on it and
they<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:33.680> can't<00:03:33.980> get<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.459> formula

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
they just can't get that formula

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.509 
they just can't get that formula
together<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:36.110> makes<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.590> game<00:03:36.769> mode<00:03:37.070> super

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
together that makes the game mode super

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.190 
together that makes the game mode super
enjoyable<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.180> they<00:03:38.510> might<00:03:38.720> just<00:03:38.900> scratch

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
enjoyable and they might just scratch

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.640 
enjoyable and they might just scratch
the<00:03:39.470> idea<00:03:39.799> but<00:03:40.489> we<00:03:40.880> do<00:03:41.209> know<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:41.930> I'm<00:03:42.320> saying

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
the idea but we do know and I'm saying

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.770 
the idea but we do know and I'm saying
we<00:03:42.799> do<00:03:43.040> know<00:03:43.310> because<00:03:43.790> if<00:03:44.030> we<00:03:44.239> didn't<00:03:44.600> know

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
we do know because if we didn't know

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.690 
we do know because if we didn't know
this<00:03:45.019> they<00:03:45.230> would<00:03:45.410> just<00:03:45.440> deny<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:46.040> entire

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
this they would just deny the entire

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.509 
this they would just deny the entire
idea<00:03:47.030> we<00:03:47.900> do<00:03:48.170> know<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.470> they<00:03:48.829> are<00:03:48.950> possibly

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
idea we do know that they are possibly

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.509 
idea we do know that they are possibly
working<00:03:49.940> on<00:03:50.269> an<00:03:50.450> idea<00:03:50.570> of<00:03:51.079> trying<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:52.070> make<00:03:52.280> it

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
working on an idea of trying to make it

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.240 
working on an idea of trying to make it
now<00:03:53.239> another<00:03:53.750> belief<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.829> lot<00:03:55.130> of

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
now another belief is that a lot of

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.100 
now another belief is that a lot of
people<00:03:55.519> say<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.760> they<00:03:56.060> are<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:56.480> focused<00:03:56.750> on

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
people say that they are so focused on

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.380 
people say that they are so focused on
perfecting<00:03:57.680> battlefield<00:03:58.430> 4<00:03:58.730> that<00:03:59.239> they're

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
perfecting battlefield 4 that they're

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.180 
perfecting battlefield 4 that they're
not<00:03:59.600> going<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.079> take<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.500> time<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:01.010> make<00:04:01.160> a

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
not going to take the time to make a

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.030 
not going to take the time to make a
dino<00:04:01.519> mode<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.120> my<00:04:02.690> argument<00:04:03.079> to<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:03.650> is

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
dino mode and my argument to that is

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.370 
dino mode and my argument to that is
that<00:04:04.310> whenever<00:04:04.880> they<00:04:05.180> showed<00:04:05.480> battlefield<00:04:06.109> 4

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
that whenever they showed battlefield 4

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.699 
that whenever they showed battlefield 4
the<00:04:06.590> pre-alpha<00:04:07.220> version<00:04:07.519> at<00:04:08.180> e3<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:09.290> looked

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
the pre-alpha version at e3 it looked

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.130 
the pre-alpha version at e3 it looked
phenomenal<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.670> was<00:04:10.880> not<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.570> wasn't<00:04:11.900> perfect

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
phenomenal it was not it wasn't perfect

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.550 
phenomenal it was not it wasn't perfect
by<00:04:12.470> any<00:04:12.500> means<00:04:12.739> but<00:04:13.579> it<00:04:13.760> was<00:04:13.970> way<00:04:14.480> further<00:04:14.900> oo<00:04:15.079> a

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
by any means but it was way further oo a

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.740 
by any means but it was way further oo a
way<00:04:15.980> further<00:04:16.280> in<00:04:16.609> production<00:04:17.299> then

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
way further in production then

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.909 
way further in production then
battlefield<00:04:18.440> 3<00:04:18.709> was<00:04:18.919> during<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.489> beta<00:04:19.850> so

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
battlefield 3 was during the beta so

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.490 
battlefield 3 was during the beta so
anytime<00:04:21.919> from<00:04:22.340> e3<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.630> release<00:04:23.990> maybe

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
anytime from e3 to the release maybe

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.140 
anytime from e3 to the release maybe
they've<00:04:24.770> been<00:04:24.950> working<00:04:25.340> on<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.490> dyno<00:04:25.820> mode

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
they've been working on a dyno mode

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.570 
they've been working on a dyno mode
they've<00:04:26.330> had<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.539> good<00:04:26.810> six<00:04:27.229> months<00:04:27.500> or<00:04:27.740> so<00:04:27.979> to

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
they've had a good six months or so to

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.210 
they've had a good six months or so to
work<00:04:28.820> on<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.030> dyno<00:04:29.330> mode<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:29.990> I'm<00:04:30.220> assuming

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
work on a dyno mode and I'm assuming

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.310 
work on a dyno mode and I'm assuming
that<00:04:31.580> they<00:04:31.729> probably<00:04:32.090> started<00:04:32.570> working<00:04:33.140> on<00:04:33.260> it

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
that they probably started working on it

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.170 
that they probably started working on it
after<00:04:33.620> they<00:04:34.190> got<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.520> basics<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.150> the

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
after they got the basics of the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.940 
after they got the basics of the
multiplayer<00:04:35.720> down<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.260> all<00:04:36.380> they<00:04:36.530> had<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.710> do

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
multiplayer down and all they had to do

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.650 
multiplayer down and all they had to do
was<00:04:37.160> add<00:04:37.340> some<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.789> smaller<00:04:38.090> things<00:04:38.390> they

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
was add some of the smaller things they

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.210 
was add some of the smaller things they
got<00:04:38.870> all<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.169> maps<00:04:39.440> designed<00:04:39.919> everything

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
got all the maps designed everything

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.159 
got all the maps designed everything
like<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.520> they've<00:04:41.300> got<00:04:41.450> the<00:04:41.599> graphics

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
like that they've got the graphics

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.740 
like that they've got the graphics
perfected<00:04:42.830> then<00:04:43.520> they<00:04:43.789> moved<00:04:44.030> on<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.390> the<00:04:44.510> Dino

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
perfected then they moved on to the Dino

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.150 
perfected then they moved on to the Dino
mode<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.200> I'm<00:04:45.289> saying<00:04:45.590> they've<00:04:45.770> got

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
mode so I'm saying they've got

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.740 
mode so I'm saying they've got
probably<00:04:46.430> about<00:04:46.550> six<00:04:46.910> months<00:04:47.090> put<00:04:47.390> into<00:04:47.600> that

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
probably about six months put into that

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.320 
probably about six months put into that
which<00:04:48.380> may<00:04:48.800> not<00:04:49.040> come<00:04:49.430> out<00:04:49.520> with<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.880> best

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
which may not come out with the best

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.260 
which may not come out with the best
game<00:04:50.720> ever<00:04:50.990> but<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.890> is<00:04:52.100> not<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.340> standalone<00:04:52.910> it

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
game ever but it is not a standalone it

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.630 
game ever but it is not a standalone it
is<00:04:53.420> in<00:04:53.540> addition<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.230> game<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:55.100> I<00:04:55.130> think<00:04:55.520> it

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
is in addition to a game so I think it

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.490 
is in addition to a game so I think it
will<00:04:55.760> still<00:04:56.000> work<00:04:56.030> out<00:04:56.570> very<00:04:56.870> well<00:04:57.050> and

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
will still work out very well and

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.890 
will still work out very well and
they've<00:04:58.130> already<00:04:58.340> got<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.700> game<00:04:58.910> engine<00:04:59.300> set

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
they've already got the game engine set

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.720 
they've already got the game engine set
up<00:05:00.080> all<00:05:00.260> they<00:05:00.380> have<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.530> do<00:05:00.680> they<00:05:00.890> kind<00:05:01.220> of<00:05:01.340> did

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
up all they have to do they kind of did

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.400 
up all they have to do they kind of did
just<00:05:01.940> take<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.390> multiplayer<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.020> kind<00:05:03.260> of

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
just take the multiplayer and kind of

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.710 
just take the multiplayer and kind of
mold<00:05:03.740> it<00:05:03.950> to<00:05:03.980> fit<00:05:04.310> together<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.940> in<00:05:05.360> six

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
mold it to fit together and in six

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.570 
mold it to fit together and in six
months<00:05:05.930> time<00:05:06.110> they<00:05:06.590> could<00:05:06.800> very<00:05:07.070> well<00:05:07.160> make<00:05:07.520> a

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
months time they could very well make a

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.330 
months time they could very well make a
good<00:05:08.000> Dino<00:05:08.270> mode<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:08.780> I'm<00:05:09.140> very<00:05:09.530> convinced

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
good Dino mode and I'm very convinced

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.640 
good Dino mode and I'm very convinced
that<00:05:10.550> it's<00:05:10.730> going<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:11.060> happen<00:05:11.300> because<00:05:11.690> as<00:05:12.080> I

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
that it's going to happen because as I

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.680 
that it's going to happen because as I
said<00:05:12.710> before<00:05:12.890> if<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:14.150> weren't<00:05:14.300> going<00:05:14.600> to

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
said before if it weren't going to

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.690 
said before if it weren't going to
happen<00:05:15.050> they<00:05:15.200> would<00:05:15.410> not<00:05:15.620> lead<00:05:16.010> us<00:05:16.040> on<00:05:16.400> they

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
happen they would not lead us on they

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.370 
happen they would not lead us on they
would<00:05:16.880> let<00:05:17.060> us<00:05:17.210> know<00:05:17.450> immediately<00:05:17.630> that<00:05:18.260> they

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
would let us know immediately that they

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.230 
would let us know immediately that they
are<00:05:18.530> not<00:05:18.770> going<00:05:19.040> to<00:05:19.160> be<00:05:19.250> adding<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.580> dynamo<00:05:20.000> that

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
are not going to be adding a dynamo that

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.850 
are not going to be adding a dynamo that
does<00:05:20.390> not<00:05:20.600> fit<00:05:20.900> into<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.320> battlefield

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
does not fit into the battlefield

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.810 
does not fit into the battlefield
profile<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:22.700> we<00:05:23.300> will<00:05:23.480> not<00:05:23.780> see<00:05:24.170> that<00:05:24.410> now<00:05:25.130> one

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
profile and we will not see that now one

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.120 
profile and we will not see that now one
last<00:05:26.060> thing<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.330> want<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.540> mention<00:05:26.600> is<00:05:27.050> that

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
last thing I want to mention is that

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.470 
last thing I want to mention is that
just<00:05:28.130> because<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.520> say<00:05:28.700> all<00:05:28.820> this<00:05:28.940> stuff<00:05:29.210> does

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
just because I say all this stuff does

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.510 
just because I say all this stuff does
not<00:05:29.660> mean<00:05:29.930> that<00:05:29.960> we<00:05:30.260> will<00:05:30.380> see<00:05:30.710> a<00:05:30.740> Dino<00:05:31.070> mode<00:05:31.310> in

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
not mean that we will see a Dino mode in

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.520 
not mean that we will see a Dino mode in
the<00:05:31.670> vanilla<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.450> game<00:05:32.690> that<00:05:33.260> also

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
the vanilla of the game that also

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.440 
the vanilla of the game that also
doesn't<00:05:33.830> mean<00:05:34.040> that<00:05:34.190> we're<00:05:34.400> going<00:05:34.970> to<00:05:35.090> see<00:05:35.330> it

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
doesn't mean that we're going to see it

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.200 
doesn't mean that we're going to see it
100%<00:05:35.870> sure<00:05:36.200> but<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.100> do<00:05:37.250> think<00:05:37.700> we're<00:05:37.910> going<00:05:38.030> to

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
100% sure but I do think we're going to

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.960 
100% sure but I do think we're going to
eventually<00:05:38.720> see<00:05:39.020> it<00:05:39.350> possibly<00:05:39.950> in<00:05:40.130> a<00:05:40.220> DLC<00:05:40.730> if

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
eventually see it possibly in a DLC if

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.870 
eventually see it possibly in a DLC if
not<00:05:41.240> in<00:05:41.450> the<00:05:41.570> vanilla<00:05:41.810> of<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.170> game<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:42.880> then

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
not in the vanilla of the game and then

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.220 
not in the vanilla of the game and then
we'll<00:05:44.090> end<00:05:44.240> up<00:05:44.330> being<00:05:44.540> able<00:05:44.690> to<00:05:44.750> play<00:05:44.900> it<00:05:45.020> maybe

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
we'll end up being able to play it maybe

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.720 
we'll end up being able to play it maybe
it's<00:05:45.410> something<00:05:45.650> in<00:05:45.830> final<00:05:46.190> stand<00:05:46.430> i'm<00:05:46.550> not

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
it's something in final stand i'm not

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.180 
it's something in final stand i'm not
sure<00:05:46.970> but<00:05:47.210> if<00:05:47.810> they<00:05:47.990> do<00:05:48.050> work<00:05:48.560> with<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.830> idea

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
sure but if they do work with the idea

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.830 
sure but if they do work with the idea
and<00:05:49.430> they<00:05:49.610> find<00:05:49.910> out<00:05:50.090> that<00:05:50.150> it's<00:05:50.450> just<00:05:50.660> not

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
and they find out that it's just not

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.660 
and they find out that it's just not
working<00:05:51.110> out<00:05:51.410> and<00:05:51.650> they<00:05:51.740> have<00:05:51.920> to<00:05:52.100> scratch<00:05:52.400> the

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
working out and they have to scratch the

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.790 
working out and they have to scratch the
idea<00:05:53.000> i<00:05:53.210> wouldn't<00:05:53.780> be<00:05:53.810> surprised<00:05:54.350> but<00:05:54.620> i<00:05:54.680> do

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
idea i wouldn't be surprised but i do

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.160 
idea i wouldn't be surprised but i do
know<00:05:55.220> for<00:05:55.430> a<00:05:55.490> fact<00:05:55.820> and<00:05:56.090> i<00:05:56.600> say<00:05:56.840> for<00:05:57.080> a<00:05:57.140> fact

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
know for a fact and i say for a fact

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.590 
know for a fact and i say for a fact
again<00:05:57.740> because<00:05:58.400> they<00:05:58.700> have<00:05:58.910> not<00:05:59.060> denied<00:05:59.420> it

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
again because they have not denied it

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.380 
again because they have not denied it
I'm<00:05:59.930> very<00:06:00.500> certain<00:06:00.950> that<00:06:01.370> they<00:06:01.880> are<00:06:02.000> working

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
I'm very certain that they are working

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.140 
I'm very certain that they are working
on<00:06:02.690> making<00:06:02.840> a<00:06:03.110> Dino<00:06:03.350> mode<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:03.919> they're<00:06:04.820> still
