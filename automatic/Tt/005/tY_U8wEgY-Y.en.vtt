00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hello my name is Charles and today we're

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.570 
hello my name is Charles and today we're
going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.639> have<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.790> look<00:00:03.000> at<00:00:03.179> ways<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.580> altering

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
going to have a look at ways of altering

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.089 
going to have a look at ways of altering
skin<00:00:06.000> tone<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:07.049> if<00:00:07.319> we<00:00:07.440> look<00:00:07.589> at<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.799> picture

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
skin tone and if we look at this picture

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.030 
skin tone and if we look at this picture
here<00:00:08.460> we<00:00:08.700> can<00:00:08.880> see<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> nice<00:00:10.530> starting

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
here we can see this is a nice starting

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.030 
here we can see this is a nice starting
point<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:11.670> working<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.480> skin<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.259> we're<00:00:13.950> going

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
point for working in skin so we're going

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.010 
point for working in skin so we're going
to<00:00:14.190> go<00:00:14.250> here<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:14.790> create<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.389> new<00:00:15.420> layer<00:00:15.780> or

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
to go here and create a new layer or

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.890 
to go here and create a new layer or
shift<00:00:16.320> control<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.880> we're<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
shift control in and we're just going to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.300 
shift control in and we're just going to
call<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:20.539> foundation<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:24.680> we<00:00:25.680> have

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
call that foundation and we have

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.800 
call that foundation and we have
selected<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.060> dark<00:00:27.539> brown<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.170> case<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
selected a dark brown in this case for a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.209 
selected a dark brown in this case for a
colorful<00:00:30.810> ground<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.740> then<00:00:31.890> we're<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
colorful ground and then we're going to

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.060 
colorful ground and then we're going to
create<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.230> soft<00:00:34.230> brush<00:00:35.600> bring<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.780> down

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
create a soft brush bring that down

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.860 
create a soft brush bring that down
bring<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.670> top<00:00:39.590> at<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.660> then<00:00:42.660> what

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
bring it on top at all and then what

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.389 
bring it on top at all and then what
we're<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.710> actually<00:00:43.829> change

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
we're going to do is we actually change

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.229 
we're going to do is we actually change
the<00:00:44.550> blend<00:00:44.789> mode<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.030> color<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.700> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.910> see

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the blend mode to color and you can see

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.369 
the blend mode to color and you can see
straight<00:00:48.809> away<00:00:50.059> when<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> paint<00:00:53.120> we<00:00:54.120> are

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
straight away when I paint we are

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.689 
straight away when I paint we are
coloring<00:00:55.379> skin<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.280> we're<00:00:56.520> actually

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
coloring skin but we're actually

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.959 
coloring skin but we're actually
maintaining<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:58.460> lot<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.609> texture<00:01:00.059> underneath

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
maintaining a lot of texture underneath

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.539 
maintaining a lot of texture underneath
and<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.739> looking<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.890> little<00:01:04.979> bit<00:01:05.220> yellow

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and this is looking a little bit yellow

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.219 
and this is looking a little bit yellow
but<00:01:06.229> that's<00:01:07.229> okay<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.640> just

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
but that's okay it's so it's just

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.190 
but that's okay it's so it's just
demonstrating<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.100> done<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:12.630> think

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
demonstrating what can be done I think

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.219 
demonstrating what can be done I think
in<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.439> case<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:14.070> we'd<00:01:14.220> probably<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.820> is

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
in this case what we'd probably do is

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.969 
in this case what we'd probably do is
take<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> pasty<00:01:16.860> down<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:18.320> yeah<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.710> about

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
take the pasty down a bit yeah in about

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.510 
take the pasty down a bit yeah in about
40<00:01:20.689> it's<00:01:21.689> all<00:01:22.229> about<00:01:22.259> subtlety<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.310> can

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
40 it's all about subtlety and you can

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.460 
40 it's all about subtlety and you can
see<00:01:23.759> straight<00:01:24.060> away<00:01:24.180> we've<00:01:24.600> we've<00:01:25.049> moved<00:01:25.320> away

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
see straight away we've we've moved away

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.520 
see straight away we've we've moved away
from<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.970> reddish<00:01:27.360> skin<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.930> almost<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
from the reddish skin to almost like a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.670 
from the reddish skin to almost like a
more<00:01:28.860> subtle<00:01:29.689> he<00:01:31.490> foundation<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.640> here<00:01:33.680> being

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
more subtle he foundation on here being

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.249 
more subtle he foundation on here being
quite<00:01:34.890> rough<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.460> instance<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.259> should

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
quite rough in this instance but should

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.340 
quite rough in this instance but should
give<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:38.040> idea<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.600> because

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
give you the good idea so and because

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.010 
give you the good idea so and because
it's<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.619> its<00:01:40.799> own<00:01:40.950> layer<00:01:41.220> obviously<00:01:42.020> it's

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it's on its own layer obviously it's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.910 
it's on its own layer obviously it's
quite<00:01:43.290> easy<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.430> either<00:01:45.329> delete

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
quite easy to go in and either delete

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.649 
quite easy to go in and either delete
using<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> eraser<00:01:47.220> tool<00:01:49.189> areas<00:01:50.210> or<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.630> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
using the eraser tool areas or for that

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.069 
using the eraser tool areas or for that
matter<00:01:52.430> click<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.759> icon<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.689> add<00:01:55.049> a

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
matter click on this icon here and add a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.050 
matter click on this icon here and add a
mask<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.770> then<00:01:56.640> actually<00:01:57.380> painting<00:01:58.380> black

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
mask and then actually painting black

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.380 
mask and then actually painting black
rub<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.299> again<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:02.369> nice<00:02:02.880> quick<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
rub it out again so a nice quick and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.130 
rub it out again so a nice quick and
easy<00:02:03.509> way<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.219> alter<00:02:05.219> skin<00:02:05.820> tone<00:02:06.140> particularly

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
easy way to alter skin tone particularly

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.660 
easy way to alter skin tone particularly
in<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.590> more<00:02:07.770> subtle<00:02:08.009> way

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.370 

if<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.090> wanted<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.420> be<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:11.630> little<00:02:12.230> more

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
if you wanted to be a little more

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.270 
if you wanted to be a little more
drastic<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.130> could<00:02:14.110> play<00:02:15.110> around<00:02:15.380> with<00:02:15.680> you

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
drastic you could play around with you

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.990 
drastic you could play around with you
saturation<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.950> again<00:02:21.880> it's<00:02:22.880> very

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
saturation but again it's very

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.059 
saturation but again it's very
subjective<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:24.170> then<00:02:24.380> probably<00:02:24.860> what<00:02:25.040> I

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
subjective and then probably what I

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.570 
subjective and then probably what I
would<00:02:25.190> do<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:26.590> what<00:02:27.590> i've<00:02:27.739> done<00:02:27.920> here<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.280> at<00:02:28.459> an

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
would do is what i've done here is at an

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.180 
would do is what i've done here is at an
adjustment<00:02:28.970> layer<00:02:29.120> using<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:30.470> icon<00:02:31.160> here

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
adjustment layer using this icon here

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.710 
adjustment layer using this icon here
and<00:02:31.720> then<00:02:32.720> i<00:02:32.840> probably<00:02:33.140> convert<00:02:33.800> this<00:02:34.069> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
and then i probably convert this to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.840 
and then i probably convert this to
black<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:36.020> mask<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:36.709> I'd<00:02:36.920> press<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.400> Apple

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
black this mask so I'd press that Apple
