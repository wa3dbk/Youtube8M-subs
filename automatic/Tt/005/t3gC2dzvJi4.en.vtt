00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.199 
bolt that's the Aden putting it on and
so<00:01:50.410> you<00:01:50.500> can<00:01:50.679> tilt<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.069> up<00:01:51.220> get<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.580> belt<00:01:51.910> on

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
so you can tilt it up get the belt on

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.150 
so you can tilt it up get the belt on
and<00:01:52.450> then<00:01:52.569> you<00:01:52.690> pull<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:53.229> down<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.709> put<00:01:54.069> the

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
and then you pull it down and put the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.240 
and then you pull it down and put the
bolts<00:01:54.429> in<00:01:54.580> kind<00:01:55.569> of<00:01:55.690> weird<00:01:55.899> but<00:01:56.140> I'll<00:01:57.039> try<00:01:57.190> to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
bolts in kind of weird but I'll try to

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.229 
bolts in kind of weird but I'll try to
show<00:01:57.459> it<00:01:57.550> to<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.729> wants<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.910> put<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.149> on

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
show it to you wants to put it on

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:59.309 
show it to you wants to put it on
there's<00:01:58.479> no<00:01:58.630> way<00:01:58.750> in<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.869> world<00:01:58.989> to<00:01:59.110> show<00:01:59.259> you

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
there's no way in the world to show you

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.020 
there's no way in the world to show you
putting<00:01:59.770> it<00:01:59.860> on<00:02:00.009> that's<00:02:00.220> actually<00:02:00.489> one<00:02:00.849> of<00:02:00.910> the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
putting it on that's actually one of the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.960 
putting it on that's actually one of the
easiest<00:02:01.300> compressors<00:02:02.520> cuz<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.610> don't<00:02:03.700> even

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
easiest compressors cuz you don't even

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.139 
easiest compressors cuz you don't even
take<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.239> belt<00:02:04.450> off<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:05.319> do<00:02:05.530> but<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.910> get<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
take the belt off you do but you get the

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.770 
take the belt off you do but you get the
point<00:02:07.330> you'll<00:02:07.690> see<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:07.959> a<00:02:08.020> minute<00:02:09.209> well<00:02:10.209> we

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
point you'll see in a minute well we

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.570 
point you'll see in a minute well we
shut<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.140> vacuum<00:02:11.530> off<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.890> gauges<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.430> make

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
shut the vacuum off the gauges to make

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.190 
shut the vacuum off the gauges to make
sure<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:12.940> holding

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
sure it's holding

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.080 
sure it's holding
and<00:02:14.470> we're<00:02:14.650> holding<00:02:14.860> holding<00:02:15.700> good<00:02:15.850> we're

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
and we're holding holding good we're

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.640 
and we're holding holding good we're
drawing<00:02:16.300> on<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.630> high<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.140> low<00:02:17.170> side

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
drawing on the high and the low side

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.390 
drawing on the high and the low side
does<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.490> an<00:02:18.640> expansion<00:02:19.180> valve<00:02:19.210> system<00:02:19.870> a

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
does it's an expansion valve system a

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.130 
does it's an expansion valve system a
lot<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.430> people<00:02:21.730> don't<00:02:22.000> tend<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.750> don't<00:02:22.930> get<00:02:23.080> a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
lot of people don't tend you don't get a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.690 
lot of people don't tend you don't get a
good<00:02:23.350> vacuum<00:02:23.770> on<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.980> system<00:02:24.430> but<00:02:24.580> we're

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
good vacuum on the system but we're

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.780 
good vacuum on the system but we're
holding<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.330> that's<00:02:25.510> what<00:02:25.780> matters<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.790> we're

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
holding and that's what matters so we're

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.310 
holding and that's what matters so we're
open<00:02:28.000> these<00:02:28.150> both<00:02:28.360> back<00:02:28.630> up<00:02:28.660> we're<00:02:29.080> gonna<00:02:29.230> let

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
you add gas and high side until you get

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.400 
you add gas and high side until you get
about<00:03:08.140> 14<00:03:08.560> 15<00:03:08.709> psi<00:03:09.630> showing<00:03:10.630> on<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.989> left<00:03:11.200> side

about 14 15 psi showing on the left side

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.770 
about 14 15 psi showing on the left side
you<00:03:11.950> do<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.250> on<00:03:12.340> purpose<00:03:12.370> there's<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.420> reason

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
you do that on purpose there's a reason

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
for it if you don't do it all is not

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.750 
for it if you don't do it all is not
lost<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:17.140> just<00:03:17.350> creates<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:18.130> little<00:03:18.640> more

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
lost it just creates a little more

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.420 
lost it just creates a little more
aggravation<00:03:19.239> in<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.540> process<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.470> just

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
aggravation in the process and just

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.880 
aggravation in the process and just
makes<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.880> go<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.120> little<00:03:22.360> worse<00:03:22.650> but<00:03:23.650> in<00:03:23.769> the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
makes it go a little worse but in the

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.590 
makes it go a little worse but in the
end<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.220> get<00:03:24.340> cold<00:03:24.610> air<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.120> everything's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
end you get cold air and everything's

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.100 
end you get cold air and everything's
fine<00:03:25.840> no<00:03:26.049> parts<00:03:26.350> damage<00:03:27.720> long<00:03:28.720> story<00:03:28.959> short

in<00:03:57.820> there<00:03:58.000> they<00:03:58.209> have<00:03:58.360> red<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.570> there<00:03:58.989> but<00:03:59.500> it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
in there they have red in there but it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.110 
in there they have red in there but it
has<00:03:59.860> to<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.130> with<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.310> type<00:04:00.489> of<00:04:00.519> compressor
