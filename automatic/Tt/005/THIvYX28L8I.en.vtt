 and meryl to raise is a makeup 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.759
 natural but at the same time sophisticated 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.390
 something tonight 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.830
 yeah look two agree but 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.830
 something for sensitive skin and 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.789
 still moderately covering and that he 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.159
 be comfortable 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.039
 so for you I'm going to use the bottom 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.450
 complexion is a cream ideal is for 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.130
 dry skin and at the same time 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.319
 gives a more silky side for the evening 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.600
 okay I could mix 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.960
 some colors to get the time 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.539
 ideal 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.280
 the ideal time is his bread it m 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.250
 is very bright this one is very 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.179
 bright he does not really 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.140
 need to be framed 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.090
 okay it has infinity of the Swedish giant 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.130
 so I put it in the jacques sponge 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.200
 will be a lot more without getting wet without 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.369
 wet and especially not then no we do not 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.109
 do not like the match because we overlap 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.209
 no manor pigs from the bottom all that to 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:13.030
 skin just work with a 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.980
 sponge to pull them well and that makes you 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.920
 this this result and that holds very 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.319
 long time I feel blessed the wii 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.450
 he is completely but at the same time 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.030
 it gives incredible brightness I 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.040
 the tried game the years of the tomorrows 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.890
 on the bastards gmac is full of life 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.630
 they loved I go powder is when 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.550
 even a little bit for 7th all the way 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.580
 evening but then slightly me 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.959
 I use a watercolor brush then 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.910
 obviously on the cheekbones you can in 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.280
 put it straight on it's a 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.890
 good player who is not orange at all 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.280
 at all gives a little tan and 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.040

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.690

 a little it creates a wave have a little 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.190
 more chest 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.060
