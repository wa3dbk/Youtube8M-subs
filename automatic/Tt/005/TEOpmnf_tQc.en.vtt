 if you really want to discover 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 overnight life of this video is so at 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.989

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.309
 birthday is not even no because 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.250
 that she says good birthday and the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.290
 blow she makes him follow a big thread 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.340
 wool yarn and more she follows him more 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.649
 there are flowers gifts 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.649
 a toy in the shape of a castle finally 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.659
 that's what and so this short film is 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.060
 pass she sings all the time it's 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.929
 really a song actually and she 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.710
 that's cold it sneezes and at every 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.210
 Once she came back she did 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.619
 appear olaf babies actually but 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.479
 she does not realize the kind she 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.950
 sneeze she turns her head so what 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.810
 she does not see them appear 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.490
 and so that accumulates it accumulates they 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.969
 will all find themselves christophe aulas 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.500
 made serene that are required are they 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.060
 in the yard where will take place 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.950
 birthday so that's the surprise 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.280
 on the other hand they do not know she does not 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.289
 do not know and so to nadi to edea but you 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.590
 was cold you must arm yourself 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.939
 rest what and guess what 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.560
 our friend elsa she says but do not 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.929
 do not worry I'm not cold because 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.619
 that the cold is for me the price of the 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.920
 freedom 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.119
 of course it was forced to 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.069
 suddenly we discover a new power 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.039
 of elsa but yes finally we had a small 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.659
 doubt in the in it's a troll that 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.459
 I do but we had a little doubt 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.410
 in the first in the first film 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.420
 because it was creating clothes to 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.739
 his clothes then everyone 07 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.829
 of art her dress she can not be in 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.000
 place and all is well this one 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.040
 she used a bouquet of flowers 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.359
 next to her to embed me 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.370
 flowers in her dress 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:25.099
 so that's pretty weird but good 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.170
 that's magic it's beautiful we're not going 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.359
 look for explanations and after the fact 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.250
 the same with his sister so elric boom 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.680
 she just did that that that over 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.299
 his sister and then hop to d el had and 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.639
 sunflowers on her dress that 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.480
 finally appear here is what 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.280
 we had talked about it in a previous 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.630
 video but here we think it's 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.470
 really very commercial the fact that they 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.329
 have changed dress 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.560
 because that's going to be a form of 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.180
 new dolls that are already in 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.139
 out of stock by the way so you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.790
 can not say it was for 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.980
 trade that it was not for trade 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.680
 because that's why it's for that 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.319
 we thought with a friend that if 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.569
 finally the snow rhine has been was 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.549
 validated but it is thought that in the queen 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.410
 snow 2 there will surely be still 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.790
 new dresses we'll see we'll see 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.459
 is not there yet 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.319
 but here's the nice surprise is that we 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.060
 sees in the room so in fact it's that 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.969
 elsa she wants to blow the horn of 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.640
 haze for to celebrate the party all that and 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.840
 by blowing in it all in late 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.010
 not quite understand what he thinks what 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.129
 happens but suddenly there is a huge 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.019
 snowball running across the ocean and 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.120
 we see that they collect manure 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.030
 in a stable and he takes the ball 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.230
 of snow and suddenly he seals his 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.139
 get into the cart full of 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.480
 manure finally here is otherwise people get 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.829
 complained it's true that suddenly 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.109
 people complain and convoyed handsome in 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.310
 the teaser we saw a lot of all 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.689
 the characters while it was 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.040
 weird good enough to make it 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.470
 do not bother it's a funny little thing 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.239
 but suddenly we see where wolves I 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.799
 forgot his name it's true he just 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.139
 take a trolley in the middle of the city 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.250
 was not obligatory it's them who me 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.019
 seems like he's the only one who had not 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.090
 the way of the first movie but hey it's 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.349
 not very serious and people get 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.470
 complained to convoy marshmallows but in 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.819
 does chamallow is that he is in the 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.760
 Castle deserts ice castle 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.230
 that she created and in fact in the end they 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.700
 say good take you 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.659
 we take you away and suddenly he takes all 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.430
 the little aces to chamalot and if not 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.669
 there is nothing special about music 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.430
 in and nice after would have to 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.610
 listen again for because suddenly 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.870
 I had more I had in mind the 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.419
 short film that really music 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.760
 music it was something about your ta ta ta 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.740
 your ta ta ta it was that it looks pretty 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.680
 nice but here it is a music that 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.240
 sounds very no birthday but that's it 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.290
 very low days so if I think 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.520
 not that's the kind of music that 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.050
 would stand as easily as 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.330
 the hyper is delivered we have too much 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.280
 heard is not it that is a song 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.830
 awesome is not it but that's it 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.419
 so a thing to say so it was so 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.960
 well forward for put in front premiere 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.100
 in short films before cinderella so 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.260
 cinderella that I will speak in a 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.419
 other video 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.880
 so that's a very good nothing 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.550
 special not surprised and very happy 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.690
 see it again really well and do it 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.100
 whether in a short film of 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.440
 blow we can not really criticize to 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.449
 they screwed up his and zaba and a 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.490
 thing that shocked we were three friends to 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.690
 to be there and janot shocked every 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.160
 three elsa blew himself in his arm 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.780
 this is the step she does not know butcher 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.599
 like in a handkerchief I mean but 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.789

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.080
 flowing plc am of course his arm 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.590
 all along his arm so suddenly we 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.930
 was to so here is otherwise all the characters 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.090
 his faithful to himself there is nothing 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.789
 name that's a good thing 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.330
 they are and it disturbs nothing here 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.330
 that's all 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.140
 that's exactly what it takes 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.630
 do not ruin the first movie 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.190
 this is a little boy 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.220
 it's a little thing that makes a little 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.780
 nostalgic of last year and so 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.970
 that's if you saw it what is that 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.020

 I had a little worry and at 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.230
 final at the beginning will tell you it's going to be 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.400
 fully sung but it's going well 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.100
 Well, there's no dialogue 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.850
