00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.740
 a new video boxing of a product that 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.490
 the truth has time I think to acquire 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.110
 those are the ones of the philips brand and that 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.539
 you know good points what is this because they are 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.570
 a few gentlemen as you can see the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.060
 box we have a little 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.040
 and in the back we have three 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.960
 spotlights 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.140
 we have a smartphone and it's because these 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.610
 focuses work or has an interface that 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.500
 It can be handled through a 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.720
 smartphone that now I'm going to 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.840
 explain a little closer to that one 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.629
 quick guide look about the colors 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.180
 that I can and, as you can see here 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.730
 they are starting what is the box we are going to 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.470
 open it I do not know how it comes for 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.410
 open up I think I have to break 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.750
 this if not then we're going to break it 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.620
 as you want 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.760
 it should be removed first 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.760
 the tape that brings 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.960
 unsharpened 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.940
 Y 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.710
 we're going to take it out let's see what we 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.229
 included here in the box that is 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.630
 on this side a power cable that 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.970
 is going to stop that kind of interface that 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.440
 it's like a robert guy or something like that 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.260
 you speak of current forgiveness is a cable 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.240
 network is a cable to see because it is 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.240
 connected to our internet because it 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.110
 there was wifi with the lights and this 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.050
 side we have the power cord the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.000
 nest that includes us in this part of 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.159
 here we have this which is basically what 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.950
 that does all the magic is a device that 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.320
 allows connect I think 60 spotlights should 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.640
 investigate them well that and allows 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.039
 connect different types of accessories 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.470
 of rain as they are LED bars spotlights 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.479
 this one different products that 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.880
 offer here connects what is 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.520
 our internet network and this side is 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.429
 connects what is the current and it 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.210
 synchronize with these three focuses those 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.770
 focuses are from leds 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.860
 they are very economical from now they are 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.420
 heavy and has a truth duration 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.740
 It is very surprising 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.640
 It seems to me that it takes more than a year 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.480
 duration then they are very parents and 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.480
 here in the bottom 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.480
 we have a very nice accordion is not the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.730
 Quick use guide seems to me of 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.010
 configuration and everything 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.959
 i 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.209
 I am basically the lord of samples and 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.220
 I nothing else this is what I 'm going to do 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.200
 they will see in the video some 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.299
 demonstration of how the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.700
 colors that have what I like a lot 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.470
 that the application offers you not only as 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.170
 colors but as landscape if you want a 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.970
 dusk those holes you simulate that 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.680
 You can control the lights of all your 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.290
 house is not different bedrooms 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.849
 registered to control the light of 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.980
 each bedroom that is different 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.049
 environment and everything and for the truth is 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.519
 this coin that goes family there is nothing and 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.200
 well here we leave the unboxing so that 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.540
 you liked it there they are going to see some 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.950
 shots of how this works if they have 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.959
 some doubt already know other of my networks 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.970
 can let them know the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.629
 institution missing 90 gentlemen we generate 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.629
 in the next video
