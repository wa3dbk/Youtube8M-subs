the strap is attached to it which you'll

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.350

see<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> other<00:00:56.340> straps<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.149> means

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
see a lot of other straps and that means

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.729 
see a lot of other straps and that means
it<00:00:57.570> dangles<00:00:58.109> too<00:00:58.320> much<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it dangles too much because you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.470 
it dangles too much because you
basically<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.399> little<00:00:59.550> extension<00:01:00.059> area

basically have a little extension area

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.119 
basically have a little extension area
the<00:01:00.809> strap<00:01:01.050> would<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the strap would be here and then you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.500 
the strap would be here and then you
have<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.399> extension<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.059> then<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
have a little extension and then it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.119 
have a little extension and then it
makes<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.840> dangle<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:04.920> sign

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
makes it dangle when it's at your sign

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.240 
makes it dangle when it's at your sign

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.890 
downwards to make it longer and you can
do<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.549> any<00:01:35.729> degree<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
do that to any degree that you want and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.149 
do that to any degree that you want and
then<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.380> lock<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
then you can lock it so you have a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.819 
then you can lock it so you have a
little<00:01:38.460> lock<00:01:38.640> rod<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:40.140> stays<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
little lock rod so that it stays that

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.980 
little lock rod so that it stays that
length<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> lock<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.600> means<00:01:42.750> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
length when you lock it that means that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.270 
length when you lock it that means that
you<00:01:43.140> know<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.560> gonna<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.070> gonna

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you know it's not gonna it's not gonna

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.819 
you know it's not gonna it's not gonna
slide<00:01:44.970> around<00:01:45.119> too<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.350> didn't<00:01:46.680> have

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
slide around too much if I didn't have

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.310 
slide around too much if I didn't have
this<00:01:46.979> locked<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.759> were<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.060> bend<00:01:48.210> down<00:01:48.540> then

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
this locked if I were to bend down then

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.660 
this locked if I were to bend down then
it<00:01:49.470> would<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> bit<00:01:50.009> longer<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.430> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it would get a bit longer because it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.609 
it would get a bit longer because it
would<00:01:50.759> sort<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:50.939> slide<00:01:51.570> forwards<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> bit<00:01:52.170> so

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
would sort of slide forwards a bit so

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.990 
would sort of slide forwards a bit so
that's<00:01:52.799> why<00:01:52.920> having<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.490> lock<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.850> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that's why having that lock that is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.660 
that's why having that lock that is
great<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.350> nice<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.009> easy<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.430> find

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
great and it's nice and easy to find

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.069 
great and it's nice and easy to find
with<00:01:56.850> your<00:01:56.969> hand<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.840> something<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
with your hand it's not something that

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.780 
with your hand it's not something that
you<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.409> fiddle<00:01:58.860> around<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.310> too<00:01:59.460> much<00:01:59.610> as

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
you to fiddle around with too much as

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.130 
you to fiddle around with too much as
far<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.299> know<00:02:00.360> there<00:02:00.689> were<00:02:00.810> some<00:02:00.840> legal

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
far as I know there were some legal

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.630 
far as I know there were some legal
issues<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.890> prevent

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
issues that prevent

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.700 
issues that prevent

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
down on the strap itself I haven't found

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.040 
down on the strap itself I haven't found
that<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.910> problem<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.360> far<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.750> straps

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
that to be a problem so far the straps

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.040 
that to be a problem so far the straps
like<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:15.830> one<00:02:16.040> where<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:16.940> entire<00:02:17.510> strap

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
like this one where the entire strap

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.190 
like this one where the entire strap
moves<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.370> your<00:02:19.550> body<00:02:19.850> rather<00:02:20.480> than<00:02:20.810> the

moves on your body rather than the

moves on your body rather than the

camera move up and down on the strap the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.040 
camera move up and down on the strap the
only<00:02:23.209> thing<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.450> if<00:02:23.600> you're<00:02:23.720> wearing<00:02:23.870> a

that's<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.330> know<00:02:29.450> at<00:02:29.569> some<00:02:29.750> points<00:02:30.110> this

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
that's you know at some points this

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.979 
that's you know at some points this
might<00:02:30.590> get<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.860> little<00:02:31.190> bit<00:02:31.520> stuck<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.569> one<00:02:32.959> of

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
might get a little bit stuck on one of

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.930 
might get a little bit stuck on one of
the<00:02:33.080> other<00:02:33.110> things<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.010> far<00:02:34.520> haven't<00:02:34.760> found

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
the other things so far haven't found

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
that to be a big issue most of the time

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.170 
that to be a big issue most of the time
it<00:02:36.920> doesn't<00:02:37.040> happen<00:02:37.160> most<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.790> time<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.060> it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
it doesn't happen most of the time if it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.150 
it doesn't happen most of the time if it
does<00:02:38.360> get<00:02:38.510> stuck<00:02:38.780> it's<00:02:39.200> only<00:02:39.350> slightly<00:02:39.800> and

does get stuck it's only slightly and
it's<00:02:40.280> still<00:02:40.459> sort<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.670> releases<00:02:41.060> itself<00:02:41.330> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
it's still sort of releases itself the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.900 
it's still sort of releases itself the
strap<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.110> made<00:02:42.290> really<00:02:42.920> nicely<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.489> does<00:02:43.670> have

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
would say here this piece here is

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.059 
would say here this piece here is
plastic<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.810> think<00:03:06.110> I<00:03:06.319> think<00:03:06.800> it<00:03:06.890> should<00:03:07.040> be

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
plastic and I think I think it should be

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.460 
plastic and I think I think it should be
metal<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.060> now<00:03:08.390> it's<00:03:08.600> not<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:08.959> much<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.350> it's

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
metal and now it's not so much that it's

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.020 
metal and now it's not so much that it's
plastic<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.010> bothers<00:03:10.250> me<00:03:10.340> it's<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.910> fact

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
plastic that bothers me it's the fact

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.449 
plastic that bothers me it's the fact
that<00:03:11.180> it's<00:03:11.360> plastic<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:11.900> at<00:03:12.319> an<00:03:12.440> angle<00:03:12.860> that

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
that it's plastic and at an angle that

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.819 
that it's plastic and at an angle that
can<00:03:13.700> be<00:03:13.850> pulled<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:15.140> have<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.500> sort<00:03:15.799> of

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
can be pulled and have a sort of

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.270 
can be pulled and have a sort of
leverage<00:03:16.400> on<00:03:16.579> itself<00:03:17.090> meaning<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:18.049> think<00:03:18.799> if<00:03:19.160> I

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
leverage on itself meaning I think if I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.710 
leverage on itself meaning I think if I
wanted<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.790> if<00:03:19.880> I<00:03:19.970> pulled<00:03:20.239> really<00:03:20.360> hard<00:03:20.630> on

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
wanted to if I pulled really hard on

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.840 
wanted to if I pulled really hard on
this<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.110> could<00:03:21.739> break<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.160> there<00:03:22.430> are<00:03:22.549> straps

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
this I could break it there are straps

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.210 
this I could break it there are straps
that<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.540> have<00:03:23.750> where<00:03:24.200> no<00:03:24.560> matter<00:03:24.799> what<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:25.100> do

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
that I have where no matter what I do

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.590 
that I have where no matter what I do
there's<00:03:25.549> no<00:03:25.700> way<00:03:25.730> I'm<00:03:25.940> going<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.120> break<00:03:26.299> them

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
there's no way I'm going to break them

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.970 
there's no way I'm going to break them
now<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:26.989> strap<00:03:27.260> does<00:03:27.440> come<00:03:27.680> with<00:03:27.829> an

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
now the strap does come with an

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.009 
now the strap does come with an
additional<00:03:28.400> little<00:03:28.579> safety<00:03:29.060> strap<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.720> I'm

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
additional little safety strap and I'm

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.870 
additional little safety strap and I'm
not<00:03:30.440> sure<00:03:30.590> if<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.799> really<00:03:30.829> like<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.430> because

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
not sure if I really like that because

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.910 
not sure if I really like that because
it<00:03:32.299> doesn't<00:03:32.570> really<00:03:32.690> say<00:03:32.930> hey<00:03:33.200> we<00:03:33.620> really

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
it doesn't really say hey we really

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.830 
it doesn't really say hey we really
believe<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.489> strength<00:03:34.820> of<00:03:35.209> our<00:03:35.360> product

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
believe in the strength of our product

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.259 
believe in the strength of our product
it<00:03:35.989> says<00:03:36.200> hey<00:03:36.489> maybe<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.790> need<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.000> little

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
it says hey maybe you need a little

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.560 
it says hey maybe you need a little
extra<00:03:38.630> safety<00:03:39.140> here<00:03:39.320> I<00:03:39.500> think<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.570> maybe

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
extra safety here I think that maybe

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.120 
extra safety here I think that maybe
Joby<00:03:42.019> should<00:03:42.230> be<00:03:42.350> really<00:03:42.590> clear<00:03:42.799> about<00:03:42.859> what

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
Joby should be really clear about what

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.690 
Joby should be really clear about what
sort<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.820> weight<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:45.190> strap<00:03:46.190> would<00:03:46.400> take

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
sort of weight this strap would take

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.370 
sort of weight this strap would take
before<00:03:46.940> breaks<00:03:47.540> because<00:03:47.930> I've<00:03:48.049> seen<00:03:48.200> other

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
before breaks because I've seen other

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.289 
before breaks because I've seen other
manufacturers<00:03:49.310> do<00:03:49.459> that<00:03:49.579> it's<00:03:49.910> not<00:03:50.060> something

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299

that<00:03:50.329> I<00:03:50.450> like<00:03:50.660> it's<00:03:51.109> not<00:03:51.350> something<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:51.680> I

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
that I like it's not something that I

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.229 
that I like it's not something that I
