00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 Hello friends today we have monday 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.340
 a day in which you just fool around and 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.590
 answer the questions tag is the same 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.650
 tradition but before we go to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.030
 most run to the main time monday 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.139
 time i have the opportunity to talk 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.779
 on different topics 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.150
 i want to clarify those some questions 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.850
 who occasionally float in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.070
 comments just do not want them on this 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.660
 look a little closer first 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.809
 here it is not a white sheet and white 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 background than a white sheet different from me 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.680
 I'll never know 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.410
 but he was bought in a special shop 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.719
 as a white background and for that cost for 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.420
 which can only cost which 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.200
 maybe it's just a white background so this 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.110
 no sheet 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.289
 and the white background is important secondly yes I am 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 get a haircut and I can notice me about it 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.230
 no more writing and my haircut will remain 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.629
 same soon well and last 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.820
 i got sick and i'm pretty weird it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.909
 it means the blogger disappears who appears and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.650
 blowing i was hurting i had a fever 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.409
 sopelki tick hurted so not 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.880
 filmed the video actually i brewed and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.760
 the video will be more 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.409
 because when you and cold 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.659
 you talk through the nose it's not very 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.150
 nice but your voice is getting 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.340
 more velvet we know such timbre 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.770
 voices changing you feel velvet 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.900
 voice or don't feel but he 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.900
 white velvet background 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.439
 voice is velvety so the video will 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.110
 more 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.979
 now go to the tag itself 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.890
 called he habits nig blogger 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.659
 how often do you check your youtube 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.240
 account but in fact late 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.670
 video time goes out almost every day 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.979
 so of course checking it every day 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.380
 because you have done a lot 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.439
 activity comments and whether everyone there 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.719
 there is why go to what to note that 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.439
 read so lately 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.750
 quite often, well, that activity is 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.270
 it matters which book videos you are more 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.020
 just love to watch 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.000
 of course the cover but seriously 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.750
 i like those see that make 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.550
 you are a couple 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.020
 fuck that is when a blogger asks 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.620
 some kind of vector thinking 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.750
 and the audience they are already trying it with others 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.500
 sides leaning on a rack it's everyday 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.110
 experience 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.820
 This issue is also considered and some 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.740
 to express their opinions to myself 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.250
 like these videos shoot let's say from 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.750
 the last where we posted on the topic soon 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.050
 reading speed is it worth reading fast 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.709
 or slowly and i only have my position 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.750
 expressed 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.640
 and getting rest getting comments there 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.780
 opportunity to look at this topic under 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.000
 wider angle 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.970
 that is, of course, roughly products 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.650
 depends both on the blogger and on the viewers and me 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.600
 it seems really cool 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.690
 if any and which kind of you 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.820
 be sure to take off each month but in 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.739
 first we now have a tradition every 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.870
 monday we remove the tags 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.000
 Well, the rollers go generally quite often 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.430
 and even on such an axis a little scrupulous 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.880
 topic recently a little on the second 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.420
 plan 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.209
 departed themes table games well, I'm at 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.860
 I think temporarily just because now 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.799
 a little poison of this topic is tired 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.630
 but still once a month is stable 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.299
 anything on board games will 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.070
 leave here is one hundred percent so if 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.019
 you love nastolki do not despair 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.140
 someday their time will come 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.390
 back old days and now the question 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.260
 following what social networks are you 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.060
 use actively i use only 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.760
 contact and youtube which basically 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.440
 You can also call social networks 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.140
 still google plus which never 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.540
 learned to use too hard well 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.030
 naturally i have both instagram and 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.430
 facebook and everything everything everything everything everything everything 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.140
 but I don't use it yet 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.660
 eked up on live libby 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.920
 but the fact that rushing is pretty boring is something 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.380
 can i do i just don't understand 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.780
 mark books then you read and 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.140
 In a big way, everything, well, I am there too. 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.910
 how do you shoot your videos but if you're on 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.980
 the channel for a long time, then probably remember that 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.530
 I used to approach shooting much 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.950
 more seriously I wrote scripts to do it 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.500
 under eat this installation all steep but 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.440
 then I realized that the exhaust is raised and therefore 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.669
 unfortunately or fortunately now the process 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.010
 simpler now everything is easier i will come 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.140
 I can cover the subject 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.170
 I put the camera and tell it and then 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:36.240
 I think my God what the hell was shooting 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:38.580
 but okay, and I'm pouring on the canal 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.370
 it's pretty shitty self-promotion but 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.710
 true truth uterus what to do 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.010
 what book videos are you most 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.680
 love to shoot it sounds silly but on 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.840
 really all 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.570
 I used to look at myself a certain framework 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.810
 that is to say only that the only way 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.440
 and then how did you think about go all this 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.200
 damn 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.880
 and began to take more relaxed and on 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.550
 different topics do nothing at all 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.090
 limit the main thing to me 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.120
 interesting well and hope you too so 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.370
 Now I am here purely on Kaifu has 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.680
 except with pleasure so the videos 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.980
 come so often if you put huskies and 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.350
 Comment out video of other bloggers yes 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.690
 not very often but if i like 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.020
 I'll write a video about it 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.970
 Like 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.610
 I basically will not become dislikes 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.260
 because I know the price of dislikes 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.720
 especially at the beginning you are just starting 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.750
 shoot video every dizlike pretty 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.330
 hard on and pride 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.970
 novice blogger is a big hit 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.970
 now there do not care now how would I 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.310
 ill and bad comments 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.020
 I perceive normally, but earlier it was 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.120
 hard for me so I try 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.850
 Dislay tiles became a hatch only when 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.890
 video hurts this legions and feelings 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.440
 either touches some kind of national 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.890
 pride and what is wrong but in general 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.410
 more likes likes likes doing this 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:07.520
 reviews and reviews on the book immediately after the 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.960
 readings actually yes maxims on 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.820
 second or third day at the latest i 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.310
 I think it is not quite right 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.320
 in a good way you need of course with a book there 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.690
 sleep think everything on the shelves 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.420
 decompose but lately i 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.060
 talked about the network of consumer goods such as house 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.490
 strange children and there to think something a 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.740
 most likely it will take two or three days and I 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.020
 I'll forget what this book is all about 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.000
 the book was therefore trying immediately 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.330
 share the emotions that I have 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.140
 there are also all the same I do not 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.340
 reviews 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.470
 but just ask what kind of opinion 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.169
 Questions should be benefits that will have a 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.419
 shoot it so well actually it to me 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.169
 so did not transmit and I also transmit 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:52.479
 I won’t ask him a question 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:55.060
 what do you like to watch a video on the topic 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:57.790
 books I ask it with mercenary interests 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.180
 to know your interests and take pictures 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.460
 video just on this topic then me 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.680
 asked to answer the question from the video in 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.350
 which you were offered to go through this tag 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.260
 accordingly, there is no such thing, and to whom are you 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.389
 do you want to pass it to anyone so 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.400
 on this we will complete 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.139
 I remind you today that do not forget 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.750

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:21.669
