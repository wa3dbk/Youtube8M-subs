actually<00:03:01.170> mix<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.189> two<00:03:02.370> sound<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:02.909> a

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
actually mix in the two sound so I get a

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.580 
actually mix in the two sound so I get a
