00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.640
 With a smile 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.900
 Hello hello hello hello 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.220
 As if nothing happened 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.720
 Ajikun (still) 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.620
 Still Hello Hello Hello Hello 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.640
 I just want to watch from a distance 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.160
 Yes, it's okay 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.820
 Even if you were far 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.360
 I can always feel you staying in my heart 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.100
 After a very long time 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.720
 Remember today 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.100
 I want to comfort my memories 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.960
 I used to endure, our love 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.800
 I wanna be with you 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.640
 With a smile 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.780
 Hello hello hello hello 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.520
 Hide my trembling heart 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.754
 Tears 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.420
 Hello hello hello hello 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.580
 Let's endure a little, if today is over 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.800
 Yes, I'm sure it's okay, even if I can't meet 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.780
 I can feel the two eyes of you 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.560
 It only takes a very long time 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.580
 I will always come back again 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.340
 How have you been? Because you ask 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.360
 So endure now, please 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.800
 Don't shake 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.420
 Yes, I will improve again 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.040
 Even if I was far, always 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.800
 Because I have always believed in each other in the same place 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.620
 I am absolutely 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.720
 I'm not afraid, even if my throat clogged with tears many times 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.560
 love you 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.900
 Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.260
 love you 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.420
 Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:36.120
 Hello my lady, Hello, I wanna be with you
