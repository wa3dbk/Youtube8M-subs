 these are the men who are the most 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.510
 important maisons have brought about

 of man 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.120
 but what were the inspirations for 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.769
 the look of next winter 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350
 no exaggeration for designers 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.329
 they choose elegant normality but with 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.479
 style and always with a touch of glam that the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.880

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.660
 on the catwalk an elegant classic man 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.340
 studded and with samp and animals 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.810
 calvin klein chooses the formality but with 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.550
 a more sporty touch 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.500
 classic jackets run technically and 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.780
 neoprene that builds for few who 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.670
 they look quilted 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.500
 at the national costume show is 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.750
 instead of scene a young man e 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.610
 angry very rock and roll 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.650
 the inspiration comes from the 50s 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.720
 when a push of rebellion changes 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.869
 the man's custom and latitude as 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.250
 the stylist ennio capasa tells us yes 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.750
 it is necessary to explain to this period why 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.930
 it was a period of great change and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.270
 fashion is a very important period, 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.950
 clearly always beautiful we say 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.110
 work with these icons then 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.920
 they stimulate the imagination a lot but we have 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.630
 seen on the catwalk 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.940
 we saw a man who did not have the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.820
 tie that is not bon ton but that has one 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.180
 great desire for real clothes a 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.810
 a great desire to say high of living 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.810
 in the street 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.970
 we return to the roots and its roots to which 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.220
 we belong to us who belong to us 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.510
 I mean with that one anger 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.090
 generation has been able to change 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 the world and that anger is at that 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.470
 a positive anger is a rage that 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.160
 Innovation good causes anger and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.170
 anger is a spicy spice you need 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.210
 to flavor any dish because 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.630
 the problem is that contemporary dishes 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.850
 they are very insipid they don't know about anything and 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.290
 they don't even feed that much 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.840
 he wants this rock and roll hit there 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.840
 he wants this beating of angry young man 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.030
 to evolve david bowie is a 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.740
 character for me is fundamental because 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.900
 it has an absolutely underground root 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.390
 but it has an audience absolutely 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.610
 mainstream and it is this balance that is 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.530
 perfect i mean look a little bit is 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.850
 differently, that is, a reach e 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.490
 totally underground though 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.050
 developed a brand that is international 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.940
 knows the whole world on internet swing 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.170
 and in this subtle balance that yes 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.970
 play everything 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.170
 you have to keep an underground root 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.310
 but try to reach a larger one 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.730
 possible public 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.620
 a crazy show and you are all in charge 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.790
 I find beautiful national costumes 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.950
 the brand 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.020
 as well as high quality style 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.910
 very rock though 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.910
 always remaining very chic too 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.890
 glam that has not hurt the story since 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.730
 played slightly late with i 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.430
 rovi stands 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.920
 in the last row with front or 18 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.350
 so I saw Christians intermittently 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.350
 so this almost intermittently 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.940
 all that as the rest from 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.490
 this in the national team 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.290
 they dress instead of a knowledge of how 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.910
 we should dress is nothing to me 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.800
 learning now to clothe myself clearly 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:18.130
 at 40 and years because of what a lot 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.350
 very elegant in their very sober 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.240
 but therefore we can also dress with 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.380
 these cables without problems also the 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.820
 first show in my life that they come 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.050
 I'm also trying to climb them 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.050
 mirrors in a horrible way 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.599
 I hope happens today still early role 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:44.680
 and it's a healthy way we use 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:48.129
 often ennio carlo and me when you get there 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.569
 meet if kind to greet us for 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.490
 indulging yourself says rock and roll 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:54.870
 live your life in a rock and manner 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.870
 roll and that is always good
