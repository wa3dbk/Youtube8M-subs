just<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> way<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> Z<00:00:51.239> bands<00:00:51.449> make

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
just because the way that Z bands make

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.299 
just because the way that Z bands make
cereals<00:00:52.140> their<00:00:52.289> their<00:00:52.500> bodies<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
cereals their their bodies are all the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.330 
cereals their their bodies are all the
same<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:55.530> only<00:00:55.559> thing<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:55.829> change<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
same and the only thing they change is a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.130 
same and the only thing they change is a
spool<00:00:56.610> size<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> cup<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.600> each<00:00:57.660> reel<00:00:57.899> so

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
spool size in the cup for each reel so

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.380 
spool size in the cup for each reel so
this<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> 20<00:00:59.460> sighs<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.149> Cup

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
this this is the 20 sighs so this Cup

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.720 
this this is the 20 sighs so this Cup
and<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.109> 22<00:01:01.620> size<00:01:01.859> Cup<00:01:02.160> would<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> same

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and the 22 size Cup would be the same

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.810 
and the 22 size Cup would be the same
and<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> bigger<00:01:03.809> Cup<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.790> 25<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and then get a bigger Cup for the 25 and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.570 
and then get a bigger Cup for the 25 and
the<00:01:06.060> 27<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> looks<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> little<00:01:08.310> bit<00:01:08.460> strange

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the 27 so it looks a little bit strange

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
the 27 so it looks a little bit strange
that<00:01:08.850> bale<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.540> actually<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> same<00:01:10.170> Bale<00:01:10.380> that

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
that bale is actually the same Bale that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.160 
that bale is actually the same Bale that
fits<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> much<00:01:11.310> larger<00:01:11.549> 27<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.900> looks<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
fits on the much larger 27 so it looks a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.010 
fits on the much larger 27 so it looks a
little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.500> awkward<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:14.479> it<00:01:15.479> does<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> job

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
little bit awkward but it does the job

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.499 
little bit awkward but it does the job
it's<00:01:16.259> really<00:01:16.590> smooth<00:01:17.060> main<00:01:18.060> feature<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it's really smooth main feature the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.690 
it's really smooth main feature the
rails<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.810> course<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.350> 100%<00:01:20.250> sealed

rails of course that it's 100% sealed
rag<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.600> body<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:23.070> could<00:01:23.189> submerge<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.880> if

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
rag and body so you could submerge it if
