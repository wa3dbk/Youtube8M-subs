00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
and power eventually you come to a point

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.460 
and power eventually you come to a point
where<00:00:57.610> your<00:00:57.730> mind<00:00:58.000> allows<00:00:58.870> you<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.230> break

which I never thought possible it's not

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.060 
which I never thought possible it's not
a<00:01:16.570> physical<00:01:16.930> thing<00:01:17.079> but<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.350> psychological

a<00:01:36.159> movie<00:01:36.429> there's<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.209> strong<00:01:37.479> connection

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
a movie there's a strong connection

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.109 
a movie there's a strong connection
between<00:01:38.139> the<00:01:38.799> process<00:01:39.249> that<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.520> soldier<00:01:39.969> will

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
between the process that a soldier will

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.120 
between the process that a soldier will
go<00:01:40.209> through<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.779> gym<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.740> process

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130

code of ethics or values that guides how

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.919 
code of ethics or values that guides how
he<00:01:53.799> behaves<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.789> allows<00:01:55.509> him<00:01:55.689> to<00:01:55.719> make

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
he behaves and allows him to make

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.359 
he behaves and allows him to make
choices<00:01:56.229> for<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.829> greater<00:01:57.009> good

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
choices for the greater good

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.249 
choices for the greater good
it's<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.759> process<00:01:58.029> of<00:01:58.299> self-discovery<00:01:58.719> and

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
it's the process of self-discovery and

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.870 
it's the process of self-discovery and
it's<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.469> process<00:01:59.709> that<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.189> soldier<00:02:00.609> will<00:02:00.759> go

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
it's a process that a soldier will go

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.550 
it's a process that a soldier will go
through<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.359> learn<00:02:01.539> whether<00:02:01.929> he<00:02:02.139> or<00:02:02.259> she<00:02:02.409> has

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
through to learn whether he or she has

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.409 
through to learn whether he or she has
what<00:02:02.889> it<00:02:02.919> takes<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.579> I<00:02:03.789> think<00:02:03.999> that's<00:02:04.149> one<00:02:04.329> of

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:04.419 
what it takes and I think that's one of

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:05.789 
what it takes and I think that's one of
the<00:02:04.479> reasons<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:04.959> a<00:02:05.139> lot<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.380> people<00:02:05.619> have

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
the reasons that a lot of people have

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.830 
the reasons that a lot of people have
