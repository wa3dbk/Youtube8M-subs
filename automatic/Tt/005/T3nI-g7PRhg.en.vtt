00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
what are these and then I looked on the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.089 
what are these and then I looked on the
back<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.270> has<00:02:06.329> soy<00:02:07.099> it's

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
back and then I see that it has soy it's

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.529 
back and then I see that it has soy it's
a<00:02:08.190> soy<00:02:08.369> protein<00:02:08.550> that's<00:02:08.940> what<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.330> they're

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
a soy protein that's what it is they're

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.970 
a soy protein that's what it is they're
vegetarian<00:02:10.140> dogs<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.580> thing<00:02:11.790> about

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
vegetarian dogs and the thing about

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.670 
vegetarian dogs and the thing about
SOI<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.450> promotes<00:02:14.660> estrogen<00:02:15.170> because

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
SOI is that it promotes estrogen because

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.760 
SOI is that it promotes estrogen because
it<00:02:15.920> has<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.150> isoflavones<00:02:17.150> they're<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:18.319> plant

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
it has a isoflavones they're a plant

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.790 
it has a isoflavones they're a plant
estrogen<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.270> when<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.660> ingest<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.770> a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
estrogen and when you ingest that on a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.590 
estrogen and when you ingest that on a
regular<00:02:21.980> basis<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.700> actually<00:02:23.060> increase<00:02:23.209> your

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
regular basis you actually increase your

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.020 
regular basis you actually increase your
production<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.080> estrogen<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:25.730> will<00:02:25.880> also

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
production of estrogen and it will also

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.670 
production of estrogen and it will also
when<00:02:26.690> doing<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.020> will<00:02:27.230> decrease<00:02:27.380> your

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
when doing this will decrease your

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.910 
when doing this will decrease your
testosterone<00:02:28.069> production<00:02:29.260> build<00:02:30.260> muscle<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
testosterone production build muscle and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.030 
testosterone production build muscle and
lose<00:02:30.980> body<00:02:31.520> fat<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:32.510> will<00:02:32.720> mess<00:02:33.050> with<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.920> know

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
lose body fat it will mess with you know

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.280 
lose body fat it will mess with you know
it'll<00:02:34.310> mess<00:02:34.430> with<00:02:34.550> those<00:02:34.640> processes<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:36.230> you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
it'll mess with those processes so you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.199 
it'll mess with those processes so you
want<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.590> make<00:02:36.709> sure<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.070> don't<00:02:37.250> take<00:02:38.060> in

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
want to make sure that you don't take in

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.990 
want to make sure that you don't take in
too<00:02:38.420> much<00:02:38.570> soy<00:02:39.550> but<00:02:40.550> every<00:02:40.730> now<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:40.970> again

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
too much soy but every now and again

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.400 
too much soy but every now and again
it's<00:02:41.360> probably<00:02:41.660> not<00:02:41.750> gonna<00:02:41.870> do<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.080> whole<00:02:42.230> lot

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
it's probably not gonna do a whole lot

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.120 
it's probably not gonna do a whole lot
of<00:02:42.530> damage<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:44.470> just<00:02:45.470> thought<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:45.830> was<00:02:45.980> kind

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
of damage I just thought this was kind

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.660 
of damage I just thought this was kind
of<00:02:46.220> interesting<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.930> some<00:02:48.800> almond<00:02:49.190> butter<00:02:49.220> I

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
of interesting and some almond butter I

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.280 
of interesting and some almond butter I
probably<00:02:50.209> should<00:02:50.480> have<00:02:50.510> bought<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:50.989> because

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
probably should have bought this because

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.130 
probably should have bought this because
I<00:02:51.860> tend<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.580> over<00:02:52.820> eat<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.120> but<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.750> love<00:02:53.959> this

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
