00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.980
 Hi there, UTB sold kickstarter. not 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.809
 My name is Yaroslav and today we will 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.540
 talk about meizu m1 note 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.219
 most accessible and now available 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.500
 which repeats simultaneously two 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.689
 smartphone let's see what's in it 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.220
 interesting and why you should pay 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.720
 attention to this smartphone and if you 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.650
 looking for a cheap but powerful solution 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.650
 go 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.030
 meizu company just its so what 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.710
 long enough represented 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.540
 interesting product related they are in 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.850
 mostly stable electronics but not 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.030
 the secret is what exactly they once 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.980
 tried to make audio players and mix 3 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.739
 was hanging over the first massive successful 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.840
 smartphone but with a new ruler was everything 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.340
 not so uniquely 4 of them turned out 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.770
 my view is not quite a data strip 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.720
 Apparatus and it was clear that all the attention 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.770
 not forgotten it is concentrated on and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.160
 mix 4 pro 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.979
 but m1 note is the most affordable 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.450
 mix 3 just a year ago this time he 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.610
 got a completely plastic case 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.880
 which in almost all places 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.500
 reminds iphone 5c and even though you don’t like 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.330
 what I compared most android 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.690
 flagships of Chinese manufacturers 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.040
 showered products but guys it is iphone 5c 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.040
 which has been built 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.560
 it is not bad 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.960
 way miss managed to make a phone 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.640
 cheaper and available for most but 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.920
 while it gave him exactly good 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.259
 characteristics among among this 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.069
 kindergartens large display with good 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.229
 resolution and here the matrix flags 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.090
 actually well she is described 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.179
 pleasant and even even with such a bright 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.830
 the sun is absolutely no problem about 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.959
 controls here are all 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.369
 in the old way so separately theta with us 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.110
 I will not dwell on this 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.740
 just the buttons here too 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.360
 plastic and it was good 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.450
 would be weird if they were different 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.890
 material and thank god i'm not plastic 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.080
 the only material that would be here 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.660
 it was really appropriate except 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.910
 ceramics like nexus 5 where is the combination 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.819
 plastic + ceramics was real 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.130
 ok here they are plastic very easy 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.160
 grope they are right with your finger bump and 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.800
 This is convenient with the smartphone itself 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.690
 say that in ses while how much am i 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.790
 he used it, he called a teacher on 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.300
 positive 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.569
 he called me exclusively 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.370
 positive emotions with the most 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.770
 weak spot on my uncle seed cam 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.900
 it does not even reach mix 4, but with 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.569
 This is much better than umi x3 as 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.310
 let's look at the device side 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.489
 in front of a large display 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.420
 which is full hd and he is really nice 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.510
 flowers and fade under the sun and in fish 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.670
 viewing angles are really good they are clearly not 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.340
 the midrange that is it is the flagship display 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.250
 and then get to the bottom of something absolutely 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.159
 It does not work and if we talk about the ends 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.109
 on the right side we are met as I have already 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.930
 spoke the shutter volume control she 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.489
 plastic and it is very sharp it can 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.680
 some will not like it but you can 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.049
 getting used to it quite well moan easy 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.599
 groped and absolutely in the right place 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.260
 in order to adjust the volume with 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.849
 left side 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.530
 SIM card tray to him there 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.680
 some claims specifically my 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.510
 sample he sticks out a little 0 sits there 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.699
 tight enough and I don't think he's 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.790
 somewhere can get away with time from below 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:40.829
 on meet 34 slots under the speaker 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.930
 in days without loud and high quality two 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.060
 bolts that hold the screen and all 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.400
 The design of the whole microphone and micro sd 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.069
 under charge here was expect 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.489
 something else but all principle in its 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.769
 places 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.720
 in front one more microphone three with 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.250
 half a mini jack and a button for 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.590
 unlock which most 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.419
 no meizu users ever 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.699
 essentially will not use and behind 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:09.959
 Miss logo is already familiar inscription de 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:13.379
 strong b bo has gelding tea chamber 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.299
 and a double flash with let's say the same 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.909
 effect like iphone 5s 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.280
 where one flash is bright another type 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:22.949
 flesh color is the biggest claim 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.990
 to the case in my case the white version on 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.060
 it is not visible at all but here 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.740
 With regards to other version not sure maybe 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.219
 there it will be clearly noticeable 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.900
 note the fact that this connector 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.729
 three and a half mini jack &amp; plastic 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.949
 really very similar to that power 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.469
 which could be seen in the iPhone 3g s 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.960
 and as we know with time this plastic 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:45.030
 starts to crack I don't know the truth is 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.469
 will be for her for but maybe so here 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.789
 god may come out a year later 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:49.919
 using this smartphone on 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.840
 the front of it is already traditional 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.020
 unlock button which is on its 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.090
 over unlock smartphone and by 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.800
 clamp it, it is accordingly blocked 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.210
 on the shell at all walk on 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.480
 to a large account i won’t 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.060
 see clearly only to the bunks 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.920
 For example, a month do not borrow s4 pro and others 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.200
 4 in the previous video we are here absolutely 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.480
 still I’ll tell you myself separately 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.340
 the camera the camera has been traditional 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.250
 mode that switch pasta without 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.050
 prayers themselves what a ios-devices 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.440
 If the auto mode is a manual mode that 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.270
 you can adjust the shutter speed 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.080
 it is definitely interesting to change 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.570
 pisa exposure and delicious mode can 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.550
 be both manual and auto 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.990
 As a matter of fact, in addition to 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.610
 this is a portrait panorama change of focus 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.600
 traditional how to learn ivan emma 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.940
 8 or m9 or m7 I did not have all of you 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.250
 sorry and built-in scanner 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.320
 qr codes from fun really 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.600
 and there slow motion mode 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.330
 which for unknown reasons may 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.770
 take off from you for 60 seconds and honestly 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.750
 saying it works through one place 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.890
 very much everything twitches in every 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.770
 case on preview 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.410
 Well, clearly not iphone 5s, but if necessary 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:08.170
 slow down because you fit but its author 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:10.600
 let's try to take a picture of these 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.060
 The pictures will be a link under the description of this. 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.650
 the video you can see how the 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.290
 patra takes pictures with good 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.600
 lighting down we can be settings 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.700
 flashes 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.040
 all sorts of presets and they are useless 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.750
 absolutely so I have them even 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.930
 I will not stop and the button for 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.330
 shifts 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.230
 fronts on the front let's try 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:37.360
 Blouse pro works by the way frontalka 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.970
 very good and I must admit that here 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.480
 this is a piece of fleece that is below 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:49.120
 you can quietly sprinkle in general like 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:51.730
 so very summed up quickly I will say this 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.730
 the device is good for its money it is now 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:57.430
 much more attractive purchase 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.560
 than most traditional brands behind 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.760
 same money 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.940
 the only true criticism is his 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.860
 the case without a cover is definitely not worth wearing 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.080
 because most likely for 3 cases 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.970
 very fast fast action itself 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.890
 apparatus and batteries claims no 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.350
 can not be because the full working 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.950
 day and he works out with a bang we are already there 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.600
 pleases 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.280
 very sound from both speakers from 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.080
 headphone is unfortunately in terms of 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.120
 video is difficult to transmit but believe on 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.470
 the word means not much good on it 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.560
 all subscribe to the channel put 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.040
 big thumbs up and comment on this 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.890
 video 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.750
 tell me whether you like this m10 or not 

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.090
 in my opinion meizu turned out really 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.650
 cool hit which for some reason like me 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.120
 seems to be selling better than 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.770
 original and mix 4 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.770
 that's all bye bye
