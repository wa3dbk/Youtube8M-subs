00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.880
 to blues that part 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.769
 the blue stream is a sanctuary for manatees 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.869
 a place where they can breathe 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.869
 without apologizing 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.720

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.690
 we lost our wailing hand like many animals 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.600
 young people are always very curious 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.180
 to know if it's a boy or a girl you just have to wait 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.960

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.460
 a new toy in their environment they become excited about the tournament 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 on themselves 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.100

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.369
 m 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.299
 but at the same time 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.299
 the most basic without scars are the youngest 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.639
 with sometimes an ofce le mans 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.639
 but these are really considerable scars 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.199
