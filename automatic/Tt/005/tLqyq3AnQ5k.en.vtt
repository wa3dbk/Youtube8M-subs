00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.510
 what can we observe the id 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.180
 interesting 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.119
 during this long weekend of 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.460
 tiradentes store has a lot to 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.860
 be able to contemplate in heaven but this part 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.289
 some interesting objects to be 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.890
 observed with the naked eye or with a telescope 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.130
 with mito from 6pm to 9pm around 19 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.620
 hours as the sun sets horizon 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.449
 north looked a little up has a 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.300
 point plus and side this yellowish point 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.450
 It is the planet Jupiter that is possible 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.250
 to be watched with the eye on twitter is a 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.010
 of the planets that we will be able to 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.649
 observe and with ease during this 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.230
 The next holiday is not a color 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.789
 yellow as you said exactly 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.500
 So play to see in town with 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.170
 light pollution without light pollution 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.800
 you can see the naked eye easily 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.660
 who has the right telescope does not need 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.269
 be a mega telescope simple telescope 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.990
 and even with binoculars and put them in the next 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.509
 to the city 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.000
 the figure where to watch're right 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.560
 Jupiter there to deal with the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.959
 person who took this photo must have 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.310
 taken several photos stacked a photo 

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:19.940
 on the other to achieve these 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.610
 details of the stripes né de jupiter né 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.259
 because I want to highlight there is not 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.569
 itself but these four 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.179
 dots around him that are the 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.369
 four galilean moons and calixto europe 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.920
 and the unimed are both very nice to be 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.660
 observed with telescope binoculars and 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.580
 so every hour 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.619
 if you go observe and suddenly do 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.810
 a drawing a photographic record you 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.920
 will notice that the movement of these streets 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.489
 around jupiter 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.989
 if you have a telescope you will 

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:52.849
 already be able to see it until the moons together and 

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:54.200
 some tracks we already have 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.660
 You can see right 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.989
 with the telescope or in some bands and 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.319
 this red marchinha in the south part and 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:05.509
 jupiter effort said not 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.899
 this is the big big red spot 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.340
 a huge hurricane observed in 1610 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.440
 where it is recorded for the first time that the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.690
 Galileo Galilei is present today 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.690
 there are three more aligned lands 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.910
 or less in length and is very cool 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.840
 To see this , one must also mention the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.760
 next people 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.370
 suddenly they observe three moons in the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.750
 place of four or even two is not 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.209
 brave because sometimes our 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.489
 They are after Jupiter, right? 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.930
 So it's an eclipse. Let's just say it. 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.930
 you can not get these fights
