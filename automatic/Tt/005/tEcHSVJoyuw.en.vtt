people out there that want to be able to

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.340 
people out there that want to be able to
monitor<00:02:59.800> their<00:02:59.950> sound<00:03:01.050> unfortunately<00:03:02.050> with

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
monitor their sound unfortunately with

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.970 
monitor their sound unfortunately with
it's<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.130> thing<00:03:03.550> called<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.820> Phi<00:03:04.060> 0

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
it's a little thing called a Phi 0

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.230 
it's a little thing called a Phi 0
unfortunately<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.130> sound<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.610> little<00:03:06.730> off

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
unfortunately the sound is a little off

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.940 
unfortunately the sound is a little off
so<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.720> might<00:03:07.870> be<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.020> little<00:03:08.200> loud<00:03:08.440> or<00:03:08.710> a<00:03:08.740> little

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
so it might be a little loud or a little

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.620 
so it might be a little loud or a little
quieter<00:03:09.400> than<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.790> orig<00:03:10.090> than<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.450> actual

quieter than the orig than the actual

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.480 
quieter than the orig than the actual

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
turn the camera off turn the camera back

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.430

on<00:04:14.310> hit<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.340> delete<00:04:15.670> button<00:04:16.109> let's<00:04:17.109> go<00:04:17.260> down

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
on hit the delete button let's go down

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.849 
on hit the delete button let's go down
to<00:04:17.609> exposures<00:04:18.609> look<00:04:19.269> my<00:04:19.510> iso<00:04:19.780> is<00:04:19.930> now<00:04:20.049> 160<00:04:20.830> i

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
to exposures look my iso is now 160 i

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:21.960 
to exposures look my iso is now 160 i
didn't<00:04:21.130> have<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.310> go<00:04:21.430> down<00:04:21.580> to<00:04:21.609> where<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:21.850> says

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
didn't have to go down to where it says

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.880 
didn't have to go down to where it says
configure<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:22.720> can<00:04:22.840> save<00:04:23.080> configure<00:04:23.530> now

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
configure and you can save configure now

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.030 
configure and you can save configure now
so<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:26.340> just<00:04:26.400> automatically<00:04:27.680> saves<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.890> for

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
so it just automatically saves it for

many<00:05:02.640> options<00:05:02.940> here<00:05:03.420> with<00:05:03.570> magic<00:05:03.900> lantern

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
many options here with magic lantern

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.320 
many options here with magic lantern
you'd<00:05:04.590> be<00:05:04.710> crazy<00:05:04.980> not<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.400> have<00:05:05.730> this<00:05:05.970> on<00:05:06.180> your

you'd be crazy not to have this on your
camera<00:05:06.540> especially<00:05:06.900> as<00:05:07.470> stable<00:05:07.950> as<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.130> is<00:05:08.250> now

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
camera especially as stable as it is now

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.460 
camera especially as stable as it is now
it's<00:05:09.330> not<00:05:09.480> like<00:05:09.660> how<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.900> used<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.170> be<00:05:10.290> and<00:05:10.350> it

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
it's not like how it used to be and it

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.500 
it's not like how it used to be and it
would<00:05:10.560> flicker<00:05:10.800> or<00:05:10.950> shut<00:05:11.280> off<00:05:11.310> on<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.790> this

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
would flicker or shut off on you this

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.160 
would flicker or shut off on you this

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
really seems to be a stable sturdy piece

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.840 
really seems to be a stable sturdy piece
of<00:05:16.350> software<00:05:16.710> that<00:05:16.830> magic<00:05:17.250> lantern<00:05:17.580> has<00:05:17.700> put

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
out by far the best so I would

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.470 
out by far the best so I would
definitely<00:05:20.250> check<00:05:20.850> it<00:05:20.880> out<00:05:21.120> there'll<00:05:21.360> be<00:05:21.390> a

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
definitely check it out there'll be a

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.250 
definitely check it out there'll be a
link<00:05:21.780> down<00:05:22.170> below<00:05:23.120> far<00:05:24.120> as<00:05:24.420> i'll<00:05:24.630> call<00:05:24.840> link

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
link down below far as i'll call link

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.930 
link down below far as i'll call link
number<00:05:25.410> 1<00:05:25.590> and<00:05:25.980> then<00:05:26.100> link<00:05:26.280> number<00:05:26.400> 2<00:05:26.550> will<00:05:26.850> be
