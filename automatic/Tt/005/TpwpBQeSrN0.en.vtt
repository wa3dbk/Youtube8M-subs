00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.500
 in 2002 it is therefore very exciting but like the n95 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.919
 the new flagship n96 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.009
 in the first instance it seems as if they were unable to reach their own standard 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:19.029
 The Nokia N96, just like its predecessor, is no longer on the media and Twitter 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.039
 I have an excellent hospital to watch the internet surfing videos 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.039
 or take very good photos with a 5 megapixel camera 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.099
 little seems to have changed in that regard 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.039
 nevertheless there are a number of small differences, namely the n96, namely a pvda 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.960
 or digital TV 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.720
 with the career of subscriptions at the dozens of fanatic public works counter 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.969
 which is good 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.510
 you can read the subtitles 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.460
 the reception so good on the train you can watch TV quietly 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.950
 the sound is slightly less these have headphones 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.910
 and in between handy standard 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.980
 they are jan de bruijn 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.520
 another big difference is that the n96 has 16 gigabytes of solidity 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.620
 and that he has a micro sd card with him that benefits eighteen 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.410
 that seems a lot, but of course you want to set up a lot of music and 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.000
 pictures and you can now also record live television is probably plenty of that 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.830
 Another idea about the difference is the design it is now shiny and sleek 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.700
 sitting it might look nice, it was very quick fingerprints 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.740
 the distinctive duels leading those two sides trained 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.440
 is still present 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.570
 yet we are no different 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.000
 disadvantage is that it is all so tight it is not a religion in the group 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.830
 and therefore within those frameworks is difficult 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.530
 the other minus point is the oldest person 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.580
 you would say that was not recognized because I have nice school that falls against him 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.210
 goes that way 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.600
 a tricky issue with your own predecessor the n95 the battery 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.210
 and strikingly enough voices in 96 hit home ground 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.330
 then he will get what he is longer due to the debts 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.210
 changes 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.700
 And that comes down to being a slow process 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.460
 for that matter but good at it just really good 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.150
 in addition, he used it was not a battery indeed lasts much longer 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.670
 that also has a major improvement 68 still has visibility of the n35 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.850
 impressive specifications are still and now you can watch live TV 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.479
 but it feels different now than with the n35 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.549
 run around and the building surrounded 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.849
 so everything went about 35 early in Ramallah if you are looking for a the 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.599
 new municipality terneuzen anp a hex it is also very good
