exercise 22 is just for building finger

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.019 
exercise 22 is just for building finger
strength<00:00:26.919> and<00:00:27.070> dexterity<00:00:27.189> for<00:00:27.730> your<00:00:27.820> right

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
strength and dexterity for your right

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.999 
strength and dexterity for your right
hand<00:00:28.300> there's<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:28.960> lot<00:00:29.169> of<00:00:29.289> types<00:00:29.500> of<00:00:29.680> patterns

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
hand there's a lot of types of patterns

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.260 
hand there's a lot of types of patterns
you<00:00:30.099> could<00:00:30.220> do<00:00:30.340> for<00:00:30.550> this<00:00:30.669> you<00:00:30.910> could<00:00:31.060> work

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
you could do for this you could work

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.270 
you could do for this you could work
some<00:00:31.899> of<00:00:31.960> those<00:00:32.020> sweep<00:00:32.290> arpeggio<00:00:32.739> patterns<00:00:33.129> I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
some of those sweep arpeggio patterns I

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.530 
some of those sweep arpeggio patterns I
was<00:00:33.399> showing<00:00:33.550> you<00:00:33.699> before<00:00:33.850> it's<00:00:34.449> a<00:00:34.510> little

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
was showing you before it's a little

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.910 
was showing you before it's a little
more<00:00:34.780> advanced<00:00:35.110> but<00:00:35.290> it's<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.500> great<00:00:35.710> way<00:00:35.890> to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
more advanced but it's a great way to

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.220 
more advanced but it's a great way to
work<00:00:36.670> out<00:00:36.850> your<00:00:36.970> right<00:00:37.149> hand<00:00:37.390> finger

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
dexterity this particular pattern we're

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.670 
dexterity this particular pattern we're
gonna<00:00:40.600> be<00:00:40.750> going<00:00:40.839> back<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.410> Locrian

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
gonna be going back to the Locrian

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.410 
gonna be going back to the Locrian
skipping<00:00:42.250> sequence<00:00:42.610> from<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.940> beginning<00:00:43.329> of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
skipping sequence from the beginning of

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.689 
skipping sequence from the beginning of
this<00:00:43.600> DVD<00:00:43.949> this<00:00:44.949> is<00:00:45.100> one<00:00:45.250> I<00:00:45.280> would<00:00:45.460> highly

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
this DVD this is one I would highly

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.540 
this DVD this is one I would highly
recommend<00:00:45.730> working<00:00:46.600> slowly<00:00:47.199> and<00:00:47.620> working

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
recommend working slowly and working

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.390 
recommend working slowly and working
specifically<00:00:49.329> on<00:00:49.420> precision<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.589> timing

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
specifically on precision and timing

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.369 
specifically on precision and timing
maybe<00:00:51.730> with<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:51.970> metronome<00:00:52.329> just<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.170> get<00:00:53.350> a

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
maybe with a metronome just to get a

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.350 
maybe with a metronome just to get a
real<00:00:53.589> clean<00:00:53.860> sound<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.430> transition<00:00:55.030> from<00:00:55.180> one

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
real clean sound and transition from one

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:10.760 
real clean sound and transition from one
note<00:00:55.540> to<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.689> next

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 

hmmm<00:01:11.219> there's<00:01:11.549> some<00:01:11.820> interesting<00:01:12.119> aspects<00:01:12.719> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
hmmm there's some interesting aspects of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.490 
hmmm there's some interesting aspects of
this<00:01:13.020> technique<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:14.159> instance<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.759> slide

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.410 

actually<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.679> grace<00:01:19.950> note<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.700> real<00:01:20.880> quick

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
actually a grace note so it's real quick

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.819 
actually a grace note so it's real quick
it's<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.719> gonna<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:21.990> affecting<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> timing

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
it's not gonna be affecting the timing

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's not gonna be affecting the timing
at<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.520> won't<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.789> counting<00:01:24.149> this<00:01:24.240> in

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
at all you won't be counting this in

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.490 
at all you won't be counting this in
other<00:01:24.479> words<00:01:24.689> when<00:01:24.869> you're<00:01:24.990> playing<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.350> with

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
other words when you're playing it with

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
other words when you're playing it with
the<00:01:25.710> metronome<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.240> course<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the metronome which of course I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.520 
the metronome which of course I
recommend<00:01:27.780> doing<00:01:28.200> when<00:01:28.319> you're<00:01:28.409> practicing

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
recommend doing when you're practicing

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.649 
recommend doing when you're practicing
any<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> these<00:01:29.069> techniques<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:30.000> particular

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
any of these techniques this particular

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
any of these techniques this particular
technique<00:01:31.409> any<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.709> these<00:01:31.770> eight<00:01:31.979> finger

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
technique any of these eight finger

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.859 
technique any of these eight finger
tapping<00:01:32.520> techniques<00:01:33.030> should<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.420> practiced

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
tapping techniques should be practiced

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.740 
tapping techniques should be practiced
extremely<00:01:34.619> slowly<00:01:35.149> play<00:01:36.149> it<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.390> slow<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.719> you

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
extremely slowly play it as slow as you

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.719 
extremely slowly play it as slow as you
possibly<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.469> where<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.950> absolutely

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
possibly can to where it's absolutely

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.569 
possibly can to where it's absolutely
perfect<00:01:38.939> even<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:39.929> it's<00:01:40.079> painfully<00:01:40.679> slow<00:01:40.950> but

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
perfect even if it's painfully slow but

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.160 
perfect even if it's painfully slow but
if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.819> do<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> number<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.390> times<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.959> you

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
if you do that a number of times as you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.809 
if you do that a number of times as you
speed<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.470> it'll<00:01:44.069> become<00:01:44.189> easier<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.700> easier

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
speed up it'll become easier and easier

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.639 
speed up it'll become easier and easier
and<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.569> finally<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.200> down<00:01:46.409> at<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and when you finally get it down at a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.130 
and when you finally get it down at a
fast<00:01:47.280> speed<00:01:47.399> you'll<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.239> perfect<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
fast speed you'll have it perfect it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.229 
fast speed you'll have it perfect it
will<00:01:49.200> actually<00:01:49.349> be<00:01:49.619> clean<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.220> every<00:01:51.119> note

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:51.239 
will actually be clean and every note

00:01:51.239 --> 00:02:31.690 
will actually be clean and every note
will<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.450> audible
