00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
alright looks like we just clicked off a

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.240 
alright looks like we just clicked off a
seven-second<00:01:12.960> flat<00:01:13.170> zero<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.560> sixty<00:01:13.890> run<00:01:14.040> here

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250

very<00:03:20.670> hard<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.000> beat<00:03:21.180> with<00:03:21.900> our<00:03:22.050> quick<00:03:22.290> shift

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
very hard to beat with our quick shift

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.170 
very hard to beat with our quick shift
goodies<00:03:22.860> in<00:03:23.010> place<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.550> grip<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.910> clutch

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
goodies in place the grip of the clutch

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.360 
goodies in place the grip of the clutch
and<00:03:24.420> those<00:03:24.780> gears<00:03:25.140> we<00:03:25.620> should<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:25.920> well<00:03:26.160> on<00:03:26.280> our

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
and those gears we should be well on our

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.950 
and those gears we should be well on our
way<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.580> some<00:03:26.760> lower<00:03:26.910> eighties<00:03:27.360> off<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.780> line

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
way to some lower eighties off the line

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.600 
way to some lower eighties off the line
I<00:03:28.290> guess<00:03:28.800> there's<00:03:28.980> really<00:03:29.010> only<00:03:29.190> one<00:03:29.370> way<00:03:29.490> to

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
I guess there's really only one way to

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.580 
I guess there's really only one way to
find<00:03:29.910> out<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.420> let's<00:03:30.690> get<00:03:30.780> our<00:03:30.900> GT<00:03:31.200> out<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.500> the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
find out so let's get our GT out of the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.870 
find out so let's get our GT out of the
shop<00:03:31.680> one<00:03:32.130> more<00:03:32.310> time

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
shop one more time

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.880 
shop one more time
do<00:03:33.240> another<00:03:33.390> blast<00:03:33.660> 260<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.560> see<00:03:34.710> if<00:03:34.770> we've

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
do another blast 260 and see if we've

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:49.700 
do another blast 260 and see if we've
improved<00:03:35.160> our<00:03:35.370> times<00:03:48.230> all<00:03:49.230> right<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.560> looks

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
improved our times all right so it looks

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.310 
improved our times all right so it looks
like<00:03:49.830> we<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:49.950> clicked<00:03:50.310> off<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.610> 6.30<00:03:51.390> 260<00:03:52.140> run

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
like we just clicked off a 6.30 260 run

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.320 
like we just clicked off a 6.30 260 run
with<00:03:52.800> our<00:03:52.980> acceleration<00:03:53.520> pack<00:03:53.850> installed

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
with our acceleration pack installed

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.150 
with our acceleration pack installed
that's<00:03:54.690> nearly<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:55.020> full<00:03:55.410> second<00:03:55.830> difference

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
that's nearly a full second difference

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.040 
that's nearly a full second difference
over<00:03:56.370> our<00:03:56.460> baseline<00:03:56.760> times<00:03:57.240> and<00:03:57.570> it's<00:03:58.020> just

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
over our baseline times and it's just

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.660 
over our baseline times and it's just
proof<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.500> our<00:03:58.560> acceleration<00:03:59.100> pack<00:03:59.250> is

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
proof that our acceleration pack is

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.610 
proof that our acceleration pack is
doing<00:03:59.910> a<00:04:00.060> great<00:04:00.330> job<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:01.020> mean<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.260> clutch<00:04:01.470> was

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
doing a great job I mean the clutch was

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.500 
doing a great job I mean the clutch was
grabbing<00:04:01.830> hard<00:04:02.160> off<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.460> line<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:02.910> we<00:04:03.420> were

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
grabbing hard off the line and we were

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.640 
grabbing hard off the line and we were
really<00:04:03.660> rolling<00:04:03.900> through<00:04:04.110> those<00:04:04.230> gears<00:04:04.470> with

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
really rolling through those gears with

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.680 
really rolling through those gears with
the<00:04:04.740> SR<00:04:04.980> performance<00:04:05.010> shifter<00:04:05.550> so<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.480> wraps

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
the SR performance shifter so that wraps

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.970 
the SR performance shifter so that wraps
it<00:04:06.780> up<00:04:06.870> here<00:04:07.050> at<00:04:07.140> their<00:04:07.230> acceleration<00:04:07.800> pack
