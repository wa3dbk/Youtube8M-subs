00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.490
 I have their viewers on because Wolfgang Joop currently goes by that both 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.380
 privately as well as in the job the quarrel with his daughter now here and the house 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.299
 in Potsdam is not over yet anyway he had Gaston good in Paris 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:14.130
 To make an expression 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.699
 and present his new collection 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.839
 The designer Bill Kaulitz had invited as a prominent workhorse 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.979
 should morally support the media of his bitter heirs 

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:27.079
 distract with daughter now 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.219
 Wolfgang John Cleese Questions about the family quarrel in the apron prohibit 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.820
 then came a small kick in that direction, also its surprising 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.920
 Cheerful colorful collection addressed but that he also need one percent 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.410
 other dangers 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.450
 continue to be and belonged to the down-to-earth to see positive 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.230
 although some of the circumstances were a bit bitter 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.589
 Henderson I had a hard time 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.589
 because this man 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.830
 Get pictures of this thing 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.120
 they are very happy by his other answer 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.890
 in Mainz the designer is the death of his mother under the autumn with daughter 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.410
 Born now something of the ground well threatens to break the family 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.940
 In an interview with the colorful Wolfgang Joop tells his daughter 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.830
 The jealous narcissistic ETA is still to be cast out 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.940
 always blaming others for the harsh words 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.810
 For the first time now expressed in the opera she would become a de-escalation 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.060
 want to apologize No they have not dealt with this matter 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.550
 If that's the truth, you start telling the truth "we do not know 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.850
 Wolfgang Jung looks battered behind him is a stressful time that is 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.770
 for sure 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.000
 Today in Paris it was finally supposed to be Gnome's model for which he was Bill 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Kaulitz also flown in extra 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.250
 he is a good footballer, the road traffic is a few others 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.690
 Changes necessary 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.680
 and the comparison will make the operator small tip who planned ahead than what 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.850
 I spontaneously wear my shoes 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.270
 We did not do that and the sun reminded us again and again 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.859
 yes, the Wunderkind collection by Wolfgang Joop in Paris was very 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:02.759
 worth seeing 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.880
 at least the quarrel with her daughter does not make her want to discover her 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.850
 took
