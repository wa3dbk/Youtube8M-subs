00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.850
 professional but 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.850
 it's too risky too dangerous 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:28.010
 the text there 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:32.210
 What do we have to do recordings? 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.210
 so filming 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.440
 is always trying to do the best to 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.159
 take the event down here 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.220
 Santos to you over the internet in 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.220
 youtube 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.220
 the wonderful network that we can have 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.800
 access easily being well crafted 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.100
 huh 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:10.300
 It is well well well used used by me is 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:16.510
 a good cause brings benefits to 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:20.739
 we are all doing this 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.000
 report talking about these service there 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:34.690
 professionals here every day put the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:38.680
 their lives at risk to their lives and that the 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.220
 its heritage is not because a boat 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.750
 This should not be too cheap. 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.750
 should not be cheap, even 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.940
 have a cost 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:01.570
 must have a motor maintenance in 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:04.810
 other things that involve this service 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:12.220
 Furthermore we give showing here 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:16.390
 something here in the mouth of the bar 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:22.630
 one of those boats there that suffered there 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:26.440
 A tragedy can not even see that 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.239
 here was one that the many who 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.200
 already happened here 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:37.239
 this was one of the boats that was almost 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:44.410
 totally destroyed there you can 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:48.390
 observe here and even by 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.390
 sunk it 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:56.110
 it does not have much damage but then with 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.810
 the tide with the waves one it will have 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.640
 an 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:06.310
 it came to well- damaged tacin 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.640
 you can observe that all your 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.640
 structure 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.440
 has very much break is very 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:34.880
 very very very tannic much damage nor 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:39.860
 so here you can see that the whole 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:45.100
 ceiling there the house was destroyed right 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.860
 and beyond the networks it is used to 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:53.750
 do the fishing that got messed up in the 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:56.800
 middle of the land and the area of ​​the sea losing 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.360
 if all this material is to be 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.639
 rated and should not be cheap that 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:09.370
 There, then, the agent who does the 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:14.380
 type of work you are recording there 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:20.840
 occurrence but occurrence of a boat 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:26.180
 it drifted by then it does not stop being 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:29.930
 a very sacrificed service nor the people 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:34.180
 thinks it's easy but it's not 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:41.030
 professionals then they are 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:45.200
 daily running the risk of this 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:50.150
 type of problem and why 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:53.540
 in every way he has to plot the way 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.330
 and entry and exit from the sea 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.770
 For me so much of this must be 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.480
 one of the worst matches of the recapture 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.170
