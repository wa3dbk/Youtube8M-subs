00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:13.400
 podcast video today I'm going to you 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.259
 talk about computers and phones 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.420
 portable 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.880
 first of all the cellphone and 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.030
 three generations and at the most recent 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.820
 like galaxy if there's nothing to say tonight 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.150
 on laptops and to the little ones 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.680
 problems stuff it's useless to put 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.760
 a laptop if they do not fit in 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.310
 pocket then that's the little detail 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.329
 then it's a little less recent and 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.270
 so that blackberry was not last 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.480
 generation it's going to fit in your pocket 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.540
 main and then it goes to the level of 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.070
 the quality and all is not bad then 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.870
 third generation so that there 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.870
 no more hurry the more mule more 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:07.280
 it is disastrous that's a screen 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.460
 2 mm or a game on it is a game 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.319
 of moldy airplane in wholesale it's bad 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.420
 not detailed basket couch 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.499
 next I want to talk about computers 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.929
 portable 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:26.119
 then there are three categories like 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:30.020
 dalhem good kind aynak legrand imac 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.459
 with the screen 200 cm 2 good and very good 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.240
 once again it takes up space 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.409
 but it was a pretty big house 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.499
 normally you should be able to house it 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:45.859
 of aure then such a screen between the two 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:48.469
 like-minded houses these are the 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:52.659
 normal high enough graphical quality 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:57.889
 you do not have too normal what is it and 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:01.120

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:03.730
 full laptops 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.680
 but which takes no 2000 meters on 2 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.490
 but this time of 4 mm on four is 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.500
 really rubbish 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.530
 are we not being more zero than 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.890
 it's not possible who you are 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.300
 have a game on it but you want to go 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.710
 internet was a giant 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.450
 pain and yet it is not 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.980
 connected but it's not a wep key 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.310
