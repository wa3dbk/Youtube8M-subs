00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.390 

so<00:00:07.319> today<00:00:07.529> we're<00:00:07.710> gonna<00:00:07.830> learn<00:00:08.010> how<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.250> do

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
so today we're gonna learn how to do

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.490 
so today we're gonna learn how to do
isolations<00:00:09.120> or<00:00:09.540> Isis<00:00:10.110> for<00:00:10.290> short

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
isolations or Isis for short

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.249 
isolations or Isis for short
specifically<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.460> yo-yo<00:00:11.880> bounce<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.990> first

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
specifically the yo-yo bounce so first

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.870 
specifically the yo-yo bounce so first
and<00:00:13.410> foremost<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.070> isolation<00:00:14.580> we're

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and foremost for this isolation we're

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400 
and foremost for this isolation we're
going<00:00:15.089> up<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.420> down<00:00:15.570> we're<00:00:15.780> not<00:00:15.900> going<00:00:16.170> side

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
going up and down we're not going side

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.800 
going up and down we're not going side
to<00:00:16.560> side<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.039> if<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.730> remember<00:00:18.390> that

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
to side so if you have to remember that

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.960 
to side so if you have to remember that
there<00:00:19.050> imagine<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.890> there's<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.130> giant<00:00:20.400> line

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
there imagine that there's a giant line

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.400 
there imagine that there's a giant line
in<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.390> middle<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.660> your<00:00:21.750> hoop<00:00:21.960> that's

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
in the middle of your hoop that's

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.380 
in the middle of your hoop that's
directly<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> middle<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:24.119> can't

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
directly in the middle and you can't

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.560 
directly in the middle and you can't
skew<00:00:24.869> from<00:00:25.170> any<00:00:25.410> side<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.760> that's<00:00:26.849> constantly

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
skew from any side so that's constantly

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.439 
skew from any side so that's constantly
even<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.550> imagine<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.640> giant<00:00:29.820> pole<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
even or imagine a giant pole in the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.910 
even or imagine a giant pole in the
middle<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.720> your<00:00:30.810> hoop<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.590> not<00:00:31.740> lying

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
middle of your hoop and it's not lying

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.889 
middle of your hoop and it's not lying
you<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.189> anything<00:00:32.460> else<00:00:32.910> besides<00:00:33.270> making<00:00:33.840> it

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
you do anything else besides making it

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.330 
you do anything else besides making it
go<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.320> down<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.710> that's<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> movement<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
go up and down so that's the movement of

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.760 
go up and down so that's the movement of
the<00:00:35.399> hoop<00:00:35.520> throw<00:00:36.030> tackle<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.600> down<00:00:36.770> next

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the hoop throw tackle up and down next

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.380 
the hoop throw tackle up and down next
grab<00:00:38.250> whatever<00:00:38.430> hand<00:00:38.790> you're<00:00:38.850> gonna<00:00:38.940> practice

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
grab whatever hand you're gonna practice

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
grab whatever hand you're gonna practice
this<00:00:39.510> trick<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:39.930> practice<00:00:40.770> both<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.160> can

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
this trick with practice both if you can

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.299 
this trick with practice both if you can
to<00:00:42.360> grab<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.840> overhand<00:00:43.020> you're<00:00:43.290> using<00:00:43.469> grab<00:00:44.160> an

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
to grab it overhand you're using grab an

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.020 
to grab it overhand you're using grab an
imaginary<00:00:44.969> hoop<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.469> down<00:00:47.030> turn

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
imaginary hoop go all the way down turn

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.270 
imaginary hoop go all the way down turn
your<00:00:48.149> wrist<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.480> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
your wrist a little bit and go all the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.760 
your wrist a little bit and go all the
way<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:52.260> thing<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
way up and then do the same thing on the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
way up and then do the same thing on the
way<00:00:52.890> back<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.399> basically<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.149> you're<00:00:54.239> doing

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
way back so basically what you're doing

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.959 
way back so basically what you're doing
is<00:00:54.629> you're<00:00:54.809> making<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> giant<00:00:55.410> letter<00:00:55.739> V<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
is you're making a giant letter V so

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.689 
is you're making a giant letter V so
you're<00:00:57.149> doing<00:00:58.160> you're<00:00:59.160> doing<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.460> little

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
you're doing you're doing this little

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.150 
you're doing you're doing this little
movement<00:01:00.059> right<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.500> also<00:01:01.710> keep<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
movement right here but also keep in

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.130 
movement right here but also keep in
mind<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.460> your<00:01:02.730> hoop<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.480> pointed<00:01:04.049> at

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
mind that your hoop is not pointed at

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
mind that your hoop is not pointed at
the<00:01:04.260> end<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:06.180> you're

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the end so what you have to do is you're

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
the end so what you have to do is you're
going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.840> trace<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.530> outline<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.100> hoop

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
going to trace the outline of the hoop

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
going to trace the outline of the hoop
the<00:01:08.820> circular<00:01:09.299> part<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> hoop<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the circular part of the hoop and that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.440 
the circular part of the hoop and that
will<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.530> your<00:01:10.979> replacement<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.180> bottom

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
will be your replacement for the bottom

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
will be your replacement for the bottom
of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> point<00:01:12.990> TV<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.860> essentially<00:01:14.250> what

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
of the point TV so essentially what

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.940 
of the point TV so essentially what
you're<00:01:14.430> doing<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.909> you're<00:01:15.659> doing<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.990> you're

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you're doing is you're doing this you're

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
you're doing is you're doing this you're
you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.759> my<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.119> hoop<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.689> there

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you can see my little hoop right there

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.109 
you can see my little hoop right there
so<00:01:19.470> you're<00:01:19.650> adjusting<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.549> hand<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> your

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
so you're adjusting your hand and your

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.960 
so you're adjusting your hand and your
movement<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> hoop<00:01:22.140> size<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.890> how<00:01:23.729> much

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
movement to the hoop size and how much

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.140 
movement to the hoop size and how much
you'd<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.229> or<00:01:26.040> how<00:01:26.280> round<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.820> depends

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you'd do it or how round it is depends

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.030 
you'd do it or how round it is depends
on<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.390> hoop<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> few<00:01:28.950> different

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
on your hoop you can do a few different

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.550 
on your hoop you can do a few different
things<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.850> trick<00:01:30.119> alone<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.930> far<00:01:31.470> as

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
things with this trick alone as far as

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.310 
things with this trick alone as far as
the<00:01:31.650> shape<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.659> so<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.720> could<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> very

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the shape of it so you could do a very

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.120 
the shape of it so you could do a very
narrow<00:01:34.770> V<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.150> down<00:01:36.890> or<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
narrow V so it's very up and down or you

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.789 
narrow V so it's very up and down or you
could<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> very<00:01:38.700> wide<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.470> but<00:01:40.470> keep<00:01:40.650> in

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
could do a very wide one but keep in

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.350 
could do a very wide one but keep in
mind<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> wider<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> more

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
mind that the wider you do it the more

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.730 
mind that the wider you do it the more
you<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.600> kind<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> trace<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.350> outline

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you have to kind of trace that outline

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
you have to kind of trace that outline

if you want to add more of an illusion
what<00:01:46.170> you're<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.740> next<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.250> you're

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
what you're going to do next is you're

single time that hoop goes down your
hands<00:01:52.200> either<00:01:52.380> gonna<00:01:52.560> cross<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.610> uncross<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
hands either gonna cross or uncross so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.899 
hands either gonna cross or uncross so
let's<00:01:55.649> start<00:01:55.950> from<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.189> beginning<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.700> up

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
let's start from the beginning go up

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.609 
let's start from the beginning go up
down<00:01:57.750> cross<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.939> stays<00:02:00.329> crossed<00:02:00.840> until

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
down cross and it stays crossed until

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.500 
down cross and it stays crossed until
the<00:02:01.710> next<00:02:02.040> time<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.369> goes<00:02:02.490> down<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.590> uncross

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
the next time it goes down so uncross

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.690 
the next time it goes down so uncross
cross<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.680> what<00:02:06.770> I'm<00:02:06.860> doing<00:02:07.130> with<00:02:07.220> my<00:02:07.250> fingers

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
cross and what I'm doing with my fingers

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.040 
cross and what I'm doing with my fingers
is<00:02:07.850> I'm<00:02:08.030> not<00:02:08.180> clasping<00:02:08.750> it

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
is I'm not clasping it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.410 
is I'm not clasping it
I'm<00:02:09.110> not<00:02:09.620> pinching<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.430> or<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:11.150> know<00:02:11.240> having

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
I'm not pinching it or you know having

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.030 
I'm not pinching it or you know having
my<00:02:11.570> fingers<00:02:11.930> around<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.380> even<00:02:12.590> if<00:02:12.650> it's<00:02:12.800> loose

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
my fingers around it even if it's loose

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.550 
my fingers around it even if it's loose
you<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.480> but<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.870> could<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.320> problem

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
you can do it but it could be a problem

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.900 
you can do it but it could be a problem
when<00:02:15.830> you're<00:02:15.890> practicing<00:02:16.070> as<00:02:16.490> our<00:02:16.580> fingers

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
when you're practicing as our fingers

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.700 
when you're practicing as our fingers
might<00:02:17.120> get<00:02:17.300> sweaty<00:02:17.960> you're<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> way<00:02:18.560> or

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
might get sweaty you're in the way or

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.650 
might get sweaty you're in the way or
something<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.160> practice<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:19.820> this<00:02:20.090> or

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
something so just practice like this or

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.980 
something so just practice like this or
hands<00:02:21.290> over<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.420> just<00:02:23.420> practice<00:02:23.810> like<00:02:23.960> that

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
hands over and just practice like that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.550 
hands over and just practice like that
so<00:02:24.410> you're<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.860> down<00:02:25.690> bottom<00:02:26.690> rotate<00:02:27.350> with

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
so you're going down bottom rotate with

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.100 
so you're going down bottom rotate with
that<00:02:27.680> outline<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.100> hoop<00:02:28.280> go<00:02:28.910> up<00:02:29.180> down

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
that outline of the hoop go up down

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.460 
that outline of the hoop go up down
rotate<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.490> add<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.790> hand<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.720> cross<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.380> it

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
rotate to add the hand you cross and it

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.350 
rotate to add the hand you cross and it
goes<00:02:33.590> down<00:02:33.770> on<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.490> cross<00:02:34.850> when<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.090> goes<00:02:35.210> down

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
goes down on a cross when it goes down

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.050 
goes down on a cross when it goes down
again<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.170> keep<00:02:36.380> doing<00:02:36.740> this<00:02:36.860> trick<00:02:37.190> so

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
again and keep doing this trick so

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.430 
again and keep doing this trick so
there's<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.630> lot<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.930> different<00:02:39.170> things<00:02:39.320> you

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
there's a lot of different things you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.170 
there's a lot of different things you
can<00:02:39.530> do<00:02:39.800> with<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.190> whole<00:02:40.340> movement<00:02:40.820> of<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.970> V

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
can do with the whole movement of the V

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.780 
can do with the whole movement of the V
with<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.510> bottom<00:02:41.900> half<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.310> just<00:02:43.490> experiment

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
with the bottom half so just experiment

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.420 
with the bottom half so just experiment
but<00:02:44.450> well<00:02:45.110> cross<00:02:45.350> an<00:02:45.530> arm<00:02:45.710> thing<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.220> just

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
but well cross an arm thing is just

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.500 
but well cross an arm thing is just
something<00:02:46.700> I'm<00:02:46.820> giving<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.390> guys
