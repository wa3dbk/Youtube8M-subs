different by his word language of
justification<00:02:21.519> he<00:02:21.730> means<00:02:21.939> something<00:02:22.239> a

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
justification he means something a

little different by his language of
faith<00:02:23.769> even<00:02:24.189> because<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.819> demons<00:02:25.180> believe

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
faith even because the demons believe

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.280 
faith even because the demons believe
right<00:02:26.739> that's<00:02:26.950> not<00:02:27.189> pauline<00:02:27.670> faith<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:29.049> it's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
right that's not pauline faith so it's

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.979 
right that's not pauline faith so it's
that<00:02:29.500> kind<00:02:29.829> of<00:02:29.920> thing<00:02:30.189> that<00:02:30.459> gets<00:02:31.299> discussed

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
that kind of thing that gets discussed

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.380 
that kind of thing that gets discussed
then<00:02:32.590> we<00:02:32.739> also<00:02:32.920> deal<00:02:33.310> with<00:02:33.340> revelation<00:02:34.209> and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
then we also deal with revelation and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.050 
then we also deal with revelation and
actually<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.530> course<00:02:35.859> is<00:02:36.040> typically<00:02:36.519> split

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
actually this course is typically split

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.300 
actually this course is typically split
we<00:02:37.329> split<00:02:37.689> it<00:02:37.780> between<00:02:37.810> two<00:02:38.200> professors<00:02:38.859> I

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
we split it between two professors I

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.309 
we split it between two professors I
teach<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:40.000> revelation<00:02:40.569> part<00:02:40.810> I'm<00:02:41.019> really

teach the revelation part I'm really

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.069 
teach the revelation part I'm really
excited<00:02:41.739> about<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.340> partly<00:02:43.209> because<00:02:43.359> I<00:02:43.780> think

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
excited about it partly because I think

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.809 
excited about it partly because I think
many<00:02:44.560> people<00:02:44.920> are<00:02:45.040> afraid<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.579> book<00:02:45.700> of

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
to its consummation in Christ so I tried

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.920 
to its consummation in Christ so I tried
to<00:03:08.799> teach<00:03:09.189> people<00:03:09.579> to<00:03:09.970> approach<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.780> book

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
to teach people to approach the book

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.110 
to teach people to approach the book
looking<00:03:11.439> for<00:03:11.650> those<00:03:11.769> major<00:03:12.250> things<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:13.000> are

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
looking for those major things that are

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.690 
looking for those major things that are
obvious<00:03:13.359> rather<00:03:14.049> than<00:03:14.319> right<00:03:15.129> away<00:03:15.370> getting

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
obvious rather than right away getting

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.420 
obvious rather than right away getting
bogged<00:03:15.909> down<00:03:15.939> in<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.359> details<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.980> believe

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
bogged down in the details and I believe

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.539 
bogged down in the details and I believe
that<00:03:18.760> way<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:20.349> can<00:03:20.560> find<00:03:20.859> out<00:03:21.069> that<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.400> book

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
that way you can find out that the book

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.030 
that way you can find out that the book
of<00:03:21.579> Revelation<00:03:22.239> is<00:03:22.419> in<00:03:22.690> fact<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:23.079> very<00:03:23.139> relevant

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
of Revelation is in fact a very relevant

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.640 
of Revelation is in fact a very relevant
book<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:25.000> relevant<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.720> spiritual<00:03:26.379> warfare

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
book it's relevant to spiritual warfare

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.339 
book it's relevant to spiritual warfare
it's<00:03:27.430> relevant<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.180> Christian<00:03:28.690> hope<00:03:28.959> that

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
it's relevant to Christian hope that

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.189 
it's relevant to Christian hope that
should<00:03:29.919> be<00:03:30.069> pretty<00:03:30.280> obvious<00:03:30.430> right<00:03:31.000> if<00:03:31.419> it<00:03:32.049> is

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
should be pretty obvious right if it is

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.189 
should be pretty obvious right if it is
