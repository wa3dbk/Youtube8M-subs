00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
we can install it in the dishwasher we

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.000 
we can install it in the dishwasher we
want<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.819> rewrap<00:03:49.420> these<00:03:49.660> wires<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.319> we<00:03:50.830> put

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
want to rewrap these wires so we put

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.920 
want to rewrap these wires so we put
some<00:03:51.130> new<00:03:51.160> tape<00:03:51.430> on<00:03:51.580> them<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.790> want<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.030> get

some new tape on them you want to get

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.750 
some new tape on them you want to get
the<00:03:53.080> black<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.410> white<00:03:53.709> wires<00:03:53.920> out<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.610> them

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
the black and white wires out of them

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.320 
the black and white wires out of them
and<00:03:55.680> then<00:03:56.680> take<00:03:57.340> these<00:03:57.489> wires<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.090> wrap<00:03:58.300> some

protected another way of those taped up
we<00:04:08.380> can<00:04:08.650> install<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.010> new<00:04:09.250> thermal<00:04:09.549> fuse<00:04:09.690> to

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
we can install the new thermal fuse to

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.150 
we can install the new thermal fuse to
put<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.900> new<00:04:11.019> thermal<00:04:11.319> fuse<00:04:11.350> in<00:04:11.680> we're<00:04:12.069> going
