00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.380
 basically exists 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.730
 for our 140th anniversary 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.110
 to bring out a vintage series and 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.180
 yes, we then oriented ourselves 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.820
 that old drums the thought was 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.540
 Simply old design with new technology too 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.210
 connect 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.080
 the first designs we have cad 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.190
 programs and then have 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.580
 Prototypes made of plastic 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.820
 then we lose printing in 3d 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.820
 let produce 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.090
 At vintage was like that used to be 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.259
 was so common 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.810
 book plywood 1 we once have one 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.600
 Slides surface in the offer itself 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.850
 also to the style of the 50s 60s 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.759
 we lean on and beyond 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.400
 also two stained wood surfaces 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.680
 at once a slightly lighter shade and 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.909
 once something a darker almost 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.909
 black hue 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.290
 at the other drums are 45 degrees 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.390
 cutter and a date is one 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.340
 Underground excavation there is the fur more 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.580
 and that gives another warmer one 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.580
 clear 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.480
 only this technique has developed with 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.300
 this full-surface no- adhesive of the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.370
 lining and the boiler to thus for 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.520
 to prevent blisters 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.480
 and second, this liability 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.820
 actually on a permanent basis 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.560
 Thus, vibrations are also the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:03:00.330
 Cover if this liability did not exist 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:03:02.010
 prevents further features are 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.800
 of course at the time 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.410
 ajar of the withdrawal, of course, too 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.489
 the exciting little bells are there for us 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.209
 the bobs from that time 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.670
 decided 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.810
 the so-called teardrop heads the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.670
 Of course we have another one 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.470
 so refined is there too 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.470
 integrated a winning backup
