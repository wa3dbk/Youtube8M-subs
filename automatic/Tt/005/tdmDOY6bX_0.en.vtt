00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
suns sim and as you walk across it it's

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.929 
suns sim and as you walk across it it's
and<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> moving<00:00:28.949> 3d<00:00:29.250> image<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> third

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and the moving 3d image of the third

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.560 
and the moving 3d image of the third
from<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> scan<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.619> creates<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.579> custom-made

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
from the scan it creates a custom-made

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.959 
from the scan it creates a custom-made
shoe<00:00:33.840> insole<00:00:34.170> called<00:00:34.530> an<00:00:34.649> orthotic<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.399> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
shoe insole called an orthotic and this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.639 
shoe insole called an orthotic and this
helps<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.329> correct<00:00:36.660> any<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> 40-foot

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
helps to correct any of the 40-foot

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.470 
helps to correct any of the 40-foot
biomechanics<00:00:38.520> which<00:00:38.820> may<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.090> contributing

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
biomechanics which may be contributing

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.510 
biomechanics which may be contributing
to<00:00:39.960> your<00:00:39.989> pain<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:41.070> now<00:00:41.219> I'm<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> show

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
to your pain so now I'm going to show

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
to your pain so now I'm going to show
you<00:00:41.670> how<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> system<00:00:42.360> works<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> James<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.649> you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
you how the system works so James if you

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:56.450 
you how the system works so James if you
can<00:00:46.800> step<00:00:47.160> onto<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.640> plane<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.920> step<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
can step onto the plane and step off the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.569 
can step onto the plane and step off the
plane<00:01:00.079> okay<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.140> from<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> statics<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.309> we

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
plane okay so from the statics can we

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.070 
plane okay so from the statics can we
can<00:01:02.789> see<00:01:03.149> areas<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.989> red<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:06.330> these

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
can see areas of red here and here these

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.250 
can see areas of red here and here these
are<00:01:07.260> areas<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.770> high<00:01:08.130> pressure<00:01:09.020> also<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.110> well

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
are areas of high pressure also as well

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260 
are areas of high pressure also as well
you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.310> James<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.760> bearing<00:01:12.030> more

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you can see that James is bearing more

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
you can see that James is bearing more
weight<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> right<00:01:12.990> than<00:01:13.229> he<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.619> left

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
weight on the right than he is the left

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
weight on the right than he is the left
so<00:01:14.220> there's<00:01:14.400> fifty<00:01:14.729> five<00:01:14.909> point<00:01:15.240> three

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
so there's fifty five point three

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.690 
so there's fifty five point three
percent<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.159> 44.7<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> left

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
percent on the right 44.7 on the left

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.359 
percent on the right 44.7 on the left
this<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.900> indicates<00:01:19.470> postural<00:01:20.130> problems

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
this just indicates postural problems

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.179 
this just indicates postural problems
which<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:22.140> may<00:01:22.290> need<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.560> look<00:01:22.680> into<00:01:22.830> further

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
which we may need to look into further

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.789 
which we may need to look into further
and<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.450> corrected<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:24.930> chiropractic

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and can be corrected with chiropractic

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.350 
and can be corrected with chiropractic
treatment<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.430> orthotics

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.390 

james<00:01:31.360> agee<00:01:31.540> who<00:01:31.810> walk<00:01:31.930> across<00:01:32.170> playfully

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.320 

that's<00:01:36.400> right<00:01:36.550> we'll<00:01:36.760> come<00:01:36.880> back<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.180> let's

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
that's right we'll come back and let's

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:46.969 
that's right we'll come back and let's
do<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.570> other<00:01:37.600> leg

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.130 

so<00:01:47.979> from<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.250> dynamics<00:01:48.789> can<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.539> can<00:01:49.719> see<00:01:49.929> the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
so from the dynamics can you can see the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.999 
so from the dynamics can you can see the
big<00:01:50.320> areas<00:01:50.829> of<00:01:51.100> red<00:01:51.909> pressure<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.859> this<00:01:53.859> is

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
big areas of red pressure and this is

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.889 
big areas of red pressure and this is
where<00:01:54.189> James<00:01:54.640> is<00:01:54.789> burying<00:01:55.179> too<00:01:55.359> much<00:01:55.509> weight

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
where James is burying too much weight

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.889 
where James is burying too much weight
through<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.560> part<00:01:56.799> of<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:56.979> foot<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:58.539> scan

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
through that part of the foot the scan

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.929 
through that part of the foot the scan
on<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.200> right<00:01:59.409> is<00:01:59.619> an<00:01:59.799> optimal<00:02:00.189> foot<00:02:00.429> sample

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
on the right is an optimal foot sample

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.480 
on the right is an optimal foot sample
so<00:02:01.329> it's<00:02:01.479> good<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.689> compare<00:02:02.200> what<00:02:03.069> your<00:02:03.219> feet

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
so it's good to compare what your feet

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.219 
so it's good to compare what your feet
are<00:02:03.610> doing<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.539> what<00:02:04.719> they<00:02:04.929> should<00:02:05.380> be<00:02:05.530> doing

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
are doing to what they should be doing

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.570 
are doing to what they should be doing
it's<00:02:08.229> possible<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.709> see<00:02:08.860> when<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.250> when<00:02:09.549> the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
it's possible to see when the when the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.650 
it's possible to see when the when the
foot<00:02:09.849> is<00:02:10.000> moving<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.650> problem<00:02:11.980> areas

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
foot is moving that the problem areas

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.630 
foot is moving that the problem areas
James<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.840> right<00:02:13.870> foot<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.590> moving<00:02:15.069> too

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
James is right foot is moving too

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.780 
James is right foot is moving too
quickly<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:17.379> will<00:02:17.530> put<00:02:17.739> pressure

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
quickly and this will put pressure

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.009 
quickly and this will put pressure
through<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.120> soft<00:02:19.299> tissues<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.959> the

through the soft tissues and the

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.680 
through the soft tissues and the
structures<00:02:20.530> not<00:02:20.739> only<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> foot<00:02:21.459> but<00:02:22.450> also

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
structures not only in the foot but also

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.390 
structures not only in the foot but also
in<00:02:23.170> your<00:02:23.560> knees<00:02:24.069> hips<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.360> low<00:02:25.780> back

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.490 

you<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.580> also<00:02:30.700> view<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.180> scan<00:02:31.599> in<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.870> 3d

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
you can also view the scan in a 3d

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.039 
you can also view the scan in a 3d
format<00:02:33.040> like<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.909> this<00:02:34.659> is<00:02:34.780> what<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
format like this and this is what the

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.929 
format like this and this is what the
lab<00:02:35.260> use<00:02:35.560> when<00:02:35.890> they<00:02:36.040> make<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.549> custom-made

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
lab use when they make the custom-made

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.350 
lab use when they make the custom-made
orthotic<00:02:37.689> so<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.319> like<00:02:38.439> a<00:02:38.470> prescription<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
orthotic so it's like a prescription the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.319 
orthotic so it's like a prescription the
orthotic<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.290> made<00:02:41.530> from<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.159> moving<00:02:42.700> 3d

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
orthotic is made from this moving 3d

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.490 
orthotic is made from this moving 3d
image<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.230> fits<00:02:44.680> your<00:02:45.159> exact<00:02:45.760> foot<00:02:46.269> imprint

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
image so it fits your exact foot imprint

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.050 
image so it fits your exact foot imprint
you

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
you

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.900 
you
the<00:02:50.959> scan<00:02:51.260> also<00:02:51.620> provides<00:02:51.980> us<00:02:52.220> with<00:02:52.250> extra

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
the scan also provides us with extra

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.970 
the scan also provides us with extra
information<00:02:53.349> so<00:02:54.349> this<00:02:54.500> just<00:02:54.650> looks<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:54.890> a

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
information so this just looks like a

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.780 
information so this just looks like a
big<00:02:55.280> table<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.569> numbers<00:02:57.069> but<00:02:58.069> actually<00:02:58.520> all

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
big table of numbers but actually all

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.370 
big table of numbers but actually all
these<00:02:59.209> numbers<00:02:59.630> should<00:02:59.750> be<00:02:59.810> falling<00:03:00.230> within

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
these numbers should be falling within

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.250 
these numbers should be falling within
the<00:03:00.590> green<00:03:00.860> optimal<00:03:01.640> range<00:03:01.849> and<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.930> can<00:03:03.080> see

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
the green optimal range and you can see

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.080 
the green optimal range and you can see
from<00:03:03.410> james's<00:03:03.890> scan<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.340> there<00:03:04.640> are<00:03:04.849> areas

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
from james's scan that there are areas

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.460 
from james's scan that there are areas

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.620 

there<00:03:14.370> are<00:03:14.490> different<00:03:14.580> types<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:15.090> orthotics

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
there are different types of orthotics

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.720 
there are different types of orthotics
for<00:03:15.780> different<00:03:16.200> shoes<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> pair<00:03:17.550> of

to see there that extra layer of red in

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.730 
to see there that extra layer of red in
the<00:03:23.550> heel<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.060> that's<00:03:24.900> for<00:03:25.110> extra<00:03:25.500> shock

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
the heel and that's for extra shock

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.050 
the heel and that's for extra shock
absorption<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:27.420> instead<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.780> your<00:03:28.020> foot

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060

very comfortable and my patients love
them<00:03:58.739> they<00:03:59.489> find<00:03:59.820> that<00:03:59.970> helps<00:04:00.540> reduce<00:04:00.959> heel

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
them they find that helps reduce heel

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.449 
them they find that helps reduce heel
pain<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.280> if<00:04:03.270> you<00:04:03.450> get<00:04:03.600> tired<00:04:03.989> achy<00:04:04.950> legs<00:04:05.100> by

pain and if you get tired achy legs by
the<00:04:05.520> end<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.940> day<00:04:06.120> orthotics<00:04:07.050> can<00:04:07.230> really

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
the end of the day orthotics can really

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.650 
the end of the day orthotics can really
help<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.770> reduce<00:04:08.040> them<00:04:10.580> this<00:04:11.580> orthotic<00:04:11.970> has<00:04:12.390> a

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
help to reduce them this orthotic has a

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.820 
help to reduce them this orthotic has a
special<00:04:13.050> top<00:04:13.290> layer<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.890> it's<00:04:14.670> useful<00:04:15.180> for

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
special top layer and it's useful for

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.430 
special top layer and it's useful for
rugby<00:04:16.830> players<00:04:17.190> football<00:04:18.060> players<00:04:18.479> because

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
rugby players football players because

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.430 
rugby players football players because
it's<00:04:19.590> quite<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.010> slimline<00:04:20.580> orthotic<00:04:21.540> and<00:04:21.810> this

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
it's quite a slimline orthotic and this

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.400 
it's quite a slimline orthotic and this
shock<00:04:22.919> absorption<00:04:23.310> top<00:04:23.790> layer<00:04:24.060> really<00:04:25.050> helps

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
shock absorption top layer really helps

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.400 
shock absorption top layer really helps
to<00:04:25.530> absorb<00:04:25.710> ground<00:04:26.700> reaction<00:04:27.030> force<00:04:30.290> this<00:04:31.290> is

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
to absorb ground reaction force this is

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.010 
to absorb ground reaction force this is
a<00:04:31.440> Christian<00:04:31.770> flex<00:04:32.010> orthotic<00:04:32.600> this<00:04:33.600> is<00:04:33.780> useful

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
a Christian flex orthotic this is useful

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.250 
a Christian flex orthotic this is useful
for<00:04:34.530> people<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.280> have<00:04:35.430> sensitive<00:04:36.000> feeds<00:04:36.540> or

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
for people you have sensitive feeds or

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.250 
for people you have sensitive feeds or
maybe<00:04:37.650> arthritic<00:04:38.190> fees<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:39.870> it's<00:04:40.020> really

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
maybe arthritic fees so it's really

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.640 
maybe arthritic fees so it's really
comfortable

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.070 

so<00:04:48.650> as<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:48.979> can<00:04:49.129> see<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:50.000> tog<00:04:50.240> banking<00:04:50.720> system

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
so as you can see the tog banking system

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.110 
so as you can see the tog banking system
is<00:04:51.259> very<00:04:51.470> accurate<00:04:51.830> because<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:52.729> captures<00:04:52.909> a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
is very accurate because it captures a

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.439 
is very accurate because it captures a
moving<00:04:53.689> 3d<00:04:54.289> image<00:04:54.620> of<00:04:54.860> your<00:04:54.979> foot<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:56.000> from<00:04:56.270> the

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
moving 3d image of your foot so from the
