00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello friends with you Maracas 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.010
 today I would like to show two interesting 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.860
 positions and first position on the port map 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.940
 that's how I took this position 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:21.210
 is on the bridge and from here I see already 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.000
 kv-5 from this position you can shoot here 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.180
 watering involved from the bridge 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.859
 as well as throw all enemies 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.829
 often roll down to the right of the bridge is very 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.250
 good position but note that in art 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.660
 only one enemy is su-8 and put 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.610
 she is not the most skill on and I decided 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.940
 risk besides this descent 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.129
 allows you to quickly slide down and on 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.030
 all sorts of fast type tanks 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.239
 then three you will be able to return from the arts but 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.460
 anyway it will be a little risky 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.710
 but here apt-5 has already ended but there is 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.409
 two three fours 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.110
 which turned out to be the best for me 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.970
 positions for myself but i can 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.420
 stick out only one tower already 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.850
 shoot at their not cardboard case but 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.170
 noticed another shot from y and minus zero this 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.829
 be sure to do with such a gun 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:33.659
 how bl-10 can mess things up again 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.299
 are you waiting for recharge but the car could 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.280
 then take a look but didn’t throw it 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.880
 she said not the most skillful 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.509
 besides, I try not to bet for a long time 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.780
 one place here someone ricochets on the left and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:53.430
 pay at this moment if the enemies 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.939
 are on the left ie anywhere here 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.440
 here they can already and then we already 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.130
 shoot you easy for them to punch you 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:09.670
 just that I did not realize that's the way was 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:13.450
 in board the t-34 and was unable to finish off so here 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:18.120
 too, is once again one last time and 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:24.100
 I shoot three shorts and get tasty 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:27.280
 shot straight up the side of the tower and you sum and here 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.750
 I certainly didn’t take that down 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.690
 already there is no sense there 2 3 4 and fall down 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.550
 also I have no sense there still lose 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.010
 more hp in the end and the amount demolished me 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.310
 almost all strength 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:49.210
 roll back but 3000 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.570
 Damage I applied and be careful if 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.930
 is there a chip here in this area or 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.060
 some other tank then if you are at the center 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.590
 leave the bridge stupidly you will be very 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.600
 throw heavily so shoot first 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.290
 hence u careful and after each 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.630
 shots immediately go down the bridge 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.260
 and move to art on you did not hit 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.260
 if it is 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.620
 so next position on our map 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.190
 Holov here I wrote that level 18 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.269
 helped here I just drove to this 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.920
 positions here it can be from here 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:37.569
 shoot at all all the enemies that 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:41.739
 are below and above and they are for you 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:45.129
 can only get with very accurately 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.069
 bucket such as kvass for me to get 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.849
 almost no chance but only if he 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.519
 lucky 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:55.390
 because here it is not even 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:59.970
 the terrain covers my enclosure sticks out a 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.739
 only one of yours but the position is quite 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.450
 fit and look heavy tanks and for 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:10.299
 t34 for t July 29 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.360
 t32 and not for many tanks which 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.630
 good vertical angles but 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.380
 if art of the enemy is skill then of course 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.410
 for a long time you will not live here taking yourself 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.450
 now damage 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.570
 Churchill I feel sorry for 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.169
 because he has so much speed 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:37.360
 slowly and that he was too lazy to drive 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:38.650
 forward looking for a shot of kvass and these 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.590
 here are the tanks below 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:46.900
 they really are also on me in 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.210
 They are all vulnerable, but I can 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.510
 absolutely all can get 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.890
 damage 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:59.840
 to any nearby enemy 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:04.530
 Here is this class he certainly interferes and 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:08.880
 leave only 28 fps hoped 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.820
 that he will no longer leave him then how 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:18.240
 times while the enemies are distracted by our 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:22.230
 ally I put at home but class again 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.070
 still can not calm down too 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:29.190
 he wants revenge on me 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.260
 but since the rate of fire is more correct 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.490
 Accuracy rate I really 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.980
 good i can just shoot you can 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:44.400
 say at a discount and with a big 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:48.990
 probability of hitting here they punch 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.680
 kvass tower he still turned on mode 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.720
 terminator now I have a few more times 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.310
 I won't break it 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.690
 now the enemies have warmed with me and 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:03.410
 certainly go to them but no sense 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:07.040
 here is what i am doing 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:11.560
 from good vertical angles to 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:15.139
 help these you can do things like that 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.250
 you can just shoot the enemies 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.000
 with impunity 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:30.259
 they just don’t know 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:35.080
 know where to go but that’s what 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:37.849
 it's over friends throws me 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.610
 humen but look what time it is 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:44.300
 this is not passed, I just got here that 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.430
 there is something I was moving and now I got up 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.060
 place because of this i still have 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:54.770
 take aim but luckily this fight 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:58.430
 ended in victory because our Sherman 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:02.289
 Jumbo will go now to finish off all who 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:05.060
 left there use this position 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:10.699
 try maybe you will like it like 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:13.159
 me and see you at this all will be more 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:17.500
 new positions that i will necessarily 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:21.430
 find and tell you about them 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.430
 successful fights and bye
