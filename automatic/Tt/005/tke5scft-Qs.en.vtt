00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
I know it's kind of long and it might

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.460 
I know it's kind of long and it might
sound<00:02:53.180> confusing<00:02:53.330> but<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:53.840> promise<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.290> if<00:02:54.410> you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
just write it out and just keep

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.230 
just write it out and just keep
practicing<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.540> will<00:02:56.750> not<00:02:57.080> be<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.380> bad<00:02:58.240> okay

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
practicing it will not be that bad okay

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.180 
practicing it will not be that bad okay
and<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.930> know<00:03:00.050> what<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.410> did<00:03:00.710> not<00:03:00.920> write<00:03:01.130> down

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
and you know what I did not write down

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.950 
and you know what I did not write down
the<00:03:01.370> stuff<00:03:01.670> for<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:01.970> bridge<00:03:02.210> for<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:02.720> song

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
the stuff for the bridge for this song

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.480 
the stuff for the bridge for this song
because<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.560> guess<00:03:03.740> when<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:03.920> learned<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.280> I

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
because I guess when I learned it I

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.770 
because I guess when I learned it I
didn't<00:03:05.150> learn<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.390> bridge<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.810> kind<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.260> get<00:03:06.470> I

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
didn't learn the bridge I kind of get I

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.150 
didn't learn the bridge I kind of get I
don't<00:03:08.780> know<00:03:08.870> impatient<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.830> don't<00:03:10.010> really

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
don't know impatient I don't really

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.570

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
we're just going to do the first in the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.770 
we're just going to do the first in the
course<00:03:22.030> okay<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:23.120> for<00:03:23.420> your<00:03:23.540> strumming

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
course okay so for your strumming

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.360 
course okay so for your strumming
pattern<00:03:24.200> it's<00:03:24.380> just<00:03:24.560> one<00:03:24.740> Shiming<00:03:25.100> pattern

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
pattern it's just one Shiming pattern

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.800 
pattern it's just one Shiming pattern
but<00:03:25.550> it<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.180> one<00:03:26.360> that's<00:03:26.570> kind<00:03:26.720> of

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
but it is the one that's kind of

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.480 
but it is the one that's kind of
difficult<00:03:27.020> that<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.410> use<00:03:27.680> in<00:03:27.830> almost<00:03:27.980> every

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
difficult that I use in almost every

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.440 
difficult that I use in almost every
video<00:03:29.230> not<00:03:30.230> really<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:30.650> kind<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:32.090> you're

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
video not really but kind of so you're

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.860 
video not really but kind of so you're
showing<00:03:32.690> pattern<00:03:32.960> is<00:03:33.140> down<00:03:34.070> down<00:03:34.520> down<00:03:35.060> down

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
showing pattern is down down down down

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.620 
showing pattern is down down down down
up<00:03:35.900> up<00:03:36.500> up<00:03:37.220> down<00:03:37.670> down<00:03:38.270> up<00:03:38.330> down<00:03:38.840> up<00:03:40.180> okay<00:03:41.180> but

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
up up up down down up down up okay but

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.850 
up up up down down up down up okay but
anyway<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:42.080> is<00:03:42.110> your<00:03:42.320> strumming<00:03:42.590> pattern

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
anyway that is your strumming pattern

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
anyway that is your strumming pattern
down<00:03:43.670> down<00:03:44.120> down<00:03:44.630> down<00:03:45.020> up<00:03:45.260> up<00:03:45.710> up<00:03:46.250> down<00:03:46.520> down
