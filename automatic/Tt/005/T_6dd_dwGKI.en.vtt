00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.030
 the fast wireless 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.469
 today I will show you their 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.599
 birthday cake recipe at 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.730
 when williams and barbie then for 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.100
 the recipe we will need 125 g of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:27.090
 nutella 125 g sugar 125 g flour 1 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:31.349
 sachet of baking powder 3rd 25 g of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.390
 butter and a pinch of salt then one 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.450
 start by putting the eggs in the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.739
 salad bowl we add sugar and we go 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:50.190
 whip it all up for about 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:57.140
 three minutes thoroughly but the salt the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.140
 melted butter and in focus 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.170
 now we will be able to put so the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.760
 Nutella 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.610
 so I advise you to spend fifteen 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.140
 seconds in the microwave to make it 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.620
 a little more liquid then we put the 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.620
 totality 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:33.520
 and I continue to whip not present 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.220
 we forget the robot and we will go so 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.829
 basically emmanuel so here I put a 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.360
 little bit of flour 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:47.679
 So I add the baking powder 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.950
 so there we have a packet flow I put back 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.079
 on top of all the flour and 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.270
 with the game whisk incorporate it with ink 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:02:02.259
 delicately then I go underneath 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.709
 and I raise I put that aside for 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.560
 Nothing 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:08.319
 here I took so a small mold to 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.580
 sponge to and I have little would then have the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.840
 bottom then I get a sheet of 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.069
 aluminum foil so I'm returning my mold 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.610
 and I will try to make him a 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.610
 footprint 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:32.170
 there I cut the outline so 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:35.170
 recover that they have then I place 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.700
 the aluminum foil so on the bottom of the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.410
 mold 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.989
 all this will help me to have a very 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.880
 beautiful release I support comes as he 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.340
 must then the key mold were so 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.980
 true so the sheet of aluminum paper 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.049
 she sticks she stays stuck and 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.160
 now I'm rumors over 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.840
 so that you do this operation I 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.280
 advise you to take soft butter 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.730
 and not melted butter 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.420
 then I put a tablespoon of 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.560
 flour and I answer them mostly 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.329
 inside the mold hours then 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.220
 do not hesitate to put him a little 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.549
 spanked from time to time to remove 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.950
 so there on more flour 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.100
 so now I'm filling up my 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.100
 mold 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.100
 the size of the mold it is between 18 and 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.090
 20 cm so the gym yvon fouras preheated 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.220
 at 170 Â° and we go leather to the east between 20 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.190
 and 25 minutes huh so always at 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.560
 watch then to make the cream 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.510
 who's going to go in the cake so he goes 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.410
 we need about 100 g of 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.710
 mascarpone 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.710
 we have here a mixture of sweets 40 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.200
 centilitres of whole liquid cream a 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.060
 range is pure sugar and all we go 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.900
 come and use sweetened condensed milk 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:03.550
 so about 4 tablespoons to a 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.800
 salad bowl I get the 100 g of 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.780
 mascarpone 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.990
 so I put that inside I'm going 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.990
 come here sweetened with my condensed milk 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:24.790
 and then I pour my two so 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:26.470
 of liquid cream and now we're going 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.820
 whip everything until the cream 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:35.740
 thicken a game but all this in a 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.860
 fluted sleeve pocket now I 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.260
 I'll put my pocket in the fridge 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.290
 then my sponge cake and 8 we have mussels 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.970
 so she is well chilled and here we go 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.210
 although aluminum has stayed at 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.010
 background 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:54.040
 9 the mold is perfect then 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:57.640
 I take a knife and I 'm going to cut 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:01.350
 so in three months i start with 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.350
 remove this first part 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.589
 now I'm showing you so 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:17.989
 inside the sponge cake is perfect 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:20.689
 so I put that aside and continue 

00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:24.319
 so I cut while turning so the 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:27.409
 cake then we will start editing 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:30.769
 of the cake so downstairs so I put the 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.169
 cake base then here I cut - 

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:36.259
 orange in two and there I am coming so 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:40.879
 press it on the biscuit for the aisne 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:44.899
 empty and then I recover so my 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:49.999
 pocket and I will come so put the 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:52.069
 cream on this first disc so that's 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:54.619
 no matter if it goes over because everything to 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:59.389
 time we will smooth the outline so that 

00:05:54.619 --> 00:06:01.579
 will rather arrange us then we come 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.169
 put in various candies so there 

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:06.979
 I took small chocolates that I 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:14.110
 cut off so we 2 then animated some 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:14.110
 tagada strawberries see will put maltese 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:19.449
 rdm helens 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:30.619
 then I put over the second 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:37.279
 disc I'm going to press lightly and 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:42.619
 come with - orange the bib and we 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:44.119
 so continue with our good good you 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:49.579
 have understood the principle it's hyper 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:51.139
 easy so here I 'm going to put the 

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:54.409
 field and genie discs from above so 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.569
 the whipped cream and now I'm going 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:59.839
 try to decorate the most beautifully 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:02.349
 possible then all the time in 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:04.639
 alternating colors 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.559
 so here I just finished so the 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.909
 cake assembly so finally I 

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:11.509
 find it's not too bad like that 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:13.699
 so I'm not going to smooth the edges I do not 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.920
 could not go to tasting because 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:17.050
