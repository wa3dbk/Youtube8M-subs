00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.069 
which can really come in handy for them
not<00:01:38.850> only<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.090> since<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> does<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:40.049> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
not only that since it does have a

it can dodge like bottomless trap hole
and<00:01:44.100> stuff<00:01:44.280> too<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.880> actually<00:01:44.970> be

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and stuff too so that can actually be

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.330

out<00:01:57.950> also<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.100> course<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.430> card<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.880> work

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
out also of course this card can work

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.969

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
cards and of course Thunder seahorse

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.230 
cards and of course Thunder seahorse
would<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.070> another<00:02:05.250> great<00:02:05.460> card<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.000> too

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
would be another great card for this too

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.749 
would be another great card for this too
and<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:07.770> really<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> whole<00:02:08.369> lot<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.640> talk<00:02:08.700> about

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and not really a whole lot to talk about

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.550 
and not really a whole lot to talk about
on<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.119> card<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.629> honestly<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:10.319> it's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
on this card but honestly I think it's

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.980 
on this card but honestly I think it's
going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> help<00:02:10.860> out<00:02:11.009> battery<00:02:11.340> min<00:02:11.489> up

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
going to help out battery min up

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.450 
going to help out battery min up
good<00:02:12.230> amount<00:02:12.410> it's<00:02:12.740> not<00:02:12.920> gonna<00:02:13.070> be<00:02:13.220> something

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
good amount it's not gonna be something

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.440 
good amount it's not gonna be something
I<00:02:13.520> don't<00:02:13.670> think<00:02:13.820> we'll<00:02:13.940> put<00:02:14.090> him<00:02:14.150> over<00:02:14.270> the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
I don't think we'll put him over the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.020 
I don't think we'll put him over the
edge<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:15.050> mean<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:16.070> don't<00:02:16.610> know<00:02:16.700> I'm<00:02:16.880> trying

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
edge I mean that I don't know I'm trying

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.220 
edge I mean that I don't know I'm trying
to<00:02:17.150> think<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.420> what<00:02:17.540> i<00:02:17.600> would<00:02:17.810> write<00:02:17.960> them<00:02:18.140> as

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
to think of what i would write them as

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.440 
to think of what i would write them as
like<00:02:18.410> maybe<00:02:18.620> tier<00:02:18.980> 2<00:02:19.340> after<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:19.880> card<00:02:20.210> maybe

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
like maybe tier 2 after this card maybe

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.430 
like maybe tier 2 after this card maybe
they<00:02:20.600> could<00:02:20.750> hit<00:02:20.840> something<00:02:21.050> like<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.260> I

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
they could hit something like that I

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.650 
they could hit something like that I
really<00:02:21.830> hope<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.490> mean<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.670> don't<00:02:22.940> they<00:02:23.480> don't

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
really hope so I mean I don't they don't

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.880 
really hope so I mean I don't they don't
feel<00:02:23.870> like<00:02:23.900> they're<00:02:24.110> tier<00:02:24.320> one<00:02:24.530> yet<00:02:24.770> or

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
feel like they're tier one yet or

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.920 
feel like they're tier one yet or
anything<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.370> course<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.570> hoping<00:02:26.870> that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
anything of course but I'm hoping that

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.840 
anything of course but I'm hoping that
maybe<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.830> know<00:02:27.860> maybe<00:02:28.250> even<00:02:28.580> there<00:02:28.700> will<00:02:28.790> be

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
maybe you know maybe even there will be

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.790 
maybe you know maybe even there will be
another<00:02:29.090> card<00:02:29.360> after<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.720> or<00:02:30.110> something<00:02:30.530> to
