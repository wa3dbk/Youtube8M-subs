00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.529
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.410
 a new video at chips and today 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.990
 I have the meditec smid in for 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.429
 games I linked the link from the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.039
 page again below in the video 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.840
 description so look over and then 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.699
 also the link from facebook because the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.369
 can make really cool video 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.810
 win the rio fans you can 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.480
 you like to stop by 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.689
 and yes I would say we open the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.480
 tin box just like magix says 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.430
 meeting in each can 22 cards plus 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.760
 an exclusive limited edition 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.540
 really cool and then open that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.649
 Whats excited about what kind of a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 limited edition 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.030
 there will definitely be in there or 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.030
 in it I have to still get on 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:08.939
 so and then I'll close you completely 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 briefly on the on charging cable to the will 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:17.759
 I just forgot my camera right now 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.280
 unfortunately a bit here is so and indeed 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.580
 Here the Teambox in any case, however, 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.000
 Nice design as I think 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:33.630
 look at it as normal as that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.950
 from the inside because they are already the same 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 limited edition and fast 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.530
 of course you can leave here as well 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.920
 in his double or other card 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.920
 receive 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.510
 then let's see where the power cards are 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.380
 are 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.130
 I believe that you can power here 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.320
 cards are exactly the ones we turn 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.320
 Just around then we have here 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:22.540
 sad kevin de bruyne proceed benji 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:31.930
 kowski jantschke is a cage wallander 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:36.860
 Healing from mali saglik star player julia 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:42.670
 ziegler roadmaps then the mainz arena 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:47.000
 home advantage sala kuske and no matter which 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:51.550
 these are our pace cards and then 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.900
 Let's go over to the permanence maps 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.130
 that's how you see matchwinner like that 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.739
 first, of course, the limited edition 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.470
 and from who of my stefan bell 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.470
 the already with this edition 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.720
 shown and then I look quickly 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:15.470
 so then we have fortuna once 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:22.250
 dÃ¼sseldorf the club logo and Schalke 04 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:25.430
 as a club so our last farmer card 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.280
 is roberto firmino matchwinner 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.739
 that's exactly what's in the teambox 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.110
 do the case really well and 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.440
 yes, if I still have the big box 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.380
 just let me know 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.580
 and yes as I said the tin box you can find 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.440
 again at gay games 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.910
 I would say I have me and says 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.110
 see you next time 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.110
 at chelsea
