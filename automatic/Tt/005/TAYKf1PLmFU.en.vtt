00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:15.889
 good milan next hand then at 130000 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.440
 like to have 18 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.830
 that certainly will not be found 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.019
 will not exaggerate so wia of 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.509
 also with 18 3 bet or except 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.820
 would certainly be back then too 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.990
 just want peace and bring home the 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.200
 but that he will give mail to the option too 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.149
 push and that's why the 3 I can 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.230
 I also imagine well 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.899
 but I think for the bottom of 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.460
 spain family now after the deal 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.399
 maybe even sooner than before 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.980
 that he is the smallest so 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.320
 lowest hand of those is from the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.449
 He will then check the walls 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.829
 as has already some 3 pets get 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.320
 and had cleaned himself and also 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.300
 So he does not have to 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.420
 absolutely no hand anywhere 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.680
 Give up because he is on 4-bet torture as well as on 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.630
 the four will also be emotional 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.689
 for even now comes the plaster 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.990
 or is he not from milan 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.990
 I say no 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.110
 and also to the merkur but we hold 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.700
 I do not believe you even for yourself 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.090
 wrong but that will happen now 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.800
 for on 19 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.480
 katz positions also happy 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.910
 The question is how much 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.220
 stronger left 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.979
 still ready 570,000 and if he still 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:44.190
 always the 1.6 million 1.4 million 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.430
 So now it had 14 million 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.520
 but hand it now I believe then 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.450
 will be end to end 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.820
 probably finally comes to me 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.979
 do not imagine him on the board 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.710
 check but he found he was giving up 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.210
 so the hand is over so I believe 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.270
 that he is not alone if he does 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.430
 the flop track that he definitely did not 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.080
 after the bet of milan , because it is 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.420
 is a pretty dry rainbow board 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.530
 And many ladies are still in it 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.910
 green drag queen kings quintet screen 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.920
 maybe that is rather unlike 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.340
 which teaches me all that or through it 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.380
 us differently he accesses the chips which 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.459
 History is told, I believe 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.709
 Now we believe the hand of 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.660
 days because now I'm curious how 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:44.310
 jan wants to continue playing so rather 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:47.700
 call went with debutant otto wacker 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.010
 schott and then me will be the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.220
 agni foal it is an import he has 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:58.830
 still 2 468 as exactly has 1 million left 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.030
 behind it and 800 800 1800 but now 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.070
 it must be over 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.870
 yes, he has to be tight again 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.360
 bring and will be there with the plane 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.380
 submit 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.350
 and I can not imagine that 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.810
 he would now hand whatever 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.769
 because milan can do it by six 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.370
 turn what a grid he gives him 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.370
 a 5 7 but many more with it 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.829
 the tenant has written again 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.650
 Thou shalt keep the fingers of this time 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.970
 to let go 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.400
 bowling is for a round hour 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.750
 I think it's okay 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.930
 a beautiful polin now in the mens 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.640
 age group 200 Czech crowns 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.220
 2200 euro to then I'm not there 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.900
 bohlen as monthly krohn eight euros 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.609
 you can afford that, too 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:52.209
 if you ever with converter roulette 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:55.120
 Chatroulette went very well for the way for 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.599
 the bank or 5 on the 7 comes on the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.099
 globe 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.099
 optional should be germany 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.739
 what is jan doing now? 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.519
 I spent the whole evening at last 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.840
 accustomed to quick fouls but what I know 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.580
 not what to think about what to look for now 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.800
 now here how to get it later 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.020
 can benefit from the milan has it too 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:35.139
 not play fast and there is 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.050
 At this point I call my rather call 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:43.539
 deep 3-bet shape flop on the flop track 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.280
 Holter and he could jan heitmann 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.930
 court but which hand ends so 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.240
 I certainly none of the concerned 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.810
 could flow now as a book he lays 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.160
 not accepted 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.870
 Chooses tries on men or something 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.080
 see the only ones but the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.620
 Answer and hard on plays is good 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:11.470
 if he is a pretty checked 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:13.270
 but we and the charter look at it 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.770
 finish the tournament and jan heitmann 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:21.490
 Three giants say it is today 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.020
 yes absolutely percent export but we now 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.060
 to end differently here with jan 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.260
 heitmann from was my forecast is 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.150
 yes the herds globe pass it by 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.419
 So what a wash said yes 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.139
 that told me that's about it now 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.229
 also decide 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:41.260
 never in life are why that has it 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.810
 nobody calculated that is the exact one 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:48.419
 humming congratulations to the two 6 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:52.479
 after biels 76,000 for our milan 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.490
 boksic from austria and claudia 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.930
 just over 90,000 for our winner 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.479
 gecko 46 from the second season of 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.880
 jan heitmann yes congratulations 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.070
 and who is still interviewing her 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.990
 have seen at the facial expression there 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.699
 you are used to success 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.050
 he is just a little bit worth it 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.259
 he wins the thing 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.900
 you have to run here, that's one 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.879
 it is the trouble that congratulates us 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.479
 today against sascha sirtl the car 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:24.639
 the flop of the full house just before 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.960
 against the roof because it makes it Treated 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.699
 like the seven and just over 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.979
 then war again for his trips 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.110
 and finally in the last one 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.690
 he makes a decisive hand 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.210
 funny you have to say a call digging 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.409
 where you also incomprehensible was me 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.629
 think we can all agree 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:44.139
 somehow that was deep 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:46.150
 embedded in the hand and milan has it 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.580
 Super clean gets 85 percent employment 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.129
 so novak has been for 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.469
 jan but it was the hand of the tournament 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.550
 and it was the last one so congratulations 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:57.759
 to jan r 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.530
 Although were tournament meant to be, I hope 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.139
 We will also interview winner with you 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.729
 down the jan that ask the flat hand 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.530
 can he know it 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.319
 we pick you will not promise anything 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:12.210
