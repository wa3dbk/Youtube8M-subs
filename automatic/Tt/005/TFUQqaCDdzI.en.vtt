00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
conclusion was much like the Erik

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.069 
conclusion was much like the Erik
Morales<00:02:58.829> versus<00:02:59.250> Barrera<00:02:59.879> trilogy<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.750> and

Morales versus Barrera trilogy and and
much<00:03:01.739> like<00:03:01.769> how<00:03:02.189> Bob<00:03:02.430> Arum<00:03:02.730> thinks<00:03:03.090> he<00:03:03.239> wants

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
much like how Bob Arum thinks he wants

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.199 
much like how Bob Arum thinks he wants
he<00:03:03.780> likes<00:03:03.989> trilogies<00:03:04.669> he's<00:03:05.669> running<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.180> a

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
he likes trilogies he's running out a

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.000 
he likes trilogies he's running out a
welter<00:03:06.569> weight<00:03:06.599> fight<00:03:06.750> he<00:03:07.290> needs<00:03:07.469> to<00:03:07.650> keep

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
welter weight fight he needs to keep

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.949

having<00:03:08.430> rematches<00:03:08.969> that<00:03:09.120> are<00:03:09.209> marketable<00:03:09.659> and

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
having rematches that are marketable and

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.860 
having rematches that are marketable and
and<00:03:10.919> I<00:03:11.519> think<00:03:11.790> he<00:03:11.909> wants<00:03:12.209> us<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.449> go<00:03:12.569> on<00:03:12.689> to<00:03:12.840> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
and I think he wants us to go on to a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.949 
and I think he wants us to go on to a
trilogy<00:03:13.290> because<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:15.180> know<00:03:15.299> last<00:03:15.569> fight<00:03:15.780> was

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
trilogy because you know last fight was

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.860 
trilogy because you know last fight was
a<00:03:16.019> clinical<00:03:16.530> robbery<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:18.299> because<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.750> that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
a clinical robbery and because of that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.559 
a clinical robbery and because of that
out<00:03:19.169> because<00:03:19.919> of<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.340> backlash<00:03:20.879> because<00:03:21.209> of

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
out because of that backlash because of

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.610 
out because of that backlash because of
the<00:03:22.109> judges<00:03:22.530> who<00:03:22.680> scored<00:03:23.340> for<00:03:23.639> Manny<00:03:23.849> Pacquiao

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
the judges who scored for Manny Pacquiao

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.189 
the judges who scored for Manny Pacquiao
in<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.919> days<00:03:26.129> after<00:03:26.159> the<00:03:26.790> fight<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.269> think

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
in the days after the fight I think

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.939 
in the days after the fight I think
there<00:03:28.409> is<00:03:28.439> a<00:03:28.650> sympathy<00:03:29.430> towards<00:03:30.419> him<00:03:30.709> vs<00:03:31.709> tim

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
there is a sympathy towards him vs tim

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.099 
there is a sympathy towards him vs tim
bradley<00:03:32.250> i<00:03:32.430> think<00:03:32.699> a<00:03:32.909> lot<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.449> people<00:03:33.540> think<00:03:33.959> he

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
bradley i think a lot of people think he

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.589 
bradley i think a lot of people think he
deserved<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> first<00:03:34.889> fight<00:03:35.189> and<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.209> my

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
deserved the first fight and in that my

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.349 
deserved the first fight and in that my
cloud<00:03:37.159> judges<00:03:38.569> judgment<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:40.669> perhaps<00:03:41.669> browns

cloud judges judgment and perhaps browns

that<00:03:42.659> are<00:03:42.750> clearly<00:03:43.019> one<00:03:43.290> for<00:03:43.470> Bradley<00:03:43.919> or<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
that are clearly one for Bradley or the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.729 
that are clearly one for Bradley or the
close<00:03:45.299> rounds<00:03:45.689> all<00:03:45.870> be<00:03:46.139> given<00:03:46.439> to<00:03:46.530> Manny

close rounds all be given to Manny
Pacquiao<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.509> true<00:03:48.750> worry<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.590> that

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
Pacquiao that is the true worry and that

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.759 
Pacquiao that is the true worry and that
is<00:03:49.919> why<00:03:50.269> we<00:03:51.269> thought<00:03:51.540> maybe<00:03:52.290> you'll<00:03:52.590> be<00:03:52.739> a

over<00:03:59.909> rooslin<00:04:00.329> name<00:04:01.109> Pacquiao<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.919> Marquez

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
over rooslin name Pacquiao and Marquez

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.610 
over rooslin name Pacquiao and Marquez
like<00:04:03.030> that's<00:04:03.269> very<00:04:03.629> impressive<00:04:04.370> however<00:04:06.620> to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
like that's very impressive however to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.610 
like that's very impressive however to
Bradley's<00:04:08.189> being<00:04:08.459> Tim<00:04:08.729> Bradley<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.389> I<00:04:10.289> think

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
Bradley's being Tim Bradley and I think

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.979 
Bradley's being Tim Bradley and I think
he<00:04:11.579> will<00:04:11.909> not<00:04:12.090> be<00:04:12.120> able<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.599> turn<00:04:12.810> down<00:04:12.840> a

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
he will not be able to turn down a

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.249 
he will not be able to turn down a
rematch<00:04:13.379> in<00:04:13.680> Las<00:04:13.889> Vegas<00:04:14.180> which<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.259> probably

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
rematch in Las Vegas which is probably

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.589 
rematch in Las Vegas which is probably
what's<00:04:16.650> going<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.859> be<00:04:16.949> offered<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.370> them<00:04:17.669> so

what's going to be offered to them so

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.409 
what's going to be offered to them so
this<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:18.870> an<00:04:19.109> excellent<00:04:19.409> fight<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.239> can't<00:04:21.239> wait

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
this is an excellent fight I can't wait

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.620 
this is an excellent fight I can't wait
for<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.840> get<00:04:21.989> made<00:04:22.289> um<00:04:22.820> I'm<00:04:23.820> still<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.570> still

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
for it to get made um I'm still I still

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
for it to get made um I'm still I still
think<00:04:25.020> my<00:04:25.110> boy<00:04:25.320> Tim<00:04:25.590> Bradley<00:04:25.889> will<00:04:26.190> take<00:04:26.370> the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
think my boy Tim Bradley will take the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.560 
think my boy Tim Bradley will take the
shut<00:04:26.770> down<00:04:26.949> much<00:04:27.400> like<00:04:27.699> I<00:04:27.850> predicted<00:04:28.180> him<00:04:28.479> to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
shut down much like I predicted him to

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.540 
shut down much like I predicted him to
do<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.900> first<00:04:29.110> time<00:04:29.290> I<00:04:29.710> think<00:04:30.310> he<00:04:30.430> would

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
do it the first time I think he would

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.340 
do it the first time I think he would
even<00:04:30.610> be<00:04:30.970> two<00:04:31.090> more<00:04:31.270> convincing<00:04:31.870> at<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.110> time

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
even be two more convincing at this time

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.610 
even be two more convincing at this time
however<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:34.300> only<00:04:34.330> concern<00:04:34.870> is<00:04:34.900> those<00:04:35.229> three

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
however the only concern is those three

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.570 
however the only concern is those three
judges<00:04:36.389> much<00:04:37.389> like<00:04:37.750> they<00:04:38.710> were<00:04:38.770> in<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.340> first

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
judges much like they were in the first

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.439 
judges much like they were in the first
fight<00:04:39.940> but<00:04:40.900> remember<00:04:41.139> Morales<00:04:41.800> Barrera<00:04:42.449> that

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
fight but remember Morales Barrera that

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.890 
fight but remember Morales Barrera that
also<00:04:44.320> was<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.800> very<00:04:45.070> controversial<00:04:45.669> fight<00:04:46.090> that

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
also was a very controversial fight that

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.020 
also was a very controversial fight that
Bob<00:04:47.199> Arum<00:04:47.500> could<00:04:47.770> not<00:04:47.979> even<00:04:48.400> finish<00:04:48.850> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
Bob Arum could not even finish the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.990 
Bob Arum could not even finish the
trilogy<00:04:49.660> but<00:04:49.810> he<00:04:50.050> but<00:04:50.710> he<00:04:50.860> made<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.100> 1-1<00:04:51.669> for<00:04:51.970> a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
trilogy but he but he made it 1-1 for a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.420 
trilogy but he but he made it 1-1 for a
reason<00:04:52.449> so<00:04:52.600> he<00:04:52.720> can<00:04:52.900> do<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.229> third<00:04:53.440> fight<00:04:53.770> but

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
reason so he can do the third fight but

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.629 
reason so he can do the third fight but
then<00:04:54.550> he<00:04:54.639> lost<00:04:54.880> both<00:04:55.120> fighters<00:04:55.509> to<00:04:55.780> Golden<00:04:56.169> Boy

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
then he lost both fighters to Golden Boy

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.980 
then he lost both fighters to Golden Boy
remember<00:04:57.639> that<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.300> think<00:04:58.419> that's<00:04:58.780> what's

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
remember that so I think that's what's

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.060 
remember that so I think that's what's
going<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.169> happen<00:04:59.590> here<00:04:59.620> and<00:05:00.070> that<00:05:00.970> is<00:05:01.180> why<00:05:01.510> I

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
going to happen here and that is why I

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.890 
going to happen here and that is why I
hope<00:05:03.070> they<00:05:03.280> have<00:05:03.430> fair<00:05:03.729> judges<00:05:04.180> in<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.690> fight

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
hope they have fair judges in the fight

hope they have fair judges in the fight
