instructions<00:03:15.560> stuff<00:03:16.560> like<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:18.680> all<00:03:19.680> right

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
instructions stuff like that all right

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.710 
instructions stuff like that all right
well<00:03:20.630> here's<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.720> case<00:03:22.970> first<00:03:23.970> impressions<00:03:24.270> I

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
well here's the case first impressions I

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.400 
well here's the case first impressions I
actually<00:03:25.380> really<00:03:25.950> like<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.160> nice<00:03:26.760> leather

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
actually really like this nice leather

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.699 
actually really like this nice leather
really<00:03:28.410> nice<00:03:28.560> chrome<00:03:28.950> accents<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.500> it's<00:03:31.500> not

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
really nice chrome accents and it's not

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.580 
really nice chrome accents and it's not
magnetic<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.850> just<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.660> guess<00:03:34.200> kind<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
magnetic it's just I guess kind of the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.860 
magnetic it's just I guess kind of the
weight<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.190> metal<00:03:35.450> kind<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.510> brings<00:03:36.750> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
weight of that metal kind of brings it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.160 
weight of that metal kind of brings it
down<00:03:37.459> so<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.580> have<00:03:38.670> known<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:38.910> no<00:03:39.360> magnet<00:03:40.020> or

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
down so you have known that no magnet or

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.320 
down so you have known that no magnet or
anything<00:03:40.380> like<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.820> it's<00:03:41.820> got<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.060> nice

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
anything like that it's got this nice

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.229 
anything like that it's got this nice
pattern<00:03:43.080> really<00:03:43.770> soft<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.760> probably

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
pattern really soft so that probably

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.930 
pattern really soft so that probably
protects<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.489> overall<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.610> looks<00:03:47.670> like

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
protects it and overall it looks like

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.120 
protects it and overall it looks like
looks<00:03:48.480> like<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> nice<00:03:48.930> case<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.410> i<00:03:49.620> could<00:03:49.950> go

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
looks like a nice case so i could go

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.729 
looks like a nice case so i could go
ahead<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.370> put<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.390> ipod<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.870> see<00:03:52.590> how<00:03:52.650> it
