spool since your bait hits the water it

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.090 
spool since your bait hits the water it
stops<00:00:37.860> letting<00:00:38.220> off<00:00:38.340> line<00:00:38.780> in<00:00:39.780> Castro's<00:00:40.320> past

and letting your gate hit the water line

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.990 
and letting your gate hit the water line
keeps<00:00:44.010> pulling<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.840> end<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.200> getting

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
keeps pulling up so you end up getting

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.190 
keeps pulling up so you end up getting
situation<00:00:48.000> where<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.420> you're<00:00:48.540> not<00:00:48.570> coming<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
little bit of pressure as you're casting

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.150 
little bit of pressure as you're casting

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that keeps the line from shooting back

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.270 
that keeps the line from shooting back
up<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:01.140> rest<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.500> usually<00:01:01.650> called<00:01:02.070> the

just<00:01:07.650> shoots<00:01:07.860> right<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.189> out<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> spool

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
just shoots right up out of the spool

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.980 
just shoots right up out of the spool
and<00:01:08.700> makes<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.210> look<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> bird

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
line on the school so what ends up

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.510 
line on the school so what ends up
happening<00:01:34.729> now<00:01:37.899> when<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:38.929> pass<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.990> line<00:01:42.170> stops

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
happening now when I pass the line stops

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.590 
happening now when I pass the line stops
I'll<00:01:43.520> show<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:43.909> piece<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.179> haja<00:01:44.329> tape

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
I'll show you the piece of haja tape

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.109 
I'll show you the piece of haja tape
right<00:01:44.810> now<00:01:45.399> I'm<00:01:46.399> not<00:01:46.609> sure<00:01:46.759> if<00:01:46.819> you'll<00:01:46.939> be<00:01:46.969> able

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
right now I'm not sure if you'll be able

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.249 
right now I'm not sure if you'll be able
to<00:01:47.270> see<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:47.390> on<00:01:47.479> camera<00:01:47.659> but<00:01:47.929> it's<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.079> black

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
to see it on camera but it's a black

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.630 
to see it on camera but it's a black
piece<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.530> hockey<00:01:48.770> tape<00:01:49.069> there's<00:01:49.280> what<00:01:49.490> I

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
piece of hockey tape there's what I

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.809 
piece of hockey tape there's what I
think<00:01:49.849> again<00:01:50.119> it<00:01:50.599> does<00:01:50.899> not<00:01:51.140> let<00:01:51.429> out<00:01:52.429> so<00:01:52.700> if

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
think again it does not let out so if

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.029 
think again it does not let out so if
you're<00:01:52.969> learning<00:01:53.619> all<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.799> need<00:01:54.950> to

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
you're learning all you need to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.589 
you're learning all you need to
basically<00:01:55.159> do<00:01:55.579> is<00:01:55.789> that<00:01:56.000> somebody's<00:01:56.359> passed

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
basically do is that somebody's passed

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.380 
basically do is that somebody's passed
out<00:01:56.840> for<00:01:57.049> you<00:01:57.170> maybe<00:01:57.520> 30<00:01:58.520> 40<00:01:58.939> yards<00:01:59.030> of<00:01:59.270> line

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
out for you maybe 30 40 yards of line

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.729 
out for you maybe 30 40 yards of line
and<00:02:00.200> every<00:02:00.770> pass<00:02:01.039> that<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:01.429> make<00:02:01.879> I<00:02:02.560> don't<00:02:03.560> have

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
and every pass that I make I don't have

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.740 
and every pass that I make I don't have
to<00:02:03.890> come<00:02:04.099> I'm<00:02:04.429> not<00:02:04.579> coming<00:02:04.969> it<00:02:05.090> but<00:02:05.329> no<00:02:05.539> more

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
to come I'm not coming it but no more

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.240
