 [Music] 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.320
 types of implants mainly 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.000
 we have two I think you all know more 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.389
 or less the difference between round 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.510
 anatomical round is a semicircle 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.760
 has the gel distributed equally in polo 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.970
 higher than in the lower the implant 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.730
 anatomical by teardrop shape or that of 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.430
 pear shape this is the anatomical one has 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.110
 way more like the natural breast 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.300
 every plastic surgeon must master 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.859
 both the different surgical techniques 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.539
 that now I will explain it to you as the 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.609
 different implants the breast implant 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.309
 our anatomy depends on your 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.649
 characteristics of muscle skin 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.300
 your chest wall depends on 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.979
 your preferences because if I put 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.839
 a round implant and you tell me by god 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.120
 that I do not notice the neckline 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.769
 because the anatomical implant is badly indicated 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.539
 It looks very nice when it's good 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.089
 indicated when the skin is very strong 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.440
 but the problem is that it gives very 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.899
 little bit so superior girls 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.999
 sportsmen the girls that you work with 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.699
 the arms that you have a musculature 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.860
 very developed it nullifies me is the effect 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.430
 of the implant then you depend again 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 of the bra 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.590
 but to give a little neckline I the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.870
 80% the truth I say the implant 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.210
 round but because I leave it natural if 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.460
 you have a powerful muscle 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.010
 Very smooth skin that will nullify my 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.930
 form of an implant the upper pole me 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.630
 It will make it just as natural as the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.160
 anatomical implant we have three ways of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.940
 access to place a breast implant 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.070
 we can place it well by the areola 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.810
 the areola usually down below unless 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.680
 we want to raise the areola a little 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.509
 then we use the upper incision 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.460
 we can use the breast groove and 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.410
 we can use the armpit here 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.570
 there is a bit of controversy if it affects 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.920
 breastfeeding is not treated breastfeeding I 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.440
 I think breastfeeding if the surgeon 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.649
 works well takes good care of the fabric and makes 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.090
 clean planes is the same percentage 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.369
 using the three ways with respect to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.619
 implant tell you the trend is 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.070
 implant filled with a silicone gel 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.130
 with a tense and hard coverage that is what 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.489
 which makes the implant does not have 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.500
 leaks do not believe me do not break and a gel of 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.550
 silicone that the trend is that every 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.550
 time be more 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.860
 increasingly more and less mobile 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.480
 so that it makes fewer complications than 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.250
 one of them long-term complications 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.030
 term is the replay 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.030
