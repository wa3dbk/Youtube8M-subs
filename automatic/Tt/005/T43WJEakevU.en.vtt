00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.889
My name is Chrissy Twigg and I am the
managing director

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:08.989
at Healthier Weight.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.420
I started the company

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.880
in 2003 with Doctor David Ashton.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.390
I knew that the work we were doing

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.790
was important and I wasn't going to let
the idea go

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.949
There are lots of myths about obesity
surgery and probably the most

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.259
important of these myths is the idea
that

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.960
obesity surgeries are always dangerous

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.099
and that really is not

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.730
true. With modern laparoscopic techniques

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.560
with modern devices and especially with
modern

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.500
aesthetics, most bariactric procedures
now a days

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.460
are actually remarkably safe.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.070
One of the crucial factors in good outcomes from surgical intervention

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.519
as you might imagine, is the skill and the
experience of the surgeons.

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.720
I mean my medical staff are a dream team

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.860
you can't find better teams.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.600
We're very privileged

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.200
in the healthy weight organization to have one of the most distinguished bariatric

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.600
surgeons - Professor Franco Favretti.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.119
He worked with the inventor of

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.479
the gastric band - a man called Lubomyr Kuzmak

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.579
Favretti and Kuzmak worked together, and it was they and several others

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.810
who actually invented the band. I think
you can

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.560
in respect to weight loss surgery and particularly in

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.320
relation to type 2 diabetes I think you
are entitled to talk about cures

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.340
for example after gastric bypass

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.640
eighty-five percent of patients who are type 2 diabetics

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.620
will be cured.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.340
Well, can we guarantee weight loss?

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.549
yeah, we can guarantee weight loss if you
follow the rules

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.749
you lose weight.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.149
I was very nervous about the consultation and didn't know whether

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.659
really about the ins and outs of it and I was quite scared.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.380
before can see Doctor Ashton. Urm, coming
up to Manchester, I made my

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.380
husband drive around the block for an
hour 'cause I was so scared.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.160
Urm, which was really stupid 'cause after seeing Doctor Ashton, he was very friendly,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.940
supportive, gave me all the answers that I needed and has given me the positive

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.140
steps to get forward have the operation

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.450
I've lost eighty-four percent of my excess weight, I'm much more confident, I'm not as tired

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.030
I don't have aching knees and I absolutely
love shopping - for clothes!

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.140
We pay an enormous amount of
attention

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.860
to close monitoring, close support.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.140
The post-care support from Healthier Weight centre

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.980
is absolutely fantastic, there's always
someone on the phone 24 hours a day

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.800
and I've often phoned late at night and in
the morning and weekends for additional support

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.640
and there's always someone to answer any questions or queries.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.480
Because we know that

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.480
an open-door policy means a greater
likelihood of success

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.460
Approach the Healthier Weight centre and see Doctor Ashton, 'cause you won't regret it.
