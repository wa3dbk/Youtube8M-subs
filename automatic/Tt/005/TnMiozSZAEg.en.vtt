gameplay<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:24.810> much<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.470> guys<00:00:25.590> have

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
gameplay but as much as you guys have

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.320 
gameplay but as much as you guys have
probably<00:00:25.949> seen<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.640> various<00:00:27.060> channels

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
probably seen it on the various channels

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.000 
probably seen it on the various channels
I<00:00:27.660> think<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.260> appropriate<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.830> my

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.990 
games rather than just play them I have
to<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.590> more<00:00:52.920> than<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.190> strategies

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
to think about more than just strategies

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
to think about more than just strategies
on<00:00:54.180> how<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.690> win<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.140> particular<00:00:55.680> gun<00:00:55.860> fight

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.369 
on how I can win a particular gun fight
I<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> look<00:00:57.300> at<00:00:57.449> inconsistencies<00:00:58.140> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
I have to look at inconsistencies in

I have to look at inconsistencies in
Battlefield<00:00:59.100> 3's<00:00:59.280> map<00:00:59.460> design<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.090> there<00:01:00.270> are

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
Battlefield 3's map design and there are

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
Battlefield 3's map design and there are
certainly<00:01:00.690> inconsistencies<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.949> figure<00:01:02.670> out

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
certainly inconsistencies and figure out

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
certainly inconsistencies and figure out
exactly<00:01:03.180> why<00:01:03.480> those<00:01:03.719> inconsistencies<00:01:04.350> exist

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
exactly why those inconsistencies exist

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.609 
exactly why those inconsistencies exist
and<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.909> they're<00:01:06.119> purposeful<00:01:06.810> or<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.409> their

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and if they're purposeful or if their

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469 
and if they're purposeful or if their
errors<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.189> design<00:01:08.549> when<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> say

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
errors in design when I say

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.780 
errors in design when I say
inconsistency<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.560> talking<00:01:11.549> primarily

inconsistency I'm talking primarily
about<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.450> speed<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.020> gameplay<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:14.280> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
about the speed of gameplay when you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.730 
about the speed of gameplay when you
talk<00:01:14.580> about<00:01:14.610> maps<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.479> no<00:01:15.750> shark<00:01:16.049> canals<00:01:16.409> or

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
talk about maps like no shark canals or

card island TDM those are generally

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.490 
card island TDM those are generally
faster<00:01:19.700> quicker<00:01:20.700> killing<00:01:21.210> games<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.900> then

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
faster quicker killing games and then

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.800 
faster quicker killing games and then
compare<00:01:23.009> these<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.700> vehicle<00:01:24.630> heavy

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
compare these with vehicle heavy

compare these with vehicle heavy
conquest<00:01:25.409> maps<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.950> firestorm<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:26.909> Caspian

or strike at Karkand or Gulf of Oman in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.350 
or strike at Karkand or Gulf of Oman in
particular<00:01:30.750> these<00:01:31.500> maps<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.549> large<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
particular these maps are so large that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.020 
particular these maps are so large that
even<00:01:33.900> with<00:01:34.020> 64<00:01:34.470> players<00:01:34.909> battles<00:01:35.909> are

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
even with 64 players battles are

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
even with 64 players battles are
generally<00:01:36.360> few<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.689> far<00:01:36.750> between<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.530> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
generally few and far between and so

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.590 
generally few and far between and so
there's<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.610> downtime<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.299> lot<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
there's a lot of downtime a lot of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.179 
there's a lot of downtime a lot of
walking<00:01:40.049> around<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.380> doing<00:01:40.500> much<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
walking around not doing much of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.240 
walking around not doing much of
anything<00:01:41.340> even<00:01:42.240> TDM<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.229> big<00:01:43.439> maps<00:01:43.710> can

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
anything even TDM on the big maps can

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.940 
anything even TDM on the big maps can
become<00:01:44.790> boring<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.810> while<00:01:46.200> tedious<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:46.920> times

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
become boring and while tedious at times

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.490 
become boring and while tedious at times
so<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> question<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.899> answer<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
so the question I have to answer is

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.760 
so the question I have to answer is
quite<00:01:50.070> simple<00:01:50.159> why<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> answer

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
quite simple why and I think the answer

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
quite simple why and I think the answer
lies<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.399> two<00:01:53.970> main<00:01:54.270> factors<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.079> which<00:01:55.229> is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
lies in two main factors one of which is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.770 
lies in two main factors one of which is
obvious<00:01:56.219> because<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> topic<00:01:57.299> I'm<00:01:57.420> talking

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
obvious because of the topic I'm talking

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.350 
obvious because of the topic I'm talking
about<00:01:57.869> map<00:01:58.590> design<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> also<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
about map design but I also think it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.539 
about map design but I also think it
