00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.180
 but the boy is always with Khabarovsk very 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:15.769
 even turned out you need to go get 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:19.300
 pleasure but during the match the numbers here 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:24.009
 our opinion that after all we 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.890
 probably we were playing the game in appearance than 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:30.960
 Khabarovsk special first half principle 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.820
 was for us a lot of angular moments 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.230
 there is no realization of course the heat builds up 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:43.079
 second half somewhere a little bit and rival 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.360
 was more active than the first half 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.170
 especially the ending very well spent 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.899
 Overall, not that our victory is logical 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.660
 so match so I congratulate 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:03.149
 guys dedication and our Krasnoyarsk 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:08.190
 more than we absolutely agree with andrew 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.190
 If you evaluate the whole series then Yenisei b 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:16.000
 better than us objectively speaking in many 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.190
 components of the game that we have turned out 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.560
 such matches are very interesting I think that 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.840
 it is also very good 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.780
 Khabarovsk club this topic guys experience 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.069
 invaluable playoff play experience with such 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.640
 strong team is still here and 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:33.310
 the current champion of Russia and play 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.099
 if such an interesting series think it 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.030
 very cool modem for for us and for 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:41.890
 our guys this series is instructive even 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.179
 not even if we consider the first match 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.989
 which is such a big score 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.119
 happened well it happened that I 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.039
 realized today on video that not 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.520
 it turned out at the head there are four corners 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.849
 in a row, the rival has implemented very much 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.929
 probably it was for this match everything is clear 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:07.390
 so i think that the key point today 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:15.190
 there were probably 2 of them that after 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:17.560
 Bala we very very rolls down 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.819
 and gave a lot of space for 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.280
 players or 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:27.189
 develop our attacks so we 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.370
 still in the first half could not even 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.900
 account and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.489
 in the second half had no 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.900
 benefits of an emotionally playing account 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.579
 the second moment probably still was 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.769
 that moment when we had such 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.459
 good 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.799
 splash I do not take no penalty 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.180
 kick about another moment when Sasha 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:55.450
 the movie was a good moment before he 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.340
 spoke with a corner I think that this one 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.030
 the moment he was unexpected for the opponent 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.310
 and release and you probably I hope I say 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.639
 probably subjunctive but nonetheless 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.040
 then you need a game could a little bit of refugees 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.319
 Well, it turned out as it happened again 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.530
 not all and fans of felicia with a victory 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.419
 Good luck in the finals to our fans 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.650
 Thank you for supporting us. 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:23.049
 in this series someone is very someone 8 before 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.199
 in Krasnoyarsk anyway we did 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.519
 Today, all they could in this series, too 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:35.009
 all tweets us championship ending 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.009
 develops very very hard 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:43.319
 hitters on the table no to the chain 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:49.590
 firstly very cool worked in 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:51.930
 defense i think they are very thorough 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.820
 were preparing in urine and we had a lot in 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.230
 this year, I think they learned our 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.420
 attacks more degree since we 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.250
 we conclude we both said not only 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.500
 about these matches but in general 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.140
 probably starting with a match that we 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.270
 spent in kiwi 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.640
 It turns out to be seven matches, but we have 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.239
 have a hitter let's say for 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:24.690
 six there is 7 match in general that is it 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:26.630
 questions for him we start three 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.340
 four games back if rewind 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.169
 already then began to think something in 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:39.510
 our game is not that something to change and 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:42.750
 today we tried to do but it is an experience 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.090
 it is necessary that gaming experience when 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.530
 good counterattacks when not 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.910
 the ball is delivered to each other and not 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.450
 delivered on time or some 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.640
 technical marriage is very important if 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:58.470
 these moments caught them 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.190
 quite a lot from the first, I think that 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.830
 the guys behind 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.210
 must score anyway cool 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:09.440
 striker must have such moments 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.440
 face your question is absolutely concept 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.430
 I think it is not entirely wrong 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.830
 quite logical 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.210
 well and if you left 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:35.990
 in parfino why are they 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.990
 why not try to make a move why 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.010
 why no chance and 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.160
 perfectly 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.830
 I think that success and the first match was 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.710
 not bad so to say that was the first match 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:54.830
 bad we spent 20 first ball which 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:57.080
 we missed it very much could not have been 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.690
 it could not be 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.990
 moment the player scored in Krasnoyarsk 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:08.940
 our gates generalize on poppy judge so 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:11.100
 appreciated the game was up to 5 balls we went 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.670
 remove rivals take advantage with 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.230
 angular and guys like that was tough and 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.160
 enough we didn't just become players 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:22.440
 risk removed starting lineup 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.840
 the guys played less so we could 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.270
 try fashionable let's say 56 lose 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.190
 but with whatever we are in the next match I'm not 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:38.790
 I know this situation is still a match 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:41.000
 three wins ahead and not when i 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:47.040
 today who used the guys that 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.930
 guys that is not clear what I want and it 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.250
 right when you want more than you 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:55.840
 could only then will you eat let 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:00.790
 we were congratulated by the series 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.740
 Yes, and we will prepare for others about what you 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.560
 many sahaba to dilute entries 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.070
 five times left the country for the people to you 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.070
 for interesting
