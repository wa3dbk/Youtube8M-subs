is I'm sand is laying on top of Pistons
that<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.329> retracted<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.110> mean<00:00:43.440> extend<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> once

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that are retracted I mean extend it once

that are retracted I mean extend it once
they<00:00:44.430> retract<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.450> sand<00:00:45.719> falls<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.440> know

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
they retract the sand falls on I know

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
they retract the sand falls on I know
redstone<00:00:47.340> which<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.969> by<00:00:48.090> default<00:00:48.480> breaks<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
redstone which just by default breaks it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.920 
redstone which just by default breaks it
apart<00:00:49.309> this<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.489> extremely<00:00:51.329> simple<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.750> build

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
apart this is extremely simple to build

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
apart this is extremely simple to build

turns I'm off alright perfect now what I
do<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.990> pressure<00:01:18.990> plate<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.549> know

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
do is I use a pressure plate I you know

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.130 
do is I use a pressure plate I you know
I<00:01:20.700> could<00:01:20.909> pull<00:01:21.090> lever<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:21.810> not<00:01:21.990> as

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
I could pull lever but that's not as

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.929 
I could pull lever but that's not as
awesome<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.590> walking<00:01:22.799> backwards<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
awesome as walking backwards and it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
awesome as walking backwards and it
reacting<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.960> thing<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.320> pressure<00:01:25.560> plates

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
reacting the thing about pressure plates

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
reacting the thing about pressure plates
though<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> they<00:01:26.430> give<00:01:26.700> an<00:01:26.820> on-off<00:01:27.240> signal

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
though is they give an on-off signal

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.569 
though is they give an on-off signal
which<00:01:28.229> means<00:01:28.259> these<00:01:28.710> would<00:01:28.950> go<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.340> off

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
which means these would go on and off

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.950 
which means these would go on and off
and<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> sin<00:01:30.150> won't<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.509> enough<00:01:30.720> time<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and the sin won't have enough time to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.069 
and the sin won't have enough time to
fall<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.100> what<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.970> run<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.570> 80

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
fall so what I do is I run that in to 80

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.510 
fall so what I do is I run that in to 80
flip-flop<00:01:34.970> which<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.280> favorite

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
flip-flop which this is like my favorite

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.030 
flip-flop which this is like my favorite
tea<00:01:38.759> flip-flop<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.140> from<00:01:40.439> again

flip-flop now since we are working with

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.109 
flip-flop now since we are working with
pistons<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.200> make<00:02:01.290> sure<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:01.950> the

pistons we have to make sure that at the

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.940 
pistons we have to make sure that at the
output<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.049> place<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.040> oh<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:07.619> stuff

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
output that we place a oh that stuff

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.760 
output that we place a oh that stuff
down<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:08.310> empty<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.170> place<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
down there empty that we place a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.400 
down there empty that we place a
repeater<00:02:11.459> otherwise<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.330> does<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> 1

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
repeater otherwise it does like a 1

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.160 
repeater otherwise it does like a 1
quick<00:02:14.190> tick<00:02:14.490> polls<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.390> don't<00:02:15.750> want<00:02:15.900> that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
quick tick polls and we don't want that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.340 
quick tick polls and we don't want that
especially<00:02:17.160> not<00:02:17.340> with<00:02:17.460> pistons<00:02:17.940> all<00:02:18.900> right<00:02:19.050> so

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
especially not with pistons all right so

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.220 
especially not with pistons all right so
the<00:02:19.980> line<00:02:20.190> will<00:02:20.400> not<00:02:20.820> likely<00:02:21.120> be<00:02:21.330> long<00:02:21.960> enough

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the line will not likely be long enough

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.900 
the line will not likely be long enough
and<00:02:22.470> these<00:02:22.890> ones<00:02:23.160> are<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.460> cross<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.850> we

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and these ones are going to cross and we

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.450 
and these ones are going to cross and we
don't<00:02:24.030> want<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.300> let's<00:02:25.140> go<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.740> opposite

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
don't want that let's go the opposite

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:35.450 
don't want that let's go the opposite
way<00:02:26.600> this<00:02:27.600> way<00:02:30.650> all<00:02:31.650> right<00:02:34.130> all<00:02:35.130> right<00:02:35.190> we'll

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
way this way all right all right we'll

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.450 
way this way all right all right we'll
use<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> repeater<00:02:36.330> here<00:02:36.390> ah<00:02:37.100> man<00:02:38.270> wrong<00:02:39.270> button

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
use a repeater here ah man wrong button

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
use a repeater here ah man wrong button
like<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:42.950> awesome<00:02:43.950> all<00:02:44.820> right<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.150> see<00:02:45.330> now

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
like so awesome all right so see now

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.800 
like so awesome all right so see now
they<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:46.010> retracted<00:02:47.270> will<00:02:48.270> step<00:02:48.570> on<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
they are retracted will step on the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.520 
they are retracted will step on the
pressure<00:02:49.020> plate<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:52.230> doesn't<00:02:52.470> have

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
pressure plate and it doesn't have

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.250 
pressure plate and it doesn't have
enough<00:02:52.770> juice<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.450> now<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.630> should<00:02:57.110> all<00:02:58.110> right

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
enough juice and now it should all right

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.480 
enough juice and now it should all right
perfect<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.830> know<00:02:59.070> we<00:02:59.190> want<00:02:59.370> them

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
perfect so you know we want them

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.390 
perfect so you know we want them
extended<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.900> can<00:03:01.050> place<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.590> sand<00:03:01.860> directly

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
extended you can place the sand directly

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.650 
extended you can place the sand directly
on<00:03:02.580> these<00:03:02.900> now<00:03:03.900> granted<00:03:04.350> mine<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> lot

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
on these now granted mine is a lot

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.450 
on these now granted mine is a lot
taller<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.650> takes<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.040> little<00:03:08.190> bit<00:03:08.310> longer

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
taller so it takes a little bit longer

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.910 
taller so it takes a little bit longer
for<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.910> sand<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.270> realize<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.720> gravity<00:03:10.680> has

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
for the sand to realize that gravity has

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.210 
for the sand to realize that gravity has
now<00:03:11.160> taken<00:03:11.220> hold<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.630> needs<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.900> fall<00:03:13.170> down

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
now taken hold and it needs to fall down

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.680 
now taken hold and it needs to fall down
you<00:03:14.220> know<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.460> shorter<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.420> faster

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
you know the shorter it is the faster

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.770 
you know the shorter it is the faster
the<00:03:16.050> sand<00:03:16.290> will<00:03:16.440> fall<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.970> by<00:03:18.180> default<00:03:18.240> it's

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
the sand will fall so by default it's

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.900 
the sand will fall so by default it's
like<00:03:19.050> hey<00:03:19.320> guys<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.830> is<00:03:19.890> Ivan<00:03:20.370> with<00:03:20.580> Bubba

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
like hey guys this is Ivan with Bubba

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.810 
like hey guys this is Ivan with Bubba
blah<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.450> bam<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.130> know<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.340> step<00:03:23.610> on<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
blah and bam so you know I step on the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.260 
blah and bam so you know I step on the
pressure<00:03:24.000> plate<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.890> that<00:03:25.890> happens<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.580> is

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
pressure plate and that happens that is

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.360 
pressure plate and that happens that is
it<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:28.200> is<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.470> ladies<00:03:28.740> and<00:03:28.770> gentlemen<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.340> is

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.500 
it that is it ladies and gentlemen it is
just<00:03:29.640> Pistons<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.150> are<00:03:30.320> retracted<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.560> is

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
just Pistons that are retracted it is

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.110 
just Pistons that are retracted it is
then<00:03:33.740> I'm<00:03:34.740> sorry<00:03:35.040> extended<00:03:35.610> then<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.970> is

then I'm sorry extended then it is

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.810 
then I'm sorry extended then it is
retracted<00:03:36.720> by<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.900> T<00:03:37.140> flip-flop<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:38.580> sand

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
retracted by the T flip-flop the sand

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.430 
retracted by the T flip-flop the sand
falls<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.690> know<00:03:39.780> act<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.110> breaths<00:03:40.320> then

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
falls on you know act the breaths then

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.430 
falls on you know act the breaths then
it<00:03:40.740> could<00:03:40.860> be<00:03:40.980> inactive<00:03:41.610> redstone<00:03:42.440> torches

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
it could be inactive redstone torches

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.750 
it could be inactive redstone torches
they're<00:03:43.830> different<00:03:44.160> things<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.489> will<00:03:44.610> break

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
they're different things that will break

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.750 
they're different things that will break
stand<00:03:45.090> apart<00:03:46.100> but<00:03:47.100> yeah<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:50.100> yeah

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760
