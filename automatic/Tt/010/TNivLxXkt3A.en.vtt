faultlessly obviously we've sold

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.240 
faultlessly obviously we've sold
zillions<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.360> these<00:00:42.510> over<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> years<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.290> one

from<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> motor<00:00:55.199> clutch<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> nice<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.699> fact

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
from the motor clutch is nice in fact

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.610 
from the motor clutch is nice in fact
accorded<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.239> history<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.629> after<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.170> new

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
accorded the history it's after a new

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.840 
accorded the history it's after a new
clutch<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> last<00:00:59.340> three<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.579> four<00:00:59.670> months

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
clutch in the last three or four months

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.930 
clutch in the last three or four months
I<00:01:00.149> think<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.390> memory<00:01:01.579> gearbox<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> good

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I think from memory gearbox is good

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.479 
I think from memory gearbox is good
there's<00:01:03.180> no<00:01:03.500> synchro<00:01:04.500> problems<00:01:04.979> or<00:01:05.129> runs

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
there's no synchro problems or runs

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.310 
there's no synchro problems or runs
these<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.060> sometimes<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> gearbox<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
these can sometimes get the gearbox is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.550 
these can sometimes get the gearbox is
really<00:01:07.590> nice<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:09.450> whole<00:01:09.570> drivetrain<00:01:09.960> feels

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
really nice the whole drivetrain feels

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.320 
really nice the whole drivetrain feels
really<00:01:10.830> secure<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.030> there's<00:01:12.240> no

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
really secure on this one there's no

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.810 
really secure on this one there's no
backlash<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.960> anything<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> drivetrain

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
backlash or anything and the drivetrain

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.550 
backlash or anything and the drivetrain
it<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.119> feels<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.350> nicely

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it just feels like a so really nicely

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.510 
it just feels like a so really nicely
kept<00:01:17.299> vehicle<00:01:18.299> all<00:01:18.390> around

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
kept vehicle all around

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:32.500 
kept vehicle all around
I<00:01:22.189> really<00:01:23.189> can't<00:01:23.399> fault<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> drive<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:42.100 

go<00:01:33.510> back

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.020 

seems<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.010> track<00:01:43.250> nice<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.610> straight<00:01:43.880> will

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
seems to track nice and straight will

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.670 
seems to track nice and straight will
find<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.330> straight<00:01:44.840> by<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.020> road<00:01:45.200> just<00:01:45.560> to

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
find a straight by the road just to

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.790 
find a straight by the road just to
confirm<00:01:46.100> that

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.250 

I<00:01:50.000> know<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.150> last<00:01:51.330> owner<00:01:51.750> told<00:01:51.930> me<00:01:52.080> he

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
I know the last owner told me he

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.710 
I know the last owner told me he
searched<00:01:52.740> high<00:01:52.980> and<00:01:53.010> low<00:01:53.160> for<00:01:53.480> rejected<00:01:54.480> loads

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
searched high and low for rejected loads

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.880 
searched high and low for rejected loads
before<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.140> found<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.550> can<00:01:57.120> see<00:01:57.300> why

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.130 

yeah<00:02:03.460> tries<00:02:03.880> perfectly<00:02:04.300> straight<00:02:04.540> true<00:02:04.840> no

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
yeah tries perfectly straight true no

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.110 
yeah tries perfectly straight true no
problems<00:02:05.530> there

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.430 

specification<00:02:12.120> wise<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.020> s<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
specification wise because it's the s it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.960 
specification wise because it's the s it
so<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:13.920> fully<00:02:14.160> equipped<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.790> also

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
so it's fully equipped it is also

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.050 
so it's fully equipped it is also
obviously<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> very<00:02:16.050> last<00:02:16.200> ones

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
obviously one of the very last ones

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.590 
obviously one of the very last ones
being<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:19.100> 300<00:02:20.100> cut<00:02:22.940> but<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.030> spec<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.390> very

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
being a 300 cut but the spec is very

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.750 
being a 300 cut but the spec is very
very<00:02:24.720> good<00:02:25.020> obviously<00:02:26.010> apart<00:02:26.250> from<00:02:26.370> metallic

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
very good obviously apart from metallic

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.730 
very good obviously apart from metallic
paint<00:02:27.000> inside<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.810> we've<00:02:27.960> got<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> full

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
mid grey lever we've got electric

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.160 
mid grey lever we've got electric
windows<00:02:35.010> all<00:02:35.190> round<00:02:35.660> which<00:02:36.660> will<00:02:36.900> find<00:02:37.110> I

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
windows all round which will find I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.470
