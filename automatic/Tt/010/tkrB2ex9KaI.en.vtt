00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello, I am with you your comments 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.130
 today's video tutorial we continue 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.929
 the topic of physics and continue so important 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.809
 aspect today consider how work 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.820
 knees ask a question or yes yes how is it 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.029
 to drink a lot of options and I'll 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.070
 I will say the correct blows all all 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.539
 correct shots in something that does not show 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.550
 this is the right punch 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.160
 well if he is shown he means 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.390
 somewhere somewhere someone passed and he 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.730
 right, I'll show you a few 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.130
 variants of the most common work 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.920
 knees shoulders 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.210
 that is, the very first option that I 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.329
 I recommend how it is a blow that you 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.370
 all seen in the base up to my base 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.289
 course video tutorials all subscribed to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.899
 the site all came to the basic course 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.730
 video tutorials that is, I recommend the knee 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.480
 beat dos feet he lands you dots us from 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 get along charge and knee as much as possible 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.469
 fast yes yes by force 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.199
 but this option is not always possible 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.530
 firstly if close strong distance 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.110
 them nowhere to charge your foot first in 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.530
 second if the enemy is standing nearby 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.049
 Misha is never drunk from the bottom of the knee 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.070
 the probability of falling in the folder and nowhere 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.890
 I will not allow 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.170
 punch legs to drink that is 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.210
 option this option is very good when 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.790
 we took the key dam follow opponent 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.340
 lost yes yes you do with from grave 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.799
 very important element 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.260
 thai boxing meaning you hold the key in 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.810
 past video tutorial we have it 1 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.690
 watched grab the nape of this 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.940
 grip you pull the right foot 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.090
 back his shock charging 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.150
 and with all your body, how would you ship his head 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.810
 that is, you leg and I go out and ship it 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.210
 washed down 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.030
 he bends on it at the exit just 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.580
 no if the head has risen from the neck from 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.420
 the head then the whole body went on if you 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.990
 when loaded 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.030
 and immediately that movement sock 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.110
 pushed off and to the left in the head immediately 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.119
 sent it so strong 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.670
 the brunt is especially good for 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.560
 self defense outside use like on 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.300
 the street guys are not prepared at all and 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.270
 even if someone is somewhere somewhere 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.610
 does this for example 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.550
 clinch nobody to work except 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.620
 thai boxers so thai boxing 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.350
 here it is your how to benefit even 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.290
 wrestlers they will immediately grab but somewhere 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.510
 throw there grab on the deflection if 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.459
 you take his head yes and immediately 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.489
 remove the new frequency target 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.430
 many even if he goes for the left foot 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.770
 would you give him the right to have 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.860
 charged you anyway then right to left 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.260
 and punch it or punch 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.410
 a couple of times at once he handles the flour and 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.070
 will be much of the fact there are still times when the time 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.410
 went to capture it come corps 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.769
 at the same time leaves not brown and 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.709
 the second movement live in the forehead is this 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:07.580
 technically very strong element 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.220
 just for kick out how to beat your knees on 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.050
 short distance prize on short 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.540
 distance when the inside gets drunk 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.300
 part that is, we take away and internal 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.120
 part here add in what plus of this 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.360
 hitting something that opponents often put up 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.810
 fruit if you beat straight knee up 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.960
 from the bottom up from the dots flag you set 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.050
 beat themselves but 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.990
 all workers on her right beat 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.810
 I set the elbows off, but if 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.570
 you beat the inner knee you beat it 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.380
 on the side you fall and shoulder 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.380
 if the hand is pressed for example a combat model 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.410
 on you took the key the opponent hands lowered 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.790
 put his elbows he puts his forehead that is 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.460
 straight knees and it will be hard to tramp you 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.270
 start to throw side on shoulder 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.300
 here on the ear on the floor on the body side 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.000
 here inserts a pen about pick your own 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.660
 hands and start knees insert 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.650
 right left side throw that is 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.590
 no injury 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.750
 but the force of such a blow is naturally of course 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.140
 lower than direct force 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.420
 well quite noticeable especially if you're in 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.000
 clay stuck where so that the enemy 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.640
 hand on top further and you can your 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.600
 support someone yes this knee goes in 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:36.720
 clean edge open there went the world 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.110
 throw quietly on the river at first 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.100
 an element like that while you looked straight 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:47.640
 side thai use knees often 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.350
 fight year all do not drink no land they 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.540
 leg back bring first and then 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.390
 bend it already in the air and punching the 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.720
 there is a hit it turns out we will collect lands 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.290
 sock we have a knee up from below 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.230
 straight 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.620
 if we beat lateral not first knee 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.920
 raises then remember we bring because 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.450
 and this punch turns out the leg is entered 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:19.580
 back and knee goes straight along plus 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:25.050
 what work is done once have brought you steel 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:27.450
 once delivered there will again be inserted after inserting 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.720
 peace is their job constantly like 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:33.490
 would be on air 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.650
 it is physically hard to work already 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.410
 constantly it turns out you need her 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.140
 straighten back then bring beats all 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.930
 air time in warehouses a lot of strength 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.500
 spend on keeping secrets and here but this 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.360
 such three main hits 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.890
 they should be used all three be able and 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.350
 the point is that in battle they will all come in handy 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:59.950
 if you are waiting for the enemy 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.940
 experienced begin to clean tass goes with 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.900
 socks or 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.540
 or right to the body or left right to 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.600
 head left oven 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:15.040
 that is, you work straight if you go 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.800
 job hard attack in clinch started 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.650
 you got tied up you start working here 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.500
 internal knee once a little bit removed 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.620
 here you are throwing internal ribs 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:30.490
 on the right and left liver the same 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.160
 fought if work went such that 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.310
 opponent then you have a little bit 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.880
 there is space up there is an opportunity 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.460
 it whistles you there you hold it 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.530
 in the clinch good. they are a little bit of it from 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.140
 yourself from great then you can 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:51.190
 that is, your knees go from the air here again 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:54.250
 there on from in a straight line as you primorye not 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.590
 hit because there is no place to hit him 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.140
 Is that between the legs on the rhythm of this 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.360
 option is not considered lateral possible 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.270
 strike but a little bit far 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.110
 need to pursue but the surf in the most 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.110
 once taken 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:11.200

 to work on a bear in different ways 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.990
 on a small 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:25.020
 bumps in diameter so that it is small 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.570
 crazy not to take and throw different colleagues 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.780
 and naturally with a partner that is, he 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:33.510
