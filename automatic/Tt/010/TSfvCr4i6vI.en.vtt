00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
be soft is going to be coming hard with

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.580 
be soft is going to be coming hard with
what's<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.090> called<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.299> division<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.109> stuff

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
what's it called the division and stuff

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.610 
what's it called the division and stuff
but<00:03:19.919> still<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.760> think<00:03:21.060> EA<00:03:21.480> might<00:03:22.079> be<00:03:22.319> able<00:03:22.440> to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
but still I think EA might be able to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.460 
but still I think EA might be able to
win<00:03:22.799> III<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.459> year<00:03:23.699> if<00:03:23.910> if<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.510> presentation

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
win III this year if if the presentation

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.180 
win III this year if if the presentation
is<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.769> point<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:27.139> it's<00:03:28.139> it's<00:03:28.650> weird<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.129> I

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
is on point and it's it's weird but I

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.860 
is on point and it's it's weird but I
think<00:03:29.459> they<00:03:29.549> might<00:03:29.730> do<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.060> they<00:03:30.389> might<00:03:30.599> do<00:03:30.750> it

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
think they might do it they might do it

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.770 
think they might do it they might do it
it<00:03:30.989> seems<00:03:31.199> like<00:03:31.639> every<00:03:32.639> franchise<00:03:33.359> right<00:03:33.599> now

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
it seems like every franchise right now

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.129 
it seems like every franchise right now
it<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:35.099> being<00:03:35.730> treated<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.540> way<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.840> should<00:03:37.109> be

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
it is being treated the way it should be

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.219 
it is being treated the way it should be
treated<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.889> that<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.609> weird<00:03:39.299> from<00:03:39.599> EA<00:03:39.840> but

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
treated and that is weird from EA but

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.229 
treated and that is weird from EA but
they're<00:03:40.409> doing<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:40.919> and<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.310> like<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.209> like
