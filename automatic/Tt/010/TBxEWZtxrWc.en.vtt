00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.609
 welcome back to cooking easy.com today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.099
 we see a fish dish 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.580
 we will make the grilled salmon with one 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.280
 first of all, Taggiasca olives sauce 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.140
 prepare the sauce in a pan 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.800
 pour a little olive oil 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.800
 add the Taggiasca olives 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:33.180
 let them brown for about 30 40 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:35.070
 seconds working on medium heat 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.390
 browning is very important because 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.059
 they will make the sauce much more flavorful 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.510
 then we pour a little white wine and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.770
 let us also fade in this case 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.770
 it will take a few seconds 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.829
 now we can add some pass about 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:01.469
 tomato we mix everything very well 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.149
 trying to mix the sauce of 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.149
 tomato with the cooking bottom 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.180
 let's cook our sauce 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.890
 adding a little fish stock 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.869
 if you don't have it, it's fine with broth 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.939
 vegetable or if you don't have it it's great 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.100
 also water and we add a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.200
 little bit of salt not too much because 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.960
 olives are already very tasty now 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.829
 let's cook our sauce for 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.720
 few minutes working on high heat 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.549
 we will do very quickly 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.920
 we also add aromatic herbs 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.220
 sage laurel rosemary those that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.509
 prefer working on a medium flame or 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.119
 medium high after 34 minutes 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.700
 we will get this consistency we keep 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.119
 while we take the hot sauce then 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.549
 our salmon here we have some 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.689
 salmon slices about 2 cm thick and 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.780
 we will have them grilled on a large pan 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.270
 very hot and very important 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.060
 both hot and very hot 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.539
 hot because otherwise the fish risks 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.319
 then to stick instead to present 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.530
 we should have some nice cooked slices 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.900
 just simply wait for the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.450
 our pan is very very hot 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:28.020
 let the fish cook for about three 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:31.940
 minutes per side then just remove it 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.260
 from the grill and put it on a plate 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.650
 let's look at our sauce again 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.060
 warm we can decorate with a little 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.440
 chopped parsley 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.510
 as you have seen it is a 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.269
 very simple and very much recipe
