00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello dear sports fans with 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.700
 again you i dmitry in saints today i 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.019
 I want to tell you about the exercises in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.320
 home conditions about one exercise 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:19.320
 exercises on the pectoral muscles as so as 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.260
 called for example bars 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.140
 if for example you do not at home but you can 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.610
 lodge at home there are bars and how can 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 pump chest muscles 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.030
 one of the exercises at home 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.340
 pump chest muscles 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.699
 exercises are called parallel bars 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.350
 focus on the other since i don't have 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.910
 bar in wide even tell you what's best 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.620
 no bars grizzled even in your home there 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.230
 bars you can not use them 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.570
 because many do not have such wide 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.870
 bars such a wide arrangement that you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.149
 could spread your arms as wide as possible than 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 the wider you will be your hands the more will be 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.670
 work on the pectoral muscles as 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.210
 possible you need to sew wider shoulders you 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.780
 projectile alignment is obtained to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.119
 do the right exercises on the muscles you 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.460
 you need to do two stops with one of 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.399
 the other side and the desired align 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.020
 on one so they were on the same line 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:28.250
 at that level further you also do everything 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.470
 do the same exercises 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.540
 how on uneven bars stand like 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.640
 steel rack tilt slightly forward 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.579
 torso 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.250
 to do as much as possible dilute shoulders 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.650
 parties were so down 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.049
 drop to 90 degrees between 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.979
 forearm and bicep times survived 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:58.020
 sank we sank survived 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.560
 dropped down and you don't need it here 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.229
 go deep so deep 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.960
 lowering can be injured 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.060
 and what turnstile need deep 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.610
 lowered and raised up to the end not 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.860
 nothing like pumping muscles can not 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.340
 be for development to turn the sun 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.560
 something else is spinning, spinning this time 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.230
 useful but here it is not necessary 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.080
 so if you want you to have 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.660
 breast stretching good then you need 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.390
 as low as possible to hold so 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:35.430
 and get out of this position and you already 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:38.760
 will be stormy stretched and it can 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.860
 do exercises even more with experience 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.980
 will need to hang a load or something 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.630
 cling on to the belt then just another 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.780
 harder will you be injured 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.300
 so as not to bring it better not 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.140
 so worth it to go down to nothing 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.420
 how do you load shoulders do not need triceps 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.870
 I also need you therefore it is desirable 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.750
 go down to 90 degrees and go up 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.780
 slowly descend look again 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.090
 raised that higher try ass 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.620
 lift up tilt shoulders forward 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.209
 it feels like you are squeezing 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.880
 polo and lowered slowly rose 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.200
 sank down slowly raise sank 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.850
 slowly got up here need to try 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.750
 stress the chest you 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.010
 should immediately once you have focused 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.410
 the initial position you should already 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.510
 tense muscles and slow down 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.510
 with strained pectoral muscles only 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.670
 reached the corner immediately turn on even stronger 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.790
 muscle and push out push out 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.489
 do not include the pectoral muscles 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.739
 keep your hands as small as possible 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:51.150
 include hands if you are the most 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:57.510
 turn on the triceps then this exercise you 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.019
 no return will give further it would be 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.200
 super 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.150
 if you make wooden for example 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.370
 made 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.859
 wooden pens to the world so they can 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.079
 move or just even narrower 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.600
 so that you have enough for example books 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.819
 An example is so much less but not books 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.989
 can be cooked so they could 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.299
 clasp so you don't have a brush 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.400
 direct so that it was a little girth you 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.169
 you can already regulate these friends you are not 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.840
 can it or so 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.660
 flexibility is different 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.600
 and forearms and hands or in hands 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.800
 did so for example there came from and already 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.270
 better if you even move 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.639
 learn was you have it move it in 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.530
 this side and here you have the same 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.490
 there will be more for 2 more will already be 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:52.120
 work chest 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:55.520
 but you will need to lean forward 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.160
 lift up and more or so 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.330
 the main thing in this exercise you do not need 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.030
 about it when you get ready to do it 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.710
 exercise so that your shoulders were up not 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.870
 think of your shoulders 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.389
 vata do not try to do this because 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.419
 what is this fur top you must strictly 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.690
 lower your shoulders as if you know when 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.880
 you are doing the same pose 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.760
 on the teeth should be when you start 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.979
 do exercises when you shrink 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.830
 so show your muscles like this 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.990
 pose you have to take up the projectile and here 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.510
 so go down 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.850
 climbed down climbed climbed 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.010
 constantly shoulders were days you with 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.750
 lower than lower shoulders 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.020
 more reward stiff chest muscles 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.599
 and if you do like this you will have 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.310
 only shoulders won't work at all 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.660
 work 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.580
 boiler tense tense since it 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.700
 not tense when you do that 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.400
 to ferment up shoulders no sense 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.250
 you will not be here I used to swing like that 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.800
 I only worked shoulders 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.190
 I got up chest poured a blue shoulders 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.340
 no such sense 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.410
 lowered your shoulders and do this exercise 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.580
 the exercise is very good and it is done 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:16.550
 mostly after pushups will continue 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.800
 prescribe programs and then it turns out 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.150
 refer to such annotations 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.389
 exercises that will show 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.580
 Further further to make it easier for you 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.460
 consider see and understand 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:31.250
 with you was dmitry sweet work 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.950
 this exercise is very effective if 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.950
 do it right before the meeting
