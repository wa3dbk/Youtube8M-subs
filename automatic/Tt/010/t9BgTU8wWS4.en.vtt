00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
would have to flip it open like that in

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
would have to flip it open like that in
order<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.490> access<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.090> guess<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.380> rad<00:01:58.560> i

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
