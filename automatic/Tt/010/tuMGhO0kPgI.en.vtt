00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
hitting back up I know I cloud you can
back<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.840> which<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.500> fine<00:01:19.740> also<00:01:19.920> but

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
back up to which would be fine also but

everything<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.340> opinion<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> little

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
everything in my opinion just a little

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.380 
everything in my opinion just a little
bit<00:01:24.299> easier<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> I'd<00:01:26.610> go<00:01:26.850> ahead<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.090> actually

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
bit easier so I'd go ahead and actually
