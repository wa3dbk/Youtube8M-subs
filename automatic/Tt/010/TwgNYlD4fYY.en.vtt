00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
okay i'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.110 
okay i'm going to show you how to make a
paper<00:00:03.170> tank<00:00:04.670> here<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.910> example<00:00:06.649> right<00:00:07.649> here

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
paper tank here is example right here

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.600 
paper tank here is example right here
now<00:00:09.120> first<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.990> need<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.590> piece<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.010> paper<00:00:11.130> a

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
now first you need a piece of paper a

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.230 
now first you need a piece of paper a
small<00:00:14.610> piece<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.849> paper<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.839> can<00:00:16.139> cut

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
small piece of paper that you can cut

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.330 
small piece of paper that you can cut
click<00:00:18.240> both<00:00:18.449> seems<00:00:18.840> like<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.680> that

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
click both seems like this is that

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.609 
click both seems like this is that
smaller<00:00:23.150> now<00:00:24.150> first<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.720> would<00:00:24.960> need<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> fold

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
smaller now first you would need to fold

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.850 
smaller now first you would need to fold
it<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.070> half<00:00:29.810> the<00:00:30.810> short<00:00:31.109> short<00:00:31.769> way<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:33.860> needs

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
it in half the short short way and needs

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.630 
it in half the short short way and needs
to<00:00:35.100> look<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.489> need

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to look like this and then you can need

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.600 
to look like this and then you can need
to<00:00:39.570> flip<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.379> corner<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.100> sheet<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> paper

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
to flip the corner on the sheet of paper

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.630 
to flip the corner on the sheet of paper
like<00:00:44.120> this<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.899> fold<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.559> you'd<00:00:50.399> see

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
like this and then fold it and you'd see

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.209 
like this and then fold it and you'd see
a<00:00:50.670> low<00:00:50.910> line<00:00:51.210> right<00:00:51.420> there<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.469> same<00:00:52.800> thing<00:00:52.829> on

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
a low line right there the same thing on

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.819 
a low line right there the same thing on
the<00:00:53.370> other<00:00:53.399> side<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.620> an<00:00:59.239> X<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
the other side so you can make an X I

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:10.870 
the other side so you can make an X I
can<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> other<00:01:03.390> side

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.340 

there's<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.800> another<00:01:16.800> line<00:01:17.570> now<00:01:18.570> this

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
there's one and another line now this

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
there's one and another line now this
part<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.680> kind<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.010> complicated<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:21.240> need<00:01:21.480> two

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
part is kind of complicated you need two

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.140 
part is kind of complicated you need two
fingers<00:01:22.970> or<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.930> fingers<00:01:25.610> put<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.730> in<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
fingers or two fingers put it in the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.050 
fingers or two fingers put it in the
side<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:29.160> X<00:01:29.430> corner<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.560> push<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.580> in<00:01:32.730> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
side the X corner and you push it in to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:53.050 
side the X corner and you push it in to
make<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:40.910> same<00:01:41.910> thing<00:01:41.940> with<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.300> other<00:01:42.450> side

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.780 

so<00:01:54.060> we're<00:01:54.240> needs<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.869> look<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:58.790> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
so we're needs to look like this and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.330 
so we're needs to look like this and
then<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.210> need<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.869> take<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.439> flop<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.070> know

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
then you need to take one flop you know

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.160 
then you need to take one flop you know
there's<00:02:02.729> two<00:02:02.970> flaps<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:03.630> take<00:02:04.140> one

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
there's two flaps right here take one

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.020 
there's two flaps right here take one
flag<00:02:04.770> from<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> side<00:02:06.560> two<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.710> them

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
flag from one of the side two of them

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
flag from one of the side two of them
pulled<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.179> back<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.790
