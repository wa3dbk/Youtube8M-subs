in this how-to video will show you how
to<00:00:08.850> install<00:00:09.210> Forks<00:00:10.139> into<00:00:10.680> bicycle<00:00:11.280> for

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
to install Forks into bicycle for

to install Forks into bicycle for
the<00:00:11.980> principle<00:00:12.430> is<00:00:12.460> the<00:00:12.550> same<00:00:12.580> whether<00:00:13.120> their

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
the principle is the same whether their

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.630 
the principle is the same whether their
suspension<00:00:13.870> forks<00:00:14.200> like<00:00:14.350> these<00:00:14.559> or<00:00:14.830> hard

Forks<00:00:16.119> to<00:00:16.330> do<00:00:16.480> this<00:00:16.660> you'll<00:00:16.930> need<00:00:17.040> number<00:00:18.040> of

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
Forks to do this you'll need number of

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.510 
Forks to do this you'll need number of
items<00:00:19.050> allen<00:00:20.050> key<00:00:20.290> a<00:00:20.529> little<00:00:21.130> bit<00:00:21.250> of<00:00:21.340> white

piece of scrap we'll try this that we

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.550 
piece of scrap we'll try this that we
can<00:00:27.550> play<00:00:27.759> why<00:00:27.940> we<00:00:28.090> need<00:00:28.240> that<00:00:28.480> a<00:00:28.779> little<00:00:29.440> bit

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
can play why we need that a little bit

bottom of the headset you'll have

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.590 
bottom of the headset you'll have
something<00:01:18.670> looks<00:01:18.909> similar<00:01:19.149> to<00:01:19.329> this<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.479> what

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
something looks similar to this and what

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.069 
something looks similar to this and what
this<00:01:22.719> will<00:01:22.869> do<00:01:23.079> it<00:01:23.799> slides<00:01:24.189> down<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:25.299> after

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
this will do it slides down and after

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.679 
this will do it slides down and after
the<00:01:26.140> engages<00:01:26.649> a<00:01:26.680> fork<00:01:27.070> into<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.850> headset<00:01:28.060> that

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
the engages a fork into the headset that

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.639 
the engages a fork into the headset that
you<00:01:29.020> have<00:01:29.259> okay<00:01:30.009> so<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.399> install<00:01:30.670> this<00:01:30.939> V<00:01:31.649> first

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
you have okay so to install this V first

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.340 
you have okay so to install this V first
thing<00:01:32.859> I<00:01:32.920> want<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.159> do<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:33.899> add<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:34.929> little<00:01:35.140> bit

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
thing I want to do just add a little bit

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.300 
thing I want to do just add a little bit
of<00:01:35.799> Greed's<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.030> bottom<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.600> stem<00:01:37.869> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
of Greed's to the bottom of the stem and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.770 
of Greed's to the bottom of the stem and
the<00:01:39.310> reason<00:01:39.579> I'm<00:01:39.640> doing<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.420> because

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
the reason I'm doing that is because

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.560 
the reason I'm doing that is because
we've<00:01:41.469> learned<00:01:41.679> from<00:01:41.859> previous<00:01:42.340> videos

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
we've learned from previous videos

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.179 
we've learned from previous videos
everything<00:01:43.570> works<00:01:43.929> better<00:01:44.229> with<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.100> little

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
everything works better with a little

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:52.160 
everything works better with a little
bit<00:01:45.490> of<00:01:45.520> lubrication<00:01:48.899> let<00:01:49.899> me<00:01:50.020> take<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.320> ring

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
bit of lubrication let me take the ring

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.630 
bit of lubrication let me take the ring
put<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.289> down<00:01:53.439> over<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.829> stem<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.340> where<00:01:54.520> the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
put it down over the stem is where the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.510 
put it down over the stem is where the
bit<00:01:54.789> of<00:01:54.880> wood<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.359> the<00:01:56.200> hammer<00:01:56.409> comes<00:01:56.679> in<00:01:56.890> what

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
bit of wood and the hammer comes in what

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.760 
bit of wood and the hammer comes in what
we<00:01:57.640> need<00:01:57.789> to<00:01:57.909> do<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.749> just<00:01:59.020> close<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.530> gap<00:01:59.740> up

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
we need to do is just close the gap up

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.580 
we need to do is just close the gap up
here<00:02:00.249> let's<00:02:00.609> do<00:02:00.789> that<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.329> don't<00:02:02.319> want<00:02:02.469> to

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
here let's do that I don't want to

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.419 
here let's do that I don't want to
hammer<00:02:02.770> directly<00:02:04.200> onto<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:05.920> I'm<00:02:05.979> using<00:02:06.219> the

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
hammer directly onto it so I'm using the

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.970 
hammer directly onto it so I'm using the
wood<00:02:06.960> transfer<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.110> laid<00:02:08.319> down<00:02:08.590> by<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:10.980> cup

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
wood transfer the laid down by this cup

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.610 
wood transfer the laid down by this cup
attached<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.580> front<00:02:13.140> gets<00:02:14.140> attached<00:02:14.440> to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
attached to the front gets attached to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.880 
attached to the front gets attached to
the<00:02:14.710> back<00:02:14.950> keep<00:02:15.600> nice<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:16.630> even
