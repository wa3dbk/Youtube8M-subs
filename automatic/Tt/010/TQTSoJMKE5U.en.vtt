live<00:00:18.110> up<00:00:18.230> to<00:00:18.260> their<00:00:18.500> potential<00:00:18.800> but<00:00:24.700> 95<00:00:25.700> I

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
live up to their potential but 95 I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.970 
live up to their potential but 95 I
think<00:00:26.060> South<00:00:26.210> Africa<00:00:26.599> went<00:00:26.960> ahead<00:00:27.560> of<00:00:27.860> their

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
think South Africa went ahead of their

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.800 
think South Africa went ahead of their
potential<00:00:28.310> but<00:00:29.000> I<00:00:29.030> think<00:00:29.240> every<00:00:29.449> other<00:00:29.570> year

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
potential but I think every other year

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.359 
potential but I think every other year
that<00:00:30.020> performed<00:00:30.440> below<00:00:30.650> their<00:00:30.890> potential

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
that performed below their potential

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.189 
that performed below their potential
because<00:00:31.490> you<00:00:31.940> look<00:00:32.300> at<00:00:32.390> their<00:00:32.510> pliers<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:32.989> man

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
because you look at their pliers and man

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.630 
because you look at their pliers and man
from<00:00:33.470> there<00:00:33.650> and<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:33.830> ability<00:00:34.309> they've<00:00:34.520> got

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
from there and the ability they've got

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.430 
from there and the ability they've got
the<00:00:34.760> physical<00:00:35.210> ability<00:00:35.420> there<00:00:35.809> but<00:00:35.960> they've

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
the physical ability there but they've

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.619 
the physical ability there but they've
got<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:36.949> John<00:00:37.550> might<00:00:37.760> disagree<00:00:38.030> with<00:00:38.150> me<00:00:38.360> but

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
got and John might disagree with me but

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.570 
got and John might disagree with me but
yeah<00:00:39.170> they<00:00:39.500> can<00:00:39.650> match<00:00:39.800> anyone<00:00:40.160> in<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.430> world

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
yeah they can match anyone in the world

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.939 
yeah they can match anyone in the world
they<00:00:41.059> did<00:00:41.239> do<00:00:41.390> it<00:00:41.510> 95<00:00:41.989> though<00:00:42.230> didn't<00:00:42.470> they<00:00:42.500> we

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
they did do it 95 though didn't they we

they did do it 95 though didn't they we
did<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:43.520> think<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.940> think<00:00:43.970> John's<00:00:44.329> right<00:00:44.420> in

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
did and I think I think John's right in

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.360 
did and I think I think John's right in
95<00:00:45.050> we<00:00:45.170> played<00:00:45.380> out<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.620> our<00:00:45.710> socks<00:00:45.950> in<00:00:46.130> and
