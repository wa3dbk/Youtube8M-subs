factory reloaded box spotlight now in

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.009 
factory reloaded box spotlight now in
the<00:00:07.609> spotlight<00:00:08.029> I'm<00:00:08.240> going<00:00:08.540> to<00:00:08.660> take<00:00:08.809> a<00:00:08.840> look

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
the spotlight I'm going to take a look

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.470 
the spotlight I'm going to take a look
at<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:09.440> liquid<00:00:09.830> Roger<00:00:10.309> and<00:00:10.790> I've<00:00:11.000> got<00:00:11.299> a

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
at the liquid Roger and I've got a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.299 
at the liquid Roger and I've got a
little<00:00:11.749> setup<00:00:12.139> here<00:00:12.290> prepared<00:00:12.980> for<00:00:13.190> you<00:00:13.249> guys

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
little setup here prepared for you guys

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.190 
little setup here prepared for you guys
but<00:00:13.789> before<00:00:13.910> we<00:00:14.209> get<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:14.509> that<00:00:14.539> let's<00:00:14.959> have<00:00:15.049> a

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
but before we get to that let's have a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.840 
but before we get to that let's have a
look<00:00:15.379> at<00:00:15.499> the<00:00:15.620> crafting<00:00:16.100> recipe<00:00:16.520> for<00:00:16.730> this

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
look at the crafting recipe for this

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.540 
look at the crafting recipe for this
block<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.050> liquid<00:00:18.260> router<00:00:18.650> is<00:00:18.950> crafted

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
block so the liquid router is crafted

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.420 
block so the liquid router is crafted
using<00:00:19.700> three<00:00:20.330> buckets<00:00:20.750> a<00:00:21.100> factory<00:00:22.100> machine

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
using three buckets a factory machine

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.240 
using three buckets a factory machine
block<00:00:22.700> some<00:00:23.450> redstone<00:00:23.930> repeaters<00:00:24.470> and<00:00:24.740> some

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
block some redstone repeaters and some

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.130 
block some redstone repeaters and some
plastic<00:00:25.580> heats<00:00:25.850> and<00:00:26.060> this<00:00:26.270> gives<00:00:26.540> you<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.690> total

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
plastic heats and this gives you a total

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.290 
plastic heats and this gives you a total
of<00:00:27.230> eight<00:00:27.470> routers<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:28.280> that's<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:28.760> pretty<00:00:29.000> nice

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
of eight routers so that's a pretty nice

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.930 
of eight routers so that's a pretty nice
mount<00:00:29.660> now<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.470> factory<00:00:31.190> machine<00:00:31.520> block<00:00:31.760> is

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
mount now the factory machine block is

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.729 
mount now the factory machine block is
crafted<00:00:32.390> using<00:00:32.689> some<00:00:32.899> stone<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:33.530> some

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
crafted using some stone and some

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.619 
crafted using some stone and some
plastic<00:00:34.070> heats<00:00:34.339> and<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:35.269> need<00:00:35.449> these<00:00:35.570> for

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
plastic heats and you need these for

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.329 
plastic heats and you need these for
every<00:00:36.050> machine<00:00:36.230> in<00:00:36.530> this<00:00:36.679> mod<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:36.920> make<00:00:37.309> a

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
every machine in this mod so make a

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.250 
every machine in this mod so make a
couple<00:00:37.640> of<00:00:37.789> those<00:00:37.969> and<00:00:38.269> of<00:00:38.870> course<00:00:39.109> the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
couple of those and of course the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.899 
couple of those and of course the
plastic<00:00:39.620> heats<00:00:39.829> are<00:00:40.039> made<00:00:40.249> using<00:00:40.550> some<00:00:40.609> raw

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
plastic heats are made using some raw

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.520 
plastic heats are made using some raw
plastic<00:00:41.210> which<00:00:41.629> can<00:00:41.839> be<00:00:41.960> obtained<00:00:42.320> by

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
plastic which can be obtained by

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.660 
plastic which can be obtained by
smelting<00:00:43.489> rubber<00:00:44.089> bars<00:00:45.460> okay

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
smelting rubber bars okay

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.349 
smelting rubber bars okay
so<00:00:47.449> um<00:00:47.659> well<00:00:48.499> the<00:00:48.949> liquid<00:00:49.309> router<00:00:49.579> basically

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
so um well the liquid router basically

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.139 
so um well the liquid router basically
allows<00:00:50.719> you<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:50.960> send<00:00:51.499> liquids<00:00:52.129> in<00:00:52.370> any

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
allows you to send liquids in any

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.169 
allows you to send liquids in any
particular<00:00:53.569> direction<00:00:53.929> so<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:55.489> can

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
particular direction so you can

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:57.969 
particular direction so you can
basically<00:00:56.329> open<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.229> interface<00:00:57.559> here<00:00:57.739> and

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
basically open the interface here and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.549 
basically open the interface here and
specify<00:00:58.370> which<00:00:59.030> output<00:00:59.569> face<00:00:59.809> of<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.319> router

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
specify which output face of the router

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.960 
specify which output face of the router
has<00:01:01.249> to<00:01:01.699> receive<00:01:02.030> which<00:01:02.389> liquid<00:01:03.610> as<00:01:04.610> you<00:01:04.760> can

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
has to receive which liquid as you can

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.600 
has to receive which liquid as you can
see<00:01:05.150> on<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.449> sides<00:01:05.720> here<00:01:05.870> it's<00:01:06.200> got<00:01:06.439> green<00:01:06.829> red

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
see on the sides here it's got green red

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.580 
see on the sides here it's got green red
blue<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.600> yellow

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
blue and yellow

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.980 
blue and yellow
so<00:01:10.040> I'm<00:01:10.189> inputting<00:01:10.430> on<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.060> red<00:01:11.420> side<00:01:11.659> here

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
so I'm inputting on the red side here

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.340 
so I'm inputting on the red side here
from<00:01:12.229> this<00:01:12.409> tank<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.939> top<00:01:14.270> is<00:01:14.479> purple

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
from this tank and the top is purple

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.010 
from this tank and the top is purple
whereas<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.070> bottom<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.210> block<00:01:17.450> has<00:01:17.750> a

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
whereas the bottom of the block has a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.770 
whereas the bottom of the block has a
black<00:01:18.590> output<00:01:19.130> face<00:01:19.399> if<00:01:19.700> well<00:01:20.299> let's<00:01:20.600> have<00:01:20.719> a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
black output face if well let's have a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.840 
black output face if well let's have a
good<00:01:20.960> look<00:01:21.110> at<00:01:21.350> that<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:21.740> these<00:01:22.340> are<00:01:22.610> some

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
good look at that so these are some

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.100 
good look at that so these are some
black<00:01:23.060> corners<00:01:23.509> here

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
black corners here

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.279 
black corners here
alright<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:25.820> demonstrate<00:01:25.969> this<00:01:26.390> I've<00:01:26.719> got

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
alright so to demonstrate this I've got

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.819 
alright so to demonstrate this I've got
a<00:01:27.320> little<00:01:27.680> setup<00:01:27.920> with<00:01:29.049> purple<00:01:30.049> in<00:01:30.320> a<00:01:30.350> day<00:01:30.799> for

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
a little setup with purple in a day for

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.090 
a little setup with purple in a day for
the<00:01:31.369> top<00:01:31.670> here<00:01:31.969> which<00:01:32.149> is<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.840> sludge<00:01:33.320> then

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
the top here which is a sludge then

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.120 
the top here which is a sludge then
water<00:01:34.430> in<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.270> blue<00:01:35.539> face<00:01:35.780> some<00:01:36.380> biomass<00:01:36.829> in

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
water in the blue face some biomass in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.440 
water in the blue face some biomass in
the<00:01:37.189> green<00:01:38.030> one

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
the green one

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.399 
the green one
and<00:01:38.539> some<00:01:40.390> energizing<00:01:41.390> lodestone<00:01:41.869> which<00:01:41.899> is

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
and some energizing lodestone which is

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.959 
and some energizing lodestone which is
sort<00:01:42.649> of<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.979> gas<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.689> in<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.259> yellow<00:01:45.409> one

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
sort of a gas in the in the yellow one

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.749 
sort of a gas in the in the yellow one
alright<00:01:46.969> so<00:01:47.320> first<00:01:48.320> of<00:01:48.530> all<00:01:48.619> let's<00:01:48.950> try<00:01:49.700> the

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
alright so first of all let's try the

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.859 
alright so first of all let's try the
water<00:01:50.060> here

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.399 

okay<00:01:53.869> so<00:01:54.649> as<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.549> can<00:01:55.670> see<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.149> water<00:01:56.409> flows

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
okay so as you can see the water flows

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.450 
okay so as you can see the water flows
nicely<00:01:57.799> out<00:01:58.249> of<00:01:58.579> our<00:01:58.880> tank<00:01:59.270> here<00:02:00.130> into<00:02:01.130> the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
nicely out of our tank here into the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.419 
nicely out of our tank here into the
pipes<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.600> right<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:02.929> 2d<00:02:03.469> blue<00:02:03.770> output

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
pipes and it is right a 2d blue output

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.270 
pipes and it is right a 2d blue output
face<00:02:05.079> okay<00:02:06.079> so<00:02:06.140> now<00:02:06.469> we<00:02:06.530> are<00:02:06.679> going<00:02:06.859> to<00:02:06.979> try<00:02:07.219> to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
face okay so now we are going to try to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.180 
face okay so now we are going to try to
get<00:02:07.609> some<00:02:08.090> sludge<00:02:08.539> into<00:02:08.810> this<00:02:09.080> tank<00:02:09.590> on<00:02:09.830> top<00:02:10.039> of

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
get some sludge into this tank on top of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.719 
get some sludge into this tank on top of
the<00:02:10.310> router

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
the router

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.240 
the router
so<00:02:11.510> let's<00:02:11.750> pour<00:02:12.050> some<00:02:12.080> sludge<00:02:12.560> in<00:02:12.769> there<00:02:12.950> and

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
so let's pour some sludge in there and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.280 
so let's pour some sludge in there and
as<00:02:13.519> you<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.790> see<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.330> top<00:02:14.750> tank

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
as you can see the top tank

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.390 
as you can see the top tank
is<00:02:15.530> filling<00:02:15.950> up<00:02:16.099> all<00:02:16.750> right<00:02:17.750> now<00:02:18.620> let's<00:02:19.219> try

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
is filling up all right now let's try

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.250 
is filling up all right now let's try
some<00:02:19.730> biomass<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:22.129> there<00:02:22.519> we<00:02:22.609> go<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.659> routed

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
some biomass and there we go it's routed

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.699 
some biomass and there we go it's routed
into<00:02:24.859> the<00:02:25.069> green<00:02:25.340> output<00:02:25.790> phase<00:02:25.969> and<00:02:26.709> right

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
into the green output phase and right

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.280 
into the green output phase and right
right<00:02:28.129> into<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.670> tank<00:02:29.239> over<00:02:29.569> here<00:02:29.599> and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
right into this tank over here and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.559 
right into this tank over here and
finally<00:02:30.859> we<00:02:31.189> have<00:02:31.400> some<00:02:31.640> energized<00:02:32.209> glow

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
finally we have some energized glow

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.610 
finally we have some energized glow
stone<00:02:33.459> which<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.700> routed<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.480> our<00:02:35.659> tank<00:02:36.049> on<00:02:36.319> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
stone which is routed to our tank on the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.069 
stone which is routed to our tank on the
yellow<00:02:37.069> output<00:02:37.579> phase<00:02:38.709> okay<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:40.450> that's<00:02:41.450> very

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
yellow output phase okay so that's very

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.240 
yellow output phase okay so that's very
nice<00:02:42.409> it<00:02:42.739> fills<00:02:43.040> up<00:02:43.250> each<00:02:44.709> each<00:02:45.709> tank

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
nice it fills up each each tank

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.530 
nice it fills up each each tank
correctly<00:02:47.470> okay<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.849> got<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.879> bit<00:02:50.090> much<00:02:50.299> in

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
correctly okay so I got a bit much in

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.809 
correctly okay so I got a bit much in
there<00:02:50.750> let's<00:02:51.230> not<00:02:51.500> place<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:51.980> down<00:02:52.099> a<00:02:52.310> new<00:02:52.549> tank

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
there let's not place it down a new tank

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.530 
there let's not place it down a new tank
all<00:02:53.090> right

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
all right

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.250 
all right
so<00:02:54.409> um<00:02:54.590> yeah<00:02:54.980> basically<00:02:55.639> that's<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:57.109> only

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
so um yeah basically that's the the only

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.020 
so um yeah basically that's the the only
thing<00:02:57.379> is<00:02:57.680> blocked<00:02:57.980> us<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.459> doesn't<00:02:58.790> require

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
thing is blocked us it doesn't require

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.270 
thing is blocked us it doesn't require
any<00:02:59.329> power<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.810> do<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.829> just<00:03:01.099> allows

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
any power to do it and it just allows

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.690 
any power to do it and it just allows
you<00:03:01.669> to<00:03:01.879> really<00:03:02.359> efficiently<00:03:03.200> route<00:03:03.769> liquids

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
you to really efficiently route liquids

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.860 
you to really efficiently route liquids
from<00:03:05.389> a<00:03:05.659> single<00:03:06.319> or<00:03:06.560> multiple<00:03:06.950> pipes<00:03:07.370> into<00:03:08.030> one

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
from a single or multiple pipes into one

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.129 
from a single or multiple pipes into one
or<00:03:09.079> more<00:03:09.139> other<00:03:09.680> pipes<00:03:10.269> well<00:03:11.269> based<00:03:11.599> on<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
or more other pipes well based on the

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.039 
or more other pipes well based on the
color<00:03:12.409> of<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.859> output<00:03:13.220> phase<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:14.209> yeah<00:03:14.780> that's

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
color of the output phase so yeah that's

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.899 
color of the output phase so yeah that's
it<00:03:15.200> for<00:03:15.439> this<00:03:15.530> spotlight<00:03:15.829> guys<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.519> hope<00:03:16.760> you
