 easy and good cooking I went to the super and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.090
 I found Japanese noodles but I do not know 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.780
 complicate I did not look for them put the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.480

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.809
 special for pasta 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.120
 manny who said a little worm when it happened 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.760
 on a bowl like that I already told you that 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.980
 he said since the freezer is he said 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.980
 plus an orgy of worms 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.860
 because he thought that learning 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.559
 That's what Paco Muñoz said, that's what Paco Muñoz says 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.140
 is already separated of course that you 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.630
 I got to know very well with water be a 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.509
 little bit salty this boiling water will 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.759
 I added the excellent cuisine and it's ready 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.679
 and when it came out nothing else I put a little bit 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.869
 oil so that all the 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.780
 pasta and it 's back we remember that the 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.270
 pasta that fed this frame polo no 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.600
 the Chinese to the Chinese that goodbye when 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.369
 it was pole frame the tragedy because of this the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.670
 Italians that out there are going to scream at 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.200
 someone who believe that neither the pasta nor 2 and 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.020
 tomatoes are from them so they are both 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.540
 sides here we have someone Italian 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.720
 where right now he put little faces and the reason 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.150
 of pepper I am using the pepper 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.220
 As the pasta goes, it seemed very 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.500
 good symmetry to have it julienne 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.750

 this water sales if you have a 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.750
 spoonful put half and half because the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.459
 flavor of white vinegar is much more 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.220
 strong than rice that has nothing 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.810
 what to see but good we go today to today 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.060

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:55.320
 our musician so that the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.090
 older than the mother of this 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:03.500

 lucky in this recipe and although the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.530
 young man to put half of the garlic because 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.690

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.490
 taste that the other one is what we are 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.520

 peanut butter exactly peanut butter that 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.870
 It is very good and an ingredient that 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.640
 love the truth and I like it very much 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.740
 Japanese food is ginger 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.390
 then that I already have my grater cited 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.550

 on the side of your radiator 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.640
 always cheese 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.370
 there you find it as when you go 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.380
 is lemon zest is taken a 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.030
 special touch because you have to start 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.520
 with the kids to eat things 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.330
 different one with a soup dedicated to 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.260
 them ok ok so you can put by 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.770
 favor bones and you're going to liquefy everything 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.270
 must liquefy two or like ok ok 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.950
 attention please that the 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.950
 supreme moment of the liquefied 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.880
 a living man always shines 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.880
 more and more 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.870
 and I'm going to use an ingredient that is 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.480
 terrific this tofu we can 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.430
 find is a tofu is not 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.620
 well because they give it the name that this 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.800
 but well that's the name we tell him 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.800
 says tofu and this is one of the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.270
 foods that people use a lot in 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.370
 the middle east for example people 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.830
 the Japanese ladies who use both 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.140
 soybean for example it has been discovered that 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.880
 they do not have that much breast cancer rate 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.790
 for example nor of matrix for example and 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.100
 I love I love the idea then and 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.470
 we use it very little in Mexico 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.720
 they do not really have a market because 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.760
 I have mine that is the one that brings one as 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.520
 if I did the least for menopause 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.930
 the best level the best there is 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.810
 I'm using the type that is firm 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.350
 there are several if it is firm and extra 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.070
 firm and one that is this extract about 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.070
 he said soft 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.810
 It does not taste like it does not taste 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.900
 absolutely nothing that's why I like it 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.480
 put it and it seems very good option 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.480
 give it to the kids and to something less than 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.480
 test it 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.480
 Thank you 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.080
 because it is very delicate but it is tasty 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.880
 chew it so stay and quit is not 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.419
 as if we are not going to lower the 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.419
 leaders or 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.570
 we are ready very well almost ready 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.430
 I could make this spaghetti pie that 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.850
 I also have here on my right hand that 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.230
 you can not miss it is spectacular 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.140
 It is a super option for kids 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.420
 now if we mix perfectly black 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.690
 add tofu added together I think 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.520
 a lady me too the lady is me 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.500
 super nutritious and they find it already in 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.960
 any super in the section of 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.270
 frozen is and I love the idea of 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.550
 that is already though even if the pod does not 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.160
 then it 's a shell we're ready 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.440
 very add tofu 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
 and he knows that I'm going to put it better as 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.790
 adornment because so do not leave me 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.770
 undo then come we serve 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.420
 here you can put whatever you want 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.980
 and lady can you put chicken you can 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.210

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.720
 little fish in pieces or you can put 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.720
 up tuna 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.730
 you 3 could say to the section of 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.490
 kitchen that if gives me so much sesame 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.789
 with armani 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.889
 sesame seeds in other places like that 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:59.090
 lying around 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:01.880
 I like the idea 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.160
 black sesame could look perfect 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.690
 we also have green because it turns out that 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.040
 we have the with holly of colors and about 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.870
 the country field is very fun to 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:14.380
 the chargers you met purple 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:18.330
 purple sesame 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.330
 and that can also wake up a lot 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.959
 the kids are not 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:26.729

 April 30 that nothing else arrive and eat 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.219
 that and they're going to love the butter 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.300
 Peanut gives it a spectacular taste 

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:35.069
 can be lost let's continue together 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.709
