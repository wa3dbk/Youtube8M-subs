00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.150 
keychain you want to grab a right above
the<00:02:26.450> last<00:02:26.690> bead<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.290> thread<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.590> on<00:02:27.830> and

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
the last bead that you thread it on and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.790 
the last bead that you thread it on and
bend<00:02:29.150> your<00:02:29.270> wire<00:02:29.510> straight<00:02:29.960> up<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> 90

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
bend your wire straight up to a 90

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.780 
bend your wire straight up to a 90
degree<00:02:31.070> angle<00:02:32.410> again<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.740> will<00:02:34.340> depend<00:02:34.490> on

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
degree angle again it will depend on

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.450 
degree angle again it will depend on
what<00:02:34.850> size<00:02:35.210> loop<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.690> want<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:37.130> where<00:02:37.280> you're

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
what size loop you want to where you're

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.960

fun and easy cheering now this keychain

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.750 
fun and easy cheering now this keychain
here<00:03:44.519> will<00:03:44.879> average<00:03:45.300> you<00:03:45.540> out<00:03:45.739> this<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.890> 10<00:03:47.129> 20

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
here will average you out this is 10 20

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.339 
here will average you out this is 10 20
30<00:03:48.030> 40<00:03:48.330> cent<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.970> complete<00:03:50.970> roll<00:03:51.599> of<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
30 40 cent a complete roll of the

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.920 
30 40 cent a complete roll of the
artistic<00:03:52.799> wire<00:03:53.190> in<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.640> non<00:03:53.819> tarnish<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.599> six

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
artistic wire in the non tarnish is six

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.140 
artistic wire in the non tarnish is six
dollars<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.280> you're<00:03:56.519> going<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.730> get<00:03:56.940> a

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
dollars and so you're going to get a

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.270 
dollars and so you're going to get a
whole<00:03:57.569> lot<00:03:57.959> out<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.379> role<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.010> would

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
whole lot out of that role so I would

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.430 
whole lot out of that role so I would
probably<00:03:59.400> say<00:03:59.760> maybe<00:04:00.000> you've<00:04:00.660> got<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> quarter

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
probably say maybe you've got a quarter

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.220 
probably say maybe you've got a quarter
in<00:04:01.620> your<00:04:01.799> wire<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.310> then<00:04:03.030> depending<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.170> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
in your wire and then depending on the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.960 
in your wire and then depending on the
size<00:04:04.349> keyring<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.310> get<00:04:05.549> you're<00:04:05.760> going<00:04:05.880> to

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
size keyring you get you're going to

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.839
