until they buy them one and so the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390 
until they buy them one and so the
matter<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.960> fact<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.560> since<00:01:20.159> they

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
matter of the fact is that since they

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.520 
matter of the fact is that since they
haven't<00:01:20.640> made<00:01:21.060> an<00:01:21.299> official<00:01:21.420> announcement<00:01:22.049> on

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
this um that release date might be a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.740 
this um that release date might be a
little<00:01:27.750> too<00:01:28.170> ambitious<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:29.009> them<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.750> might

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
little too ambitious for them and might

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.649 
little too ambitious for them and might
not<00:01:30.930> happen<00:01:31.170> part<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.369> hard<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:33.000> but

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
not happen part that's hard to know but

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.440 
not happen part that's hard to know but
i<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:34.229> put<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.680> at<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> pretty<00:01:35.280> high

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
i would put that at a pretty high

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
i would put that at a pretty high
probability<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.130> release

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
probability that that is the release

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.480 
probability that that is the release
date<00:01:39.259> but<00:01:40.259> don't<00:01:40.560> hold<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.220> because

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
date but don't hold me to it because

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.450 
date but don't hold me to it because
it's<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.850> official<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:43.229> next<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.130> price<00:01:44.610> and

there's<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:25.860> rumors<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.970> as<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.990> see

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
there's just rumors and as you can see

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.820 
there's just rumors and as you can see
in<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.890> picture<00:02:29.130> below<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:30.720> looks<00:02:31.140> kind<00:02:31.739> of

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
in the picture below it looks kind of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.320 
in the picture below it looks kind of
like<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.220> combination<00:02:32.760> between<00:02:33.590> an<00:02:34.590> ipad<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.910> a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
like a combination between an ipad and a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.770 
like a combination between an ipad and a
PS<00:02:36.660> Vita<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.790> was<00:02:39.030> one<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.420> more<00:02:39.600> out

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
PS Vita and that was one of the more out

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.410 
PS Vita and that was one of the more out
that<00:02:40.440> was<00:02:40.680> one<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.069> more<00:02:41.250> popular<00:02:41.520> um

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.520 

concepts<00:02:45.420> around<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.870> internet<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.410> so

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
concepts around the internet and so

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.580 
concepts around the internet and so
that's<00:02:46.709> why<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:46.980> picked<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.590> I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that's why I picked that one I I

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.500 
that's why I picked that one I I
honestly<00:02:50.519> don't<00:02:50.730> think<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.180> will<00:02:51.269> look<00:02:51.450> like

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
honestly don't think it will look like

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.750 
honestly don't think it will look like
that<00:02:51.930> when<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.350> buy<00:02:52.530> when<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.160> buy<00:02:53.280> one<00:02:53.730> if

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
that when you buy when you buy one if

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.540 
that when you buy when you buy one if
you<00:02:54.060> go<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.780> buy<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:56.130> i<00:02:58.040> think<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.100> that

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
you go and buy one but i think that that

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.020 
you go and buy one but i think that that
actually<00:03:00.110> captures<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.489> where<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.760> video

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
actually captures in where the video

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.410 
actually captures in where the video
game<00:03:03.360> industry<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:04.260> going<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.800> nutshell<00:03:05.420> uh

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
game industry is going in a nutshell uh

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.800 
game industry is going in a nutshell uh
I<00:03:07.140> think<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:09.500> images<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.830> new<00:03:11.459> X<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.330> xbox

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
I think the images of the new X the xbox

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.380 
I think the images of the new X the xbox
720<00:03:13.350> looked<00:03:13.920> kind<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.340> somewhere<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.060> and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
720 looked kind of somewhere to that and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.560 
720 looked kind of somewhere to that and
I<00:03:16.290> think<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.010> what<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.640> next<00:03:17.910> generation

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
I think this is what the next generation

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.920 
I think this is what the next generation
of<00:03:18.660> consoles<00:03:19.140> might<00:03:19.470> look<00:03:19.709> be<00:03:19.980> similar<00:03:20.519> to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
of consoles might look be similar to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.979 
of consoles might look be similar to
probably<00:03:21.930> not<00:03:22.079> look<00:03:22.440> exactly<00:03:22.590> like<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.280> and

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
probably not look exactly like that and

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.039 
probably not look exactly like that and
now<00:03:24.989> just<00:03:25.680> like<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.220> previous<00:03:26.630> PlayStation<00:03:27.630> 3

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
now just like the previous PlayStation 3

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.890 
now just like the previous PlayStation 3
the<00:03:28.650> PlayStation<00:03:29.370> 4<00:03:29.640> will<00:03:29.910> definitely<00:03:30.540> drop

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
the PlayStation 4 will definitely drop

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.410 
the PlayStation 4 will definitely drop
before<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.590> xbox<00:03:32.160> um<00:03:33.860> now<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.420> unless

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
before the xbox um now that unless

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.750 
before the xbox um now that unless
Microsoft<00:03:37.049> catches<00:03:37.530> Sony<00:03:37.799> by<00:03:38.010> surprise<00:03:38.459> you

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
Microsoft catches Sony by surprise you

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.050 
Microsoft catches Sony by surprise you
can<00:03:38.940> expect<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.900> happen<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.579> just<00:03:41.579> know

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
can expect that to happen so just know

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.620 
can expect that to happen so just know
if<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:43.620> see<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.130> playstation<00:03:44.790> 4<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.090> stores

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
if you see the playstation 4 and stores

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.960 
if you see the playstation 4 and stores
then<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.620> xbox<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.250> right<00:03:47.489> around<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.910> corner

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
then the xbox is right around the corner

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.210 
then the xbox is right around the corner
and<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.519> um<00:03:51.650> we<00:03:52.650> know<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:53.070> the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
and I think that um we know that the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.509 
and I think that um we know that the
same<00:03:53.489> company<00:03:54.060> who<00:03:54.660> made<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.079> chips<00:03:55.519> for

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
same company who made the chips for

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.550 
same company who made the chips for
PlayStation<00:03:57.209> before<00:03:57.630> will<00:03:57.989> be<00:03:58.140> doing<00:03:58.440> it

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
PlayStation before will be doing it

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.289 
PlayStation before will be doing it
again<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.420> so<00:04:00.440> it'll<00:04:01.440> be<00:04:01.730> it'll<00:04:02.730> probably<00:04:03.000> be

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
again and so it'll be it'll probably be

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.539 
again and so it'll be it'll probably be
upgraded<00:04:03.930> but<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.910> don't<00:04:05.910> know<00:04:06.090> for<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:08.519> most

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
upgraded but I don't know for the most

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.500 
upgraded but I don't know for the most
part<00:04:09.120> what<00:04:10.220> what<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.370> want<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:11.880> have<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:12.450> a

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
part what what we want it to have is a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.340 
part what what we want it to have is a
better<00:04:13.140> online<00:04:13.500> gaming<00:04:14.459> service<00:04:14.930> that's<00:04:15.930> what

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
better online gaming service that's what

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.279 
better online gaming service that's what
we<00:04:16.979> want<00:04:17.250> out<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.789> ps3<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.660> better<00:04:18.720> online

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
we want out of the ps3 is better online

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.730 
we want out of the ps3 is better online
game<00:04:19.880> now<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:21.299> think<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.109> great<00:04:22.409> that<00:04:22.470> it's

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
game now I think it's great that it's

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.050 
game now I think it's great that it's
free<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.580> hope<00:04:23.610> they<00:04:23.880> keep<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.539> aspect

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
free and I hope they keep that aspect

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.830 
free and I hope they keep that aspect
um<00:04:26.180> but<00:04:26.780> people<00:04:27.320> still<00:04:27.590> like<00:04:27.860> Xbox<00:04:28.430> Live<00:04:28.840> more

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
um but people still like Xbox Live more

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.420 
um but people still like Xbox Live more
even<00:04:30.320> though<00:04:30.380> they<00:04:30.530> have<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.889> pay<00:04:31.100> which<00:04:31.310> I

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
even though they have to pay which I

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.850 
even though they have to pay which I
don't<00:04:31.639> understand<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:33.200> think<00:04:33.530> that<00:04:33.830> that

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
don't understand and I think that that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.430 
don't understand and I think that that
was<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.430> one<00:04:34.639> main<00:04:34.910> drawback<00:04:35.480> to<00:04:35.510> PlayStation

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
was the one main drawback to PlayStation

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.480 
was the one main drawback to PlayStation
3<00:04:36.740> was<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:37.580> can<00:04:37.790> play<00:04:38.389> with<00:04:38.870> your<00:04:39.200> friends

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
3 was you can play with your friends

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.180 
3 was you can play with your friends
that<00:04:40.490> well<00:04:40.790> or<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.180> easily<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.169> if<00:04:42.980> they

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
that well or that easily and if they

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.070 
that well or that easily and if they
change<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.850> I<00:04:43.880> think<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.570> police<00:04:44.900> station

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
change that I think the police station

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.550 
change that I think the police station
for<00:04:45.560> will<00:04:45.800> be<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:45.980> huge<00:04:46.340> hit
