00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.030
 Talk to me, folks. 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.259
 of you in the last release video 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 bringing you now a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.640
 pc configuration of approximately 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.580
 two thousand and one hundred reais for editing and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.109
 Gameplay recording at a low cost 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.460
 Let's do a little different in this 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.210
 video here that is to be a little bit 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.210
 soon 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.390
 the processor was my big doubt 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:43.059
 I could opt for the fc 6 300 but in 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.340
 many cases the e3 is best for 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.440
 rendering even being a processor 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.750
 dual-core it works best in most 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.760
 programs for video editing by the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.360
 least in the tests that I saw them is the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.070
 best 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.230
 although he is from al-khor he has 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.699
 four says what will make it work 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.910
 like a quad core 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.530
 in the case of this model which is the i3 4150 it 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.250
 has a higher touch than the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.540
 others 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.660
 in this case it is 3.5 ghz the ttp is 54 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.600
 otis very low only he already 50 today in 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.830
 three mega cash and the price of it is 415 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.259
 real 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.130
 the motherboard I decided to leave the same as the 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.350
 previous video 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.050
 I always emotive leave this motherboard 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.000
 with excellent value for money she did not 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.070
 wanted to give up having a motherboard with 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.899
 this being that the price difference does not 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.789
 is too high, for example if people 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.009
 to put one of 85 that would be the 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.740
 most basic chipset we just 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.390
 save only 65 reais 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.619
 so keep betting on this 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.570
 mother h 97m plate 3 in the one gigabyte 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.430
 cool thing that crossfire support 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.920
 ex and sees with enough resources that are 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.840
 interesting of people having the price of it 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.270
 still have not had any changes 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.759
 which is three hundred and fifteen reais 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.159
 the configuration memory is for sure 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.840
 does not sell this most basic and 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.200
 corsican classic 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.869
 this kit here is selling $ 185 two air 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.420
 combs of 2010 will put two kits that 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.759
 in total of 8 gb of RAM that is the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.750
 enough to record m3 and you do not have 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.959
 no bottleneck 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.519
 hd and I found only where internal 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.010
 in the case of the previous video 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.760
 I had chosen a seagate hd of 2 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.410
 terabytes 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.480
 now we put this there a little 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.120
 in this case the gazette at a price of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.120
 200 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.370
 actual cabinet for the configuration I 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.900
 I put a deputy will be br 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.700
 the input cabinet that has a 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.739
 reasonable air flow put in 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.720
 setting more to have another 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.950
 alternative in the market but we know 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.269
 that the cabinet makes no difference 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.680
 in performance 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.900
 despite being a very important component 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.970
 important for us to keep a good 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.230
 cooling of internal components 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.690
 he is an office with a background 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.819
 very good you are seeing a 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.140
 example of cable management and can 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.480
 see that you can do a good planning 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.579
 very good in this office even though he 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.590
 be on the front panel 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.170
 account with usb 3.0 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.090
 but other if 2.0 and standard input 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.340
 audio the price I thought it was 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.040
 of seven teams five reais and we will 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.900
 wanju video card board was a 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.269
 another great doubt to make this 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.959
 video had the option of placing 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.970
 nvidia 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.819
 but I thought well and decided to put a 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.680
 network of r 7 240 people because I do not know if 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.750
 You remember but the motherboard goes 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.579
 support a pallium fire and how 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.440
 configuration is being made to whoever 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.420
 is not so high on the budget 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.400
 this model is an excellent option that 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.019
 will do very well in the current games 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.419
 we will be able to run the majority 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.910
 of games at least normal to 60 frames 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.010
 per second and if in the future you want 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.169
 put one more model and make a dual 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.480
 gpu you will be able to do since the 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.209
 motherboard supports and also the source you 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.519
 will see that it also supports the 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.510
 chosen is that in fact the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.019
 previous doubt 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.000
 is the pcr of 430 watts for those who have seen the 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.239
 last video this source although it is 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.209
 labeled with 430 otis power it 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.129
 was able to deliver more than 600 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.980
 stability 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.989
 and because the cost of it is greatly reduced 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.910
 It will be one of the most used here 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.579
 My Videos and does not like this track 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.260
 price in Brazil is the best 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.419
 source in my eyes 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.519
 so that's it we finished the video with 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.500
 approximately two thousand and one hundred reais 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.449
 I recommend this computer to anyone who wants 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.460
 start recording game place of course 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.949
 he will not be able to run the games with 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.260
 very good graphics but you'll already have 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.570
 a guarantee to at least send them 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.300
 a reduced chart and good rate of 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.280
 frames 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.930
 world, I thank everyone who is 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.759
 watching the video if you liked 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.440
 video by clicking joinha are favorites 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.440
 a hug and I went
