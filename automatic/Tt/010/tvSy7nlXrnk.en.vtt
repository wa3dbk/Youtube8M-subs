00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
thing that I I like about fragrances is

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:12.499 
thing that I I like about fragrances is
that<00:05:11.370> sometimes<00:05:11.699> you<00:05:11.819> can<00:05:11.940> layer<00:05:12.120> them<00:05:12.360> now

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
that sometimes you can layer them now

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.180 
that sometimes you can layer them now
they're<00:05:12.690> not<00:05:12.840> built<00:05:13.169> really<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:13.860> be<00:05:13.949> layered

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
they're not built really to be layered

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.279 
they're not built really to be layered
because<00:05:14.490> they're<00:05:14.669> individual<00:05:15.389> creations<00:05:16.080> but

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
because they're individual creations but

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.559 
because they're individual creations but
sometimes<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:17.279> can<00:05:17.430> pick<00:05:17.669> out<00:05:17.789> elements<00:05:18.300> that

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
sometimes you can pick out elements that

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.439 
sometimes you can pick out elements that
are<00:05:18.870> similar<00:05:19.529> so<00:05:20.039> there's<00:05:20.460> a<00:05:20.520> little<00:05:21.270> bit<00:05:21.419> of

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
are similar so there's a little bit of

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.180 
are similar so there's a little bit of
