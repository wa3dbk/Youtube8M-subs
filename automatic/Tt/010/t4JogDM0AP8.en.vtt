00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.479 
with a really weak kicker and he just
puts<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.540> much<00:00:33.600> pressure<00:00:33.950> and<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.070> stands<00:00:35.370> up

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
is he's actually playing pretty solid

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.500 
is he's actually playing pretty solid
and<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.100> think<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.489> playing<00:00:41.700> good<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.049 
and I think it's playing good I just I
guess<00:00:43.020> I'm<00:00:43.200> waiting<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:43.680> another<00:00:44.250> spot<00:00:44.610> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
guess I'm waiting for another spot a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.049 
guess I'm waiting for another spot a
better<00:00:45.719> spot<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.980> played<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> table

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
better spot have you played on the table

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.430 
better spot have you played on the table
with<00:00:48.180> him<00:00:48.329> before<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.660> noticed<00:00:48.960> he<00:00:49.170> was<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
with him before I noticed he was on a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
with him before I noticed he was on a
different<00:00:49.829> table<00:00:49.980> too<00:00:50.280> yesterday<00:00:50.579> yeah<00:00:51.570> yeah

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
different table too yesterday yeah yeah

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
different table too yesterday yeah yeah
I<00:00:51.899> barely<00:00:52.500> played<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.129> him<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.430> five

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I barely played with him like five

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
I barely played with him like five
minutes<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.629> they<00:00:54.780> yesterday<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.800> then

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
minutes and then they yesterday and then

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.369 
minutes and then they yesterday and then
they<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.520> instantly<00:00:57.000> moved<00:00:57.270> moved<00:00:57.750> me<00:00:57.989> table

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
they just instantly moved moved me table

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.209 
they just instantly moved moved me table
so<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.520> no<00:00:59.550> idea<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.300> plays<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.870> like

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
so I I have no idea we plays and like

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.310 
so I I have no idea we plays and like
today<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> figured<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> was<00:01:02.910> pretty<00:01:03.600> solid<00:01:04.049> like

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
today I figured it was pretty solid like

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230 
today I figured it was pretty solid like
I<00:01:04.470> thought<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> would<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.339> very<00:01:05.610> loose

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
I thought it would be like very loose

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.230 
I thought it would be like very loose
because<00:01:06.689> he<00:01:06.840> has<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.140> many<00:01:07.260> many<00:01:07.619> chips<00:01:07.920> place

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
because he has so many many chips place

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.640 
because he has so many many chips place
he's<00:01:09.240> good<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.720> he's<00:01:10.320> been<00:01:10.500> pretty

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
he's good I think he's been pretty

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.320 
he's good I think he's been pretty
aggressive<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.280> thinking<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> previous

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
aggressive I thinking like the previous

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.740 
aggressive I thinking like the previous
days<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:14.310> very<00:01:14.640> aggressive<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.210> think<00:01:15.659> he

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
days but is very aggressive I think he

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.020 
days but is very aggressive I think he
ran<00:01:15.960> good<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.470> people<00:01:17.280> didn't<00:01:17.610> believe<00:01:17.700> him

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
ran good and people didn't believe him

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.880 
ran good and people didn't believe him
but<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.659> tell<00:01:18.990> us<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.259> yesterday<00:01:19.710> because
