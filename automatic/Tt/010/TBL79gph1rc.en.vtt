00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.970
 Hi, I'm nervous and me 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.029
 Imagine my tarnished one was before 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:20.270
 I'm thrilled so once only times 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:22.310
 My peace has a good 270 here 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.280
 call weight 10 to 50 grams 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.660
 that's not true anymore because it is 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.520
 But not at all so of disadvantage is 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.159
 the tip has broken off as a result 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.329
 you can do a bit harder action 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:40.280
 Of course you are also really good 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.679
 fish in there so larger fish you can 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.069
 you not throw this I think 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:49.899
 from aldi or so no idea but also 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:55.309
 If I can then I have one here 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:57.670
 router it so you can see here that the costly 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:03.859
 So from shakespeare 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:10.480
 the cosmos last 180 so longer than 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:14.990
 80 and throw weight 5 to 25 grams 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.870
 with the dm control so one ins 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.170
 roll 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:25.760
 yes I can just turn then I have 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.660
 Also a route from all I already know 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.130
 have quite a long time though 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:36.620
 maybe with a bigger role 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:39.130
 from the abu basir the cardinal too 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.180
 quite well 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:47.180
 Well, these routes length of 42 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.460
 Here again I have red from 240 this 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.410
 but exor idea is already 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:59.350
 quite old as it is also the kpn of drm 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:02.890
 then I have one more here 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.890
 pretty old role 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:15.140
 it is the 2009 biomass that recognizes 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.600
 Shimano definitely have it up here 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.920
 take a little time once more 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.310
 a role 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.760
 but still a pretty old one then here 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.830
 such a piece of copper just up to 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.959
 thing with a connection to shopping 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:38.000
 then today pictures and so on 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.730
 here my little other box yes I know 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.150
 who will tell you then at the beginning 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:54.830
 Here are many different types of knives 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:56.750
 is it better that knife belongs to me 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.010
 he is still quite often 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:11.920
 at the top then after the death lepper 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:18.560
 yes clearly here then a lot here 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:22.000
 rubber stinkst albums so so above with 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.140
 cement run with the spindle then 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.459
 he makes to move in the water and 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:33.579
 that genetic error corp did that 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:36.019
 I like to fall down so once 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.320
 your computer 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:42.829
 He's doing pretty well with me now 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.620
 to a drier of drm also on 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:50.989
 A rather old yes to a bit 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.610
 broken here it does not look that there 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:58.560
 you do not 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:00.360
 basketball and that was easier too 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.860
 most of the time, solving is the way to do it 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.640
 a pincers because of the advantage 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.830
 you can do the granden with it 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.980
 probably only short not crack 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.620
 but cut and lie 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.459
 in which one can be nice at 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.720
 you can do that with everyone like that 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.820
 neck crack the most of the crack 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:27.680
 institute just so crisp through 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.680
 that's it really good
