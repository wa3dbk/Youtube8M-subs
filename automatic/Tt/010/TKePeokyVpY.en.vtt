when<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.000> buy<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.800> trying<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.859> think<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
when you buy like trying to think of

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.990 
when you buy like trying to think of
another<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> camera

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
another like a camera

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.209 
another like a camera
they<00:00:30.570> usually<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.900> these<00:00:31.109> bits<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.800> plastic

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
they usually have these bits of plastic

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.459 
they usually have these bits of plastic
that<00:00:32.399> cover<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> display

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
that cover the display

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.430 
that cover the display
we're<00:00:34.890> looking<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.160> two<00:00:36.140> triple<00:00:37.140> a's<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
we're looking at two triple a's in the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
we're looking at two triple a's in the
back<00:00:38.329> anyway

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
back anyway

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.330 
back anyway
so<00:00:40.110> let's<00:00:40.290> take<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> look<00:00:40.620> at<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.219> this

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
so let's take a look at what what this

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.860 
so let's take a look at what what this
actually<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:42.860> what<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> find<00:00:44.250> confusing<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
actually is what I find confusing if you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750 
actually is what I find confusing if you
look<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.559> without<00:00:47.010> even<00:00:47.250> turning<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.700> on

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
look at it without even turning it on

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.660 
look at it without even turning it on
that<00:00:48.000> looks<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> Tetris<00:00:48.899> game<00:00:48.989> doesn't<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
that looks like a Tetris game doesn't it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.090 
that looks like a Tetris game doesn't it
yeah<00:00:50.930> you<00:00:51.930> save<00:00:52.140> some<00:00:52.320> weight<00:00:52.440> anyway<00:00:52.710> so

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
yeah you save some weight anyway so

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.180 
yeah you save some weight anyway so
let's<00:00:53.489> fire<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.859> stuff

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
let's fire it up and we have some stuff

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.790 
let's fire it up and we have some stuff
there<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.870> soundtrack<00:01:01.260> plays<00:01:01.440> backwards

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
there and a soundtrack plays backwards

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
there and a soundtrack plays backwards
so<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> essentially<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
so you can see it essentially what this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.480 
so you can see it essentially what this
is<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.729> a<00:01:05.840> mmm<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.110> best<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.590> figure<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.100> we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
is is a mmm the best I can figure out we

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.060 
is is a mmm the best I can figure out we
have<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> multi<00:01:09.210> game<00:01:09.920> device<00:01:12.619> this<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.680> showing

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
have a multi game device this is showing

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.230 
have a multi game device this is showing
you<00:01:14.310> Game<00:01:14.640> one

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
alright and that appears to be a shmup

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
alright and that appears to be a shmup
kind<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.439> thing<00:01:19.619> how<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.729> switch<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
kind of thing how do we switch to the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.740 
kind of thing how do we switch to the
next<00:01:21.330> game<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.119> arrow<00:01:24.299> keys<00:01:24.570> are

guess you see on top abcdefgh edgy this

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.819 
guess you see on top abcdefgh edgy this
is<00:01:49.439> clearly<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> Tetris<00:01:50.430> board<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.869> when

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
is clearly like a Tetris board but when

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.380 
is clearly like a Tetris board but when
I<00:01:52.860> was<00:01:53.070> playing<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.549> earlier<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.149> could

different games on on on a little

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.530 
different games on on on a little
primitive<00:05:31.700> device<00:05:32.240> and<00:05:34.090> it's<00:05:35.090> an<00:05:35.150> example<00:05:35.390> of

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
primitive device and it's an example of

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.030 
primitive device and it's an example of
something<00:05:35.750> trying<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.110> be<00:05:36.200> everything<00:05:36.470> and

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
something trying to be everything and
