00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.500
 modern operating system such 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.279
 as you know, you can of course 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.279
 information 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:48.579
 save what the weather we have so far it's all 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.059
 they're just like on for english 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.440
 language 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.089
 but windows 10 but somehow surpassed everything 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.129
 existing operating systems 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.109
 the amount of information that they 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.969
 collected and sent to the company itself 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.769
 let's start with what's going on there 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.199
 absolutely the entire keyboard fleet and 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.720
 sends the camera company than it 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.780
 done at a fairly low level then 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.780
 there is 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.670
 rations the system is just all the buttons 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.479
 which you clicked send us where it is 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.770
 really 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:28.420
 time the network gets really love 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.710
 so I am concerned about the deputies 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.200
 State Duma in the general sense 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.479
 will not affect and microsoft she answers 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.119
 and we have it all voluntarily 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.770
 go not to include these functions so well at 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.729
 default date they are all included 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.350
 but that means there are a number of things 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.350
 which may be a deputy to protecsol 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.200
 who said these words does not understand 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.710
 the fact is that in order for us to 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.240
 country 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.039
 used any such operating 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.690
 system she must have a certificate 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.360
 who serves her frisbee 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.229
 so about the certificate it concerns there 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.479
 encryption system and other things means here 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.220
 of all such why special services should 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.190
 have access 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.470
 so of course this operating 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.819
 see the system of the year she decides she can 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.439
 use in 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.230
 state and power the Russians are not there 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:23.240
 used anywhere using knoweth 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.670
 to windows basically what could it be 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.540
 they are used salina but generally speaking 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.540
 means 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.090
 microsoft last ten years there 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.500
 pretty much experimented with 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.020
 operating system experiment 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.370
 we will take this away so when came out 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.190
 for example windows vista 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.470
 then nobody on them all continued 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.780
 sit or xp sell saddle now until 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.800
 pretty long flow the year before 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.090
 main miscalculation 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.010
 it means everyone climbed on windows and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.560
 how much a successful system should have been 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.020
 simply 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.090
 I think any special cutters will be 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.090
 stay because 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.140
 quite again 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.660
 Here I take what it will be lunch 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.730
 This computer is all good but unfortunately 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.020
 Apple has no solutions for 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.480
 corporate systems and 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.380
 mike once with windows you can them there 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.700
 accompanying no program 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.470
 all cities 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.180
 you can automate work 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.120
 businesses there is a network of 500 or 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.190
 1000 computer and it will all be together 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.640
 work handing out the right did not get by 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.640
 us here 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.650
 if paper can quickly by this its 1st 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.819
 better your desktop means 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.819
 and it will all be 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.860
 I want to take now 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.950
 and therefore 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.950
 that sense and 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.500
 there are no government ideas there are two 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.990
 big networks anyway 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.000
 use in offices because man 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.620
 there which pier she doesn't work at 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.370
 journalist he will certainly sit 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.370
 we accumulate 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.310
 Now I think microsoft of course 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:28.849
 hurried a little looking over that 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.849
 what is personal information here i think
