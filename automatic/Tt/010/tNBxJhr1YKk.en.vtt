3101<00:00:19.710> 5<00:00:20.359> Emerald<00:00:21.359> Express<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:22.260> 56<00:00:22.859> pieces

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
3101 5 Emerald Express it's 56 pieces

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.200 
3101 5 Emerald Express it's 56 pieces
this<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> first<00:00:25.320> field<00:00:25.849> it's<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> three<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
this is the first field it's a three and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.050 
this is the first field it's a three and
one<00:00:27.619> this<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> second<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.609> that's<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
one this is a second and that's the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:46.940 
one this is a second and that's the
third<00:00:30.269> actually<00:00:31.260> that's<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> second<00:00:45.950> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
third actually that's the second the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.040 
third actually that's the second the
bottom<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.879> get<00:00:54.059> three<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.480> them<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
bottom so if you get three of them you

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.819 
bottom so if you get three of them you
can<00:00:55.199> construct<00:00:55.789> this<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.300> entire<00:00:57.829> three

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
can construct this the entire three

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.790 
can construct this the entire three
parts<00:00:59.160> all<00:00:59.969> right<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> let's<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.559> over<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
parts all right so let's go over the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.009 
parts all right so let's go over the
instruction<00:01:02.309> book<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.809> little

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
instruction book it's this little

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.190 
instruction book it's this little
instruction<00:01:04.530> book<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.489> first<00:01:05.729> build<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
instruction book the first build and it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.899 
instruction book the first build and it
is<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.850> train<00:01:08.850> engine<00:01:09.920> second<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
is the train engine second is this and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450 
is the train engine second is this and
the<00:01:12.150> third<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.250> build

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the third is that so they have you build

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.130 
the third is that so they have you build
the<00:01:14.549> end<00:01:14.729> before<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.360> case<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.750> only<00:01:15.840> get

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the end before that in case you only get

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.499 
the end before that in case you only get
twos<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.619> stuff<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.400> an<00:01:17.520> end<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> arm

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
twos and stuff you have an end and arm

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:32.969 
twos and stuff you have an end and arm
in<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> screen<00:01:19.110> available<00:01:20.060> new<00:01:21.060> sets

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.679 

another<00:01:33.759> three<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.329> one<00:01:34.539> lego<00:01:34.840> creator<00:01:35.140> said

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
another three in one lego creator said

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.830 
another three in one lego creator said
alright<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.700> here<00:01:40.030> is<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.420> Emerald<00:01:40.750> Express

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840

alright so here is the Emerald Express
I've<00:01:41.829> done<00:01:42.100> all<00:01:42.250> three<00:01:42.520> bits<00:01:42.789> and<00:01:43.179> I'll<00:01:44.140> just

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
I've done all three bits and I'll just

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.389 
I've done all three bits and I'll just
go<00:01:44.439> over<00:01:44.469> one<00:01:44.799> by<00:01:44.950> one

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
go over one by one

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.499 
go over one by one
here's<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.240> engine<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.299> nicest

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
here's the engine this is the nicest

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.639 
here's the engine this is the nicest
looking<00:01:49.869> part<00:01:50.319> in<00:01:50.710> my<00:01:51.039> opinion<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:53.229> rolls<00:01:53.530> very

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
looking part in my opinion it rolls very

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.630 
looking part in my opinion it rolls very
very<00:01:54.310> nicely<00:01:55.049> new<00:01:56.049> surface<00:01:56.469> has<00:01:57.159> window

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
very nicely new surface has window

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.569 
very nicely new surface has window

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
this says a coal engine front they

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.640 
this says a coal engine front they
really<00:02:11.380> got<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.680> look<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.480> Train<00:02:13.650> down

front and the dark emerald look each
section<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.209> clipped<00:02:28.480> by<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> ball<00:02:29.470> joint<00:02:29.739> and

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
section is clipped by a ball joint and

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.319 
section is clipped by a ball joint and
it<00:02:31.299> will<00:02:31.510> trail<00:02:32.519> easily<00:02:33.519> with<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
it will trail easily with that on the

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.150 
it will trail easily with that on the
front<00:02:34.569> number<00:02:34.690> two<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.090> is

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
front number two so here it is

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.250 
front number two so here it is
but<00:02:39.160> passenger<00:02:39.850> cart<00:02:40.739> store<00:02:41.739> wheels<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.310> this

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
but passenger cart store wheels on this

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.379 
but passenger cart store wheels on this
it<00:02:44.260> has<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.560> receiving<00:02:45.100> end<00:02:45.280> here<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.910> the

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
it has the receiving end here and the

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:51.330 
it has the receiving end here and the
ball<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.709> side<00:02:48.060> smooth<00:02:49.060> top<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.950> angle

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
ball on this side smooth top that angle

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.050 
ball on this side smooth top that angle
and<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.579> angle<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.569> can<00:02:52.600> see<00:02:53.019> we're

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and that angle and you can see we're

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:03.300 
and that angle and you can see we're
clear<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.090> through<00:02:55.450> it

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.949 

there<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.489> this<00:03:04.760> inside<00:03:05.239> on<00:03:05.480> what<00:03:05.840> it's

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
there is this inside on what it's

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.949 
there is this inside on what it's
supposed<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.349> be<00:03:07.330> but<00:03:08.330> it's<00:03:08.450> yellow

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.130

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
part number Q and for the caboose it's

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.559 
part number Q and for the caboose it's
really<00:03:22.090> really<00:03:23.090> nice

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569
