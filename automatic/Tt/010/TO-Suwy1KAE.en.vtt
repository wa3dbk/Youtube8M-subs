little<00:03:05.670> Evo<00:03:06.060> bottom<00:03:06.600> here<00:03:06.720> we'll<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:06.930> kind

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
little Evo bottom here we'll just kind

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.620 
little Evo bottom here we'll just kind
of<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.950> loosen<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.459> up<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.700> little<00:03:08.790> bit<00:03:09.000> guys

good so you can spread it on buns there
so<00:03:12.569> little<00:03:12.900> lemon<00:03:13.200> zest<00:03:13.760> dip<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.150> hot<00:03:15.450> in

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
so little lemon zest dip in that hot in

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.140 
so little lemon zest dip in that hot in
here<00:03:16.290> -<00:03:16.500> um<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:17.130> don't<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.430> know<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.549> quest<00:03:17.910> after

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
here - um I don't you know I quest after

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.390 
here - um I don't you know I quest after
I<00:03:18.389> get<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.780> feta<00:03:19.319> on<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.889> bottom<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
I get the the feta on the bottom of the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.250 
I get the the feta on the bottom of the
bun<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.670> kind<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.910> smashed<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.510> batch<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.139> there

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
bun I kind of smashed the batch in there

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.110 
bun I kind of smashed the batch in there
it<00:03:22.350> kind<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.530> acts<00:03:22.680> as<00:03:22.829> glue<00:03:23.040> gotcha

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
it kind of acts as glue gotcha

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.400 
it kind of acts as glue gotcha
otherwise<00:03:24.569> they're<00:03:24.780> falling<00:03:25.049> off<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.380> put

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
otherwise they're falling off and I put

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.870 
otherwise they're falling off and I put
them<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.799> bottom<00:03:26.010> because<00:03:26.370> if<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:26.609> pick
