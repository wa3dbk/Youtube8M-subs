setting<00:00:54.149> powder<00:00:55.160> one<00:00:56.160> thing<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
setting powder one thing that is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.930 
setting powder one thing that is
different<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.559> compared<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.520> banana

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
different on this compared to the banana

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.910 
different on this compared to the banana
powder<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:02.100> fact<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.789> has<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> sifter

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
powder is the fact that it has a sifter

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.929 
powder is the fact that it has a sifter
inside<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.439> it's<00:01:07.460> more<00:01:08.460> convenient

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
inside of it and it's more convenient

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.410 
inside of it and it's more convenient
and<00:01:09.270> easier<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:10.400> just<00:01:11.400> stick<00:01:11.790> either<00:01:12.090> your

and easier to just stick either your
sponge<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.229> brush<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.490> apply<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
sponge or your brush and then apply it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.170 
sponge or your brush and then apply it
to<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.150> face<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.250> sifter<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.030> it

to your face this it has a sifter on it
but<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.350> dip<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.560> brush

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.880 
but it's not like you can dip your brush
or<00:01:20.369> your<00:01:20.850> sponge<00:01:21.470> that's<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.890> con<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.700 

it's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.450> luxury<00:01:34.110> powder<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.720> this<00:01:36.720> powder<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it's a luxury powder and this powder is

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.380 
it's a luxury powder and this powder is
not<00:01:37.950> meant<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:39.020> everyone<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:41.759> are<00:01:42.060> more

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
not meant for everyone if you are more

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.620 
not meant for everyone if you are more
on<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:43.070> deeper<00:01:44.070> skin<00:01:44.340> tone<00:01:44.610> side<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.420> might

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
on the deeper skin tone side you might

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.630 
on the deeper skin tone side you might
want<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> use<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> toe<00:01:46.829> pads<00:01:47.159> or<00:01:47.610> something

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
want to use like a toe pads or something

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.929 
want to use like a toe pads or something
like<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:50.280> come<00:01:50.490> off<00:01:50.670> very

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
like that because this can come off very

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.649 
like that because this can come off very
chalky

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
chalky

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.649 
chalky
now<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.320> graftobian<00:01:54.100> powder<00:01:54.909> I'm<00:01:55.210> not<00:01:55.390> sure

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
now the graftobian powder I'm not sure

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.330 
now the graftobian powder I'm not sure
how<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:55.990> would<00:01:56.200> be<00:01:56.380> more<00:01:56.590> deeper<00:01:56.920> skin<00:01:57.100> tones

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
how it would be more deeper skin tones

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.789 
how it would be more deeper skin tones
but<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.579> think<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:57.939> would<00:01:58.030> be<00:01:58.180> fine<00:01:58.479> because

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
but I think it would be fine because

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.109 
but I think it would be fine because
this<00:01:59.799> is<00:02:00.189> so<00:02:00.520> finely<00:02:01.390> milled<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:03.130> blends<00:02:03.549> in<00:02:03.789> so

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
this is so finely milled it blends in so

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.760 
this is so finely milled it blends in so
well<00:02:04.149> when<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.869> wipe<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.259> away

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
well when you wipe it away

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.430 
well when you wipe it away
it<00:02:06.039> almost<00:02:06.329> transforms<00:02:07.329> into<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.960> color<00:02:08.229> you

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
it almost transforms into the color you

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.859 
it almost transforms into the color you
applied<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.090> doesn't<00:02:10.450> come<00:02:10.630> off

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
applied it to so it doesn't come off

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.820 
applied it to so it doesn't come off
very<00:02:11.459> chalky<00:02:12.459> one<00:02:12.880> thing<00:02:13.170> with<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.440> banana

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
very chalky one thing with the banana

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.610 
very chalky one thing with the banana
powder<00:02:15.160> when<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.580> would<00:02:15.880> use<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.450> under<00:02:17.170> my<00:02:17.380> eye

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
powder when I would use it under my eye

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.009 
powder when I would use it under my eye
it<00:02:18.160> almost<00:02:18.430> seems<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.150> dries<00:02:19.599> out

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
it almost seems like it dries out

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:20.880 
it almost seems like it dries out
