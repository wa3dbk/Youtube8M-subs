00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:17.520
 guests dear friends me just 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.680
 say about cons 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.780
 that I personally like what I can not 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.990
 get used to 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:30.960
 here in Canada well minuses 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.850
 pronounced is the cost of services 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 which is here above all 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.030
 cost of services for electronic equipment i 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.520
 will bring on 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.520
 for services for electronic services on 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.180
 internet on cellular they are 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.930
 really three times higher than what it was 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.630
 on Russian territory 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:02.579
 then I can blame the climate 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:08.660
 in the sense that I personally would like 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:14.759
 so that it would be warmer further I would like 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:18.229
 if there was my will, I would like to 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.490
 she had a ray of the road because the roads were for 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.069
 country growth as canada 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.140
 I think it's terrible, well, you yourself, when 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.670
 see my videos you see what quality 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 pavement let's say we are now 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.450
 we are going to Montreal and you can also see 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.840
 what is monreale here 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.780
 the second second largest in size there 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.170
 by investment by development of the city 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.090
 Canada 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:49.130
 the road to say the least does not shine what else 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:54.020
 what else what else what else is here 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:02:01.580
 pretty high taxes even taxes 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:05.560
 higher than technology taxes in the us 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:11.450
 don't like again when compared to 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.120
 the fact that there is a usa cost of gasoline 10 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.830
 percent 30 more expensive than usa if 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.750
 us she said the cost of gasoline 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.989
 approximately equal to the dollar, even 90 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:33.640
 something cents then act out of gasoline 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:37.870
 exceeds with yes there will be 100 dollar 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.360
 20 dollar 30 and actually it's pretty 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.120
 expensive 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:50.200
 what else I don't like what I can 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:52.180
 say as a disadvantage well i'm on my own 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:58.470
 a man who is pretty active and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.030
 quick decision making in lifestyle and 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.480
 probably if I want to find fault 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.459
 to here bureaucracy systems so on 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.840
 people worked for a living because people 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.840
 in fact here is not very 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.740
 hurry somewhere life is very measured 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.110
 life is very calm and usually people 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.540
 don't bother your head 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.350
 in work there in some fast mode in 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.180
 center 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:33.370
 and what else what else what else in 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.710
 as flaws, I can say that 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.130
 since i'm used to certain 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.830
 brand that is sold in Russia and in 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.410
 food and clothing I would like 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.180
 so that these brands were represented either 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.110
 were generally represented on the territory 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.730
 Canada either represented more 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:58.440
 quantity more because 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:04.180
 I can really say that here 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:06.400
 European brands are very few here on 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.370
 my opinion of people is completely different 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.489
 sense of taste and sense of style than there is in 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.000
 Europe for me is largely alien and 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.350
 I do not like it and I would like to 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.409
 follow and maintain 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:25.229
 European fashion in clothes in style 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:29.100
 what else can I say as 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:32.900
 claims side canada 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.000
 and you don't even know about everything 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.690
 cons that come to me I'm 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.750
 said 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.750
 and 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.950
 Not on this, I say goodbye 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.990
 if you have any questions 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.040
 I will answer with pleasure 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.040
 goodbye
