00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.360
 we are convinced we need to win 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.280
 that we want to fight the championship up 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.959
 the end so it's a classic and the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 classic you have to win these games 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.760
 classics you have to win them beyond 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.650
 playing badly or winning them well and I think 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.630
 that is what is important, I hope we have 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.660
 a result of how fine it is going 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.490
 agree when you pite the end and knowing 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.830
 that the decisions we made were 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.619
 successful that within the areas the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.440
 disciplinary sanctions were fair and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.440
 then with only that I get tired 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.750
 without side without wealth and this yellow 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.970
 before starting the game saved 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.040
 when the game that distinguishes 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.410
 between the two guys that is prohibited 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.300
 and good sanctions to put yellow 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.300
 to capital and good serious teachers 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 was what happened came with a pet the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.050
 carlos team got two pets 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.210
 in quotes when that happens is 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.820
 yellow regulator for capital 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.170
 of the team playing the team that is 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.940
 local where the hand is after nine 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 instants if this happens in the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.380
 gasometer with a lot of public in the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.969
 classic in front of mouth 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.439
 the first protest of pinche that already 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.159
 I was badly predisposed by that 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.289
 admonition 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.390
 and all the san lorenzo that erased them 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.119
 literally the field went to mouth the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.829
 first time the belt ratio 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.750
 against the two central mouth- strap 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.509
 it broke the relationship told you the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.670
 notoriously exuberant strap difference 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.679
 with the two central It reminded me 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.810
 Orteguita when it had the streak 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.630
 and the loser and it looked like they were playing two 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.729
 different speeds sun models in 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.709
 voice tones that appeared or painted 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.340
 when at two different speeds but 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.090
 very many of san lorenzo deleted it from the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.069
 court 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.239
 to such a point that many many 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.149
 called attention was established about 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:05.689
 Kahneman that he ends up saving the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.329
 Orion stick again broke the 22 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.000
 we broke it is true it said line 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.650
 in the beginning this be pity no hand of 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.420
 boiled meet once there is nothing that is not 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.640
 discusses clear criminal 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.950
 Delfino receives it from Bahía Destiny 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.480
 they would account van gave the feeling that 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.310
 the goal goes at any time not for 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.280
 played by what san lorenzo demonstrated 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.830
 and this one to the criminal who 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.660
 but could not have given me lounge alone 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.830
 the possibility of opening the marker and 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.740
 play quieter though oriol 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.140
 guess very well the intention and the tahá 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.000
 to the pipí romagnoli that wants to die the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.530
 shot because two or three alternatives two 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.910
 or three very clear possibilities 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.910
 naturally this is one of them 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.939
 asks him to let him guess Orion but 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.120
 let's say that to see I think that own 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.450
 mouth coach at the end said the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.900
 true that if we had tied 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.819
 we would be in front of a stage 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.940
 completely said 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.260
 this because mouth was little and nothing 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.540
 this is the only mouth of the first 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.970
 time in fact snatches from gigliotti to 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.000
 Torrico center also played well 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.909
 did not get many but the times that 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.590
 had to answer I do not know for sure 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:22.790
 one can understand mitigating because 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.209
 it's a goal from leash he had the mastery of 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.870
 belt with the domain made the range of 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.260
 drug 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.109
 along with a good piatti move, let's say 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.579
 this capillary control towards the 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.829
 complete with extremes and in that 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.389
 difference that there was in the institute its 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.829
 front between belt and the central 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.470
 mouth particularly in the heads-up 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.770
 with the letter of the day was centered 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.170
 quite the explanation of why one 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.090
 this juice what played and could to right 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:58.320
 so he ended up suffering from more san lorenzo 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:11.860
 I had nothing to do with that controversy 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:15.330
 face out of the area is finishing the 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.330
 booties broke it 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.769
 these others plays that now for the 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.540
 sector 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.610
 We have talked to hunt a 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.160
 on the slope to make goals even 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.730
 generating siege situations returned 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.730
 to your goal scorer 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.520
 he had mouth in the last matches 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.650
 is having few goal situations 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.080
 but the ones you have are shortcuts 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.820
 providential of the archers is not that 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.020
 it gets to little for the times that you 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.020
 come here you have 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.040
 this move 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.740
 or medium carbon containment field that 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.740
 did not contain eye criminals looms 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.930
 that's why shanties 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.919
 excellent mouth visitors 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.639
 the two were chiqui pérez tierra el 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.590
 first criminal in his career in his career 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.590
 how many rich wind 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:40.020
 If it seems to me they worked very well 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.940
 the 4 penal pear trees left the date 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.940
 2005 record 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.560
 let's say archers how figures triumph 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.880
 about him he stressed his value by the way 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.990
 which is partly the same there are many 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.990
 field invasion 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.750
 really 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.979
 we wish a good time I had the bad 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.289
 Really good luck but I think that the 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.610
 team was much superior to mouth in 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.610
 all sense in 90 minutes 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.810
 if you think that mouth has a chance 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.130
 I have to change many bass if I 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.180
 can promise something to these people that 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.310
 is in tutoring and so much has 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.599
 committed to this team that follows 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.099
 supporting that we are not going to 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.570
 treat the week you said it was not a 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:34.440
 obligation now is an obligation 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.870
 against him 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.330
 I do not like the word obligation 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.090
 We are 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.819
 here because we like we know what 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.189
 we represent we are responsible 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:50.330
 we work hard to get the 

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:50.330
 things but obligations 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.669
 in football there is a team that plays in the 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.680
 who plays better will keep much more 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:04.080
 the ball as if it would be the first time 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.550
 in the second time the get the 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.110
 we manage much more we could 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.500
 to have reached the tie we did not achieve it 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:13.550
 but deep down it's a logical victory 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.710
 of classrooms we do not just have a group 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.180
 fernando has a lot of roman football has 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.250
 a lot of soccer are characteristics 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.430
 different from the players who played 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:25.100
 today, but we're not going to regret 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:29.380
 when we have the problems I all 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.380
 try to get solutions
