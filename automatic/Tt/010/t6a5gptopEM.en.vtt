00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and it's going to kind of leave this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
and it's going to kind of leave this
like<00:01:15.180> little<00:01:15.330> loop<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.650> little

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
like little loop right here that little

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.550 
like little loop right here that little
loop<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:17.700> give<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.060> access<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.900> pushing
