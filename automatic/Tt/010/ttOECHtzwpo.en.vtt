as<00:00:50.219> far<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.550> lowering<00:00:50.820> temperatures<00:00:51.180> except

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
as far as lowering temperatures except

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.869 
as far as lowering temperatures except
at<00:00:51.809> night<00:00:51.949> we<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> secondary<00:00:53.610> cold

front<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.270> see<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.660> right<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:54.870> not<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
front you can see that right here not a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.930 
front you can see that right here not a
lot<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.860> moisture<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.789> do<00:00:56.910> think

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
lot of moisture with it but we do think

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.490 
lot of moisture with it but we do think
there's<00:00:57.239> gonna<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.449> enough<00:00:57.660> lift<00:00:57.960> ahead<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
there's gonna be enough lift ahead of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.439 
there's gonna be enough lift ahead of
the<00:00:58.559> cold<00:00:58.710> front<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.850> few<00:01:00.149> rain<00:01:00.420> showers

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the cold front that a few rain showers

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.439 
the cold front that a few rain showers
at<00:01:01.050> first<00:01:01.520> will<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.640> squeezed<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.329> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
at first will be squeezed out with this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
at first will be squeezed out with this
front<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.019> moves<00:01:04.199> southeast<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
front as it moves southeast here and you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.440 
front as it moves southeast here and you
can<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> south<00:01:05.610> eastern<00:01:05.939> fringe<00:01:06.210> here

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
can see on the south eastern fringe here

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.020 
can see on the south eastern fringe here
some<00:01:07.409> light<00:01:07.590> rain<00:01:07.770> showers<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
some light rain showers there and as it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
some light rain showers there and as it
moves<00:01:09.270> through<00:01:09.390> those<00:01:10.350> rain<00:01:10.680> showers<00:01:10.710> change

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
moves through those rain showers change

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
moves through those rain showers change
over<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> snow<00:01:11.610> showers<00:01:12.150> before<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.600> end<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
over to snow showers before they end so

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
over to snow showers before they end so
you<00:01:13.080> could<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.490> an<00:01:14.640> inch<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:15.000> snow

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you could see up to an inch of snow

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
you could see up to an inch of snow
anywhere<00:01:15.780> northwest<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> Philadelphia

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
anywhere northwest of the Philadelphia

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.300 
anywhere northwest of the Philadelphia
metro<00:01:17.430> area<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.310> accumulations

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
metro area I think these accumulations

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.890 
metro area I think these accumulations
here<00:01:20.460> probably<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.150> mostly

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
here probably going to be mostly

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.870 
here probably going to be mostly
coatings<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> half<00:01:23.040> pension<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.670> most

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
places at the tail end of this front as

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.730 
places at the tail end of this front as
it<00:01:26.610> moves<00:01:26.790> through<00:01:27.470> going<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.619> bit

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it moves through going a little bit

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.770 
it moves through going a little bit
further<00:01:28.979> now<00:01:29.310> we're<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.600> with

further now we're going to be going with

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
further now we're going to be going with

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.609 
the next week and I'll show you what
that<00:01:35.729> means<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> minute<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:37.439> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that means in a minute what that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.260 
that means in a minute what that
basically<00:01:37.650> means<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> short<00:01:38.850> term<00:01:39.030> here

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
basically means in the short term here

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940 
basically means in the short term here
as<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:39.479> showing<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.680> model

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
as I'm showing you this the model

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.679 
as I'm showing you this the model
graphics<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.390> we're<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
graphics here is that we're going to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.679 
graphics here is that we're going to
have<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> series<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.590> light<00:01:44.220> snow<00:01:44.490> short<00:01:45.479> waves

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
just running the gfs here and it keeps

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.680 
just running the gfs here and it keeps
this<00:02:16.590> system<00:02:17.220> light<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.360> point<00:02:18.570> where

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
this system light and to the point where

this system light and to the point where
you<00:02:18.750> just<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.020> few<00:02:19.200> snow<00:02:19.440> showers<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:19.980> on

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
you just get a few snow showers here on

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.340 
you just get a few snow showers here on
Saturday<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.970> previous<00:02:21.390> version<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> GFS

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
Saturday the previous version of the GFS

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.260 
Saturday the previous version of the GFS
had<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.100> little<00:02:23.370> bit<00:02:23.520> more<00:02:23.640> snow<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.180> on

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
had a little bit more snow here on

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.930 
had a little bit more snow here on
Wednesday<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:24.980> we're<00:02:25.980> not<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.670> see<00:02:26.820> what

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
Wednesday so we're not you see what

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.220 
Wednesday so we're not you see what
happens<00:02:27.240> here<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.540> systems<00:02:28.080> actually

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
happens here this systems actually

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.450 
happens here this systems actually
ramped<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.800> little<00:02:28.980> bit<00:02:29.070> closer<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
ramped up a little bit closer to the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.400 
ramped up a little bit closer to the
coast<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.910> time<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.420> that's<00:02:30.840> why<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.050> throws

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
coast this time and that's why it throws

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.320 
coast this time and that's why it throws
up<00:02:31.440> some<00:02:32.100> more<00:02:32.280> snow<00:02:32.580> back<00:02:32.820> here<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.150> our<00:02:33.300> area

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
up some more snow back here in our area

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.210 
up some more snow back here in our area
here<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:33.960> our<00:02:34.080> coverage<00:02:34.320> area<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.860> actually

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
here in our coverage area and actually

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.100 
here in our coverage area and actually
it<00:02:35.460> gets<00:02:35.580> done<00:02:35.730> pretty<00:02:35.910> far<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.330> circled<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
it gets done pretty far is circled the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.960 
it gets done pretty far is circled the
area<00:02:37.230> where<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.500> normally<00:02:37.680> do<00:02:37.980> Northwest<00:02:38.430> 95

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
area where I normally do Northwest 95

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.580 
area where I normally do Northwest 95
there<00:02:39.240> but<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.810> actually<00:02:39.960> gets<00:02:40.170> down<00:02:40.410> there

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
there but it actually gets down there

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.410 
there but it actually gets down there
were<00:02:40.710> tire<00:02:41.040> coverage<00:02:41.460> area<00:02:41.790> where<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:42.210> cold

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
were tire coverage area where we cold

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.440 
were tire coverage area where we cold
enough<00:02:42.570> for<00:02:42.630> snow<00:02:43.070> in<00:02:44.070> these<00:02:44.310> areas<00:02:44.520> here<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.210> I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
enough for snow in these areas here so I

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.690 
enough for snow in these areas here so I
well<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.200> keep<00:02:46.320> an<00:02:46.440> eye<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.100> think<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
well to keep an eye on this I think the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.640 
well to keep an eye on this I think the
models<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.210> difficult<00:02:48.660> time<00:02:48.720> handling<00:02:49.380> a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
models have a difficult time handling a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.550 
models have a difficult time handling a
split<00:02:49.920> flow<00:02:50.130> pattern<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.180> because

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
split flow pattern and this is because

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.530 
split flow pattern and this is because
this<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:52.950> we<00:02:53.070> mean<00:02:53.250> with<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.460> split<00:02:54.060> flow<00:02:54.270> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
this is what we mean with a split flow I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.480 
this is what we mean with a split flow I
have<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.410> jet<00:02:55.650> streams<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.130> have<00:02:56.280> one

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
have to jet streams you have one

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.740 
have to jet streams you have one
southern<00:02:56.850> jet<00:02:57.060> that's<00:02:57.240> sitting<00:02:57.480> down<00:02:57.600> you're

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
southern jet that's sitting down you're

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.180 
southern jet that's sitting down you're
like<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.020> pretty<00:02:58.200> much<00:02:58.410> zonal<00:02:58.860> west<00:02:59.070> to

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
like that's pretty much zonal west to

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.430 
like that's pretty much zonal west to
east<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.210> know<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.720> northern<00:03:01.140> extreme

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
east and you know the northern extreme

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.080 
east and you know the northern extreme
is<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:01.740> here<00:03:01.980> these<00:03:02.100> two<00:03:02.160> are<00:03:02.400> not<00:03:02.580> connecting

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
is up here these two are not connecting

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.210 
is up here these two are not connecting
so<00:03:03.240> this<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.510> called<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.720> split<00:03:04.050> flow<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.620> all

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
so this is called a split flow and all

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.920 
so this is called a split flow and all
that<00:03:05.430> will<00:03:05.610> do<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.820> have<00:03:06.240> these<00:03:06.450> little<00:03:06.750> pieces

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
that will do is have these little pieces

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.140 
that will do is have these little pieces
of<00:03:07.110> energy<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.650> ride<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.460> northern<00:03:08.820> stream

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
of energy that ride this northern stream

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.510 
of energy that ride this northern stream
and<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.540> very<00:03:09.780> quickly<00:03:10.190> ride<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> jet

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
and going very quickly ride the jet

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.880 
and going very quickly ride the jet
stream<00:03:11.930> right<00:03:12.930> across<00:03:13.260> our<00:03:13.440> area<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
stream right across our area the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.260 
stream right across our area the
northern<00:03:14.220> stream<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.610> since<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.940> cannot

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
northern stream and since it cannot

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.270 
northern stream and since it cannot
connect<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.960> southern<00:03:16.140> stream<00:03:16.530> you

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
connect with the southern stream you

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.070 
connect with the southern stream you
can't<00:03:17.520> get<00:03:17.670> any<00:03:17.850> big<00:03:18.030> system<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.690> we're<00:03:19.020> not

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
can't get any big system so we're not

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.720 
can't get any big system so we're not
looking<00:03:19.350> at<00:03:19.380> any<00:03:19.530> big<00:03:19.770> snowstorms<00:03:20.400> over<00:03:20.640> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
looking at any big snowstorms over the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.980 
looking at any big snowstorms over the
next<00:03:20.940> week<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:21.510> i'll<00:03:21.600> definitely<00:03:21.930> be

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
next week here but i'll definitely be

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.870 
next week here but i'll definitely be
cold<00:03:22.350> because<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.310> norther<00:03:23.550> stream<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.850> very

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
cold because the norther stream is very

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.570 
cold because the norther stream is very
dominant<00:03:24.480> with<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.750> cold<00:03:24.960> air<00:03:25.140> polar<00:03:26.100> vortex

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
dominant with that cold air polar vortex

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.890 
dominant with that cold air polar vortex
is<00:03:26.730> actually<00:03:27.000> shifting<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.450> southeast

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
is actually shifting to the southeast

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.930 
is actually shifting to the southeast
here<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:29.190> going<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> be<00:03:29.400> filtering<00:03:29.790> in

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
here so it's going to be filtering in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.640 
here so it's going to be filtering in
some<00:03:30.090> cold<00:03:30.300> air<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.630> our<00:03:30.780> region<00:03:30.990> some<00:03:31.350> very

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
some cold air in our region some very

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.620 
some cold air in our region some very
cold<00:03:32.160> for<00:03:32.460> this<00:03:32.550> time<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.850> year<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.300> don't<00:03:33.510> want

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
cold for this time of year I don't want

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.930 
cold for this time of year I don't want
to<00:03:33.690> make<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.900> sound<00:03:34.050> like<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.290> going<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> be

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
to make it sound like it's going to be

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.280 
to make it sound like it's going to be
bone-chilling<00:03:35.940> cold<00:03:36.570> like<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:36.990> was<00:03:37.140> in

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
bone-chilling cold like it was in

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.110

to mid 40s it's going to feel a lot
colder<00:03:43.770> than<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.240> especially<00:03:45.240> in<00:03:45.630> these

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
be doing with the extreme cold for this

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.760 
be doing with the extreme cold for this
time<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.350> year<00:03:55.500> now<00:03:56.280> we're<00:03:56.460> going<00:03:56.550> to<00:03:56.640> get<00:03:56.790> into

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
time of year now we're going to get into

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.530 
time of year now we're going to get into
the<00:03:58.770> GFS<00:03:59.220> again<00:03:59.550> just<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.850> show<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.120> what<00:04:00.390> this

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
the GFS again just to show you what this

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.840 
the GFS again just to show you what this
did<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:00.960> the<00:04:01.020> rest<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.320> run<00:04:01.470> here<00:04:01.850> gfs

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
did for the rest of the run here gfs

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.180 
did for the rest of the run here gfs
that<00:04:03.060> took<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.540> system<00:04:03.930> on<00:04:04.170> Wednesday<00:04:04.920> and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
that took the system on Wednesday and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.850 
that took the system on Wednesday and
took<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.240> offshore<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.530> just<00:04:07.710> keeps

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
took that offshore and it just keeps

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.440 
took that offshore and it just keeps
rotating<00:04:08.160> these<00:04:08.610> little<00:04:08.880> Clippers<00:04:09.210> to<00:04:09.330> see

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
rotating these little Clippers to see

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.640 
rotating these little Clippers to see
there's<00:04:09.570> another<00:04:09.720> one<00:04:09.930> here<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.350> rotates

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
there's another one here it rotates

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.440 
there's another one here it rotates
these<00:04:10.860> clipper<00:04:11.100> systems<00:04:11.550> in<00:04:11.700> here<00:04:11.940> quick

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
these clipper systems in here quick

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.270 
these clipper systems in here quick
moving<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.140> out<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.410> not<00:04:13.709> much<00:04:13.950> strength

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
moving in and out and not much strength

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.130 
moving in and out and not much strength
to<00:04:14.550> them<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:15.540> think<00:04:15.600> that's<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.959> pattern

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
to them and I think that's the pattern

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.080 
to them and I think that's the pattern
we're<00:04:16.320> going<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.500> go<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.650> over<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.340> next<00:04:17.700> week

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
we're going to go to over the next week

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.090 
we're going to go to over the next week
or<00:04:18.270> so<00:04:18.330> if<00:04:18.930> something<00:04:19.380> changes<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.890> you<00:04:19.950> get

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
or so if something changes and you get

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.950 
or so if something changes and you get
one<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.370> these<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.790> amplify<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.540> little<00:04:21.870> bit

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
one of these to amplify a little bit

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.360 
one of these to amplify a little bit
more<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.260> get<00:04:22.350> a<00:04:22.440> little<00:04:22.710> bit<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.979> buckle<00:04:23.310> in

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
more you get a little bit of a buckle in

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.219 
more you get a little bit of a buckle in
that<00:04:23.490> jet<00:04:23.700> stream<00:04:24.030> like<00:04:24.630> we<00:04:24.780> showed<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.080> here

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
that jet stream like we showed you here

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.629 
that jet stream like we showed you here
on<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.380> split<00:04:25.620> flow<00:04:25.800> pattern

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
on the split flow pattern

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.700 
on the split flow pattern
you<00:04:26.909> can<00:04:27.090> get<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.270> lot<00:04:27.449> by<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:28.289> can<00:04:28.409> get<00:04:28.499> a<00:04:28.530> lot

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
you can get a lot by you can get a lot

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.390 
you can get a lot by you can get a lot
more<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:30.120> lot<00:04:30.870> larger<00:04:31.229> of<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.650> storm<00:04:31.949> but<00:04:32.189> right

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
more a lot larger of a storm but right

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.279 
more a lot larger of a storm but right
now<00:04:32.550> we're<00:04:32.729> not<00:04:32.819> seeing<00:04:33.120> any<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.449> that<00:04:33.569> here's

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
now we're not seeing any of that here's

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.540 
now we're not seeing any of that here's
that<00:04:34.499> system<00:04:34.830> on<00:04:34.949> Wednesday<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.370> have<00:04:35.490> a

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
that system on Wednesday you have a

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.459 
that system on Wednesday you have a
slight<00:04:35.849> dip<00:04:36.120> here<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:36.569> that's<00:04:36.749> why<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.960> GFS

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:37.469 
slight dip here so that's why the GFS

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:38.899 
slight dip here so that's why the GFS
was<00:04:37.620> showing<00:04:37.889> something<00:04:38.099> a<00:04:38.249> little<00:04:38.520> bit<00:04:38.759> more

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
was showing something a little bit more

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.719 
was showing something a little bit more
amped<00:04:39.300> here<00:04:39.560> but<00:04:40.560> nothing<00:04:40.860> too<00:04:41.039> crazy<00:04:41.279> and

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
amped here but nothing too crazy and

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.700 
amped here but nothing too crazy and
definitely<00:04:42.689> no<00:04:42.840> big<00:04:43.050> Nor'easters<00:04:43.529> or

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
definitely no big Nor'easters or

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.499 
definitely no big Nor'easters or
blizzards<00:04:44.069> but<00:04:44.819> you<00:04:44.909> see<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.180> go<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.330> little

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
blizzards but you see you go a little

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.209 
blizzards but you see you go a little
bit<00:04:45.689> further<00:04:45.840> here<00:04:46.139> here's<00:04:46.289> Friday<00:04:46.590> Saturday

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:47.219 
bit further here here's Friday Saturday

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.219 
bit further here here's Friday Saturday
still<00:04:47.789> the<00:04:47.939> split<00:04:48.210> float<00:04:48.479> or<00:04:48.689> the<00:04:48.779> streams<00:04:49.080> up

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
still the split float or the streams up

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.809 
still the split float or the streams up
here<00:04:49.499> southern<00:04:49.770> streams<00:04:50.099> down<00:04:50.279> here<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:50.699> they

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
here southern streams down here so they

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.700 
here southern streams down here so they
can't<00:04:51.060> connect<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.629> you<00:04:52.110> have<00:04:52.229> no<00:04:52.379> big<00:04:52.590> storms

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
can't connect and you have no big storms

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.379 
can't connect and you have no big storms
and<00:04:53.099> that<00:04:53.219> pretty<00:04:53.340> much<00:04:53.430> goes<00:04:53.699> for<00:04:53.999> the<00:04:54.060> entire

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
and that pretty much goes for the entire

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.320 
and that pretty much goes for the entire
run<00:04:54.719> of<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.139> GFS<00:04:55.590> here<00:04:55.830> or<00:04:56.580> we<00:04:56.849> remain<00:04:57.060> in<00:04:57.240> this

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
run of the GFS here or we remain in this

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.170 
run of the GFS here or we remain in this
split<00:04:58.319> flow<00:04:58.469> pattern<00:04:58.889> so<00:04:59.129> we'll<00:04:59.669> update<00:04:59.849> that

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
split flow pattern so we'll update that

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.119
