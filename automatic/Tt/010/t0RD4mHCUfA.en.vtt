to winterize a bike now so taking a
little<00:01:48.700> bit<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:49.690> guess<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.620> next<00:01:50.830> project<00:01:51.600> I'm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
little bit I guess the next project I'm

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.010 
little bit I guess the next project I'm
looking<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:52.960> do<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:55.270> chop<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.690> fender<00:01:55.990> a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
looking to do is we chop the fender a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.980 
looking to do is we chop the fender a
little<00:01:56.260> bit<00:01:56.410> but<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:57.280> get<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.520> new<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:58.630> larger

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990

headlight<00:01:59.410> but<00:02:00.450> let's<00:02:01.450> about<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:01.870> thinking<00:02:02.530> of

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
headlight but let's about it thinking of

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.430 
headlight but let's about it thinking of
also<00:02:02.890> maybe<00:02:03.250> raising<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.880> headlight<00:02:04.270> or<00:02:04.540> find

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
also maybe raising the headlight or find

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.020 
also maybe raising the headlight or find
a<00:02:05.530> bracket<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.070> bring<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.340> out<00:02:06.460> over<00:02:06.700> for<00:02:07.000> a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
a bracket to bring it out over for a

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.410 
a bracket to bring it out over for a
farther<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.660> from<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.869> prominent<00:02:09.209> that's<00:02:10.209> about

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
farther so from a prominent that's about

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
farther so from a prominent that's about
it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.770 
it
I'll<00:02:12.370> also<00:02:12.670> remove<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:14.790> chain<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.480> belt

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
I'll also remove the chain the belt

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.140 
I'll also remove the chain the belt
guards<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.320> lower<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.010> upper<00:02:18.070> but<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.060> know

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
guards the lower and upper but you know

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.460 
guards the lower and upper but you know
what<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.300> will<00:02:19.540> start<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.930> up<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:22.989> can<00:02:23.230> maybe

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
what I will start it up so you can maybe

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.310 
what I will start it up so you can maybe
see<00:02:23.620> what<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:23.980> sounds<00:02:24.130> like
