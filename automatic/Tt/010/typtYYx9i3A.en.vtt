 big financial worries but on the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.200
 field the players do not let go two 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.079
 minutes after the opening of the score and 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.219
 valoise equalization Le Mans the first

 goal of the season for abdelhakim omrani 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.369
 a goal that changes everything and gives back 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.889
 a lot of hope at mans are the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.929
 less point outside would relieve 

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:32.060
 a lot the club he could get out of 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.359
 the red zone at half time a goal 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.359
 all over 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.600
 laval is better lately two 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.069
 victories over the last five games 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.579
 after a series of nine games without 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.590
 success must be confirmed at home but 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.179
 the emotion clings 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.619
 mentions that remain them on three 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.709
 consecutive defeats 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.209
 a single goal scored in this series and 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.590
 for now they are holding this draw 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.109
 and why not score the second goal 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.289
 outside a good center and the ball 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.759
 picked up by the Laval goaltender 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.770
 Laval residents who will have trouble getting 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.639
 provide situations and who tries 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.639
 a lot of far-off strikes 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.050
 this one is still far from the frame 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.819
 over three games without defeat the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.700
 Lavalois insists on trying to 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.890
 win this game against the mans 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.890
 82nd minute the second goal and scored 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.019
 by ghislain gimbert his seventh of the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.209
 season 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.890
 the value finally takes over the advantage at 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.540
 score and it's a very hard blow for the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.099
 manceaux who have won only one of 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.769
 their last eight meetings 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.040
 once again the mentions collapses 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.360
 at the end of the match one last hope when 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.160
 even with this balloon in the surface of 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.940
 repair but it's captured by the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.250
 enemy goalkeeper 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.640
 the mans will have to do it again 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.250
 bow in this game away 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.049
 the possibility to maintain exists 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.090
 always but the right operation is 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.750
 clearly Laval with this victory 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.750
 2 goals to 1
