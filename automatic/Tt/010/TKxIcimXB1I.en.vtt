00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.140 

I'm<00:01:01.330> starting<00:01:02.140> by<00:01:02.260> doing<00:01:02.650> the<00:01:02.800> outline

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.710

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.640

comment<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:31.230> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.860> do<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.280> patterning

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
comment I'm going to do the patterning

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:43.560 
comment I'm going to do the patterning
in<00:01:34.570> some<00:01:34.900> of<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.140> other<00:01:35.350> colors<00:01:37.440> patterns

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:52.550 

add<00:01:43.870> a<00:01:43.930> lot<00:01:44.409> of<00:01:44.590> richness<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:46.210> design

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.770 

I'm<00:01:53.130> swapping<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.479> some<00:01:54.689> blue

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
I'm swapping out for some blue

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.620 
I'm swapping out for some blue
and<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.010> loop<00:01:58.400> pattern

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:19.350 

and<00:02:04.990> by<00:02:05.200> adding<00:02:05.469> das

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.200 

you<00:02:19.930> can<00:02:20.140> really<00:02:20.530> enhance<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.850> whole<00:02:22.060> letter

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
you can really enhance the whole letter

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.840 
you can really enhance the whole letter
so<00:02:25.210> larger<00:02:25.780> areas<00:02:26.910> give<00:02:27.910> you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
so larger areas give you

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.200 
so larger areas give you
more<00:02:30.390> detail<00:02:30.990> this<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.460> lines<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.180> a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
more detail this is for lines and a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.520 
more detail this is for lines and a
circle

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.030 

I'm<00:02:37.709> going<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.220> put<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.730> green<00:02:39.360> back<00:02:40.230> here<00:02:40.680> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
I'm going to put a green back here and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.430 
I'm going to put a green back here and
we're<00:02:41.220> going<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.520> do<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> triangle<00:02:42.569> pattern

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.100 

I'm<00:02:45.770> just<00:02:46.040> going<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.340> put<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.700> dot

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
I'm just going to put a dot

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.660 
I'm just going to put a dot
in<00:02:48.650> each<00:02:48.860> time

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
in each time

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.450 
in each time
and<00:02:51.240> now<00:02:51.420> will

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
and now will

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.170 
and now will
add<00:02:52.820> some<00:02:53.390> extra<00:02:55.090> little<00:02:56.090> flourishes

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.820 

taking<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.049> letter<00:03:00.230> personality

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.950 

and<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.790> want

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.940 

for<00:03:09.500> an<00:03:09.590> extra<00:03:09.740> touch

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.710 

I<00:03:15.040> always<00:03:15.910> love<00:03:16.180> hearts

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.800 

and<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.930> think<00:03:21.990> you<00:03:22.290> can<00:03:22.500> go<00:03:22.650> through

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
and I think you can go through

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.010 
and I think you can go through
head

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.370 

extra<00:03:30.710> pattern<00:03:31.630> inside<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.840> letter<00:03:33.050> like

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
extra pattern inside the letter like

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.570 
extra pattern inside the letter like
that

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
that

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.300 
that
so<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.330> is<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> three-color<00:03:36.440> letter<00:03:36.830> blue

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
so this is a three-color letter blue

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.040 
so this is a three-color letter blue
green<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:38.000> gold<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.790> now<00:03:41.060> I'd<00:03:41.450> like<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.810> show
