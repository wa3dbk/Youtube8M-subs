00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.840 
on his free leg so what I'd like to ask
him<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.139> hold<00:00:16.320> us<00:00:16.500> free<00:00:16.740> leg<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.220> little

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
him to do is hold us free leg a little

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.670 
him to do is hold us free leg a little
bit<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.240> front<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.690> them<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:18.960> keep<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.500> low

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
bit out in front of them and keep it low

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.580 
bit out in front of them and keep it low
he's<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> take<00:00:20.970> very<00:00:21.000> small<00:00:21.390> hops<00:00:21.869> as<00:00:22.140> he

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
he's going to take very small hops as he

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.950 
he's going to take very small hops as he
goes

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.520 

let's<00:00:32.650> feel<00:00:32.860> a<00:00:32.890> little<00:00:33.040> bit<00:00:33.190> more<00:00:33.250> ankle<00:00:33.730> prep

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.430 

and<00:00:38.800> good<00:00:39.370> okay<00:00:40.240> so<00:00:40.300> we'll<00:00:40.630> do<00:00:40.780> these<00:00:40.930> off<00:00:41.200> both

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
and good okay so we'll do these off both

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.440 
and good okay so we'll do these off both
legs<00:00:41.740> Zuhair<00:00:42.460> started<00:00:42.790> with<00:00:42.880> his<00:00:43.030> left<00:00:43.270> now

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
legs Zuhair started with his left now

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.120 
legs Zuhair started with his left now
he's<00:00:43.600> going<00:00:43.720> to<00:00:43.780> switch<00:00:44.020> with<00:00:44.200> his<00:00:44.320> right<00:00:44.530> the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
he's going to switch with his right the

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.040 
he's going to switch with his right the
one<00:00:45.310> thing<00:00:45.520> I<00:00:45.640> wanted<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:45.940> notice<00:00:46.300> is<00:00:46.540> that<00:00:46.570> you

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
one thing I wanted to notice is that you

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.180 
one thing I wanted to notice is that you
can<00:00:47.200> turn<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.470> camera<00:00:47.770> a<00:00:47.800> little<00:00:47.860> bit<00:00:48.010> this

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
can turn the camera a little bit this

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.380 
can turn the camera a little bit this
way<00:00:48.370> is<00:00:48.630> that<00:00:49.630> Zuhair<00:00:50.260> is<00:00:50.380> keeping<00:00:50.739> his<00:00:50.860> leg

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
way is that Zuhair is keeping his leg

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.060 
way is that Zuhair is keeping his leg
low<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.630> out<00:00:52.720> in<00:00:52.840> front<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.320> what<00:00:53.890> you'll

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
low and out in front and what you'll

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.280 
low and out in front and what you'll
notice<00:00:54.190> is<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.610> as<00:00:54.970> he<00:00:55.180> hops<00:00:55.480> he's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
notice is that as he hops he's

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.160 
notice is that as he hops he's
essentially<00:00:56.890> cycling<00:00:57.460> this<00:00:57.640> leg<00:00:58.110> through<00:00:59.110> a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
essentially cycling this leg through a

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.350 
essentially cycling this leg through a
small<00:00:59.470> cycle<00:00:59.949> so<00:01:00.370> even<00:01:00.730> though<00:01:00.910> this<00:01:01.120> leg

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
small cycle so even though this leg

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.660 
small cycle so even though this leg
isn't<00:01:01.629> contacting<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.620> ground<00:01:02.650> this<00:01:03.309> leg<00:01:03.519> is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
isn't contacting the ground this leg is

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.960 
isn't contacting the ground this leg is
still<00:01:03.850> working<00:01:04.119> through<00:01:04.510> this<00:01:05.970> and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
still working through this and

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.520 
still working through this and
essentially<00:01:07.690> what<00:01:07.840> we're<00:01:07.990> going<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.140> see<00:01:08.350> is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
essentially what we're going to see is

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.950 
essentially what we're going to see is
this<00:01:09.400> really<00:01:09.729> translates<00:01:10.270> well<00:01:10.479> I<00:01:10.509> would<00:01:10.780> use

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
this really translates well I would use

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.380 
this really translates well I would use
this<00:01:11.200> exercise<00:01:11.800> with<00:01:12.220> sprinters<00:01:12.880> with<00:01:13.149> long

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
this exercise with sprinters with long

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.240 
this exercise with sprinters with long
jumpers<00:01:13.840> but<00:01:14.259> what<00:01:14.410> this<00:01:14.590> translates<00:01:14.800> well

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
jumpers but what this translates well

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.310 
jumpers but what this translates well
with<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.490> triple<00:01:15.790> jump<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.840> idea<00:01:17.259> that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
with the triple jump is the idea that

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.230 
with the triple jump is the idea that
although<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.220> triple<00:01:18.550> jump<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:18.880> zoo<00:01:19.030> hares

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
although the triple jump in zoo hares

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.969 
although the triple jump in zoo hares
case<00:01:19.509> he's<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:19.780> right<00:01:20.080> footed<00:01:20.440> take<00:01:20.619> off<00:01:20.800> so

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
case he's a right footed take off so

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.190 
case he's a right footed take off so
he's<00:01:21.160> right<00:01:21.369> right<00:01:21.580> left<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.479> really<00:01:22.690> he<00:01:23.170> is

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
he's right right left that really he is

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.350 
he's right right left that really he is
not<00:01:23.500> right<00:01:23.800> right<00:01:23.830> left<00:01:24.280> he's<00:01:24.580> really<00:01:24.910> right

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
not right right left he's really right

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.410 
not right right left he's really right
left<00:01:25.930> right<00:01:26.200> left<00:01:26.520> however<00:01:27.520> that<00:01:27.940> left<00:01:28.240> is

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
left right left however that left is

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.749 
left right left however that left is
just<00:01:28.720> does<00:01:28.869> not<00:01:28.990> make<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.229> contact<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.460> we<00:01:30.490> want

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
just does not make a contact so we want

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:31.889 
just does not make a contact so we want
to<00:01:30.820> start<00:01:31.000> working<00:01:31.149> this<00:01:31.450> in<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.720> very

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
to start working this in a very

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.170 
to start working this in a very
rudimentary<00:01:32.140> fashion<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.550> this<00:01:33.759> time<00:01:33.970> notice

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
rudimentary fashion so this time notice

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.749 
rudimentary fashion so this time notice
that<00:01:34.360> he<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.320> essentially<00:01:35.860> staying<00:01:36.220> right

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
that he is essentially staying right

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.029 
that he is essentially staying right
left<00:01:37.240> throughout<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.200> movement<00:01:38.410> although

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
left throughout the movement although

00:01:39.039 --> 00:02:10.270 
left throughout the movement although
his<00:01:39.220> contacts<00:01:39.759> are<00:01:39.940> only<00:01:40.240> with<00:01:40.390> his<00:01:40.539> right

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.800 

next<00:02:11.030> we're<00:02:11.150> going<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.330> add<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.480> little<00:02:11.690> bit

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
next we're going to add a little bit

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.690 
next we're going to add a little bit
more<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.290> complexity<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.550> hair

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
more of a complexity to it and so hair

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:35.940 
more of a complexity to it and so hair
is<00:02:13.790> going<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.940> go<00:02:14.090> left<00:02:14.330> left<00:02:14.630> right<00:02:14.720> right

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.170 

and<00:02:36.950> again<00:02:37.220> notice<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.610> although<00:02:37.910> that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
and again notice that although that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.760 
and again notice that although that
exercise<00:02:38.690> was<00:02:38.930> called<00:02:39.200> left<00:02:39.410> left<00:02:39.680> right

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
exercise was called left left right

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.280 
exercise was called left left right
