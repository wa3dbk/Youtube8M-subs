00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.950
 Today, some Ukrainian media when 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.259
 learned that the project and the south stream is closed 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.570
 wrote peremoga over Russian 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.820
 gas station but it looks like they wound rejoices 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.469
 today all the world's media 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.480
 information analyzes the visit of the President 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.789
 Putin to Turkey where he did it 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.880
 loud statement conclusion actually 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.180
 unambiguous Moscow made very strong 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.340
 move 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 By the way Bulgaria when banned 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.890
 laying a gas pipeline to put it mildly 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.580
 spat on your interests if you don't 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.009
 knew 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.050
 bulgaria carry pepper and with 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.880
 turkey money for gas transit sofia 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.280
 would get more than annual budget 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.059
 countries dmitry oil to consequences 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.040
 Summit until yesterday 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.140
 of the day, the gas question was of little interest 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.969
 European average man and the old press 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.950
 of light today journalists are discussing even 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.350
 color of the carpet near the palace 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.719
 erdogan instead of the usual red 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.910
 the blue in did not see the hint of the Turks 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.539
 instead of the south stream you need to develop 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.149
 blue 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.030
 agreed, including a discount on all 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.650
 also blue fuel from January 1st 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.930
 year understandable prices for blue fuel for 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.400
 Turkish consumers by 6 percent and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.400
 ready we will reduce 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.590
 these prices are further as our sales 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.970
 joint major projects detailed 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.189
 calculations made by the president 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.630
 left no doubt russia decided 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.810
 collapse the South Stream project 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.119
 and with it and get rid of illusions 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.970
 you know these illusions they are already pretty 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.100
 long and the point here is not even so much in 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.979
 brotherhood of Slavs how much 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.930
 the leadership of these countries Vladimir Putin 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.659
 meets the crowds in belgrade with her 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.150
 there is higher rating than local 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.580
 president and in ero combined but with 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.009
 this power is in the hands of those 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.229
 who are hesitant and not 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.080
 may act in accordance with 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.390
 the interests of their country officials 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.610
 and weight of the South Stream project closure 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.320
 one is not clear on brussels 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.130
 left Ukraine as a country 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.200
 transit country 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.020
 which means secured for the coming 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.490
 winter risky game shut kiev 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.319
 gas transit to bargain with 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.690
 Gazprom or all cost on 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:17.080
 the content of Europe is now also Bulgaria 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.880
 lever deer and now are not the best 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.610
 relationship flush so the south stream 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.500
 or the victim of the station and this relationship but also 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.239
 out just can't without russian gas 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.799
 for Europe this is a reality at least 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.500
 next 20-30 years 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.090
 brussels need to be careful not passed 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.250
 and days and how Europe from Sofia 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.959
 turned away to advise Vladimir Putin 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.239
 bulgari applied for compensation 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.730
 losses whether the south stream the country could 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.010
 receive up to 400 million euros per year and 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.829
 put them on the road hospitals and schools 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.230
 and now all the same tube Brussels money 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.850
 does not give the president of bulgaria has already taken off 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.280
 responsibility for stopping southern 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.470
 flow and weak europe hopes to get 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.030
 From Moscow explanations but already hardly 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.640
 will be able to oppose something 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.459
 US pressure, I think one of 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.709
 consequences for bulgaria will change 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.489
 governments because voters don't 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.260
 forgive the betrayal of Bulgaria 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.359
 which was committed by having 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.190
 Bulgarian seer and more selective 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.690
 ask and betrayal of Russian 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.140
 Bulgarian friendship which was also 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.270
 done 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.400
 Hungarians and Serbia as well as in all countries 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.650
 who told their south stream yes 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.600
 in spite of the US European no 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.550
 today expressed great regret 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.130
 their money invested project let u 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.400
 the small ones also flew into the pipe only 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.880
 pronounced with Russia to build the southern 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.620
 flow 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.300
 this is bad news for us 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.700
 expert pipeline projects only 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.410
 restrain the Russian energy 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.660
 exports are partly hindering the development of supplies 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.550
 and liquefied gas on the same asian 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.680
 premium market primarily in 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.550
 China with which Moscow already has a big 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.400
 gas contract 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.440
 Russia is already building LNG plants the most 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.720
 large projects in Yamal and in the far 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.690
 east and the rejection of the south stream only 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.100
 only push them to the development of steel 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.690
 known today and the details of others and 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.110
 deals concluded between Moscow and 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.880
 ankara so until 2022 russia 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.160
 exactly take part in a unique 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.890
 nuclear power plant construction project 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.170
 aku and build and will be on the principle 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.269
 the board owns exploit that is 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.430
 Russia will remain the owner of the station 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.250
 which means it will directly make a profit 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.590
 but the gas topic definitely remains 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.270
 topic number one is the Brussels bureaucrats 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.520
 in panic turkey turns into 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.590
 largest energy hop through 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.110
 which in of will go hydrocarbons from 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.810
 Russia kospi and in perspective Iran 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.550
