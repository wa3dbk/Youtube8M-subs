crapload of a hat on switch actually

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480 
crapload of a hat on switch actually
take<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.570> lot<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.750> memory<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.380> am<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
take up a lot of memory I am going to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
take up a lot of memory I am going to
liquid<00:01:08.760> cool<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.540> an<00:01:09.630> h-60<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.390> slim

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
liquid cool this with an h-60 it is slim

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.429 
liquid cool this with an h-60 it is slim
that's<00:01:13.890> why<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> chose<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.990> as<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.290> see

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that's why I chose it as you can see

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.420 
that's why I chose it as you can see
here<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> had<00:01:16.770> some<00:01:17.150> I<00:01:18.150> had<00:01:18.960> some<00:01:19.140> old<00:01:19.290> RAM<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.040> had

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
here I had some I had some old RAM I had

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580 
here I had some I had some old RAM I had
lying<00:01:20.610> around<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.540> obviously<00:01:22.049> blue<00:01:22.350> does

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
lying around but the obviously blue does

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
lying around but the obviously blue does
not<00:01:22.740> match<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:22.979> red<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.520> black<00:01:23.700> scheme<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.570> was

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
not match the red and black scheme I was

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.420 
not match the red and black scheme I was
going<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.189> remove

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
going for this I actually just remove

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.020 
going for this I actually just remove
the<00:01:26.610> heat<00:01:26.790> sinks<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.369> from<00:01:29.369> these<00:01:29.490> Corsair

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the heat sinks and from these Corsair

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.410 
the heat sinks and from these Corsair
Vengeance<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> 2133<00:01:32.759> Ram<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.240> I'm

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
Vengeance and this is 2133 Ram and I'm

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.109 
Vengeance and this is 2133 Ram and I'm
really<00:01:33.780> not<00:01:34.110> impressed<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:35.009> these<00:01:35.880> heat

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
really not impressed with these heat

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.210 
really not impressed with these heat
sinks<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:36.720> they're<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.079> big<00:01:38.009> piece<00:01:38.189> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
sinks I think they're a big piece of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.210 
sinks I think they're a big piece of
 personally<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.829> how<00:01:41.070> they

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
 personally I don't see how they

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.190 
 personally I don't see how they
were<00:01:41.280> designed<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> ever<00:01:41.939> keep<00:01:42.329> anything<00:01:42.420> cool

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
were designed to ever keep anything cool

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.249 
were designed to ever keep anything cool
I<00:01:43.229> think<00:01:43.860> it'll<00:01:43.979> perform<00:01:44.189> much<00:01:44.579> better

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
I think it'll perform much better

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.620 
I think it'll perform much better
without<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.619> heat<00:01:46.799> sinks<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.630> heatsink

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
without the heat sinks on them heatsink

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.960 
without the heat sinks on them heatsink
on<00:01:49.439> them<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.490> actually<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:50.939> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
on them and this is actually kind of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.760 
on them and this is actually kind of
what<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.180> looks<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.479> without<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.619> looks

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
what it looks like without it it looks

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.170 
what it looks like without it it looks
pretty<00:01:53.009> nice<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.030> does

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
pretty nice actually I think it does

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
pretty nice actually I think it does
anyways<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:56.100> yeah<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:57.409> processor<00:01:58.409> running<00:01:59.280> in

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
anyways so yeah and processor running in

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:08.419 
anyways so yeah and processor running in
i-5<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.439> that<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.729> 46<00:02:02.729> 70<00:02:03.270> K

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.100 

and<00:02:09.429> that's<00:02:09.640> pretty<00:02:09.910> much<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.479> have<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.869> lot

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
and that's pretty much it I have a lot

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.270 
and that's pretty much it I have a lot
of<00:02:11.260> work<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.530> do<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:12.390> build<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.510> gonna<00:02:13.720> be

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
of work to do this build is gonna be

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.210 
of work to do this build is gonna be
quite<00:02:15.280> compact<00:02:15.790> oh<00:02:16.290> sorry<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.410> forgot<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.830> tell

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
quite compact oh sorry I forgot to tell

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.759 
quite compact oh sorry I forgot to tell
you<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.400> hard<00:02:18.580> drive<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.790> have<00:02:19.000> here<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.330> a

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
you the hard drive I have here is a

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.150 
you the hard drive I have here is a
Seagate<00:02:20.769> Barracuda<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.849> is<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.120> three<00:02:23.069> what<00:02:24.069> is

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
Seagate Barracuda it is a three what is

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.729 
Seagate Barracuda it is a three what is
that<00:02:24.340> three<00:02:25.180> terabytes<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.650> should<00:02:29.650> have

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
that three terabytes so I should have

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.309 
that three terabytes so I should have
hooked<00:02:29.860> up<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.299> another<00:02:31.299> one<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.569> those<00:02:31.660> two<00:02:31.870> 40s

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
hooked up a another one of those two 40s

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.820 
hooked up a another one of those two 40s
and<00:02:32.500> ran<00:02:32.680> late<00:02:32.890> zero<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.819> didn't<00:02:34.810> what<00:02:35.739> it

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
and ran late zero of it I didn't what it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.430 
and ran late zero of it I didn't what it
should<00:02:36.010> have<00:02:36.099> could<00:02:36.280> all<00:02:36.400> right<00:02:36.549> guys<00:02:36.819> oh<00:02:37.440> well

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
but uh this buildin all was probably

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.640 
but uh this buildin all was probably
about<00:02:41.940> thirteen<00:02:42.940> hundred<00:02:43.230> maybe<00:02:44.230> fourteen

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
and I'm a big AMD fan this is my first

and I'm a big AMD fan this is my first
venture<00:03:16.150> into<00:03:17.430> Nvidia<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:18.819> see<00:03:19.269> how<00:03:19.389> it<00:03:19.510> goes

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
venture into Nvidia so see how it goes

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.870 
venture into Nvidia so see how it goes
I'm<00:03:20.079> pretty<00:03:20.380> excited<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:22.650> am<00:03:23.650> NOT<00:03:24.250> excited<00:03:24.609> with

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
I'm pretty excited I am NOT excited with

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.640 
I'm pretty excited I am NOT excited with
new<00:03:25.060> egg<00:03:25.209> shipping<00:03:25.660> right<00:03:25.840> now<00:03:25.989> but<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.440> did

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
new egg shipping right now but it did

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.140 
new egg shipping right now but it did
get<00:03:26.859> here<00:03:27.069> so<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.810> should<00:03:28.810> not<00:03:28.989> complain<00:03:29.319> I

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
get here so I should not complain I

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.129 
get here so I should not complain I
guess<00:03:31.150> there<00:03:31.299> was<00:03:31.389> a<00:03:31.419> big<00:03:31.540> storm<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.049> the

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
guess there was a big storm in the

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.319 
guess there was a big storm in the
mainland<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.799> live<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.310> Hawaii<00:03:33.669> so<00:03:34.030> it's<00:03:34.209> a

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
mainland I live in Hawaii so it's a

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.640 
mainland I live in Hawaii so it's a
little<00:03:36.000> things<00:03:37.000> ship<00:03:37.419> slower<00:03:38.019> out<00:03:38.260> here<00:03:38.530> and

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
little things ship slower out here and

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.339 
little things ship slower out here and
split<00:03:38.799> that<00:03:39.040> way<00:03:39.389> so<00:03:40.389> I<00:03:40.720> give<00:03:41.139> them<00:03:41.260> the

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
split that way so I give them the

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.930 
split that way so I give them the
benefit<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.799> doubt<00:03:41.950> snow<00:03:42.400> storm<00:03:42.730> or

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
benefit of the doubt snow storm or

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.150 
benefit of the doubt snow storm or
whatever<00:03:43.419> storm<00:03:43.780> that's<00:03:44.590> happening<00:03:44.980> in<00:03:45.069> the

whatever storm that's happening in the
