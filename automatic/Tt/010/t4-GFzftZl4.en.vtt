00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
course we've got ball valves here and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.990 
course we've got ball valves here and
then<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.850> goes<00:01:47.909> upstairs<00:01:49.460> into<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> ceiling

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
then this goes upstairs into the ceiling

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.200 
then this goes upstairs into the ceiling
to<00:01:51.479> which<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.350> eventually<00:01:52.890> takes<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> water

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to which that eventually takes the water

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.990 
to which that eventually takes the water
back<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> tank<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.979> we'll<00:01:56.850> also

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
back up to the tank and then we'll also

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.749 
back up to the tank and then we'll also
plumbed<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.469> auxilary<00:01:58.860> stuff<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
plumbed in the auxilary stuff there to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.550 
plumbed in the auxilary stuff there to
go<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> new<00:02:00.210> skimmer<00:02:00.539> which<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.380> reef

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
go to the new skimmer which is the reef

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.810 
go to the new skimmer which is the reef

so<00:02:03.390> we've<00:02:03.630> got<00:02:03.840> ball<00:02:04.500> valves<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.399> use

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
so we've got ball valves so we can use

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.219 
so we've got ball valves so we can use
either<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> pumps<00:02:06.539> to<00:02:06.689> pump<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.110> it

there another valve in a set there

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.520 
there another valve in a set there
actually<00:03:07.970> goes<00:03:08.150> back<00:03:08.359> up<00:03:08.629> so<00:03:08.959> we<00:03:08.989> can<00:03:09.230> pump<00:03:09.410> it

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
actually goes back up so we can pump it

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.199 
actually goes back up so we can pump it
away

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209

another gate from the returns from

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.130 
another gate from the returns from
upstairs<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.579> we<00:03:13.670> can<00:03:13.910> again<00:03:14.840> regulate

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
upstairs so that we can again regulate

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
the water flow got up in the ceiling up

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.229 
the water flow got up in the ceiling up
there<00:03:18.500> we've<00:03:19.160> got<00:03:19.310> one<00:03:19.459> of<00:03:19.579> our<00:03:19.640> anti<00:03:20.000> leak

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
there we've got one of our anti leak

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.940 
there we've got one of our anti leak
devices<00:03:20.900> in<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.140> back<00:03:21.319> I<00:03:21.620> don't<00:03:21.680> know<00:03:21.799> if<00:03:21.890> you

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
devices in the back I don't know if you

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.410 
devices in the back I don't know if you
can<00:03:22.099> really<00:03:22.250> see<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.579> very<00:03:22.970> well<00:03:23.030> but<00:03:23.329> I'll

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
can really see that very well but I'll

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.140 
can really see that very well but I'll
try<00:03:23.599> and<00:03:23.720> hold<00:03:23.840> still<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:25.519> we<00:03:25.609> got<00:03:25.760> that<00:03:25.940> in

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
try and hold still so we got that in

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.500 
try and hold still so we got that in
place<00:03:26.410> we've<00:03:27.410> got<00:03:27.459> power<00:03:28.459> strips<00:03:28.970> tucked<00:03:29.329> up

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
place we've got power strips tucked up

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.390 
place we've got power strips tucked up
underneath<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:30.200> like<00:03:30.470> them<00:03:30.620> up<00:03:30.739> high<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.280> they

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
underneath I like them up high so they

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.979 
underneath I like them up high so they
don't<00:03:31.579> get<00:03:31.669> wet<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:32.299> gives<00:03:32.510> me<00:03:32.630> plenty<00:03:32.840> of

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
don't get wet that gives me plenty of

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.949 
don't get wet that gives me plenty of
drip<00:03:33.200> cord<00:03:33.700> back<00:03:34.700> up<00:03:34.970> here<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.239> can<00:03:35.480> see<00:03:35.720> that

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
drip cord back up here you can see that

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.680 
drip cord back up here you can see that

the leak detection modules there on the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.530 
the leak detection modules there on the
floor<00:03:38.930> we've<00:03:39.200> got<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.349> couple<00:03:39.560> cords<00:03:40.359> got<00:03:41.359> some
