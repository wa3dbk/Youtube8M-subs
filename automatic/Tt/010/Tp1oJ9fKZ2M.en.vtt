00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.410
 So the idea came into being 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.650
 that not six jan event catering too 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.599
 and we are always looking for new and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.510
 spectacular places the brandenburger 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.189
 gate to gendarmenmarkt and are very 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.660
 difficult with the authorities and us 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.840
 then looking for an alternative 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.340
 who has become because it just now 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.679
 brings with it brings it is just like that 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 Air conditioning or just about 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:41.460
 technically so we are one 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.250
 event-location yes we are not 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.190
 restaurant which opened daily 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.829
 and we cook everything ourselves and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.829
 produce here in the bus we have 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.710
 a large kitchen on board who cooks 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.480
 during the ride and then it will open 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 the point exactly and then when we get there 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.910
 a point of interest is a menu 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 send 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.799
 We always have two service staff 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.020
 board we have a spirit on board 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.070
 the mostly moderated driver 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.869
 we seize the customer from the company 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.210
 found, for example, brandenburger 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.600
 serving serve arise there 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.250
 the appetizer and that is in ours 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.940
 classic culture dining creation menu 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.920
 served on beautiful 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.350
 sights we can also do one 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.740
 fingerfood variation during the ride 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.390
 send 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.370
 that means we do not have to 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.710
 be sure to stop the benefits of many 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.460
 Customers of us only need one transfer 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.440
 For example, from the airport to the airport 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.180
 hotel and are also Germany 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.530
 on road 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.090
 if now present the event in 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.760
 hamburg we would still have today 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 Here you can buy the food in Berlin and 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.460
 Then we would be on the way to hamburg 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.560
 to produce 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.720
 Of course, it comes your guide costs 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.980
 even the staff relationship yes 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.730
 already on berlin because we have ours 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.760
 team here 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.740
 or we will somehow รก la carte 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.400
 Restaurant in the morning here with us 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.400
 we also have one 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.410
 produce production kitchen there and 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.800
 there in hamburg wants with the evening the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.260
 event with the food from berlin 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.390
 a year ago we have this one 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.790
 bought a bus and we have the then 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.280
 completely gutted like a change 30 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.560
 seats distributed on two floors 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.310
 in the back area we have the kitchen 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.240
 built-in 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.489
 For this we have the bus construction 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.390
 after making changes we have to 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.720
 have hifi system installed by el pais where 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.610
 just the ride also dvb-t looked 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.440
 can be presentations of companies 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.020
 we can deduce from 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.810
 camera we can while so to speak the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.360
 cook behind all can cook over their 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.670
 keep track of what's going on in the kitchen 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.260
 Our toilet is no longer the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.040
 original you before, so to speak 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
 was built 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.610
 but we have now on the yachts 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.370
 Construction of villa rooms requires one 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.250
 luxury flo can be installed and allowed to say 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.730
 it is also all well 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.500
 isolated so you really have it all 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.840
 we have a lot of peace right now 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.870
 appeared on potsdamer platz about alpha 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.240
 cars over and you can hear the almost even 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.310
 I would not say anything about the card 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.020
 of course, depending on how fast 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.820
 the menu should be sent and what 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.530
 for components arise up to 80 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.120
 We could also get people from the kitchen 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.950
 they really serve this 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.480
 challenge this compressed and challenging 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.000
 drive this 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.380
 because of course also that him the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.030
 whole logistical thing that everything 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.160
 because you do not have him like that 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.470
 A lot of space because you have everything so far so 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.850
 compress the whole thing that you 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.620
 you can quickly access that quickly 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.420
 but you have to be able to shoot warm as well 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.550
 At the same time, that's the way to clear it away 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.080
 next walk and so that is always a 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.250
 pure circulation and that of course 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.650
 these challenges 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.820
 So we have three in our office 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.950
 solid employees 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.760
 the rest were because the service staff 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.800
 And we always offer that to the head 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.390
 means we also have a firm 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:08.160
 team we have offerings year the 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.680
 at the beginning because 90 euro per person until 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.549
 no limits set to the top 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.660
 So a used tourist bus costs 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:22.610
 around the 150 200,000 euro and the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.610
 investment in the expansion was 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.270
 300,000 we will certainly in the future 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.270
 another second
