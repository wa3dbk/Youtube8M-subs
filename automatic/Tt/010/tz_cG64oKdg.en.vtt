00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
for this one the clue is flat top result

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.720 
for this one the clue is flat top result
so<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.850> have<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.060> piece<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.540> Tupperware<00:00:07.730> multi

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
so we have a piece of Tupperware multi

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.240 
so we have a piece of Tupperware multi
cache<00:00:08.940> so<00:00:09.240> this<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.660> only<00:00:09.780> stage<00:00:09.900> one<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:11.130> it

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
cache so this is only stage one and it

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.379 
cache so this is only stage one and it
says<00:00:12.740> just<00:00:13.740> complete<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.519> jigsaw<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.240> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:38.610 

we<00:00:29.660> could<00:00:29.930> be<00:00:30.050> here<00:00:30.290> sometime

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.740 

this<00:00:39.620> might<00:00:39.950> miss<00:00:40.280> sir<00:00:40.579> video<00:00:41.239> among<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.540> fast

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
this might miss sir video among it fast

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.960 
this might miss sir video among it fast
forwarded<00:00:42.430> because<00:00:43.430> I'm<00:00:43.550> sure<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:43.879> don't

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.400 

no<00:00:49.579> is<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:50.559> no<00:00:52.720> and<00:00:53.720> one<00:00:53.870> that's<00:00:54.079> because<00:00:54.260> that

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
no is it no and one that's because that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
no is it no and one that's because that
went<00:00:54.620> no<00:00:56.019> okay<00:00:58.960> mm-hmm<00:01:02.050> basically

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.560 

so<00:01:35.430> fast<00:01:35.700> forward<00:01:35.730> seven<00:01:36.180> minutes<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> put

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.790 
so fast forward seven minutes you put
you<00:01:36.660> complete<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.020> puzzle<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.620> going<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
you complete the puzzle and I'm going to

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.900 
you complete the puzzle and I'm going to
show<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.980> all<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.340> obvious<00:01:38.430> reasons<00:01:38.580> because

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
show it all for obvious reasons because

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.040 
show it all for obvious reasons because
then<00:01:39.090> you'll<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.420> whole<00:01:39.570> coordinates

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
then you'll see the whole coordinates

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.200 
then you'll see the whole coordinates
but<00:01:40.230> this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.220> we've<00:01:41.310> got<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:42.030> took

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
but this is what we've got good one took

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.520 
but this is what we've got good one took
we<00:01:42.300> like<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.510> say<00:01:42.630> about<00:01:42.780> seven<00:01:43.110> minutes<00:01:43.320> let's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
we like to say about seven minutes let's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.500 
we like to say about seven minutes let's
let's<00:01:44.340> follow<00:01:44.550> these<00:01:44.670> coordinates<00:01:45.120> and<00:01:45.270> see

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
let's follow these coordinates and see

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.610 
let's follow these coordinates and see
what<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.320> end<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.080> good<00:01:49.260> Maltese

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
what is at the end and all good Maltese

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.210 
what is at the end and all good Maltese
have<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.400> end<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.840> at<00:01:51.840> Fontana<00:01:52.220> which

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
have at the end of it at Fontana which
