farm<00:00:32.910> basics<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.540> today<00:00:33.780> we're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.110> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
farm basics and today we're going to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.690 
farm basics and today we're going to
talk<00:00:34.440> about<00:00:34.469> name-brand

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
talk about name-brand

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.760 
talk about name-brand
versus<00:00:36.149> generic<00:00:36.390> pesticides<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> same

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
versus generic pesticides it's the same

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.619 
versus generic pesticides it's the same
thing<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.430> pharmaceutical<00:00:39.270> products

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
thing like with pharmaceutical products

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.240 
thing like with pharmaceutical products
for<00:00:39.780> example<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.739> go<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.070> drugstore

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
for example you can go to the drugstore

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.150 
for example you can go to the drugstore
and<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:43.020> name-brand<00:00:43.530> product<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and here is one name-brand product and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.790 
and here is one name-brand product and
right<00:00:44.280> next<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.700> it'll<00:00:44.910> say<00:00:45.180> same<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.289> this

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
right next to it it'll say same as this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.279 
right next to it it'll say same as this
other<00:00:47.010> product<00:00:47.399> well<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.329> thing<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.629> with

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
other product well the thing is with

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.920 
other product well the thing is with
egg'<00:00:49.649> chemicals<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.579> isn't<00:00:51.059> necessarily

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
egg' chemicals it isn't necessarily

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
egg' chemicals it isn't necessarily
exactly<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> same<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.520> could<00:00:53.879> get<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
exactly the same so you could get a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.869 
exactly the same so you could get a
what's<00:00:55.020> called<00:00:55.260> generic<00:00:55.710> glyphosate<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
what's called generic glyphosate and it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.610 
what's called generic glyphosate and it
might<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.570> same<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:58.109> name-brand

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
might not be the same as name-brand

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.500 
might not be the same as name-brand
roundup<00:00:59.129> there<00:00:59.340> would<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.609> couple<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.149> main

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
roundup there would be a couple of main

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.240 
roundup there would be a couple of main
things<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.350> would<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.680> different<00:01:02.129> well

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
things that would be different well

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.439 
things that would be different well
there<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:02.579> some<00:01:02.789> major<00:01:03.090> differences

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
there are really some major differences

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
there are really some major differences
the<00:01:03.899> salt<00:01:04.260> could<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.680> different<00:01:05.070> there's<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the salt could be different there's a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.640 
the salt could be different there's a
four<00:01:05.790> pound<00:01:06.090> or<00:01:06.360> six<00:01:06.659> pound<00:01:06.930> product<00:01:07.470> on

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
four pound or six pound product on

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
four pound or six pound product on
different<00:01:08.250> salts<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> concentration<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
different salts of concentration the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.260 
different salts of concentration the
concentration<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.650> different<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.189> also<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
concentration is different and also the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
concentration is different and also the
surfactant<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.890> there's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
surfactant that's in there or if there's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219 
surfactant that's in there or if there's
any<00:01:14.189> surfactant<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.119> their<00:01:15.299> web<00:01:15.600> surfactant

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
any surfactant in their web surfactant

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.899 
any surfactant in their web surfactant
is<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:16.979> helps<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.490> product

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
is is that's what helps that product

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.480 
is is that's what helps that product
move<00:01:18.180> through<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.140> leaf<00:01:19.380> surface<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.340> get

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
move through the leaf surface and get

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
move through the leaf surface and get
into<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> plant<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> little

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
into the plant and if you have a little

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
into the plant and if you have a little
more<00:01:22.350> surfactant<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.400> gonna<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> little

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
more surfactant it's gonna be a little

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730 
more surfactant it's gonna be a little
more<00:01:24.119> consistent<00:01:24.810> throughout<00:01:25.140> variable

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
more consistent throughout variable

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.830 
more consistent throughout variable
weather<00:01:25.920> conditions<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:27.630> no

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
weather conditions and if you have no

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.140 
weather conditions and if you have no
surfactant<00:01:28.439> at<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.710> well<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.610> might<00:01:30.090> not

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
surfactant at all well it just might not

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330 
surfactant at all well it just might not
get<00:01:30.659> all<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.049> glyphosate<00:01:31.530> down<00:01:31.890> into<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
get all that glyphosate down into the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
get all that glyphosate down into the
leaf<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.329> big<00:01:33.630> difference<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> lot

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
leaf so that's a big difference in a lot

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
leaf so that's a big difference in a lot
of<00:01:34.439> these<00:01:34.590> products<00:01:35.009> yeah<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.400> that's<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
of these products yeah and that's just

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.819 
of these products yeah and that's just
on<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> technical<00:01:36.659> side<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.229> things<00:01:37.380> then

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
on the technical side of things then

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.249 
on the technical side of things then
there's<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> program<00:01:38.700> side<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.900> Darrin

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
there's the program side and like Darrin

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.039 
there's the program side and like Darrin
was<00:01:40.439> was<00:01:40.860> alluding<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> earlier<00:01:42.049> sometimes

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
was was alluding to earlier sometimes

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
service policy if it doesn't work they

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.380 
service policy if it doesn't work they
just<00:02:19.800> say<00:02:20.069> well<00:02:20.190> go<00:02:20.459> buy<00:02:20.610> some<00:02:20.849> more<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.239> try

just say well go buy some more and try

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.120 
just say well go buy some more and try
it<00:02:21.510> again<00:02:21.599> so<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.319> you're<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.620> product<00:02:22.860> like

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
it again so if you're in a product like

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.890 
it again so if you're in a product like
that<00:02:23.370> where<00:02:23.730> there<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.000> no<00:02:24.180> service<00:02:24.540> policy

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
that where there is no service policy

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.720 
that where there is no service policy
then<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.200> isn't<00:02:25.500> such<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.739> big<00:02:26.010> deal<00:02:26.160> which<00:02:26.489> one

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
then it isn't such a big deal which one

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.490 
then it isn't such a big deal which one
you<00:02:26.910> know<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.239> might<00:02:27.540> not<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.959> such<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> big<00:02:28.470> deal

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
you know it might not be such a big deal

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.690 
you know it might not be such a big deal
but<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.860> want<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.160> make<00:02:29.280> sure<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.580> the
