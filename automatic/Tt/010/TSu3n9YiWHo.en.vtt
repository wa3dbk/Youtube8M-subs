he<00:01:32.620> drowns<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:56.380> was<00:01:56.530> stuck<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.860> itself<00:01:57.070> -

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
he drowns that was stuck to itself -

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.920 
he drowns that was stuck to itself -
then<00:01:57.580> did<00:01:58.180> it<00:01:58.330> yeah<00:02:00.450> did<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.540> go<00:02:01.630> on<00:02:03.930> anyways

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
then did it yeah did it go on anyways

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.530 
then did it yeah did it go on anyways
that's<00:02:05.110> how<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.290> find<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.619> holes<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:07.149> a<00:02:07.270> lot

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
that's how you find the holes it's a lot

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.940 
that's how you find the holes it's a lot
easier<00:02:07.720> than<00:02:07.990> using<00:02:08.080> food<00:02:08.410> coloring<00:02:08.470> and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
easier than using food coloring and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.469 
easier than using food coloring and
turning<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.399> whole<00:02:09.520> pool<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:09.880> different<00:02:10.330> color

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
turning the whole pool a different color

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.240 
turning the whole pool a different color
yeah<00:02:11.020> because<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.260> didn't<00:02:11.530> work<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:11.920> that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
yeah because that didn't work and that

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.710 
yeah because that didn't work and that
usually<00:02:12.670> works<00:02:12.880> if<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.150> kind<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.450> have<00:02:13.600> an

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
usually works if you kind of have an

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.460 
usually works if you kind of have an
idea<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.110> where<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.350> holes<00:02:14.500> at<00:02:16.110> they<00:02:17.110> go<00:02:17.260> hold

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
idea of where the holes at they go hold

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.250 
idea of where the holes at they go hold
on<00:02:17.620> on<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.890> bottom
