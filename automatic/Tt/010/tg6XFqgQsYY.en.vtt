00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:10.920
 we go d money I leave 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:15.450
 okay today ok I 'll you 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 present now the gt i9000 5 it's 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.070
 the first smartphone that we bring and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.320
 it's a copy so called 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.840
 name of the original samsung escape 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.020
 it is true that it really looks like 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.210
 very very strong so it's very difficult 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:41.730
 to differentiate between this model 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:49.159
 he's the real it gets drunk rs4 kevin 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 jonas and indiana he has a sim card 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.730
 like the original 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:08.720
 so there another model yet another 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:11.230
 copy of s4 so we will go like the original 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.230
 apparently 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:36.729
 have been ratified 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.420
 my brother is closing 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.420
 Windows 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.259
 it is true that it is quite bluffing that 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.259
 the type of copies 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:16.170
 even the same interface is very close 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:19.290
 of the original and that's a fake in 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.400
 everything or because that's what 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.420
 gives the score 28 miles which is 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.590
 not at all real they even do 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.020
 until then do their info 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.880
 phone and do kring brakes in 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.580
 everything to import phones this 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.380
 they do is it covers the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.590
 samsung with a fake scriptures 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.540
 it goes away and below it marked 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.800
 samsung outright so here if you 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.390
 buy samsung escat on the internet at 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.460
 good prices there are big chances 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.370
 whether it's samsung like this 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:07.250
 and even the label here is the gt 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:11.470
 i9000 five exactly like the real thing 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.770
 so copy 1 1 as he calls here 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.600
 klein and in anthracite gray bel sil and 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:23.959
 in white so here better more original 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:34.480
 they did it downright in dual sim it 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:38.180
 call it the gt ll 95.02 is there again 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.739
 the name samsung scored hidden by a 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.739
 import label 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.810
 we see here again a copy 1 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.810
 on a htc one 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.410
 so there's not only samsung or apple that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.410
 are that are copied 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.810
 so they are really very well done 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.539
 okay it's really unless you're 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.050
 an expert very hard to make the 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.050
 difference 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:53.719
 poppy the samsung 4 they even have the same 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:56.029
 concert where we change the pages without 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:57.939
 touch the smartphone exactly like 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:02.509
 on ozone that do not just 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:06.529
 imitate easy milk look even the 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:11.029
 features today when we 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:13.159
 turn on it's the copy of s4 it's like 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:18.349
 the original have brands and samsung s 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:22.159
 4 so to me really once again 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.899
 trains really hope pretty much 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:30.259
 impossible to know if it's true or 

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:32.689
 false like when we look at 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:36.339
 applications they have the same interface 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.339
 that the original 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.719
 the title race 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.660
 with here even here we do not see well with 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.230
 reflections but the bar of icons as 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.230
 on samsung 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.610
 and the screen the screen well it's a 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:22.250
 screen y ps with good a good 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:28.870
 resolution so to wonder if they are 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:28.870
 not even produced in samsung factories 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:39.979
 so here I show you the slice of 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:42.490
 phone and everything is metal like on 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.490
 original
