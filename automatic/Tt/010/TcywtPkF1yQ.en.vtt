 We're going to do brunes today if you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.380
 My blog is never a delight 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.340
 once you try you do not 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.590
 Do you want to go back to the cake? 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.750
 chocolate because it is much better then it is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 super simple to make this recipe and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.580
 Let's talk to make this recipe. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 We 're going to need sugar eggs. 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.689
 melted chocolate and if I withdraw 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.910
 microwave and can have as you 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.910
 Prefer chocolate powder flour and knots 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.210
 the first thing we'll do 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.380
 then you put butter in a mixer 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.070
 the butter has to be at temperature 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.200
 environment to be able to hit and stay 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.900
 creamy that we are going to hit this 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.740
 butter with the sugar until it forms a 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.740
 cream pretty cuddly 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.049
 Now we'll do it and get more. 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.210
 four clean the corners of the flight 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.560
 those little corners that stick together 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.060
 some butter 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.460
 We'll clean up making sure that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:35.630
 it's okay cultural dinho and there 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:37.430
 people will put the chocolate put the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.420
 chocolate to my flour inside a 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.550
 sieve 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.009
 just to say that people who are not 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.310

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:52.119
 next blog and not only will it hurt 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.710
 s and we'll put that in 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.050
 of our mix, you see how the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.910
 little chocolate nuts do not get 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.850
 to reap only that we do not 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:12.769
 any Brazil within our 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:15.560
 our our I'll just give a mixture 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.079
 money here and we 'll start 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.640
 incorporate this into our mass of 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.640
 put with the league cup 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.159
 ready our mix is â€‹â€‹ready 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.780
 make sure you do not mix 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.450
 when you put the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.000
 dry ingredients so that you do not 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.540
 a very heavy mass what we are going to 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.599
 do now just put the knots of a 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.290
 mixture of people we'll put 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.019
 inside the chair to finally stay 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.000
 ready to eat there sobral has 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.329
 various types of plans is usually 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.819
 When you research on the blog they 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.760
 fall into three categories 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.590
 the blog that is like a sip that is a 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.459
 light mass as well as from a 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.989
 even a chocolate goal that is 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.200
 middle chocolate that is half chocolate 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.540
 cookie and another they call Fanti 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.959
 that I could not find a 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.099
 Portuguese translation but it's the goal 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.750
 what are we doing here is Brazil 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.959
 that we are doing here that he is 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.549
 super wet is heavier and to my type 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.799
 I prefer to say that this is the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.239
 the more delicious it is worth it 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.739
 This is what I'm showing you. 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.069
 here a baking sheet this one more or 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.579
 less the size of 20 by 31 if a 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.280
 small can also be a square 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.919
 hard type lex that mark is square 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.549
 is smaller than our blog it stays in 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:48.489
 It's true, it gets thinner, it's not for 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.560
 it does not grow so size you 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.120
 put it will stay because we do not 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.769
 You're adding yeast here, then. 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.949
 the mass does not grow 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.840
 I'm going to do it now, just spread my word. 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.010
 Okay, well, it's okay, I put paper. 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.540
 butter 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.540
 we got to inform 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.610
 the beaches stayed way 25 minutes I 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.850
 I put it in the oven preheated to 180 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.640
 degrees and then I informed them I left 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.960
 it cooled a little I informed and we are going 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.880
 see how it went, right? 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.220
 If you know me, you know what I 'm going to do. 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.690
 now I'll put some sugar 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.090
 confectioner just to make cute 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.710
 I think it gives a lot more presentation 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.110
 cool for our work 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.240
 I put some of us here in the middle just to 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.290
 decorate to show that they have well 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:50.910
 now we will only cut and see how it is 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:54.330
 that it was delicious to take a piece that 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.330
 I like 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.680
 careful not to leave him too long 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.790
 in the oven so he does not get much 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.770
 knowing that he has to be well 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.260
 wet inside he 's fine 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:10.800
 That 's the way it has to be. 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.800
 It gets very wet in Mexico. 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.700
 Do you need melted chocolate? 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.830
 even to have this flavor because if you 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.810
 put in only dust will happen that goes 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.110

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.530

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.530
