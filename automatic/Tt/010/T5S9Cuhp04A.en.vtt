are not shown in this animation but you
get<00:01:33.100> an<00:01:33.190> idea<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.820> pipe<00:01:34.090> goes<00:01:34.360> down<00:01:34.930> to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
get an idea that that pipe goes down to

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.070 
get an idea that that pipe goes down to
about<00:01:35.560> four<00:01:36.460> inches<00:01:36.850> above<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.420> bottom<00:01:37.990> of

the tank

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.050 
the tank
then<00:01:39.400> we<00:01:39.670> have<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.210> outflow<00:01:40.960> pipe<00:01:41.350> for<00:01:41.800> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
then we have the outflow pipe for the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.660 
then we have the outflow pipe for the
overflow<00:01:43.060> for<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.780> spent<00:01:44.290> fuel<00:01:44.950> if<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.460> like

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
overflow for the spent fuel if you like

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.210 
overflow for the spent fuel if you like
and<00:01:45.910> it's<00:01:46.720> just<00:01:46.840> screwed<00:01:47.740> right<00:01:47.770> into<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
and it's just screwed right into the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.100 
and it's just screwed right into the
side<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.670> tank<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.090> then<00:01:49.210> curves<00:01:49.510> up<00:01:49.900> and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
side of the tank and then curves up and

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.200 
side of the tank and then curves up and
then<00:01:50.800> down<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.310> has<00:01:51.400> a<00:01:51.430> valve<00:01:51.730> so<00:01:51.970> we<00:01:52.030> can

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
then down and has a valve so we can

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.240 
then down and has a valve so we can
build<00:01:52.390> up<00:01:52.600> gas<00:01:52.900> pressure<00:01:53.320> when<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:53.950> open<00:01:54.220> that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
build up gas pressure when you open that

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.090 
build up gas pressure when you open that

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.780 
and when that valve is open that red
valve<00:03:43.080> going<00:03:43.799> back<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.190> tank<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.580> water

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
valve going back in the tank the water

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.970 
valve going back in the tank the water
will<00:03:45.390> then<00:03:45.630> fill<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.080> tank<00:03:46.290> up<00:03:46.530> again<00:03:46.830> and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
will then fill that tank up again and

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.800 
will then fill that tank up again and
push<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.370> grass<00:03:47.549> out<00:03:47.850> when<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.480> close<00:03:48.780> that

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
push the grass out when you close that

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.650 
push the grass out when you close that
valve<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.680> open<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.790> valve<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.390> sump

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
valve and open the valve to the sump

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.539 
valve and open the valve to the sump
bucket<00:03:52.019> then<00:03:52.319> as<00:03:52.680> you're<00:03:52.860> making<00:03:52.980> more<00:03:53.280> gas

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
bucket then as you're making more gas

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.490 
bucket then as you're making more gas
you<00:03:53.790> fill<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.060> sub<00:03:54.269> bucket<00:03:54.600> which<00:03:54.930> pumps<00:03:55.260> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
you fill the sub bucket which pumps the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.680 
you fill the sub bucket which pumps the
water<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.790> bladder<00:03:56.970> pressure<00:03:57.269> tank

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
water to the bladder pressure tank

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.979 
water to the bladder pressure tank
here's<00:03:58.680> where<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.130> gas<00:03:59.549> comes<00:04:00.030> out<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.750> go<00:04:00.930> to

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
here's where the gas comes out to go to

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.390 
here's where the gas comes out to go to
the<00:04:01.200> kitchen<00:04:01.380> stove<00:04:01.769> over<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.069> go<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
the kitchen stove over to go to the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.970 
the kitchen stove over to go to the
generator<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.480> we<00:04:03.660> showed<00:04:03.930> comes<00:04:04.650> out<00:04:04.829> of

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
generator that we showed comes out of

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.020 
generator that we showed comes out of
the<00:04:05.070> very<00:04:05.250> top<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.359> gas<00:04:06.630> collective<00:04:07.380> tank

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
the very top of the gas collective tank

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.560 
the very top of the gas collective tank
so<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.299> gas<00:04:09.630> collector<00:04:10.260> tank<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:11.180> made<00:04:12.180> to

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
so the gas collector tank is made to

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.590 
so the gas collector tank is made to
create<00:04:12.750> high-pressure<00:04:13.620> gas<00:04:14.220> when<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.030> top

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
create high-pressure gas when the top

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.930 
create high-pressure gas when the top
tank<00:04:15.930> or<00:04:16.169> water<00:04:16.380> pressure<00:04:16.560> tank<00:04:17.039> is<00:04:17.220> filled

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
tank or water pressure tank is filled

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.090 
tank or water pressure tank is filled
and<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.299> valve<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:18.930> opened<00:04:19.289> here<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:20.070> a

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
and that valve is opened here is a

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.840 
and that valve is opened here is a

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.990 
backyard in south-central Los Angeles
and<00:04:26.180> here<00:04:27.180> is<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.870> proof<00:04:28.289> of<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:29.310> working<00:04:29.880> as

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
and here is the proof of it working as

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.420 
and here is the proof of it working as
you<00:04:30.539> can<00:04:30.720> see<00:04:30.930> when<00:04:31.110> he<00:04:31.169> opens<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.770> valve<00:04:32.010> on

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
you can see when he opens the valve on

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.840 
you can see when he opens the valve on
the<00:04:32.880> gas<00:04:33.270> collector<00:04:34.020> he<00:04:34.500> gets<00:04:34.740> flame<00:04:35.160> I'll

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
the gas collector he gets flame I'll

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.550 
the gas collector he gets flame I'll
explain<00:04:36.300> more<00:04:36.510> later<00:04:36.810> when<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.050> have<00:04:37.200> more<00:04:37.380> time

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
explain more later when I have more time

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.200 
explain more later when I have more time
to<00:04:37.740> make<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.890> more<00:04:38.070> detailed<00:04:38.400> video<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.910> hope

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
to make a more detailed video I hope

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.280 
to make a more detailed video I hope
that<00:04:39.270> helps<00:04:40.169> Thanks<00:04:41.010> bye
