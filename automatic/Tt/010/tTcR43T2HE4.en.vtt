00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
in so I had a couple of those but I

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
in so I had a couple of those but I
thought<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> heck<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.710> know<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:29.070> $10<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
thought what the heck you know for $10 a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.289 
thought what the heck you know for $10 a
box<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.210> thought<00:01:30.420> why<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.320> give<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.890> shot

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
box I thought why not give it a shot

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.719 
box I thought why not give it a shot
so<00:01:33.299> anyway<00:01:33.689> opened<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.290> those<00:01:34.470> boxes<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.520> didn't

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
so anyway opened up those boxes I didn't

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.980 
so anyway opened up those boxes I didn't
want<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> put<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.210> video<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> was
