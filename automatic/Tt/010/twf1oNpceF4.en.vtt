00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
be able to grasp onto the hair so they

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.609 
be able to grasp onto the hair so they
can<00:01:39.329> pull<00:01:39.479> them<00:01:39.570> out<00:01:39.659> same<00:01:40.259> thing<00:01:40.290> goes<00:01:40.530> with

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.910 
shave my legs for this video that's
scary<00:01:47.960> okay<00:01:48.960> why<00:01:49.200> don't<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.350> guys<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.710> how<00:01:49.799> it

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
scary okay why don't you guys see how it

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.730 
scary okay why don't you guys see how it
works<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.369> couldn't<00:01:50.759> shave<00:01:51.030> okay<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.710> has

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
works I couldn't shave okay so it has

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.039 
works I couldn't shave okay so it has
speeds<00:01:53.520> usually<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> low<00:01:54.479> speed<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
speeds usually like a low speed and a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749 
speeds usually like a low speed and a
high<00:01:55.200> speed<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> low<00:01:56.460> speed

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
high speed they have the low speed

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.310 
high speed they have the low speed
because<00:01:56.969> sometimes<00:01:57.540> people<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> better

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
because sometimes people like it better

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.050 
because sometimes people like it better
to<00:01:58.590> keep<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.189> got<00:01:59.369> attacked<00:01:59.549> by<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.729> rooster

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to keep it I got attacked by a rooster

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.120 
to keep it I got attacked by a rooster
right<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.479> when<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:01.130> sometimes

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
right there when I was little sometimes

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.289 
right there when I was little sometimes
people<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.579> keep<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> low<00:02:03.270> speed

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
people like to keep it at a low speed

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.670 
people like to keep it at a low speed
when<00:02:03.750> they're<00:02:03.869> dealing<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.110> coarse<00:02:04.439> hair

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
when they're dealing with coarse hair

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.469 
when they're dealing with coarse hair
like<00:02:04.920> leg<00:02:05.100> hair<00:02:05.369> because<00:02:06.030> sometimes<00:02:06.299> when<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
like leg hair because sometimes when the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.930 
like leg hair because sometimes when the
speed<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> too<00:02:06.990> high<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.799> moves<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.369> fast<00:02:08.640> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
speed is too high it moves so fast that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.369 
speed is too high it moves so fast that
it's<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.330> breaking<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> hair<00:02:10.229> off

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
it's just like breaking the hair off

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.960 
it's just like breaking the hair off
instead<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.860> pulling<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.250> out<00:02:11.430> which<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.730> what

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
instead of pulling it out which is what

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.730 
instead of pulling it out which is what
we<00:02:12.060> want

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
we want

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.860 
we want
so<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.760> mean<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.000> can<00:02:14.090> try<00:02:14.210> both<00:02:14.390> ways<00:02:14.600> they

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
so I mean you can try both ways they

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.300 
so I mean you can try both ways they
might<00:02:15.020> work<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.410> high<00:02:15.530> speed<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:16.130> what

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
might work on high speed for you what

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.620 
might work on high speed for you what
you<00:02:16.370> want<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.640> do<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:16.940> want<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.120> pull<00:02:17.390> the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
you want to do is you want to pull the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.230 
you want to do is you want to pull the
skin<00:02:17.960> with<00:02:18.260> one<00:02:18.650> hand<00:02:19.010> as<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:20.290> softly<00:02:21.290> glide

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
skin with one hand as you softly glide

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.300 
skin with one hand as you softly glide
against<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.390> grain<00:02:23.690> with<00:02:24.290> your<00:02:24.440> epilator<00:02:24.890> in

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
against the grain with your epilator in

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.300 
against the grain with your epilator in
the<00:02:25.730> other<00:02:25.880> hand<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.440> pretty<00:02:28.040> painful

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
the other hand and it is pretty painful

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.580 
the other hand and it is pretty painful
so<00:02:28.640> sometimes<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.150> tend<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.390> go<00:02:29.540> faster<00:02:30.050> than

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
so sometimes I tend to go faster than

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.200 
so sometimes I tend to go faster than
other<00:02:30.830> times<00:02:31.160> but<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.700> should<00:02:31.850> try<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.000> go<00:02:32.150> as

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
other times but you should try to go as

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.790 
other times but you should try to go as
slow<00:02:32.360> as<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.600> possibly<00:02:33.020> can<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.470> it's<00:02:33.620> getting

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
slow as you possibly can so it's getting

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.220 
slow as you possibly can so it's getting
all<00:02:34.100> over<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.370> hairs<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:36.020> how<00:02:36.110> it's

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
all over the hairs and you see how it's

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.630 
all over the hairs and you see how it's
starting<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.560> kind<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.770> turn<00:02:36.920> red<00:02:37.190> like<00:02:37.400> that

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
starting to kind of turn red like that

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.950 
starting to kind of turn red like that
that's<00:02:38.090> why<00:02:38.240> it's<00:02:38.360> better<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.660> do<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.840> at<00:02:38.930> night

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
that's why it's better to do it at night

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.300 
that's why it's better to do it at night
because<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.710> don't<00:02:39.860> really<00:02:39.950> know<00:02:40.130> how<00:02:40.250> long

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
because you don't really know how long

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.830 
because you don't really know how long
it's<00:02:40.640> gonna<00:02:40.730> stay<00:02:40.970> red<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.420> usually<00:02:41.540> goes

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
it's gonna stay red but it usually goes

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.380 
it's gonna stay red but it usually goes
away<00:02:41.870> within<00:02:42.470> like<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.710> half<00:02:42.920> an<00:02:43.040> hour<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.520> I've

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
away within like a half an hour and I've

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.790 
away within like a half an hour and I've
been<00:02:44.510> using<00:02:44.660> this<00:02:44.780> for<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.990> few<00:02:45.170> months<00:02:45.440> now

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
been using this for a few months now

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.820 
been using this for a few months now
and<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.400> really<00:02:47.140> think<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.380> it's<00:02:48.530> actually

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
and I really think that it's actually

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.710 
and I really think that it's actually
worth<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.370> money<00:02:49.610> because<00:02:50.000> your<00:02:50.180> hair<00:02:50.390> kind

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
worth the money because your hair kind

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.330 
worth the money because your hair kind
of<00:02:50.900> well<00:02:51.260> my<00:02:51.410> hair<00:02:51.590> doesn't<00:02:51.740> grow<00:02:51.920> back<00:02:51.980> for

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
of well my hair doesn't grow back for

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.920 
of well my hair doesn't grow back for
like<00:02:52.430> another<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:53.180> know<00:02:53.270> week<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.630> half<00:02:53.660> to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
like another you know week and a half to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.320 
like another you know week and a half to
two<00:02:54.080> weeks<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:55.190> it's<00:02:55.460> actually<00:02:55.610> kind<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.000> worth

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
two weeks so it's actually kind of worth

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.660 
two weeks so it's actually kind of worth
the<00:02:56.690> investment<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:57.260> only<00:02:57.380> paid<00:02:57.560> $40<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.520> you

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
the investment I only paid $40 and you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.190 
the investment I only paid $40 and you
think<00:02:58.940> how<00:02:59.120> much<00:02:59.300> do<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.540> actually<00:02:59.720> spend<00:02:59.960> on

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
think how much do you actually spend on

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.290 
think how much do you actually spend on
like<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.980> know<00:03:01.100> razor<00:03:01.370> replacements<00:03:02.210> and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
like you know razor replacements and
