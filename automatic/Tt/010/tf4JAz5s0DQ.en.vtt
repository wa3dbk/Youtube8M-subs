at<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.340> third<00:01:58.549> one<00:01:58.820> down<00:01:59.030> now<00:01:59.329> same<00:02:00.140> minor<00:02:00.619> 7

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
at the third one down now same minor 7

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.789 
at the third one down now same minor 7
chord<00:02:01.070> voicing<00:02:01.880> right<00:02:02.390> this<00:02:03.259> time<00:02:03.470> I<00:02:03.530> went

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
chord voicing right this time I went

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.559 
chord voicing right this time I went
down<00:02:04.369> okay<00:02:06.820> now<00:02:07.820> we<00:02:07.880> know<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.119> that's<00:02:08.450> a

little bit low you might be able to get
away<00:02:10.459> with<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:11.830> okay<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.040> then<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.260> c<00:02:15.260> major

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
away with it okay and then to c major

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.640 
away with it okay and then to c major
seven<00:02:15.680> if<00:02:16.099> i<00:02:16.190> do<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.550> up<00:02:16.940> an<00:02:17.209> octave<00:02:17.300> i<00:02:17.630> get<00:02:18.190> that

this sounds nice do u minor 7 right
built<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.069> fourths<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:29.049> this<00:02:30.049> is<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.830> g7

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
built in fourths and this is the g7

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.740 
built in fourths and this is the g7
built<00:02:33.019> on<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.290> flat<00:02:33.530> 5<00:02:33.799> right<00:02:34.310> right<00:02:35.269> could

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
built on the flat 5 right right could

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.380 
built on the flat 5 right right could
also<00:02:35.930> do<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:39.349> then<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.860> go<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.209> c<00:02:41.209> major
