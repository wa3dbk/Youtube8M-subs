 each side with one 2 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.260
 but 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.260
 on each side a little 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.250
 excess salt do not be afraid then about 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.250

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.450
 enough salt 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.970
 the next thing we do is take the mixture 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.970
 peppers and start learning 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.710
 just from all sides 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.619
 enough and add garlic 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.070
 before that , we usually wipe 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.650
 so that at least the smell was garlic new 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:21.680
 zealous garlic thats of course 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:26.600
 if you do not like the essence of pain and pound 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.190
 now salt pepper we put it all 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.190
 a piece of bacon package 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.209
 garlic and forget there is lard 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.359
 send for a day in the fridge here we are 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.790
 arrived at the cottage we need 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.110
 electric stove 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.510
 sawdust 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.880
 buddy papik our sa and large capacity 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.190
 for file 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:07.260
 and most importantly the picture unit 1 is that 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.780
 we make sawdust and man throw 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.510
 shooting with water 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.310
 for the matches well 20 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.250
 we don't need the full package somewhere 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.250
 sprinkle less than half 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:36.030
 so sawdust by the way chips alder although this 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:41.840
 sawdust and wood chips 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.840

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.520
 soak 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:04.730
 the first thing we do but put somewhere 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.690
 here and turn to the most possible 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:15.340
 I have four after this small 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:15.340
 Amount saw take and leveled 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.250
 wait for smoke after that 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:34.620
 put the interior until the stove heats up 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.620
 the cabin itself is the usual 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.259
 so the second piece 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.610
 we pierce 

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:58.800
 such. 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.310

 put the pallet 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:18.510

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:22.450
 cross members 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.060
 hang villages and cook all these two hours 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:33.760

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:36.460

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.650
 by water 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.830
 You can put what is not a load to 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.520
