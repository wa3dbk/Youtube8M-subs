00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.630
 Hello, today's video I want 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.250
 dedicate so powerful let's say 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.879
 culture 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.030
 which is called a walnut or rather 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.010
 seedlings 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.790
 walnut in every nursery 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.220
 who is engaged in growing 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.220
 planting material often remain 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:54.059
 so-called overgrown saplings 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:58.579
 which are no longer subject to transplantation such 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:03.239
 seedlings are usually either discarded or 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.899
 they drop out for themselves and we have about 5 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.000
 years ago 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:14.550
 about 20 walnut seedlings left 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.220
 walnut their age was already 4 year and for 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.399
 walnut produce additive 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.539
 preferably up to the age of three 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.170
 so since we have these 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.590
 seedlings 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 we decided to disembark them and see 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.289
 what happens about five years have passed 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.610
 last year, these nuts gave the first 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:39.060
 harvest and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:42.720
 we were pleasantly surprised namely water 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.950
 on some trees were larger 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.149
 than the fruit of the mother tree now I tell you 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.310
 show them here is the second fruiting 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.569
 last year was the first of this year 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:03.929
 the second fruiting is not quite small 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:09.170
 a nut is by the way one tree here side by side 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:11.900
 growing second distance between trees 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:18.590
 makes one and a half meters 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.590
 the rivers on this tree are slightly smaller than 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.150
 on a tree growing next so this 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:31.660
 tree we remove from here remove this nut 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.900
 we will leave as he surpassed 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.840
 your parent is now very online 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.050
 much information about the vaccinated 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.750
 walnuts price per sapling 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.330
 grafted walnut is quite high price for 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.810
 seedling 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:55.600
 seedlings two to three times lower than the price 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:59.620
 grafted seedlings here we grow 10 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:04.240
 nuts five of them are absolutely not 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.390
 different from the mother tree in two 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.520
 nuts fruit is much larger than that 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.410
 mother tree three trees 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.350
 turned out worse than the mother 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.790
 hence 70 percent maternal 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.150
 before the breed is passed 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.540
 if you produce a simple math 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:31.080
 calculation can be calculated that 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:34.720
 pretty cost effective to plant all the others 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.370
 seedlings some part then from 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.070
 is rejected but the greater number 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.730
 will remain the same can save 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.370
 material costs are secondarily 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.420
 the seedling will always be stronger and stronger 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.209
 there is no grafted seedling 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.900
 disappears the likelihood of breakage of breaking 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.570
 seedlings so here is such a simple 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.680
 experiment we spent spending on it 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:07.280
 just some ten years so if u 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:13.040
 you have on the plot 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:16.280
 good tree that gives nuts 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:21.889
 which is easy to clean which is light 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.370
 grain do not be afraid of all these sow extra 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.950
 then from the rejects do not need extra 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.700
 you will remain very competitive 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.970
 capable of 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.150
 trees that will bring 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.150
 certain income
