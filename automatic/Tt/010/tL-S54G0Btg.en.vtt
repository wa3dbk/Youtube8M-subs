00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.160
 toilet inconveniences like themselves 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.210

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.700

 say the Russian customs is 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.659
 all trucks stand along the road and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.150
 the rest of the transport does not interfere 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.100
 ofigenii new rules foreign 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.650
 transport companies have been warned 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 advance and major carriers long ago 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.610
 issued all the necessary documents of their 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.860
 transport passes without problems 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.750
 many carriers were not ready for 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.009
 innovations despite being 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 previously warned 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.509
 customs authorities of the south have ceased 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.100
 use the TIR books as 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.930
 the only way to ensure 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.840
 compliance with customs transit 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.799
 without additional security measures 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.850
 stipulated by the customs code 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.200
 customs union 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.149
 the main problem is that on 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.960
 the territory of the customs union transit 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.689
 freight transport 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.329
 can no longer go on the books 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.799
 international association 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.380
 carriers to these documents are needed 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.780
 Now additional documents issue 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.270
 they can be here on the spot it takes 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.129
 about 20 minutes but it all depends on 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.290
 carrier he should care and 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.269
 about their parents 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.400
 I have correctly written documents 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.170
 Probably, therefore, forecasts for 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.829
 As even disappear queue 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.379
 boundaries 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.040
