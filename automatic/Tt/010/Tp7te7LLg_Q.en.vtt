00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.310 

it<00:01:28.070> heats<00:01:28.280> up<00:01:28.490> pretty<00:01:28.640> quickly<00:01:29.119> we<00:01:30.110> won't

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
it heats up pretty quickly we won't

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.039 
it heats up pretty quickly we won't
write<00:01:30.590> far<00:01:30.950> on<00:01:31.130> is<00:01:31.310> pretty<00:01:31.580> crap<00:01:31.880> but<00:01:32.720> if<00:01:32.840> one

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
write far on is pretty crap but if one

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.450 
write far on is pretty crap but if one
of<00:01:33.080> these<00:01:33.580> bullets<00:01:34.580> lands<00:01:34.850> on<00:01:35.060> your<00:01:35.180> own<00:01:35.360> craft

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
of these bullets lands on your own craft

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.920 
of these bullets lands on your own craft
specialist<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.670> fighter<00:01:38.000> like<00:01:38.150> their<00:01:38.570> what<00:01:38.810> I'm

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
specialist a fighter like their what I'm

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.460 
specialist a fighter like their what I'm
going<00:01:39.110> be<00:01:39.650> I<00:01:39.680> think<00:01:40.190> is<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:41.840> could<00:01:42.080> take<00:01:42.259> my

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
going be I think is it could take my

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.600 
going be I think is it could take my
I've<00:01:42.590> got<00:01:42.740> off<00:01:42.950> his<00:01:43.130> healthy<00:01:43.490> here<00:01:45.610> very

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
I've got off his healthy here very

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.749 
I've got off his healthy here very
quickly<00:01:46.759> it's<00:01:47.149> just<00:01:47.360> with<00:01:47.540> one<00:01:47.720> bullet<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:49.250> you

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
quickly it's just with one bullet so you

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.460 
quickly it's just with one bullet so you
know<00:01:50.000> game<00:01:50.270> right<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.750> pretty<00:01:51.049> good<00:01:51.259> for

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
know game right this is pretty good for

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.300 
know game right this is pretty good for
my<00:01:51.740> with<00:01:53.170> it's<00:01:54.170> slightly<00:01:54.560> slower<00:01:54.979> than<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
my with it's slightly slower than the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.830 
my with it's slightly slower than the
other<00:01:55.399> aircraft<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.030> think<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.450> doesn't

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
other aircraft I think it doesn't

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.330 
other aircraft I think it doesn't
really

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.430 

time<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.150> speed<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.960> weapons<00:02:01.320> have

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
time to speed the weapons have

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.710 
time to speed the weapons have
overheated<00:02:01.920> after<00:02:02.220> it's<00:02:02.369> very<00:02:02.720> maneuverable

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
overheated after it's very maneuverable

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.020 
overheated after it's very maneuverable
you<00:02:03.750> could<00:02:04.170> fly<00:02:04.680> around<00:02:04.830> there<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.640> he<00:02:05.820> won't

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you could fly around there and he won't

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.839 
you could fly around there and he won't
have<00:02:06.240> any<00:02:06.420> issues<00:02:07.399> see

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
have any issues see

have any issues see
some<00:02:10.539> trees<00:02:10.869> accidentally<00:02:11.560> because<00:02:11.769> it<00:02:11.890> does

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
some trees accidentally because it does

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.470 
some trees accidentally because it does
was<00:02:12.249> great<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.640> do

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
was great to do

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.170 
was great to do
but<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:16.040> kind<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.099> arm<00:02:17.400> will<00:02:17.580> new<00:02:17.730> health<00:02:18.000> you

I'm<00:02:33.810> shooting<00:02:34.050> at<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:35.550> best<00:02:35.730> not<00:02:35.880> to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
I'm shooting at you so it's best not to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.780 
I'm shooting at you so it's best not to
taking<00:02:36.330> bombers<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.870> only<00:02:37.620> fighters<00:02:38.130> and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
taking bombers and only fighters and

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.089 
taking bombers and only fighters and
it's<00:02:39.300> better<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.750> get<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:40.110> that's<00:02:40.410> how<00:02:40.709> rather

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
it's better to get one that's how rather

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.940 
it's better to get one that's how rather
than<00:02:41.250> taking<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.760> head<00:02:41.970> first<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.650> with<00:02:43.800> other

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
than taking the head first so with other

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.100 
than taking the head first so with other
aircraft<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.880> peplum<00:02:45.270> IG<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.870> take

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
aircraft like the peplum IG you can take

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.640 
aircraft like the peplum IG you can take
one<00:02:46.290> aircraft<00:02:46.610> on<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:49.080> can't<00:02:49.410> do<00:02:49.590> that

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
one aircraft on this you can't do that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:59.449 
one aircraft on this you can't do that
you<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.800> see<00:02:55.010> hit<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.130> BF<00:02:56.370> 109e<00:02:57.269> here<00:02:58.459> big

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
you can see hit the BF 109e here big

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.850 
you can see hit the BF 109e here big
breasts<00:02:59.819> I<00:03:00.030> just<00:03:00.269> use<00:03:00.780> don't<00:03:01.019> take<00:03:01.260> Scouts<00:03:01.590> car

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
breasts I just use don't take Scouts car

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.530 
breasts I just use don't take Scouts car
ain't<00:03:02.099> going<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.430> make<00:03:02.519> that<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.209> it's<00:03:03.330> always

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
ain't going to make that so it's always

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.790 
ain't going to make that so it's always
when<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:03.930> one<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.080> them<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.349> target

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
when you can get one of them on target

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000 
when you can get one of them on target
it's<00:03:05.459> pretty<00:03:05.850> airplane<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.410> say<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:07.799> quite

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
it's pretty airplane and say it's quite

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.839 
it's pretty airplane and say it's quite
maneuverable<00:03:08.250> and

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.500 

so<00:03:11.390> yeah<00:03:11.599> in<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.079> little<00:03:12.790> mid-engined<00:03:13.790> white

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
so yeah in this little mid-engined white

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.500 
so yeah in this little mid-engined white
apply<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.930> sole<00:03:15.849> when<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:17.030> actually<00:03:17.329> makes

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
apply the sole when the actually makes

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.989 
apply the sole when the actually makes
the<00:03:17.689> difference<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.139> game<00:03:18.799> how<00:03:19.249> it<00:03:19.370> works<00:03:19.609> I'm

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:19.999 
the difference the game how it works I'm

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:26.440 
the difference the game how it works I'm
not<00:03:20.209> too<00:03:20.389> sure<00:03:23.590> climb<00:03:24.590> rate<00:03:24.829> is<00:03:24.950> quite<00:03:25.159> good

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
not too sure climb rate is quite good

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.400 
not too sure climb rate is quite good
I've<00:03:26.900> had<00:03:27.170> better

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
I've had better

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.890 
I've had better
doctors<00:03:29.920> only<00:03:30.190> got<00:03:30.370> three<00:03:30.910> machine<00:03:31.240> guns<00:03:31.270> be

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
doctors only got three machine guns be

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.470 
doctors only got three machine guns be
that<00:03:32.080> good<00:03:32.290> as<00:03:32.470> suppose<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:34.060> better<00:03:34.240> to<00:03:34.390> have

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
that good as suppose it's better to have

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.790 
that good as suppose it's better to have
four<00:03:34.950> when<00:03:35.950> he<00:03:36.040> gets<00:03:36.220> up<00:03:36.340> with<00:03:36.490> five<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.800> I

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
four when he gets up with five so I

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.620 
four when he gets up with five so I
don't<00:03:39.130> know<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.520> don't<00:03:39.760> really<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.240> flying

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
don't know I don't really like flying

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.450 
don't know I don't really like flying
this<00:03:40.840> one<00:03:41.080> as<00:03:41.200> much<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.740> maneuverability<00:03:42.400> as

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
this one as much the maneuverability as

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.320 
this one as much the maneuverability as
good<00:03:42.700> as<00:03:42.850> I<00:03:42.970> said<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.980> for<00:03:45.250> overall<00:03:45.970> we're

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
good as I said but for overall we're

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.430 
good as I said but for overall we're
craft<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.990> when<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.260> said<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.680> would<00:03:47.830> be<00:03:47.860> worth

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
craft and when I said it would be worth

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.400 
craft and when I said it would be worth
money<00:03:50.440> he<00:03:50.770> has<00:03:51.310> kind<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.730> three<00:03:52.030> big<00:03:52.330> problems

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.300 

just<00:03:55.980> get<00:03:56.160> away<00:03:56.250> across<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.450> galaxy<00:03:58.320> is<00:03:58.410> did

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
just get away across the galaxy is did

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.410 
just get away across the galaxy is did
you<00:03:59.430> forget

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
you forget

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.230 
you forget
Jenny<00:04:01.110> better<00:04:01.410> eyedrops<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.250> mean<00:04:02.520> where<00:04:02.790> that

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
Jenny better eyedrops I mean where that

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.059 
Jenny better eyedrops I mean where that
plus<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.690> brilliant<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.410> just

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.080 

so<00:04:09.700> yeah<00:04:09.909> that's<00:04:10.120> become<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.450> bit<00:04:10.659> really

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.069 

the<00:04:15.090> weapons<00:04:15.450> have<00:04:15.569> overheated<00:04:16.430> see<00:04:17.430> that

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:35.710 

place<00:04:22.079> this<00:04:22.320> was<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> doubtless

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.600 

sorry

yeah<00:04:39.120> they've<00:04:39.300> been<00:04:39.330> pretty<00:04:39.569> much<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.900> say

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
yeah they've been pretty much to say

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.390 
yeah they've been pretty much to say
about<00:04:40.319> this<00:04:40.500> aircraft

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
about this aircraft

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.429 
about this aircraft

if<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:45.979> get<00:04:46.189> here<00:04:46.399> too<00:04:47.499> quickly

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:49.899 
if you get here too quickly

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:52.089 
if you get here too quickly
it's<00:04:50.899> up<00:04:51.019> to<00:04:51.169> you<00:04:51.319> really<00:04:51.349> that's<00:04:51.830> what<00:04:52.069> I

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
it's up to you really that's what I

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.429 
it's up to you really that's what I
think<00:04:52.369> the<00:04:52.610> aircraft<00:04:52.939> anyway<00:04:53.330> as<00:04:53.989> you<00:04:54.169> can<00:04:54.319> see

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
think the aircraft anyway as you can see

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.199 
think the aircraft anyway as you can see
you<00:04:54.559> get<00:04:54.739> quite<00:04:54.979> a<00:04:55.009> lot<00:04:55.189> of<00:04:55.219> points<00:04:55.639> if<00:04:55.879> you<00:04:55.999> win

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:56.209 
you get quite a lot of points if you win

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:57.399 
you get quite a lot of points if you win
the<00:04:56.360> game<00:04:56.509> with<00:04:56.749> this<00:04:56.899> because<00:04:57.110> it's<00:04:57.319> a

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
the game with this because it's a

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.070 
the game with this because it's a
premium<00:04:57.769> aircraft<00:04:58.449> but<00:04:59.449> I<00:04:59.479> just<00:04:59.779> think<00:04:59.929> you

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
premium aircraft but I just think you

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.040 
premium aircraft but I just think you
risk<00:05:00.349> dime<00:05:01.249> quite<00:05:01.939> quickly<00:05:02.300> unless<00:05:02.659> you're

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
risk dime quite quickly unless you're

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.829 
risk dime quite quickly unless you're
able<00:05:03.529> to<00:05:04.449> deal<00:05:05.449> with<00:05:07.389> maneuvering<00:05:08.389> around<00:05:08.479> as

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:08.839 
able to deal with maneuvering around as

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.029 
able to deal with maneuvering around as
you<00:05:08.959> can<00:05:09.110> see<00:05:09.199> I'm<00:05:09.349> going<00:05:09.709> around<00:05:09.919> the

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
you can see I'm going around the

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.379 
you can see I'm going around the
aircraft<00:05:10.189> now<00:05:10.610> just<00:05:10.849> to<00:05:10.939> give<00:05:11.059> you<00:05:11.149> a<00:05:11.209> good
