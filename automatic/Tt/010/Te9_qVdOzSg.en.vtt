00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.770
 very good we are all here in the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.580
 desktop again and we will record 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.130
 how to install the minecraft launcher 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.290
 1.7 onwards for non-premium users 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.000
 as I already had a tutorial on the channel and 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.339
 it does not work because I'm going to update it with 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.809
 a new launcher that I found what 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.130
 take off the first one for windows and then 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.900
 linux is worth 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.110
 you have to delete the point folder 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.150
 Minecraft 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.750
 that is in percent sometimes 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.750
 up to percent 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.900
 point minecraft and you have the content or 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.070
 directly this is right to eliminate I 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.080
 I had already done it so I do not need 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.210
 do it again then open the 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.010
 launcher in case you have windows with 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.010
 double click execute 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.159
 and now they wanted us launcher and it would start 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.070
 to download things worth everything you have to 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.689
 wait for it to finish and then it's like 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.700
 if it were a premium we created a user 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.159
 new we choose the name version of the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.670
 version we keep and plate the typical thing comes out 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.810
 well i'm going to open it to do to see 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.819
 I will enter with a user as a figure 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.909
 no premium for example and let's play 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.909
 1.7 points 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.690
 just one user and I am supported and 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.690
 premium 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.799
 is for you to see that if it works it's worth not 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.930
 I have a text so that everything and even 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.360
 we can enter the server is as if 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.049
 were and well up here the part of 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.010
 windows I will leave a file in the 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.020
 description of 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.300
 a rack that come inside two folders 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.830
 one for windows and another linux and marks the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.990
 of linux and mac is the same test voucher 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.290
 that is not the same so see you 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.700
 now in the linux part and we're 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.970
 here at the linux desk now 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.640
 to explain how to install the launcher 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.580
 in good linux you will have a folder a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.650
 file let run let it be 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.480
 call skynet launcher first thing 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.340
 you have to do is if you already have some 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.480
 another launcher delete the point folder 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.150
 minecraft this is in the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.819
 personal folder if you do not have them 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.590
 points you have to press control h 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.710
 and there you will see the points we seek point 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.330
 minecraft and we erase it 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.330
 eliminate where is 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.700
 and good to the trash that is already 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.099
 option 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.690
 ok we have already do not have a folder 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.989
 pointed minecraft now that we have to 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.030
 do create a new and right create 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.030
 folders we will see more points 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.780
 we open it and we have to put the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.780
 launcher 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.440
 now 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.599
 we go to the desktop right click 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.840
 we have to create a launcher in this 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.270
 I have ubuntu and I can not create 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.160
 pitchers because 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.560
 this version has been removed 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.480
 option but you can create a 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.460
 pitcher so good if you do not need 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.930
 ok this is to put an icon 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.210
 personalized but you can have it that way 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.160
 it is also worth the case that no 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.850
 you want to put the icon we have this 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.860
 we give right click properties 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.390
 permissions and we have to check the box 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.990
 allow to execute this file as a 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.520
 program because if we do not have it checked 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.710
 it will happen this good hope that something of 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.400
 open with the compressor 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.939
 this will happen 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:00.069
 it tells us that it is not blocked because it does not 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:02.490
 it's an executable so we have to 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.770
 mark it as executable 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.940
 the next step after marking it 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.700
 as executable 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.160
 is to open it instead of double clicking 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.550
 with right click to open with open jdk 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.550
 java 7 or java 6 is the same we open it 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.430
 we wait a little 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.810
 and it would not come out this is worth here we put 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.810
 the username 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:35.390
 we login and now we wait a bit 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.640
 they would download a few good things 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.640
 here the profile now we can wait for you 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.050
 we need and we put for example 1.7 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.050
 points 2 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.300
 here 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.909
 we keep it 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.710
 and good, it's clear, he has given us an error 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:05:01.629
 because I do not have and I did not have internet 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.430
 activated, but it would be the same as I am 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.639
 in shit why I have problems with 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.639
 this 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.270
 it took with windows vale we create profile 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:16.240
 again then play the typical thing was just 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.319
 explaining how to do the installation 1 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.750
