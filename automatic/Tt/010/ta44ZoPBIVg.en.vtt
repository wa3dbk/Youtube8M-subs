00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.860 
you want to send in your old device you
can<00:00:42.760> do<00:00:42.940> that<00:00:43.059> but<00:00:43.239> you're<00:00:43.329> probably<00:00:43.569> better

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
can do that but you're probably better

can do that but you're probably better
off<00:00:43.960> holding<00:00:44.319> on<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.589> it<00:00:44.710> maybe<00:00:45.309> you<00:00:45.609> know

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:45.639 
off holding on to it maybe you know

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:46.919 
off holding on to it maybe you know
someone<00:00:46.030> who<00:00:46.149> could<00:00:46.299> be<00:00:46.389> added<00:00:46.600> to<00:00:46.659> your<00:00:46.719> teen

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
someone who could be added to your teen

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.569 
someone who could be added to your teen
account<00:00:47.260> or<00:00:47.799> maybe<00:00:47.979> you<00:00:48.100> just<00:00:48.159> want<00:00:48.429> to<00:00:48.489> keep

account or maybe you just want to keep
it<00:00:48.699> as<00:00:48.819> a<00:00:48.850> backup<00:00:49.120> that<00:00:49.389> can<00:00:49.539> be<00:00:49.600> activated

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
it as a backup that can be activated

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.069 
it as a backup that can be activated
whenever<00:00:50.319> you<00:00:50.469> want<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:51.389> next<00:00:52.389> is<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:52.899> AC

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
whenever you want and next is the AC

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.459 
whenever you want and next is the AC
adapter<00:00:54.299> so<00:00:55.299> this<00:00:55.449> obviously<00:00:55.870> goes<00:00:56.139> with<00:00:56.350> the

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
adapter so this obviously goes with the

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:04.460 
adapter so this obviously goes with the
micro<00:00:56.859> USB<00:00:57.249> cable<00:00:57.819> that<00:00:58.479> I<00:00:58.510> will<00:00:58.780> take<00:00:59.049> out<00:00:59.319> now

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.980 

I'll<00:01:05.470> just<00:01:05.500> take<00:01:06.100> out<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.490> cable<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.150> lay<00:01:07.870> it

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
I'll just take out the cable and lay it

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.740 
I'll just take out the cable and lay it
next<00:01:08.260> to<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:10.060> sure<00:01:10.300> you've<00:01:10.420> seen<00:01:10.480> that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
next to it I'm sure you've seen that

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.270 
next to it I'm sure you've seen that
before<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:11.170> just<00:01:11.380> connects<00:01:11.740> with<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.040> wall

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
before it just connects with the wall

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.350 
before it just connects with the wall
all<00:01:12.730> adapter<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.510> I<00:01:13.540> charge<00:01:14.020> your<00:01:14.170> device<00:01:14.410> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
all adapter to I charge your device and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.630 
all adapter to I charge your device and
lastly<00:01:16.360> is<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.780> battery<00:01:17.230> which<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.740> 2,000

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
lastly is the battery which is 2,000

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.880 
lastly is the battery which is 2,000
milliamps<00:01:19.230> so<00:01:20.230> that<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.440> actually<00:01:20.740> good<00:01:20.860> for

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
milliamps so that is actually good for

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.520 
milliamps so that is actually good for
14<00:01:21.520> hours<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:21.940> talktime<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.480> 8<00:01:22.840> days<00:01:23.200> standby

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
14 hours of talktime and 8 days standby

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.800 
14 hours of talktime and 8 days standby
which<00:01:24.400> is<00:01:24.550> pretty<00:01:24.760> good<00:01:24.940> in<00:01:25.060> general<00:01:25.180> but<00:01:25.630> I

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
which is pretty good in general but I

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.050 
which is pretty good in general but I
would<00:01:25.990> say<00:01:26.140> excellent<00:01:26.590> for<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.920> 228<00:01:27.850> dollar

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
would say excellent for a 228 dollar

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.780 
would say excellent for a 228 dollar
quad-core<00:01:28.630> device<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.220> device<00:01:30.310> actually

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
quad-core device and the device actually

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.640 
quad-core device and the device actually
also<00:01:30.970> supports<00:01:31.540> wireless<00:01:32.050> charging<00:01:32.350> pads

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
also supports wireless charging pads

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.610 
also supports wireless charging pads
which<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:33.010> pretty<00:01:33.220> neat<00:01:34.170> I'll<00:01:35.170> probably<00:01:35.320> take

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
which is pretty neat I'll probably take

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.290 
which is pretty neat I'll probably take
the<00:01:35.770> plastic<00:01:36.190> off<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.430> wall<00:01:36.700> mount<00:01:36.940> as<00:01:37.120> well

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
the plastic off this wall mount as well

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.260 
the plastic off this wall mount as well
just<00:01:37.510> to<00:01:37.800> take<00:01:38.800> it<00:01:38.920> off<00:01:39.010> everything<00:01:39.490> but<00:01:40.120> yeah

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
just to take it off everything but yeah

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.520 
just to take it off everything but yeah
this<00:01:40.510> is<00:01:40.630> essentially<00:01:41.080> everything<00:01:41.380> that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
this is essentially everything that

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.580 
this is essentially everything that
comes<00:01:41.830> inside<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.340> Hydra<00:01:42.880> vibes<00:01:43.120> box<00:01:46.590> now

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
comes inside the Hydra vibes box now

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.230 
comes inside the Hydra vibes box now
we'll<00:01:47.800> look<00:01:47.920> at<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.130> physical<00:01:48.700> aspects<00:01:49.120> of

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
we'll look at the physical aspects of

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
thirty minutes which will actually be

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.530 
thirty minutes which will actually be
testing<00:02:51.639> towards<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:51.970> end<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.239> video<00:02:52.419> so

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
testing towards the end of this video so

definitely watch out for that and as

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:56.879 
definitely watch out for that and as
well<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.989> Hydra<00:02:56.230> vive<00:02:56.379> actually<00:02:56.709> has<00:02:56.859> a

well the Hydra vive actually has a

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.679 
well the Hydra vive actually has a
removable<00:02:57.340> battery<00:02:57.639> so<00:02:58.030> I'll<00:02:58.150> take<00:02:58.359> off<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
removable battery so I'll take off the

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
those who are often on the go and might

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.619 
those who are often on the go and might
need<00:03:02.950> more<00:03:03.099> than<00:03:03.159> a<00:03:03.310> full<00:03:03.519> charge<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.090> if

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
micro SD slot you can actually add up to

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.830 
micro SD slot you can actually add up to
32<00:03:12.310> gigabytes<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.849> extra<00:03:13.180> storage<00:03:13.480> if<00:03:13.689> you'd

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
for it to be fully waterproof and

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.339 
for it to be fully waterproof and
actually<00:03:25.180> really<00:03:25.419> liked<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.659> feel<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:25.989> the

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
actually really liked the feel of the

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.379 
actually really liked the feel of the
back<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:26.919> textured<00:03:27.489> it's<00:03:27.699> super<00:03:28.030> grippy

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
back it's a textured it's super grippy

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.649 
back it's a textured it's super grippy
feels<00:03:28.959> comfortable<00:03:29.409> and<00:03:29.709> safe<00:03:29.979> in<00:03:30.099> your<00:03:30.159> hand

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
feels comfortable and safe in your hand

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.030 
feels comfortable and safe in your hand
and<00:03:31.659> yeah<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.319> that's<00:03:32.439> a<00:03:32.590> little<00:03:32.709> bit<00:03:32.889> about

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
and yeah so that's a little bit about

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.129 
and yeah so that's a little bit about
the<00:03:33.790> physical<00:03:34.209> aspects<00:03:34.599> and<00:03:34.689> I<00:03:34.750> think<00:03:34.989> we'll

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
the physical aspects and I think we'll

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.339 
the physical aspects and I think we'll
turn<00:03:35.379> on<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.650> hydro<00:03:35.979> vibe<00:03:36.159> now<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:38.079> now<00:03:38.290> the
