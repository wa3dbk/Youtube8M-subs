00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.339
 4WD extreme test of car engine and sport 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.770
 on a locked handling course at over 2000 meters altitude must be ten 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.519
 4WD cars prove 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.289
 first candidate of the Opel Insignia in its sharpest variant with 325 hp 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.449
 his four-wheel system is technically complex basically as 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.719
 Front-wheel drive but an electro-hydraulic controlled 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.990
 Multi-plate clutch guides the power 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.320
 Cardan shaft also continues to the rear 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.340
 in case of cases 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.390
 even the power can be distributed from right to left or vice versa 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.980
 Opel is not fish here too meat is now ultimately he brings 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.920
 out of the city out of Bangkok 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.600
 So the opposite is the opener 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 soon not enough points too 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.440
 next candidate of the BMW x6 in the final version 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.640
 despite its size the Bayer does not let itself of its weight 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.090
 Impress and stomp cheerfully 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.159
 his advantage 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.630
 a fully variable rear differential 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.140
 4 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.700
 at a happy car 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.800
 the left 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.140
 the right wheel 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.550
 exactly the same force 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.670
 The Crafter will not be granted over the differential it will always be very 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.180
 Well balanced now you can but in reality has the electronic 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.500
 Components are used for everything and that's what makes the world possible 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 force 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.820
 Haase says that one thing or another will give more strength 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.000
 to assist in the intrusion of the car 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.070
 turn when they are powerful 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.750
 555 hp, two chamber includes 4 tons curb weight 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.830
 these are the dates of the BMW x6 m 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.830
 this is the strongest car in this comparison 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.450
 The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution offers legal rally technology in mass production 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.380
 trumped legally on which underground 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.219
 he is the snow king of 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.169
 strongholds 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.980
 his 295 hp are not rudimentary to the x6 ran 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.930
 but he is the only one with thousands of club year LAN front axle 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.930
 There the power is distributed further 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.200
 Letzigrund Oct 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.549
 with the subscription 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.819
 Minute goal 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.799
 the special conditions let the snow 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.619
 Nevertheless, Evo can not deny its own past 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.539
 since then a sedan of the Audi s4 as extra on board a sports differential 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.640
 This controls the distribution of forces on the rear axle via electronics Dolleschal 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.619
 multi-plate clutch 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:58.109
 the data sheet shows 333 hp 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.139
 more important for the snow quality one of the Ingolstadt in Tabor Quattro and 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.889
 locked f 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.309
 even when accelerating is this is one of the fastest 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.059
 now it's about curves 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:14.159
 the grandson of the ur-quattro can beat himself on the slippery course 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.919
 us with the car here 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.689
 strictly speaking 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.689
 For example, 70,000 users 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:24.879
 St 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.499
 on 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.639
 The Nissan gt-r is about honor 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.459
 he could not score points while accelerating and he had to deal with the handling 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.459
 Make up lost ground with the driving impressions 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.079
 the gt-r with variable power distribution brings the 485 hp to the four wheels 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:48.800
 Like his rivals Audi and BMW, he can target more power to a bike 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.800
 the rear axle continues 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.809
 is also quite good from the time of coming or not planning 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.069
 self-sufficient proof of love performance is not everything 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.130
 231 to 555 hp 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.739
 the Mozilla com the SUVs and sports cars 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.389
 everyone was there 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.409
 and there is a clear winner on the handling course of the Audi s4 win 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.919
 with almost two seconds ahead of next, he goes up 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.620
 narrowly beaten with two hundredths and in third place the Mitsubishi Lancer 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.990
 Evolution the boys 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.219
 many readings many different opinions 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.110
 but in the end there can be only one winner 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.060
 the overall result of the 'auto engine and sport' is stronger 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.910
 The Audi Horex has become increasingly fastest time in the Kursaal 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:46.939
 EADS had Northrop 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.839
 The way she is driven is completely lost in herself and still 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:53.839
 Urfahr they think that's really nice combination 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.140
 Traditions and lots of technology 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.860
 All ten Allradler have managed him 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.270
 because of snow test in the border area
