00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
programming so you know you don't really

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.810 
programming so you know you don't really
need<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.090> much<00:03:03.930> okay<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.890> has<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.130> new<00:03:05.489> froth

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
need that much okay it has the new froth

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.720 
need that much okay it has the new froth
technology<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.080> gets<00:03:07.739> hotter<00:03:08.100> than<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
technology so it gets hotter than the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.140 
technology so it gets hotter than the
ones<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.600> past<00:03:09.810> okay<00:03:10.739> um<00:03:10.980> also<00:03:11.700> smaller
