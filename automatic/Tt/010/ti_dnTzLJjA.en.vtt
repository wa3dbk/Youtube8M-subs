testing<00:00:02.700> testing<00:00:03.560> today<00:00:04.560> we're<00:00:04.770> going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.920> be

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
testing testing today we're going to be

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.430 
testing testing today we're going to be
talking<00:00:05.100> about<00:00:05.310> applying<00:00:06.080> textures<00:00:07.080> to

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
talking about applying textures to

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.339 
talking about applying textures to
images<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.309> Photoshop<00:00:09.139> this<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> very

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
images in Photoshop this is a very

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.169 
images in Photoshop this is a very
simple<00:00:11.040> yet<00:00:11.580> delicate<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.660> ultimately

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
simple yet delicate and ultimately

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.019 
simple yet delicate and ultimately
abstract<00:00:15.179> process<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.340> which<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.550> take<00:00:17.910> an

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
abstract process and which we take an

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.849 
abstract process and which we take an
original<00:00:18.420> photo<00:00:18.690> like<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.590> see<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
original photo like you see on the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.700 
original photo like you see on the
screen<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.400> then<00:00:21.180> overlay<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> texture<00:00:22.410> photo

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
screen and then overlay a texture photo

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.439 
screen and then overlay a texture photo
such<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.900> concrete<00:00:25.580> to<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.730> some<00:00:26.970> sort<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.269> like

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
such a concrete to get some sort of like

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
such a concrete to get some sort of like
grunge<00:00:27.840> texture<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.369> like<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.580> call

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
grunge texture is what we like to call

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.340 
grunge texture is what we like to call
it<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:31.289> web<00:00:31.529> industry<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:33.290> what<00:00:34.290> I'm

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it in the web industry and what I'm

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.729 
it in the web industry and what I'm
going<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:35.070> overlay<00:00:35.760> two<00:00:36.270> textures

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
going to do here is overlay two textures

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.020 
going to do here is overlay two textures
over<00:00:37.739> my<00:00:37.890> original<00:00:38.219> image<00:00:38.399> I'm<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> take

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
over my original image I'm going to take

over my original image I'm going to take
this<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.629> which<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.620> shot<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.219> Vinh<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.700> tour

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
just going to do like a command click or

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.760 
just going to do like a command click or
something<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.600> basic<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.289> copy<00:00:52.559> this

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
something and basic just copy this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.139 
something and basic just copy this
original<00:00:53.690> text<00:00:54.690> or<00:00:54.750> image<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.030> image<00:00:57.030> i'm

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
original text or image to the image i'm

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.340 
original text or image to the image i'm
working<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:59.340> feel<00:00:59.850> like<00:00:59.910> using<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.660> text

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
working on and I feel like using to text

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.070 
working on and I feel like using to text
or<00:01:01.469> images<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> use<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.780> today

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
or images I so I'm going to use to today

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
or images I so I'm going to use to today
and<00:01:05.270> these<00:01:06.270> images<00:01:06.689> are<00:01:07.250> obviously<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.400> size

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and these images are obviously not size

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.300 
and these images are obviously not size
to<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.299> size<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> original<00:01:10.049> image<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.220> I'm

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
to the size of the original image so I'm

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.820 
to the size of the original image so I'm
just<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> resize<00:01:12.659> them<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.500> their

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
just going to resize them on their

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.300 
just going to resize them on their
respective<00:01:14.369> layers<00:01:15.259> this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.560> something

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
respective layers this is not something

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.179 
respective layers this is not something
you<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:19.170> could<00:01:19.350> easily<00:01:19.710> use<00:01:19.770> them

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you have to do you could easily use them

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
you have to do you could easily use them
as<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> size<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.909> they<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.450> create<00:01:22.170> any

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
as the size that they are or create any

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.740 
as the size that they are or create any
size<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.600> general

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
size of to what you like but in general

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.440 
size of to what you like but in general
I<00:01:25.080> usually<00:01:25.590> fill<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.430> overall<00:01:27.060> area<00:01:27.299> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
I usually fill out the overall area of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.770 
I usually fill out the overall area of
the<00:01:27.540> image<00:01:27.570> using<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.200> textures<00:01:29.509> now<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.659> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the image using my textures now what you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.719 
the image using my textures now what you
see<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.640> very<00:01:32.640> large<00:01:34.130> solid<00:01:35.130> image

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
see here is just very large solid image

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.230 
see here is just very large solid image
and<00:01:36.439> now<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.220> applied<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> texture

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and now that we have applied a texture

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.800 
and now that we have applied a texture
the<00:01:39.420> question<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.869> how<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.140> blend<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the question is how do we blend the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.460 
the question is how do we blend the
original<00:01:43.350> texture<00:01:43.979> into<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.570> image<00:01:45.750> because

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
original texture into the image because

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.899 
original texture into the image because
the<00:01:46.590> idea<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.340> texture<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.759> like

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the idea is that the texture is like

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030 
the idea is that the texture is like
some<00:01:48.270> sort<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.720> addition<00:01:49.259> some<00:01:49.649> sort<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.920> way

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
some sort of addition some sort of way

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.109 
some sort of addition some sort of way
to<00:01:50.360> re<00:01:51.360> represent<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:53.070> original<00:01:53.490> content<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
to re represent the original content of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.830 
to re represent the original content of
your<00:01:54.149> image<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> want<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> change<00:01:56.840> some

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
your image so if you want to change some

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.030 
your image so if you want to change some
sort<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.079> lighting<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.560> want<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.799> get<00:01:58.890> some

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
sort of lighting you want to get some

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.010 
sort of lighting you want to get some
sort<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.280> flair<00:01:59.549> some<00:01:59.850> sort<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.119> feeling<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
sort of flair some sort of feeling to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.560 
sort of flair some sort of feeling to
your<00:02:01.140> original<00:02:01.560> image<00:02:02.060> that's<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.329> what

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
your original image that's really what

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
your original image that's really what
the<00:02:03.659> point<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> texture<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.189> a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the point of the texture is it's just a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.670 
the point of the texture is it's just a
way<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.630> give<00:02:06.630> some<00:02:07.170> other<00:02:07.350> sort<00:02:07.649> of

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
way to give some other sort of

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.910 
way to give some other sort of
expression<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.429> some<00:02:08.700> sort<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.000> modification

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
expression do some sort of modification

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.160 
expression do some sort of modification
so<00:02:10.920> here's<00:02:11.370> our<00:02:11.489> image

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
so here's our image

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.800 
so here's our image
and<00:02:12.849> what<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:13.880> usually<00:02:14.270> start<00:02:14.480> out<00:02:14.569> with<00:02:14.750> is

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and what I usually start out with is

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.280 
and what I usually start out with is
doing<00:02:15.500> some<00:02:15.709> sort<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.069> levels<00:02:16.760> adjustment

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
doing some sort of levels adjustment

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.280 
doing some sort of levels adjustment
because<00:02:19.180> when<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.300> apply<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.660> texture<00:02:21.110> it's

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
because when you apply a texture it's

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.650 
because when you apply a texture it's
going<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.560> change<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:22.130> overall<00:02:22.660> shadowing

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
going to change the overall shadowing

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.920 
going to change the overall shadowing
and<00:02:24.470> light<00:02:24.890> distribution<00:02:25.250> on<00:02:25.580> your<00:02:25.700> image<00:02:25.970> so

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
and light distribution on your image so

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.300 
and light distribution on your image so
you<00:02:26.959> really<00:02:27.230> want<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.500> start<00:02:27.770> with<00:02:27.860> something

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
you really want to start with something

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.510 
you really want to start with something
that<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:29.390> want<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.620> want<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.950> have<00:02:31.130> which

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
that you want to you want to have which

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.660 
that you want to you want to have which
is<00:02:31.670> why<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:31.850> do<00:02:32.980> desaturation<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.370> levels

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
is why I do desaturation and a levels

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.270 
is why I do desaturation and a levels
adjustment<00:02:34.790> initially<00:02:35.770> this<00:02:36.770> gives<00:02:37.010> us<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
adjustment initially this gives us the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.030 
adjustment initially this gives us the
base<00:02:37.430> image<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.959> question<00:02:39.319> is<00:02:39.530> how

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
base image and now the question is how

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.229 
base image and now the question is how
do<00:02:40.100> we<00:02:40.190> blend<00:02:40.910> our<00:02:41.330> concrete<00:02:42.140> textures<00:02:42.769> into

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
do we blend our concrete textures into

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.009 
do we blend our concrete textures into
the<00:02:44.239> initial<00:02:44.569> image<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:46.580> here<00:02:46.819> now<00:02:47.720> we<00:02:47.780> just

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
the initial image so here now we just

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.509 
the initial image so here now we just
have<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.170> big<00:02:48.350> picture<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.800> concrete<00:02:49.280> because

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
have a big picture of concrete because

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.940 
have a big picture of concrete because
it's<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.880> layer<00:02:50.209> above<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:50.750> original<00:02:51.140> image

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
it's on a layer above the original image

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.880 
it's on a layer above the original image
and<00:02:52.720> we<00:02:53.720> can<00:02:53.870> go<00:02:53.959> through<00:02:54.200> different<00:02:54.350> blending

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
and we can go through different blending

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.970 
and we can go through different blending
modes<00:02:55.100> such<00:02:55.640> as<00:02:56.230> they're<00:02:57.230> like<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.410> hard<00:02:57.709> light

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
modes such as they're like a hard light

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.410 
modes such as they're like a hard light
soft<00:02:58.580> light<00:02:58.910> dark<00:02:59.750> and<00:02:59.959> multiply<00:03:01.269> there<00:03:02.269> are

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
soft light dark and multiply there are

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.850 
soft light dark and multiply there are
people<00:03:02.720> who<00:03:02.810> program<00:03:03.230> these<00:03:03.350> things<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.830> know

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
people who program these things you know

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.890 
people who program these things you know
exactly<00:03:04.430> what<00:03:04.549> they<00:03:04.640> do<00:03:04.700> I'm<00:03:05.060> not<00:03:05.690> one<00:03:05.870> of

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
exactly what they do I'm not one of

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.449 
exactly what they do I'm not one of
those<00:03:06.049> people<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.799> kind<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.010> like<00:03:07.160> flip

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
those people I just kind of like flip

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.930 
those people I just kind of like flip
through<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:08.030> see<00:03:08.269> what<00:03:08.390> looks<00:03:08.420> cool<00:03:08.780> and

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
through I see what looks cool and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.190 
through I see what looks cool and
generally<00:03:10.940> i'm<00:03:11.540> going<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.900> use<00:03:11.989> something

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
generally i'm going to use something

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.199 
generally i'm going to use something
like<00:03:12.319> an<00:03:12.560> overlay<00:03:13.040> or<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.430> soft<00:03:13.910> light

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
like an overlay or a soft light

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.780 
like an overlay or a soft light
depending<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.370> how<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.700> blend<00:03:17.269> together

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
depending on how the to blend together

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.050 
depending on how the to blend together
so<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.769> look<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:22.459> see<00:03:22.730> what<00:03:22.850> good

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
so you just like look and see what good

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.300 
so you just like look and see what good
see<00:03:23.510> what<00:03:23.660> looks<00:03:23.780> good<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.380> think<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.070> looks

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
see what looks good I think this looks

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.080 
see what looks good I think this looks
okay<00:03:25.640> um<00:03:26.709> some<00:03:27.709> of<00:03:27.799> you<00:03:27.890> may<00:03:28.040> think<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.430> sucks

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
okay um some of you may think that sucks

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.509 
okay um some of you may think that sucks
well<00:03:29.390> okay<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.989> this<00:03:30.200> does<00:03:30.440> suck<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:31.010> would

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
well okay that this does suck I would

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.229 
well okay that this does suck I would
agree<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:33.280> eventually<00:03:34.280> find<00:03:34.760> something<00:03:35.120> that

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
agree but eventually find something that

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.520 
agree but eventually find something that
you<00:03:35.269> like<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.750> doesn't<00:03:35.989> really<00:03:36.109> matter<00:03:36.290> if

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
you like and doesn't really matter if

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.430 
you like and doesn't really matter if
anyone<00:03:36.769> else<00:03:36.950> likes<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:38.049> just<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:39.140> long<00:03:39.230> as

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
anyone else likes it just so long as

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.930 
anyone else likes it just so long as
you're<00:03:39.859> happy<00:03:40.130> with<00:03:40.280> your<00:03:40.430> work<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:43.609> once<00:03:43.760> we

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
you're happy with your work so once we

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.560 
you're happy with your work so once we
have<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.209> basic<00:03:45.370> blending<00:03:46.370> mode<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.820> then

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
have the basic blending mode I then

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.220 
have the basic blending mode I then
start<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.140> go<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.070> throw<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.310> few<00:03:49.720> levels<00:03:50.720> or

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
start to go in and throw a few levels or

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.160 
start to go in and throw a few levels or
curves<00:03:51.590> adjustments<00:03:52.190> down<00:03:52.720> because<00:03:53.720> this

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
curves adjustments down because this

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.080 
curves adjustments down because this
gives<00:03:54.350> me<00:03:54.590> control<00:03:55.130> over<00:03:55.819> how<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:58.090> original

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
gives me control over how the original

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.930 
gives me control over how the original
image<00:03:59.239> is<00:03:59.690> in<00:04:00.049> terms<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.859> its<00:04:01.069> light<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.700> dark

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
image is in terms of its light and dark

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.960 
image is in terms of its light and dark
values<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.630> then<00:04:02.750> I'm<00:04:03.850> changing<00:04:04.850> these

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
values and then I'm changing these

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.970 
values and then I'm changing these
values<00:04:05.359> for<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.720> overall<00:04:06.109> images<00:04:06.709> which

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
values for the overall images which

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.349 
values for the overall images which
include<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.819> textures<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:11.209> can

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
include the the textures and you can

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.890 
include the the textures and you can
also<00:04:11.510> throw<00:04:12.139> in<00:04:13.269> adjustment<00:04:14.269> layers<00:04:14.569> between

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
also throw in adjustment layers between

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.640 
also throw in adjustment layers between
the<00:04:15.350> different<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:17.630> different<00:04:17.900> textures<00:04:18.260> in

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
the different the different textures in

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.710 
the different the different textures in
this<00:04:18.919> case<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.459> think<00:04:19.519> I'll<00:04:19.789> just<00:04:19.850> keep<00:04:20.359> them<00:04:20.539> as

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
this case I think I'll just keep them as

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.779 
this case I think I'll just keep them as
they<00:04:20.870> are<00:04:20.950> because<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.010> really<00:04:22.250> wanted<00:04:22.520> them<00:04:22.640> to

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
they are because I really wanted them to

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.100 
they are because I really wanted them to
blend<00:04:22.970> in<00:04:23.180> together

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
blend in together

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.350 
blend in together
and<00:04:25.110> once<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.440> have<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:25.830> down<00:04:26.150> you're<00:04:27.150> going

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
and once you have this down you're going

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.980 
and once you have this down you're going
to<00:04:27.570> probably<00:04:28.080> want<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.470> start<00:04:28.740> manipulating

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
to probably want to start manipulating

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.220 
to probably want to start manipulating
the<00:04:31.639> how<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.700> original<00:04:33.210> image<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.750> standing

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
the how the original image is standing

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.950 
the how the original image is standing
at<00:04:34.320> with<00:04:34.620> respect<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.310> textures<00:04:35.760> so<00:04:36.570> here

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
at with respect to the textures so here

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.300 
at with respect to the textures so here
I've<00:04:37.230> opened<00:04:37.470> up<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.830> few<00:04:38.070> masks<00:04:38.970> masks<00:04:39.600> and

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
I've opened up a few masks masks and

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.770 
I've opened up a few masks masks and
basically<00:04:41.310> all<00:04:41.490> I'm<00:04:41.580> doing<00:04:41.850> is<00:04:41.910> painting<00:04:42.240> with

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
basically all I'm doing is painting with

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.379 
basically all I'm doing is painting with
a<00:04:42.960> black<00:04:43.590> brush<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.340> an<00:04:44.580> opacity<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:45.120> like

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
a black brush of an opacity of like

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.470 
a black brush of an opacity of like
twenty<00:04:45.870> percent<00:04:46.200> and<00:04:46.470> I'm<00:04:47.400> trying<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:48.000> reveal

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
twenty percent and I'm trying to reveal

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.379 
twenty percent and I'm trying to reveal
the<00:04:48.630> face<00:04:48.900> of<00:04:48.930> this<00:04:49.380> portrait<00:04:50.389> because

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
the face of this portrait because

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.210 
the face of this portrait because
otherwise<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.440> text<00:04:52.740> or<00:04:52.800> images<00:04:53.040> are

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
otherwise the the text or images are

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.370 
otherwise the the text or images are
just<00:04:53.400> like<00:04:53.550> really<00:04:53.850> they're<00:04:54.780> really<00:04:54.930> strong

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
just like really they're really strong

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.560 
just like really they're really strong
you<00:04:55.950> know<00:04:56.010> covering<00:04:56.430> up<00:04:56.610> facial<00:04:57.000> feature<00:04:57.210> is

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
you know covering up facial feature is

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.570 
you know covering up facial feature is
covering<00:04:57.900> up<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.080> odds<00:04:58.310> that's<00:04:59.310> something

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
covering up the odds that's something

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.780 
covering up the odds that's something
which<00:04:59.700> which<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.240> wanted<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:01.580> because<00:05:02.580> if<00:05:02.700> you

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
which which I wanted and because if you

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.340 
which which I wanted and because if you
just<00:05:03.000> throw<00:05:03.270> down<00:05:03.479> the<00:05:03.630> textures<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.080> you

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
just throw down the textures and you

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.040 
just throw down the textures and you
don't<00:05:04.530> do<00:05:04.680> any<00:05:04.889> sort<00:05:05.130> of<00:05:05.450> you<00:05:06.450> know<00:05:06.510> smart

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
don't do any sort of you know smart

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.840 
don't do any sort of you know smart
blending<00:05:07.560> or<00:05:08.300> if<00:05:09.300> there's<00:05:09.570> no<00:05:09.750> real<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.850> don't

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
blending or if there's no real I don't

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.810 
blending or if there's no real I don't
know<00:05:12.290> message<00:05:13.290> here<00:05:13.530> madness<00:05:13.950> then<00:05:14.550> it<00:05:14.669> just

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
know message here madness then it just

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.760 
know message here madness then it just
kind<00:05:15.000> of<00:05:15.180> enough<00:05:16.169> for<00:05:16.290> me<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.440> doesn't<00:05:16.680> look

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
kind of enough for me it doesn't look

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.360 
kind of enough for me it doesn't look
very<00:05:16.800> cool<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:18.660> I'm<00:05:18.930> going<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.110> take<00:05:19.380> away<00:05:19.650> most

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
very cool so I'm going to take away most

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.230 
very cool so I'm going to take away most
but<00:05:20.669> not<00:05:20.729> all<00:05:20.910> of<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:22.139> of<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:23.490> force<00:05:23.850> of<00:05:24.180> the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
but not all of the of the force of the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.150 
but not all of the of the force of the
texture<00:05:24.780> because<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.680> don't<00:05:25.860> want<00:05:26.010> to

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
texture because I don't want to

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.650 
texture because I don't want to
overshadow<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.910> image<00:05:27.120> but<00:05:27.330> at<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.479> same

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
overshadow the image but at the same

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.020 
overshadow the image but at the same
time<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:27.930> do<00:05:28.140> want<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.620> texture<00:05:29.070> there<00:05:29.280> to<00:05:29.880> give

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
time I do want a texture there to give

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.070 
time I do want a texture there to give
some<00:05:30.330> sort<00:05:30.570> of<00:05:30.919> texture<00:05:31.919> to<00:05:32.039> the<00:05:32.160> image<00:05:33.080> and

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
some sort of texture to the image and

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.779 
some sort of texture to the image and
oftentimes<00:05:34.620> if<00:05:35.220> you're<00:05:35.340> working<00:05:35.490> with<00:05:35.669> a

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
oftentimes if you're working with a

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.400 
oftentimes if you're working with a
concrete<00:05:36.150> texture<00:05:36.539> you'll<00:05:36.780> see<00:05:37.020> that<00:05:37.229> there

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
concrete texture you'll see that there

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.500 
concrete texture you'll see that there
might<00:05:37.500> be<00:05:37.560> some<00:05:37.860> huge<00:05:38.370> crack<00:05:38.729> which<00:05:39.000> is<00:05:39.180> going

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
might be some huge crack which is going

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.650 
might be some huge crack which is going
across<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:40.020> throat<00:05:40.229> of<00:05:40.289> your<00:05:40.470> subject<00:05:41.660> which

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
across the throat of your subject which

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.750 
across the throat of your subject which
is<00:05:43.320> not<00:05:43.470> really<00:05:43.500> why<00:05:43.800> why<00:05:44.100> because<00:05:44.310> it's<00:05:44.550> kind

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
is not really why why because it's kind

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.760 
is not really why why because it's kind
of<00:05:44.789> like<00:05:44.910> my<00:05:45.150> texture<00:05:45.570> is<00:05:45.660> decapitating<00:05:46.590> the

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
of like my texture is decapitating the

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.760 
of like my texture is decapitating the
portrait<00:05:47.190> I<00:05:47.970> don't<00:05:48.600> know<00:05:48.690> it<00:05:49.289> could<00:05:49.350> be<00:05:49.590> cool

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
portrait I don't know it could be cool

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.120 
portrait I don't know it could be cool
in<00:05:49.860> some<00:05:50.039> circumstances<00:05:50.400> but<00:05:51.060> here<00:05:51.300> it's<00:05:51.419> not

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
in some circumstances but here it's not

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.830 
in some circumstances but here it's not
someone's<00:05:53.130> just<00:05:53.280> going<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.700> dark<00:05:54.270> head<00:05:54.450> out<00:05:54.660> I

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
someone's just going to dark head out I

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.620 
someone's just going to dark head out I
could<00:05:55.050> also<00:05:55.169> clone<00:05:55.590> it<00:05:55.740> out<00:05:55.919> or<00:05:56.360> do<00:05:57.360> something

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
could also clone it out or do something

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.590 
could also clone it out or do something
to<00:05:57.870> de-emphasize<00:05:58.850> that<00:05:59.850> part<00:06:00.030> of<00:06:00.090> the<00:06:00.150> texture

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
to de-emphasize that part of the texture

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.990 
to de-emphasize that part of the texture
and<00:06:02.600> oftentimes<00:06:03.600> I<00:06:04.050> also<00:06:04.229> add<00:06:04.560> a<00:06:04.889> solid<00:06:05.760> color

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
and oftentimes I also add a solid color

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.590 
and oftentimes I also add a solid color
layer<00:06:07.130> because<00:06:08.130> it's<00:06:08.580> this<00:06:09.180> is<00:06:09.330> like<00:06:09.479> the

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
layer because it's this is like the

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.420 
layer because it's this is like the
final<00:06:09.810> stuff<00:06:10.200> and<00:06:10.440> kind<00:06:10.530> of<00:06:10.620> achieving<00:06:11.010> the

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
final stuff and kind of achieving the

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.040 
final stuff and kind of achieving the
the<00:06:11.729> color<00:06:11.970> balance<00:06:12.330> which<00:06:12.479> I<00:06:12.600> want<00:06:12.810> in<00:06:12.930> the

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
the color balance which I want in the

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.370 
the color balance which I want in the
image<00:06:13.729> and<00:06:14.729> again<00:06:15.510> I<00:06:15.539> just<00:06:15.810> kind<00:06:15.990> of<00:06:16.020> flipped

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
image and again I just kind of flipped

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.370 
image and again I just kind of flipped
through<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.680> different<00:06:17.070> ooh<00:06:17.190> that's<00:06:17.610> cool<00:06:18.380> no

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
through the different ooh that's cool no

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.020 
through the different ooh that's cool no
it<00:06:19.500> wasn't<00:06:19.530> flip<00:06:20.280> through<00:06:20.520> the<00:06:20.639> different

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
it wasn't flip through the different

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.490 
it wasn't flip through the different
blending<00:06:21.479> modes<00:06:21.720> and<00:06:21.990> I<00:06:23.660> think<00:06:24.660> I<00:06:24.720> like<00:06:24.870> landed

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
blending modes and I think I like landed

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.170 
blending modes and I think I like landed
eventually<00:06:25.919> on<00:06:26.039> overlay<00:06:26.580> or<00:06:26.610> soft<00:06:26.970> light

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
eventually on overlay or soft light

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.279 
eventually on overlay or soft light
again<00:06:27.419> because<00:06:27.690> it's<00:06:27.900> out<00:06:28.470> of<00:06:28.530> my<00:06:28.770> cliche<00:06:29.280> and

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
again because it's out of my cliche and

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.899 
again because it's out of my cliche and
after<00:06:31.289> doing<00:06:31.530> a<00:06:31.650> few<00:06:31.919> final<00:06:32.280> adjustments<00:06:32.340> on

after doing a few final adjustments on
the<00:06:32.940> levels<00:06:33.479> then

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
the levels then

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.090 
the levels then
I'm<00:06:34.270> going<00:06:34.600> to<00:06:34.810> save<00:06:35.259> this<00:06:35.440> and<00:06:35.740> jump<00:06:35.919> back<00:06:35.949> to

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
I'm going to save this and jump back to

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.340 
I'm going to save this and jump back to
Lightroom<00:06:36.580> I<00:06:36.820> do<00:06:37.449> on<00:06:37.630> my<00:06:37.660> catalog<00:06:38.199> in

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
Lightroom I do on my catalog in

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.800 
Lightroom I do on my catalog in
Lightroom<00:06:38.830> even<00:06:39.370> if<00:06:39.490> I<00:06:39.580> do<00:06:39.639> the<00:06:39.940> final<00:06:40.419> image

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
adjustments in Photoshop here's a

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.379 
adjustments in Photoshop here's a
previous<00:06:43.930> version<00:06:44.770> of<00:06:44.979> this<00:06:45.070> image<00:06:45.430> and<00:06:46.060> now

previous version of this image and now

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.620 
previous version of this image and now
the<00:06:46.449> the<00:06:47.759> one<00:06:48.759> I<00:06:48.789> just<00:06:48.880> worked<00:06:49.240> on<00:06:49.360> to<00:06:49.539> be

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
the the one I just worked on to be

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.680 
the the one I just worked on to be
popping<00:06:50.020> up<00:06:50.110> out<00:06:50.350> here<00:06:50.590> it<00:06:50.860> is<00:06:51.300> my<00:06:52.300> computer<00:06:52.660> is

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
popping up out here it is my computer is

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.279 
popping up out here it is my computer is
really<00:06:52.870> slow<00:06:52.990> so<00:06:53.229> this<00:06:53.560> takes<00:06:53.740> a<00:06:53.889> while<00:06:55.289> and

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
really slow so this takes a while and

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:57.840 
really slow so this takes a while and
actually<00:06:56.800> the<00:06:56.979> image<00:06:57.250> I<00:06:57.340> did<00:06:57.460> originally

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
actually the image I did originally

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.360 
actually the image I did originally
looks<00:06:58.090> a<00:06:58.240> lot<00:06:58.509> better<00:06:58.720> than<00:06:59.020> one<00:06:59.259> I<00:06:59.289> just<00:07:00.190> did

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
looks a lot better than one I just did

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.430 
looks a lot better than one I just did
for<00:07:00.550> you<00:07:00.610> guys<00:07:00.789> here<00:07:01.030> I<00:07:01.440> have<00:07:02.440> sorry<00:07:04.199> yeah<00:07:05.199> it's

crap<00:07:06.630> anyways<00:07:07.630> in<00:07:07.930> in<00:07:08.849> the<00:07:09.849> Lightroom<00:07:10.240> the

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
crap anyways in in the Lightroom the

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.450 
crap anyways in in the Lightroom the
stage<00:07:10.539> i'm<00:07:10.750> going<00:07:10.900> to<00:07:10.960> go<00:07:11.020> back<00:07:11.050> and<00:07:11.620> work<00:07:12.190> with

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
stage i'm going to go back and work with

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.909 
stage i'm going to go back and work with
the<00:07:12.669> final<00:07:13.000> exposure<00:07:13.449> i'm<00:07:14.410> going<00:07:14.560> to<00:07:14.650> tweak

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 
the final exposure i'm going to tweak

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.029 
the final exposure i'm going to tweak
the<00:07:14.949> shadow<00:07:15.699> values<00:07:16.150> tweak<00:07:16.630> the<00:07:16.870> d<00:07:17.320> saturation

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 
the shadow values tweak the d saturation

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.969 
the shadow values tweak the d saturation
values<00:07:19.199> probably<00:07:20.199> play<00:07:20.380> around<00:07:20.560> a<00:07:20.680> little<00:07:20.710> bit

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:20.979 
values probably play around a little bit

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:23.490 
values probably play around a little bit
with<00:07:21.160> the<00:07:21.430> clarity<00:07:22.090> of<00:07:22.120> the<00:07:22.419> image<00:07:22.780> and<00:07:23.020> bump

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
with the clarity of the image and bump

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.740 
with the clarity of the image and bump
up<00:07:23.650> the<00:07:23.770> clarity<00:07:24.099> slider<00:07:24.370> if<00:07:24.580> I<00:07:24.669> feel<00:07:25.300> like<00:07:25.539> I

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:25.750 
up the clarity slider if I feel like I

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.279 
up the clarity slider if I feel like I
need<00:07:25.990> to<00:07:26.020> I<00:07:26.410> don't<00:07:26.979> know<00:07:27.160> he's<00:07:27.370> need<00:07:27.610> to<00:07:27.759> but
