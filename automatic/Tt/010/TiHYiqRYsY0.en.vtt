00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
battery is so dead that the charger

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
battery is so dead that the charger
won't<00:00:46.829> even<00:00:47.100> recognize<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.750> when

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
are you sure you've even connected a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.549 
are you sure you've even connected a
battery<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:56.030> when<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.149> put<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> 13.6

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
battery and when you put it on the 13.6

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.000 
battery and when you put it on the 13.6
supply<00:00:59.000> it'll<00:01:00.000> slowly<00:01:00.390> bring<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.680> voltage

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
supply it'll slowly bring up the voltage

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.260 
supply it'll slowly bring up the voltage
in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> battery<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.699> something<00:01:02.969> where<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.180> can

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
in the battery to something where it can

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.640 
in the battery to something where it can
be<00:01:03.359> charged<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.909> 16<00:01:06.510> volt<00:01:06.750> boost<00:01:07.110> that's

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
be charged and the 16 volt boost that's

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.380 
be charged and the 16 volt boost that's
for<00:01:07.920> when<00:01:08.010> you've<00:01:08.189> sulfated<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.850> battery<00:01:09.150> or

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
for when you've sulfated your battery or

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.130 
for when you've sulfated your battery or
had<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.630> run<00:01:09.810> down<00:01:10.049> pretty<00:01:10.560> severely<00:01:12.140> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
had it run down pretty severely this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
had it run down pretty severely this
will<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.619> cure<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.460> completely<00:01:14.939> dead<00:01:15.090> battery

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
will not cure a completely dead battery

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
will not cure a completely dead battery
but<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.900> does<00:01:16.350> help<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.920> especially<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
but it does help and especially if you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.899 
but it does help and especially if you
get<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.030> top<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.540> away<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.820> give<00:01:20.820> it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
get on top of it right away and give it

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
get on top of it right away and give it
a<00:01:20.939> boost<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.560> its<00:01:22.799> described<00:01:23.220> its<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
overhaul so it is a handy little thing

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.120 
overhaul so it is a handy little thing
to<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.990> now<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.259> soon<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> battery<00:01:32.040> is

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
to have now as soon as the battery is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.359 
to have now as soon as the battery is
done<00:01:32.310> charging<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.970> will<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:34.369> standby

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
done charging it will go into standby

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.819 
done charging it will go into standby
mode<00:01:36.020> which<00:01:37.369> looks<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:40.159> this<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:42.680> when<00:01:43.680> it's

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
mode which looks like this and when it's

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.069 
mode which looks like this and when it's
in<00:01:43.950> standby<00:01:44.280> it'll<00:01:45.060> automatically<00:01:45.659> check<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
in standby it'll automatically check the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.080 
in standby it'll automatically check the
battery<00:01:46.380> levels<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.799> kick<00:01:46.950> back<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
battery levels and kick back in to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.639 
battery levels and kick back in to
charge<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.659> needs<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> overall<00:01:50.909> I

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
charge it if it needs to be so overall I

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.100 
charge it if it needs to be so overall I
am<00:01:52.649> very<00:01:53.610> impressed<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.479> genius

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
am very impressed with the genius

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.370 
am very impressed with the genius
charger<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.700> only<00:01:57.000> downside<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:58.079> is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
charger here the only downside is it is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
charger here the only downside is it is
expensive<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> number<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.610> amps<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
expensive for the number of amps you

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.160 
expensive for the number of amps you
have<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.350> a-you<00:02:02.450> know<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.990> those

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
have so it's a-you know you get those

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.499 
have so it's a-you know you get those
old<00:02:04.560> car<00:02:04.950> chargers<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.619> 15<00:02:08.580> 20<00:02:09.119> amps

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
old car chargers and you have 15 20 amps

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.430 
old car chargers and you have 15 20 amps
or<00:02:09.660> whatever<00:02:10.379> those<00:02:10.800> big<00:02:11.069> metal<00:02:11.370> box<00:02:11.580> ones<00:02:12.050> for

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
or whatever those big metal box ones for

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.400 
or whatever those big metal box ones for
cheaper<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.070> this<00:02:14.880> will<00:02:15.360> take<00:02:15.960> care<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.290> your
