00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
lot I don't know I didn't look it up I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.529 
lot I don't know I didn't look it up I
would<00:01:39.500> say<00:01:39.709> 10<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.190> 20<00:01:40.489> pounds<00:01:40.670> maybe<00:01:41.060> 15

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
you come into the input which is then

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.809 
you come into the input which is then
whip<00:03:11.239> lashing<00:03:11.959> your<00:03:12.170> head<00:03:12.379> up<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.489> what<00:03:13.700> do<00:03:13.760> we

have to do well usually the culprits for

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.720 
have to do well usually the culprits for
this<00:03:17.079> number<00:03:18.079> one<00:03:18.319> if<00:03:18.590> somebody's<00:03:19.400> poor

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
this number one if somebody's poor

discuss in my up-and-coming DVD the
dynamite<00:05:32.130> downswing<00:05:32.840> but<00:05:33.840> let's<00:05:34.350> get<00:05:34.500> into

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
dynamite downswing but let's get into

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.640 
dynamite downswing but let's get into
this<00:05:34.830> some<00:05:35.010> more<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:35.790> it's<00:05:36.480> a<00:05:36.660> free<00:05:37.050> pivot

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
this some more so it's a free pivot

that move where that right shoulder

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.290 
that move where that right shoulder
works<00:06:25.200> towards<00:06:25.710> the<00:06:25.860> ball<00:06:26.070> and<00:06:26.400> you<00:06:26.790> can<00:06:26.970> start

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
works towards the ball and you can start

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.290

this<00:06:45.690> explosive<00:06:46.410> golf<00:06:46.530> show<00:06:46.800> was<00:06:47.010> a<00:06:47.040> short

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
this explosive golf show was a short

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.830 
this explosive golf show was a short
little<00:06:47.550> show<00:06:47.850> but<00:06:48.419> I<00:06:48.450> think<00:06:48.510> it's<00:06:48.750> an

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
little show but I think it's an

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.780 
little show but I think it's an
important<00:06:49.380> show<00:06:49.590> because<00:06:50.250> if<00:06:50.340> you<00:06:50.460> went<00:06:50.700> to

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
important show because if you went to

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.719 
important show because if you went to
any<00:06:51.060> golf<00:06:51.330> course<00:06:51.780> in<00:06:51.900> America<00:06:52.410> worldwide<00:06:53.070> you

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
any golf course in America worldwide you

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.320 
any golf course in America worldwide you
would<00:06:53.910> probably<00:06:54.390> find<00:06:54.570> 90<00:06:55.320> to<00:06:55.470> 95%<00:06:56.220> of<00:06:56.880> golfers

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
would probably find 90 to 95% of golfers

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.690 
would probably find 90 to 95% of golfers
out<00:06:57.510> there<00:06:57.570> trying<00:06:58.440> desperately<00:06:58.800> to<00:06:59.310> keep

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
out there trying desperately to keep

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.470 
out there trying desperately to keep
their<00:06:59.940> head<00:07:00.180> down

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
their head down

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.840 
their head down
keep<00:07:01.110> their<00:07:01.320> eyes<00:07:01.560> pressed<00:07:02.160> over<00:07:02.550> the<00:07:02.640> ball

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
keep their eyes pressed over the ball

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.480 
keep their eyes pressed over the ball
and<00:07:03.120> yet<00:07:03.720> they<00:07:03.870> have<00:07:04.020> a<00:07:04.050> poor<00:07:04.410> concept<00:07:05.160> of

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
and yet they have a poor concept of

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.940 
and yet they have a poor concept of
number<00:07:06.240> one<00:07:06.420> the<00:07:06.570> trajectory<00:07:07.260> of<00:07:07.410> the<00:07:07.680> stroke

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:07.950 
number one the trajectory of the stroke

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.310 
number one the trajectory of the stroke
but<00:07:08.190> also<00:07:08.430> on<00:07:08.880> how<00:07:09.300> that<00:07:09.360> a<00:07:09.540> club<00:07:09.900> should<00:07:10.110> meet

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
but also on how that a club should meet

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.440 
but also on how that a club should meet
the<00:07:10.470> ball<00:07:10.680> most<00:07:11.370> of<00:07:11.610> them<00:07:11.700> are<00:07:11.790> trying<00:07:11.970> to<00:07:12.120> work
