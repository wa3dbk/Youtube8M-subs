when I and other people who really get

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.689 
when I and other people who really get

455 for 5 reps now and he's trying to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.609 
455 for 5 reps now and he's trying to
add<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.170> he's<00:01:37.290> trying<00:01:37.530> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
add that up and he's trying to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.740 
add that up and he's trying to
eventually<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.310> 500<00:01:38.880> pounds<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.329> 5<00:01:39.479> reps

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

eventually get to 500 pounds for 5 reps
and<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:40.799> asked<00:01:41.009> me<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> thought<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.729> his

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and he asked me what I thought of his

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
and he asked me what I thought of his
progression<00:01:42.540> pattern<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.350> joked<00:01:43.619> back

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
progression pattern and I joked back

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.310 
progression pattern and I joked back
with<00:01:44.100> him<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.720> someone<00:01:46.049> who<00:01:46.170> can

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
with him that you have someone who can

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.889 
with him that you have someone who can
bench<00:01:46.590> 405<00:01:47.430> pounds<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:48.060> 10<00:01:48.210> reps<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.540> asking

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
bench 405 pounds for 10 reps is asking

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.870 
bench 405 pounds for 10 reps is asking
me<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.290> think<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.310> their<00:01:50.490> progression

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
me what I think if not their progression

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.580 
me what I think if not their progression
better<00:01:53.030> really<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.320> about

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
better really but what do I think about

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.520 
better really but what do I think about
his<00:01:58.860> progression<00:01:59.189> pattern<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> very

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
his progression pattern that is a very

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.590 
his progression pattern that is a very
old-school<00:02:01.920> method<00:02:02.549> guys<00:02:02.850> were<00:02:03.119> doing<00:02:03.329> that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
old-school method guys were doing that

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.520 
old-school method guys were doing that
shit<00:02:03.840> back<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.320> 50s<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.100> 60s<00:02:06.229> back<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
shit back in the 50s and 60s back in the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.740 
shit back in the 50s and 60s back in the
day<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.099> strongest<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.209> only<00:02:09.509> drug

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
day when the strongest and only drug

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.660 
day when the strongest and only drug
they<00:02:09.929> had<00:02:10.110> around<00:02:10.319> was<00:02:10.530> Dianabol<00:02:11.190> they<00:02:11.430> didn't

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
they had around was Dianabol they didn't

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.720 
they had around was Dianabol they didn't
have<00:02:11.790> access<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.300> all

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

these<00:02:14.890> guys<00:02:15.099> were<00:02:15.340> still<00:02:15.550> big<00:02:15.909> and<00:02:16.180> strong<00:02:16.360> as

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
these guys were still big and strong as

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
hell and that's what guys used to often

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.130 
hell and that's what guys used to often
do<00:02:18.700> back<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.330> day<00:02:19.450> that's<00:02:19.659> a<00:02:19.840> very

to be all-around big and strong that's a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.250 
to be all-around big and strong that's a

supplementation that individual has but
it's<00:02:57.459> still<00:02:57.609> interesting<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.239> he's

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
it's still interesting that he's

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.910 
it's still interesting that he's
promoting<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.930> idea<00:02:59.260> but<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.709> sometimes

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
promoting this idea but it sometimes

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.180 
promoting this idea but it sometimes
goes<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.340> show<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.910> sometimes<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.870> very

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
goes to show you that sometimes the very

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.069 
goes to show you that sometimes the very

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
simplistic old-school methods that guys

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.830 
simplistic old-school methods that guys
have<00:03:05.500> been<00:03:05.650> using<00:03:05.890> for<00:03:06.190> 50<00:03:06.609> or<00:03:06.790> 60<00:03:07.299> years<00:03:07.329> or

have been using for 50 or 60 years or

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.410 
have been using for 50 or 60 years or
more<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.530> use<00:03:09.489> these<00:03:09.790> things<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.299> become

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
more and use these things to become

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.650 
more and use these things to become
massively<00:03:11.140> big<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.680> strong<00:03:12.060> they<00:03:13.060> still<00:03:13.420> work

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
massively big and strong they still work

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.930 
massively big and strong they still work
today<00:03:13.900> if<00:03:14.379> someone<00:03:15.220> wanted<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.730> very

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
today if someone wanted a very

today if someone wanted a very

simplistic training protocol who just

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.309 
simplistic training protocol who just
had<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.030> goals<00:03:19.239> of<00:03:19.419> trying<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.750> get<00:03:19.900> big<00:03:20.290> and

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
had the goals of trying to get big and

had the goals of trying to get big and
strong<00:03:20.590> as<00:03:21.010> hell<00:03:21.329> they<00:03:22.329> could<00:03:22.389> use<00:03:22.720> this

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
strong as hell they could use this

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.080 
strong as hell they could use this
program<00:03:23.319> they<00:03:24.040> could<00:03:24.220> do<00:03:24.370> just<00:03:24.669> that<00:03:24.849> on<00:03:24.970> all

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
program they could do just that on all

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.309

their<00:03:25.239> big<00:03:25.359> compound<00:03:25.750> lifts<00:03:26.079> they<00:03:26.169> could

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
their big compound lifts they could

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.500 
their big compound lifts they could
start<00:03:26.590> with<00:03:26.739> 5<00:03:27.010> rep<00:03:27.250> sets<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.790> slowly<00:03:28.120> build

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
start with 5 rep sets and slowly build

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.930 
start with 5 rep sets and slowly build
up<00:03:28.690> however<00:03:28.959> long<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.500> took<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:30.010> eventually

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
up however long it took to eventually

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.400 
up however long it took to eventually
get<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.180> 10<00:03:31.359> reps<00:03:31.599> with<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.870> weight<00:03:32.109> and<00:03:32.290> then

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
get to 10 reps with that weight and then

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.259 
get to 10 reps with that weight and then
add<00:03:32.620> wait<00:03:32.889> until<00:03:33.519> they<00:03:33.639> it<00:03:33.819> was<00:03:33.940> heavy<00:03:34.120> enough

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
add wait until they it was heavy enough
