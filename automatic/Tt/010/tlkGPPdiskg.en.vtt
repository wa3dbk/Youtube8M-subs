00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
close in the first two periods I have to

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.860 
close in the first two periods I have to
admit<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.819> definitely<00:02:26.030> blow<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:26.510> home<00:02:26.720> at

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
the end for a 6-1 victory now on to the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.680 
the end for a 6-1 victory now on to the
player<00:02:31.489> growth<00:02:31.760> screen<00:02:33.879> as<00:02:34.879> you<00:02:35.060> can<00:02:35.209> see<00:02:35.329> here

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
player growth screen as you can see here

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.229 
player growth screen as you can see here
not<00:02:35.959> really<00:02:36.230> much<00:02:36.379> choice<00:02:36.670> when<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.700> comes<00:02:38.000> to

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
not really much choice when it comes to

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.610 
not really much choice when it comes to
signing<00:02:38.750> your<00:02:38.810> experience<00:02:39.260> points<00:02:39.560> so

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
signing your experience points so

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.110 
signing your experience points so
basically<00:02:39.889> just<00:02:39.980> Maksim<00:02:40.489> at<00:02:40.609> as<00:02:40.730> much<00:02:40.850> as<00:02:41.030> you

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
basically just Maksim at as much as you

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.000 
basically just Maksim at as much as you
can

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
can

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.069 
can
and<00:02:43.010> that's<00:02:43.160> exactly<00:02:43.340> what<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.819> do<00:02:43.930> then<00:02:44.930> I

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
and that's exactly what I do then I

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.720 
and that's exactly what I do then I
decide<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.500> change<00:02:45.709> up<00:02:45.980> my<00:02:46.250> boosters

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
decide to change up my boosters

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.460 
decide to change up my boosters
basically<00:02:47.299> I<00:02:47.329> only<00:02:47.450> changed<00:02:47.810> up<00:02:47.930> one<00:02:48.139> that<00:02:48.319> was

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
basically I only changed up one that was

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.470 
basically I only changed up one that was
the<00:02:48.650> athletic<00:02:49.010> booster<00:02:49.549> I<00:02:49.730> went<00:02:50.180> from<00:02:50.269> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
the athletic booster I went from the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.289 
the athletic booster I went from the
cha-cha<00:02:51.019> which<00:02:51.170> gives<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.500> 4x<00:02:52.400> or<00:02:52.849> rating

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
cha-cha which gives you 4x or rating

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.420 
cha-cha which gives you 4x or rating
points<00:02:53.569> for<00:02:53.690> agility<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.410> swish<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.220> up<00:02:55.310> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
points for agility and swish it up to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.740 
points for agility and swish it up to
the<00:02:55.549> wraparound<00:02:55.940> which<00:02:56.239> gives<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.599> better

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
the wraparound which gives you better

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.750 
the wraparound which gives you better
puck<00:02:57.079> control<00:02:57.500> my<00:02:57.769> figure<00:02:58.160> getting<00:02:58.459> checked

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
puck control my figure getting checked

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.270 
puck control my figure getting checked
all<00:02:58.940> all<00:02:59.180> these<00:02:59.450> signs<00:02:59.799> it<00:03:00.799> would<00:03:00.889> be<00:03:00.980> nice<00:03:01.130> to

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
all all these signs it would be nice to

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.580 
all all these signs it would be nice to
have<00:03:01.400> some<00:03:01.609> X<00:03:01.819> or<00:03:02.030> puck<00:03:02.269> control<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.500> that's

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
have some X or puck control so that's

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.860 
have some X or puck control so that's
what<00:03:03.799> I<00:03:03.859> did<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.370> until<00:03:05.269> next<00:03:05.419> time<00:03:05.599> this<00:03:05.810> is

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
what I did so until next time this is

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.489 
what I did so until next time this is
