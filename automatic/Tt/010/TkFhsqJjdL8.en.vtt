00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.500
 well this slope to all is sir 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.270
 blood burns everything for the attacked qg 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.340
 so bring here too 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.279
 so in fact me strategy is really 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.390
 very simple so tunes once I try 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.050
 to attack but I had taken to 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.869
 the enemy 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.290
 so we'll get around this Tuesday and 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.460
 try to understand this mmo j 9000 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.980
 it's a special weapon missing them 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.899
 poor the human soul but really very 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.480
 violent or at 12000 health this one is 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.340
 to arrive here when one is the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.949
 montreuillois dream to contain it this 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.309
 mortar to get behind the qg to 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.699
 wonder so I hope I'm going 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.600
 succeed 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.600
 we will try to attack the research 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.850
 that I have a connection so here is 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.390
 I'm going to take the cannon is launched all 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.250
 these are the mortars so no that small 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.230
 little but unfortunately we will launch 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.790
 my troops 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:13.970
 no it's still a no I'm launching 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.970
 Lets' go 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.829
 I launch his rocket of distress or who 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.689
 shit the mines ouch ouch it hurts 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.840
 my last zucca was destroyed pretty 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.840
 string 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.200
 we will be content to destroy it 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.030
 I launch my second d2 rocket I want 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.460
 to be good in a bit it means a 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.729
 distress rocket but that's not it 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.640
 sells under fire from the 9000 mlg 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.840
 that i will tackle north qg knew 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.840
 just but I think it's feasible 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:58.340
 so I would have attacked the qg under the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.430
 hall and too much pressure from the mnj 9000 the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.140
 life of tea qg without small step by 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.190
 small port we may be able to get there 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.650
 while a rifle is in the process 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:16.690
 to shoot down the radar underneath it is not 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.690
 not too touched by the mjc very well 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.990
 while the qg is in the process of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.620
 decrease in life issue but I know 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.390
 not if it 'll finally make you 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.370
 rifle would come on the radar to him 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:38.840
 alone he now attacks the qg 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.330
 so always under the fire of the mnj and he 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.560
 just lost his life 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.420
 while amelie most balèze soldiers 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.050
 are in a bag that I know more too 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.050
 when we call them 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.650
 this is going to be corrected I take 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.260
 station that is only a small minute 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.720
 in this must be feasible I think the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.100
 times I had taken these mines conveyed 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.120
 I have them eliminate all his mines 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.170
 frankly there is nothing left 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.460
 no it was frankly it's 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.910
 really doable sergeant I have 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.350
 still a soda that to a life there 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.420
 call to vivières he had barely 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.630
 five seconds 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.110
 oh right here it's gonna be right with just 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.110
 we believe in it anyway 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.240
 while the i9000 mmg are attacking us 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.860
 always alternated yes we will succeed on 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.860
 story is good it's sure we succeed in 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:39.990
 tension victory so ben that's the 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.600
 vision of the game have shown you that 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.250
 attack and hell and damnation know you 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.620
 how difficult it is to premium 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.780
 and all these wild all these wild 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.370
 excuse me very well this state island 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.820
 you have other bigger ones and 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.820
 more formidable 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.060
 victory 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.360
 competition a lot of choices in 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.170
 more so here I did 4 any case of 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.170
 loss and the one chosen 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.350
 and here I am with the little trophy of 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.650
 revenge we're just going to see them quickly 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.650
 made 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.490
 still larger units I 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.060
 think the weather is good and we're going 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.060
 towards the little trophy 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.240
 Everything in its time 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:41.030
 these are the trophies of which 25 cases in his 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.159
 junior ranks fighting on this I hope that 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.139
