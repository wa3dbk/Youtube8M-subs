wherever she wants and then the other
side<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:49.769> another<00:02:50.010> fixed<00:02:50.459> loop<00:02:50.609> like

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
side you have another fixed loop like

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.789 
side you have another fixed loop like
this<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:51.900> bring<00:02:52.169> it<00:02:52.260> around<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.560> tree
