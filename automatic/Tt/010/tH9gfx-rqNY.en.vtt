00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and black they say oh I used to think it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.630 
and black they say oh I used to think it
was<00:01:38.270> MBS<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:39.570> reading<00:01:39.750> upside<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.640> now

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
was MBS I was reading upside down now

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.560 
was MBS I was reading upside down now
with<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.970> oh<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.810> god<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.009> says<00:01:44.610> sqw

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
with it oh my god it actually says sqw

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.350

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
yeah probably so I don't think the last

lot of words is usually like cool like
that<00:01:58.050> but<00:01:59.010> but<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.000> also<00:02:00.150> has<00:02:00.330> like<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
that but but it also has like the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.690 
that but but it also has like the
