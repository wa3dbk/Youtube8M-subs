00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 and so friends hello to everyone today I want 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.920
 tell you how to do it 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.519
 bunker feeder for rabbits from 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.519
 profile 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.769
 the profile here is what we get here 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.849
 on sizes 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:28.199
 6 height three 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.099
 that is, immediately say take such 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.390
 of course you can take a bigger profile 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.969
 this is someone like a fantasy 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.540
 played out here right away here 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.890
 see here such eclipse and here's the little thing 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.980
 take pliers here 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.469
 knead leveling ie you already 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:54.660
 show now let's figure it out 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:01:03.739
 take two pieces of length 35 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.739
 centimeters and 24 centimeters long 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:13.830
 look now here 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:17.610
 mark the size of 25 centimeters do 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.080
 marks then next mark 7 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.170
 centimeters and three centimeters why three 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.900
 centimeters because we have here 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.220
 get 3 centimeters done here 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.280
 leaves on one side and on the other 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.270
 third in and scissor cut 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:47.840
 metal the cut and what we get and 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.840
 so here it is, it's all elementary 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.620
 in this way, that is one part 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.520
 feeders did we get that is 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.720
 very easily just take the second 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:10.759
 part the second part as i roasted 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:15.830
 24 centimeters here with a single 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.860
 here the nuance is small here it turns out 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.740
 width we have three centimeters take here 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.110
 half an inch and a half and well I did 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.680
 eight centimeters long that is here 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.160
 did noted here cut off can 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.060
 make 10 centimeters long 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.940
 I tried a new one not enough 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.730
 now how is she going to take two 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.730
 parts is one to one 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.910
 guys harmonica 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.380
 almost ready for this kind 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.550
 it's really gonna take a camera now 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:09.820
 show you see not necessarily the end 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:14.000
 you're exactly what i'm not trying to do and 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:18.130
 exactly to the millimeter it's not necessarily me 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.130
 I think the main thing that was practical convenient 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:36.580
 Here is such a feeder is obtained among 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:36.580
 nko now we have to rivet here and 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:45.709
 here and whenever possible in principle it is possible 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:50.209
 here to rivet on one side and with 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:54.739
 I will not rivet the second one 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:58.220
 that we will use ordinary ordinary 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.500
 shilale guest punching per group 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.460
 wire 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.830
 and all things look like this now I 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:12.250
 I did it all I will not show 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.250
 I will show you the finished feeder 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.410
 and so here we have such here 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:22.199
 harmonica 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.530
 finished here broke a couple of holes 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:29.190
 normal wire everything is secure all 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:34.160
 keeps well here two holes all 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:37.199
 around rewind here does not go hard 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.060
 there is usually a couple of electrical tape in. 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:45.990
 after all . rather all just 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:49.260
 neatly I think it turned out on 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.880
 cancel while let's check tried 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.880
 pour a half liter jar over here 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:12.930
 look I myself wonder yet not 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:15.770
 I measured the guys well, I will say this 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.599
 practically down to the floor a liter jar 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:23.550
 abyss changed the floor liter jar goes 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:26.190
 there feed a rabbit well, about three 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.900
 days that is like this 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.580
 small feeder of course you 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:35.970
 experimenting do more less 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:39.659
 sometimes even approximately we will see how 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:44.370
 it works here is filled up even well 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:46.490
 half a liter quietly 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.990
 we select 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:55.580
 it can be seen that gradually enough sleep that is 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:59.880
 Here is such a simple trough 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:03.060
 quick neat valve i.e. 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.389
 a rabbit he will not fool rake she 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.360
 will wake up here that is clearly 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.659
 it is clear that there is no problem at all 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.320
 what will she choose again 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:21.800
 I hope to scatter 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:23.540
 they are not here and so all friends 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.110
 as usual
