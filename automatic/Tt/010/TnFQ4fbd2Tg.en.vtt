the<00:00:09.660> vacuum<00:00:09.870> pack<00:00:10.260> elite<00:00:10.740> can<00:00:11.250> do<00:00:11.519> jars<00:00:11.849> as

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
the vacuum pack elite can do jars as

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.560 
the vacuum pack elite can do jars as
well<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.750> bags<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.460> inside<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
well as bags so on the inside of the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.769 
well as bags so on the inside of the
channel<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> little<00:00:16.650> stand-up<00:00:17.279> pipe<00:00:17.779> which

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
channel is a little stand-up pipe which

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.040 
channel is a little stand-up pipe which
allows<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.859> plug<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.760> jar<00:00:21.029> sealer<00:00:21.420> now

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
allows you to plug in a jar sealer now

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.650 
allows you to plug in a jar sealer now
jar<00:00:22.439> sealers<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.490> simple<00:00:24.330> device

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
jar sealers are a very simple device

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.410 
jar sealers are a very simple device
they<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> rubber<00:00:26.010> gasket<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.880> inside

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
they have a rubber gasket on the inside

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.589 
they have a rubber gasket on the inside
of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.840> jar<00:00:27.990> sealer<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.760> three<00:00:29.760> prongs<00:00:30.179> that

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
of the jar sealer and three prongs that

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.459 
of the jar sealer and three prongs that
basically<00:00:31.260> help<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.070> lid<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:33.110> lift<00:00:34.110> off<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
basically help the lid to lift off the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.819 
basically help the lid to lift off the
jar<00:00:35.190> without<00:00:35.640> gluing<00:00:36.510> itself<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> inside

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
jar without gluing itself to the inside

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.549 
jar without gluing itself to the inside
of<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.219> jar<00:00:38.399> sealer<00:00:39.020> so<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.290> want<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
of the jar sealer so when you want to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
of the jar sealer so when you want to
create<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.890> vacuum<00:00:41.579> inside<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.390> jar<00:00:42.629> put<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
create a vacuum inside the jar put the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.979 
create a vacuum inside the jar put the
flat<00:00:43.500> lid<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.980> top<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> jar<00:00:44.820> plug<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
flat lid on top of the jar plug it in

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
flat lid on top of the jar plug it in
and<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.920> case<00:00:47.190> we're<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> put<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and in this case we're going to put the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
and in this case we're going to put the
open<00:00:48.270> end<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> hose<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:51.110> suction<00:00:52.110> port

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410

and<00:00:52.620> use<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.030> controls<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.260> turn<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.829> machine

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and use the controls to turn the machine

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.319 
and use the controls to turn the machine
on<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.780> all<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.170> lights<00:00:58.410> light<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
on so that all the lights light up and

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.770 
on so that all the lights light up and
hit<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.570> pump<00:01:00.989> switch<00:01:01.789> now<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.210> will

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
hit the pump switch now this will

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.039 
hit the pump switch now this will
extract<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.920> air<00:01:05.100> from<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> jar<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.240> create

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
extract the air from the jar and create

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.870 
extract the air from the jar and create
a<00:01:07.110> vacuum<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.920> inside<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.939> jar

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.910 

in<00:01:13.299> this<00:01:13.450> case<00:01:13.719> of<00:01:13.990> packing<00:01:14.380> peanuts<00:01:14.799> they're

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
in this case of packing peanuts they're

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.130 
in this case of packing peanuts they're
sort<00:01:15.310> of<00:01:15.399> expanding<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.180> little<00:01:16.420> bit<00:01:16.600> when<00:01:16.990> the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
sort of expanding a little bit when the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.920 
sort of expanding a little bit when the
machine<00:01:17.469> shuts<00:01:17.740> off<00:01:18.149> uncork<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.299> jar<00:01:19.509> sealer

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
machine shuts off uncork the jar sealer

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.810 
machine shuts off uncork the jar sealer
and<00:01:20.549> remove<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.820> jar<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.640> keeps<00:01:24.640> your

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
and remove the jar and that keeps your

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.419 
and remove the jar and that keeps your
lid<00:01:25.180> vacuum-packed<00:01:26.170> nice<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:26.649> tight<00:01:29.429> so

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
lid vacuum-packed nice and tight so

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.359 
lid vacuum-packed nice and tight so
since<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.270> lid<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.829> vacuum-pack<00:01:32.829> nice<00:01:33.100> and

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
since the lid is vacuum-pack nice and

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.950 
since the lid is vacuum-pack nice and
tight<00:01:33.610> on<00:01:33.789> it<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.119> next<00:01:34.240> time<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.689> want<00:01:34.840> to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
tight on it the next time you want to

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.309 
tight on it the next time you want to
open<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.470> jar<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:36.069> use<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.390> back<00:01:37.630> set<00:01:38.049> of<00:01:38.200> a

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
open the jar I use a the back set of a

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.770 
open the jar I use a the back set of a
dirty<00:01:38.920> knife<00:01:39.220> blade<00:01:39.549> in<00:01:39.759> my<00:01:39.939> kitchen<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.659> then

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
dirty knife blade in my kitchen and then

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.960

just<00:01:41.289> give<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.770> lid<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:41.979> little<00:01:42.280> bit<00:01:42.429> of<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.579> pry

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
just give the lid a little bit of a pry

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.389 
just give the lid a little bit of a pry
up<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:44.049> will<00:01:44.200> let<00:01:44.380> air<00:01:44.619> back<00:01:44.950> into<00:01:45.159> the

up and that will let air back into the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:53.160 
up and that will let air back into the
jar<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.640> take<00:01:46.090> lid<00:01:46.299> off<00:01:46.450> quite<00:01:46.689> easily<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:53.140> of

is so popular with us is the fact that

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.679 
is so popular with us is the fact that
it<00:01:58.659> does<00:01:59.170> handle<00:01:59.709> liquids<00:02:00.399> better<00:02:01.179> than<00:02:01.479> most

are going to suck a little bit of juice

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.039 
are going to suck a little bit of juice
up<00:02:26.230> into<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> machine<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.430> again<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.060> we're

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
up into the machine so again and we're

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.870 
up into the machine so again and we're
going<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.350> use<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.829> manual<00:02:30.069> setting<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
going to use the manual setting and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.059 
going to use the manual setting and
because<00:02:31.720> we<00:02:31.930> know<00:02:32.139> we're<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.620> suck<00:02:33.040> some

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
because we know we're going to suck some

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.490 
because we know we're going to suck some
juice<00:02:33.489> up<00:02:33.700> across<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.060> heat-seal<00:02:34.690> bar<00:02:34.959> we<00:02:35.290> are

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
juice up across the heat-seal bar we are

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.789 
juice up across the heat-seal bar we are
going<00:02:35.889> to<00:02:36.130> increase<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.120> seal<00:02:37.420> time<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.650> its

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
going to increase the seal time to its

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.150 
going to increase the seal time to its
maximum<00:02:39.220> setting<00:02:40.019> will<00:02:41.019> use<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.440> manual<00:02:41.680> heat

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
maximum setting will use the manual heat

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.000 
maximum setting will use the manual heat
cycle<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.269> that<00:02:43.299> we<00:02:43.569> can<00:02:43.780> watch<00:02:44.019> when<00:02:44.980> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
cycle so that we can watch when the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.729 
cycle so that we can watch when the
juices<00:02:45.609> start<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:45.970> move<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.690> once<00:02:47.260> we<00:02:47.500> see

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
juices start to move and once we see

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.020 
juices start to move and once we see
them<00:02:47.950> moving

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
them moving

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.120 
them moving
you<00:02:49.360> push<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.840> seal<00:02:50.080> button<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.010> the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
you push the seal button so that the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.940 
you push the seal button so that the
heat<00:02:51.340> seal<00:02:51.700> will<00:02:52.060> activate<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.930> then<00:02:53.620> keep

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
heat seal will activate and then keep

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.010 
heat seal will activate and then keep
your<00:02:54.160> eye<00:02:54.190> on<00:02:54.340> those<00:02:54.790> juices<00:02:55.330> they<00:02:55.630> need<00:02:55.870> to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
your eye on those juices they need to

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.900 
your eye on those juices they need to
stop<00:02:56.290> moving<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.069> then<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.400> know<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
stop moving and then you know that the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.540 
stop moving and then you know that the
bag<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.150> sealed<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.920> one<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.340> few

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
bag is sealed this is one of the few

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.340 
bag is sealed this is one of the few
channel<00:03:01.030> style<00:03:01.270> machines<00:03:01.690> I've<00:03:01.930> ever<00:03:02.080> seen

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
channel style machines I've ever seen

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.080 
channel style machines I've ever seen
that<00:03:02.620> will<00:03:02.740> actually<00:03:02.920> seal<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.610> bag<00:03:03.790> even

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
that will actually seal the bag even

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.380 
that will actually seal the bag even
when<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.110> wet
