00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello everyone with you mister gir 45 i'm still 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.490
 once I apologize for the last time 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.130
 was such a well, not very good homemade 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.839
 which didn't even cling today itself 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.680
 will be homemade which is possible for you 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.410
 hook it maybe someone and no though 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.539
 principle i'm involved looked at her in 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:41.000
 In principle, this is such a resident of the island hunting 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:48.149
 sage and as already understood the tour 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.050
 jungle air tour in general 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.940
 there are no poems 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.940
 samantha seems i know the element of air 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:05.129
 jungle I don't know why they decided so well yes 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:07.080
 Ok, here is such a tug of hunched and how 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.650
 you see where I got this simple 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.040
 do you think everything is right from Fourno xl 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.990
 from the brain series and so am i barely 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.200
 did and here such in this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.430
 dressing gown or something like a robe 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.640
 probably I don’t know how to do it right 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.030
 I call it very hard to do it all 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.340
 him and by the way here is the removal function 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.900
 masks blocked completely i.e. 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.280
 can not and can create such 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.220
 a little turaga behind me fixed 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.750
 so black wire but not 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.750
 wire I know this 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.909
 say which wire is so close up 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.420
 wire 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.270
 if you can see there is an hour well seen slightly 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.030
 here he sits down to drag 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:06.030
 and maybe if you bought it cool there 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:08.099
 example technique where there are wires you there 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.420
 such wires and all the time for doing such 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.959
 cork 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.730
 small and it’s me and procrastination 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.940
 made him such a waist on metal 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.410
 optina 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.780
 are you here all the robe call attack 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.739
 I do not know what exactly is called such 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.450
 small turaga 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.670
 he would still be wearing a robe and there or 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.099
 some kind of ken would write three whales 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.750
 hieroglyphs would be cool at all 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.430
 light green ro glyphs with stripes 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.799
 needs and would like hawala but 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.200
 gray know how some of the 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.299
 rag already 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.640
 but how can I change this color ? 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:54.750
 the sofa but only darker and torn 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.269
 such would be very cool he seriously by 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.329
 I probably even have this tree 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.950
 colors like here's a stick camp she's so 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:07.430
 colors and a staff like this 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.880
 with all sorts of algae 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.970
 branches with a cross face the blade on 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.850
 the end of such a tour 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.760
 if you like him and me he is very 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.049
 I still liked it somehow 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.480
 implement everything and think a good option 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.730
 I could have someone 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.150
 get better and maybe someone 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.250
 get worse do not argue with you was 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.590
