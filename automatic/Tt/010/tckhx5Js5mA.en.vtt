00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.849
 hello to all dear friends of painters 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.880
 famous this day begins the guide for the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.300
 making the DIY nativity scene 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.779
 the first step is the choice of the base 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.890
 we have used this as a basis 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.460
 what you see in the background that they would be 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.130
 of the ikea platforms that are used 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.280
 precisely for the storage of goods e 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.040
 if you go to ikea you can find gods 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 departments where these pedals no longer have 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 the goods and therefore we can take them 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.379
 free of charge and realize the basis of the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.600
 our crib this platform is 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.730
 very useful both because it is raised by the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.359
 point of support in fact you see these 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.820
 blocks both because it is made of cardboard 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.920
 so we have the possibility to create 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.400
 holes very easily for later 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.830
 pass the lights and we can 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.860
 use as well as a stroke a 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.880
 very sturdy cardboard also of the tables 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.479
 of plywood 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.299
 we can also divide the base into more 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.940
 sections as it will be more useful 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.820
 keep it in the future 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.400
 because in small pieces they can 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.800
 be kept more easily 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.010
 we can now move on to 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.390
 realization of the sketch based on 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:50.650
 on the base which is a meter and a half to 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.240
 a meter roughly so let's start with 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.130
 the same 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.630
 let's proceed then make the sketch that you 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.150
 Speed issues 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.320
 I have drawn a bit the size of 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:09.910
 what I wanted to do 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:12.630
 however it is enough to create the plant that is less 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.310
 of the form we want to achieve 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.530
 takes the form of the base of ours 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:25.200
 crib that we start with the closes 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:29.200
 various areas in our crib 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:35.520
 add two little hills more or less 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:40.720
 one high on the left and the other 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:44.880
 on the right side and the hill on the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:49.750
 the right side will also include ours 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.610
 cave in this point in this 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:58.600
 point we will come our cave 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:04.620
 from the while on the hill on the side 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.620
 left that I love small houses 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.019
 so many small houses not even many 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.650
 because for they will be small houses 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:18.040
 then in the distance and on a mountain e 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.370
 so the density of houses is not so 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.570
 high as we go towards the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:30.400
 plain that this area could be 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:33.310
 enlarge a building this for 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.750
 give a sense of depth in the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:42.540
 increasingly perspective construction 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.910
 large and finally of reconstructions that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.840
 maybe they will house the carpentry or 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:56.080
 other things even larger 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:04:00.310
 here we then separated the two 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:04.260
 small hills evidence that we want in 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.530
 half a river passes the little river 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:12.240
 in this way and then this little river 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.240
 will create a pond 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.989
 here it is 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:29.360
 this would be the little river I drive 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:29.360
 those with the heavenly quickly 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.000
 then we can add a bridge 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.960
 we can add a bridge this 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.280
 point and then maybe we can detail them 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.230
 add as they come to us 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.680
 ideas during the construction of the crib 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.080
 this little sketch is already sufficient 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.490
 to start with the real crib e 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.100
 we just don't need to 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.280
 make drawings with many 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.280
 details 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.210
 here is the end result there is not 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.640
 I anticipated that we will base ourselves on the 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.360
 classic crib with or 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.900
 setting in Bethlehem from where there is a 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.420
 particular type of vegetation in 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.570
 particular plants that resist climates 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:28.980
 arid therefore like the olive trees and the 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:31.140
 palm trees and the soil will be very dry 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.610
 so our setting will have 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:38.760
 craggy rocks that are a lot 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:43.790
 valid that we represent just one 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:46.590
 dry climate and the only vegetation 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.310
 we find it near the 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.050
 river 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:56.310
 then the houses in Bethlehem are in 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:06:01.860
 terracotta then we will reproduce the houses 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:05.340
 of Bethlehem in terracotta with plaster 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.820
 white also these houses have one 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.130
 small dome in like roof and don't have 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.980
 a sloping roof the roof a 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.220
 spiovente is used in environments where 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:20.790
 the rains are very intense while here 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.580
 in Bethlehem there is no need and the roof 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:27.660
 a dome serves to collect 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:31.500
 heat upwards then remove it 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:34.140
 from the environment where you live is in fact vi 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.720
 they are houses with domes that 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.050
 they even have a small hole in the 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.490
 center just to let it flow 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.300
 outside the heat that is created 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.420
 inside of 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.790
 in this way of houses not only remain 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.960
 fresh but there is a continuous influx of 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.700
 area and a recycling of air and this is the 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.970
 our crib base 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:01.590
 in addition you can choose cheese makers 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:05.730
 also on the Neapolitan crib of 700 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:12.110
 set in old vehicles in the 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:15.420
 ancient alleys of naples with houses that 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:18.270
 associated with ruins that houses a lot 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:21.510
 ancient with balconies and so on 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:27.450
 these houses in particular instead are 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:28.830
 to one or maximum two floors and is therefore 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.600
 that 's all 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:34.230
 let's move on to the next one 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.890
 of the construction of the hillocks e 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.890
 of the mountains
