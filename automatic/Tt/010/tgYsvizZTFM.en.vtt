the first Manchester Fashion Week it's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
the first Manchester Fashion Week it's
never<00:01:34.920> we've<00:01:35.610> never<00:01:35.640> had<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> fashion<00:01:36.420> week

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.330 
never we've never had a fashion week
before<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.350> was<00:01:37.380> quite<00:01:37.590> special<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
before so it was quite special and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.330 
before so it was quite special and
exciting<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:40.229> was<00:01:40.530> quite<00:01:40.650> small<00:01:41.010> because

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
exciting and it was quite small because

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.890 
exciting and it was quite small because
obviously<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:42.030> wasn't<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.420> London<00:01:42.750> Fashion

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
obviously it wasn't like London Fashion

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.890 
obviously it wasn't like London Fashion
Week<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.700> because<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.090> first<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.600> but

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
Week and because it is the first one but

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.420

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
catwalk pictures I was trying really

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.990

hard<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> image<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:05.970> focus

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
hard to get the image is in focus

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.020 
hard to get the image is in focus
because<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:07.320> not<00:02:07.710> used<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> shooting<00:02:08.429> kind<00:02:08.939> of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
because I'm not used to shooting kind of

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.280 
because I'm not used to shooting kind of
moving<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:10.669> subjects<00:02:11.669> so<00:02:12.299> that<00:02:12.959> was<00:02:13.079> a<00:02:13.109> bit<00:02:13.230> of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
moving and subjects so that was a bit of

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.659 
moving and subjects so that was a bit of
a<00:02:13.349> challenge<00:02:13.529> with<00:02:13.799> my<00:02:13.889> camera<00:02:14.099> but<00:02:14.340> some<00:02:14.579> of

planning<00:02:18.400> on<00:02:18.580> doing<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.849> video<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.300> but

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
planning on doing a video on this but

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.020 
planning on doing a video on this but
when<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:19.630> came<00:02:19.780> home<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.110> had<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.739> lot<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.250> footage

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
when I came home I had a lot of footage

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.460 
when I came home I had a lot of footage
of<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.360> catwalk<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.959> I<00:02:23.020> thought<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.410> a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
of the catwalk and I thought it's a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.860 
of the catwalk and I thought it's a
shame<00:02:23.680> for<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.099> kind<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.660> sit<00:02:25.660> there

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
shame for it to just kind of sit there

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.410 
shame for it to just kind of sit there
so<00:02:26.170> i<00:02:26.410> thought<00:02:26.800> i<00:02:26.860> would<00:02:26.920> show<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.250> guys<00:02:27.580> even
