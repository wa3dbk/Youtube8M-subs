00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
reptile to go into it's actually going

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.280 
reptile to go into it's actually going
to<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> burn<00:01:38.909> hole<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.630> won't<00:01:39.930> collapse

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
to be a burn hole and it won't collapse

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.160 
to be a burn hole and it won't collapse
once<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> dries<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.970> hardens<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.840> really

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
once it dries and it hardens it's really

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.700 
once it dries and it hardens it's really
good<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> part<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:45.710> use

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
good now the part that you don't use

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.399 
good now the part that you don't use
water<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.610> don't<00:01:47.939> mold<00:01:48.299> will<00:01:48.960> also

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
water with and you don't mold will also

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.920 
water with and you don't mold will also
stay<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.890> sand<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.060> there's<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.540> great

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
stay like sand so there's a great

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.980 
stay like sand so there's a great
capacity<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.979> reptile<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:54.299> also<00:01:54.750> have

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
capacity for your reptile to also have

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.620 
capacity for your reptile to also have
the<00:01:55.110> ability<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.560> borrow<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.909> sand<00:01:57.210> part

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the ability to borrow in the sand part

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.899 
the ability to borrow in the sand part
and<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:59.280> very

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
and that that's very

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
and that that's very
behavior<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.780> allows<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.439> molding<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
behavior so it allows for molding but it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.050 
behavior so it allows for molding but it
also<00:02:02.520> allows<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.060> remain<00:02:03.810> likes<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:05.130> it's

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
also allows to remain likes and so it's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.339 
also allows to remain likes and so it's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
vitae sand or something like that so you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.030
