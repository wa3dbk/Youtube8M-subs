of course this is fully customized and
it<00:00:22.199> can't<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> real<00:00:22.890> thing<00:00:23.119> but

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.630 

everyone<00:00:28.580> wants<00:00:28.850> to<00:00:28.940> know<00:00:29.029> how<00:00:29.360> it<00:00:29.480> performs

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
everyone wants to know how it performs

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.910 
everyone wants to know how it performs
it<00:00:31.660> performs<00:00:32.710> actually<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.210> acceleration<00:00:35.210> is

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
it performs actually the acceleration is

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.380 
it performs actually the acceleration is
about<00:00:36.920> average<00:00:38.290> unlike<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.440> slam<00:00:39.739> band<00:00:40.010> from

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
about average unlike the slam band from

about average unlike the slam band from
san<00:00:41.390> andreas<00:00:41.750> which<00:00:41.989> acceleration<00:00:42.620> was<00:00:42.710> fast

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
san andreas which acceleration was fast

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.049 
san andreas which acceleration was fast
and<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:44.030> vehicle<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:44.510> pretty<00:00:44.720> fast<00:00:46.059> this

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
and the vehicle is pretty fast this

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.259 
and the vehicle is pretty fast this
one's<00:00:47.620> acceleration<00:00:48.620> is<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:49.100> little<00:00:49.879> bit<00:00:50.090> above

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
one's acceleration is a little bit above

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.579 
one's acceleration is a little bit above
average<00:00:50.480> for<00:00:51.050> this<00:00:51.440> kind<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:51.980> vehicle<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:53.589> the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
average for this kind of vehicle and the

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.410 
average for this kind of vehicle and the
handling<00:00:55.010> is<00:00:55.250> actually<00:00:55.610> pretty<00:00:55.820> good<00:00:56.059> but<00:00:56.330> it

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
handling is actually pretty good but it

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.070 
handling is actually pretty good but it
is<00:00:56.830> easy<00:00:57.830> to<00:00:58.120> get<00:00:59.120> it<00:00:59.269> into<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.510> tailspin

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
is easy to get it into a tailspin

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.520 
is easy to get it into a tailspin
therefore<00:01:00.830> being<00:01:01.070> its<00:01:01.309> tail<00:01:02.000> happy<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:05.530> you

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
therefore being its tail happy and you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.690 
therefore being its tail happy and you
can<00:01:06.710> only<00:01:06.920> get<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.400> in<00:01:07.729> certain<00:01:08.210> missions

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
can only get it in certain missions

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.070 
can only get it in certain missions
unless<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:10.909> want<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.180> use<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.540> cheat<00:01:11.840> which

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
unless you want to use the cheat which

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.800 
unless you want to use the cheat which
is<00:01:12.290> 82<00:01:12.860> 655<00:01:13.790> 50<00:01:15.070> 100<00:01:18.610> which<00:01:19.610> I<00:01:20.119> used<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.659> because

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
is 82 655 50 100 which I used it because

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.230 
is 82 655 50 100 which I used it because
it's<00:01:21.110> really<00:01:21.350> hard<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.680> get<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:21.979> about<00:01:22.909> using

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
it's really hard to get it about using

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.539 
it's really hard to get it about using
that<00:01:23.270> cheap<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:23.869> got<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.860> once<00:01:25.010> before<00:01:25.220> but

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
that cheap I got it once before but

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.810 
that cheap I got it once before but
accidentally<00:01:26.060> crashed<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:27.640> yeah<00:01:28.640> I<00:01:28.670> got

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
accidentally crashed it so yeah I got

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.160 
accidentally crashed it so yeah I got
pretty<00:01:28.880> mad

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.240 

but<00:01:32.799> it's<00:01:33.580> not<00:01:33.729> tall<00:01:34.150> penny<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:36.400> is<00:01:36.520> good

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.450 

sounds<00:01:40.090> good

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.410 

I<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.860> like<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:45.220> vehicle<00:01:45.729> i<00:01:45.850> enjoy<00:01:46.240> it

I really like this vehicle i enjoy it
this<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.590> my<00:01:47.710> favorite<00:01:47.950> paint<00:01:48.250> job<00:01:48.490> with<00:01:48.729> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
this is my favorite paint job with the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.850 
this is my favorite paint job with the
red<00:01:49.060> wheels<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:53.050> only<00:01:53.170> bad<00:01:53.530> thing<00:01:53.560> about

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
red wheels I'm the only bad thing about

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.660 
red wheels I'm the only bad thing about
it<00:01:54.159> i<00:01:54.310> think<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.760> how<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.909> top<00:01:55.240> slopes<00:01:55.630> down<00:01:55.930> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it i think is how the top slopes down I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.600 
it i think is how the top slopes down I
don't<00:01:57.670> really<00:01:57.790> like<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.299> too<00:01:58.659> much<00:01:59.610> other

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
don't really like that too much other

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.899 
don't really like that too much other
than<00:02:00.790> that<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.240> love<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:01.840> lot
