in<00:00:01.920> your<00:00:02.129> notes<00:00:02.340> you'll<00:00:02.669> find<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:04.220> picture<00:00:05.220> that

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
in your notes you'll find a picture that

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.220 
in your notes you'll find a picture that
looks<00:00:05.640> kind<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.120> like<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.299> wheel<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.960> one<00:00:07.109> that

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
looks kind of like a wheel and one that

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.750 
looks kind of like a wheel and one that
looks<00:00:07.410> like<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.589> square<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.370> got<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.550> bunch

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
looks like a square and it's got a bunch

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.730 
looks like a square and it's got a bunch
of<00:00:08.880> letters<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.210> stuff<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.990> that's

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
of letters and stuff on it and that's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.249 
of letters and stuff on it and that's
called<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.219> codon<00:00:11.639> chart<00:00:11.969> okay<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.870> talked<00:00:13.110> in

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
called a codon chart okay we talked in

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.780 
called a codon chart okay we talked in
the<00:00:13.320> last<00:00:13.500> video<00:00:13.740> cut<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.219> short<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.490> talked<00:00:14.670> in

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
the last video cut on short we talked in

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.880 
the last video cut on short we talked in
the<00:00:14.820> last<00:00:14.969> video<00:00:15.179> there's<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.080> codon<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the last video there's a codon is a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.679 
the last video there's a codon is a
three<00:00:17.900> base<00:00:18.900> sequence<00:00:23.180> okay<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.449> three

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
three base sequence okay it's a three

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.189 
three base sequence okay it's a three
base<00:00:24.810> sequence<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.070> mRNA<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.199> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
base sequence it's on the mRNA and the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
base sequence it's on the mRNA and the
purpose<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> code<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.310> codons

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
purpose of the code on the codons

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.440 
purpose of the code on the codons
purpose<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.289> tell<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.360> tRNA<00:00:35.059> what<00:00:36.059> amino

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
purpose is to tell the tRNA what amino

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.530 
purpose is to tell the tRNA what amino
acid<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.960> bring<00:00:37.879> I'm<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.210> put<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
use the make sure you use the mRNA codes

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.420 
use the make sure you use the mRNA codes
not<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.480> tRNA<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> all<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> them<00:00:59.190> should

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
not the tRNA and all of them should

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.119 
not the tRNA and all of them should
start<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.910> Aug<00:01:00.480> okay<00:01:01.230> there's<00:01:01.559> two<00:01:01.800> kinds<00:01:02.070> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
start with Aug okay there's two kinds of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.609 
start with Aug okay there's two kinds of
charts<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> square<00:01:03.149> chart<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:04.170> round

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
charts there's a square chart in a round

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.859 
charts there's a square chart in a round
chart<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.420> directions

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
chart this is going to these directions

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
first of all it should say start on the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.240 
first of all it should say start on the
left<00:01:39.990> hand<00:01:40.229> side<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> chart<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.979> find<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
left hand side of the chart and find the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.560 
left hand side of the chart and find the
first<00:01:41.400> base<00:01:41.670> ok<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> move<00:01:42.450> this

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
first base ok I'm going to move this

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.569 
first base ok I'm going to move this
over<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.869> little<00:01:42.899> bit<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> by

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
over a little bit so you can see it by

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
over a little bit so you can see it by
the<00:01:44.640> left<00:01:44.939> hand<00:01:45.149> side<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> chart<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.020> means

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the left hand side of the chart it means

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.700 
the left hand side of the chart it means
these<00:01:47.159> guys<00:01:47.430> over<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.990> okay<00:01:48.990> those<00:01:49.560> are

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
these guys over here okay those are

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.160 
these guys over here okay those are
going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> equate<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:51.180> equal<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
going to equate to or equal to if you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.960 
going to equate to or equal to if you
will<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.860> first<00:01:53.220> letter<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.880> sequence

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
will the first letter of your sequence

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.090 
will the first letter of your sequence
okay<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.080> you<00:01:56.140> start<00:01:56.530> over<00:01:56.710> here<00:01:56.860> on<00:01:57.010> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
okay so you start over here on the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.220 
okay so you start over here on the
left-hand<00:01:57.370> side<00:01:57.580> okay<00:01:58.390> let's<00:01:58.660> say<00:01:58.900> that<00:01:59.110> our

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
left-hand side okay let's say that our

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.720 
left-hand side okay let's say that our
sequence<00:01:59.710> is<00:01:59.920> ua<00:02:00.370> g<00:02:01.740> okay<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:02.800> we<00:02:03.160> find<00:02:03.400> you

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
sequence is ua g okay so we find you

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.420 
sequence is ua g okay so we find you
alright<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:05.080> now<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.710> second<00:02:06.040> one<00:02:06.130> says<00:02:06.280> now

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
alright so now the second one says now

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.040 
alright so now the second one says now
look<00:02:06.610> at<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.820> top<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.150> find<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.510> second<00:02:07.900> base

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
look at the top and find the second base

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.370 
look at the top and find the second base
the<00:02:08.770> second<00:02:09.160> base<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.580> right<00:02:09.820> here<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.380> all

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
the second base is right here a all

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.350 
the second base is right here a all
right<00:02:11.560> then<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.250> third<00:02:12.460> one<00:02:12.520> says<00:02:12.910> look<00:02:13.180> down

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
right then the third one says look down

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.490 
right then the third one says look down
the<00:02:13.480> right-hand<00:02:13.630> side<00:02:13.900> now<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.200> gotta<00:02:14.380> move

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
the right-hand side now I gotta move

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.990 
the right-hand side now I gotta move
this<00:02:14.620> over<00:02:14.770> look<00:02:15.310> down<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.610> right<00:02:15.730> hand<00:02:15.880> side

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
this over look down the right hand side

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.300 
this over look down the right hand side
and<00:02:16.330> find<00:02:16.570> your<00:02:16.750> third<00:02:16.960> one<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:18.280> third

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
and find your third one and the third

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.390 
and find your third one and the third
one<00:02:18.520> is<00:02:18.880> G<00:02:19.240> ok<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.620> somewhere<00:02:22.920> third<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.190> G

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
one is G ok so somewhere third one is G

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.240 
one is G ok so somewhere third one is G
ok<00:02:24.670> let<00:02:24.910> me<00:02:24.940> be<00:02:25.570> more<00:02:25.720> specific<00:02:25.800> see<00:02:26.800> how<00:02:27.010> this

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
ok let me be more specific see how this

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.400 
ok let me be more specific see how this
line<00:02:27.520> is<00:02:27.790> drawn<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.150> across<00:02:28.420> here<00:02:28.630> so

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
line is drawn right across here so

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.330 
line is drawn right across here so
somewhere<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.850> row<00:02:31.600> of<00:02:31.990> you<00:02:32.470> there<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.310> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
somewhere in this row of you there is a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.800 
somewhere in this row of you there is a
jeep<00:02:33.670> because<00:02:34.060> see<00:02:34.209> if<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.420> look<00:02:34.600> there's

other geez down here too well these
aren't<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.400> jeez<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.760> I'm<00:02:36.850> talking<00:02:37.030> about

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
aren't the jeez that I'm talking about

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.780 
aren't the jeez that I'm talking about
somewhere<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.320> this<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.220> row<00:02:39.490> right<00:02:39.760> here

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
somewhere in this in this row right here

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.850 
somewhere in this in this row right here
is<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.330> G<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.959> that's<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.440> G<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.740> you're

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
is a G so that's the G that you're

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.920 
is a G so that's the G that you're
talking<00:02:42.010> about<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:43.000> what<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.240> want<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.720> do

talking about so what I want you to do

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.500 
talking about so what I want you to do
is<00:02:44.230> here's<00:02:44.980> how<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.190> read<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:46.120> take<00:02:46.330> your

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
is here's how you read it you take your

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.230 
is here's how you read it you take your
first<00:02:46.690> one<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.740> find<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.160> row<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:49.030> take

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
first one and you find the row you take

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.420 
first one and you find the row you take
your<00:02:49.270> second<00:02:49.900> one<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.620> find<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.980> column

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
your second one and you find the column

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.940 
your second one and you find the column
so<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.090> only<00:02:52.420> going<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.660> be<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:53.470> column

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
so it's only going to be this column

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.440 
so it's only going to be this column
right<00:02:53.980> here<00:02:54.900> all<00:02:55.900> right<00:02:56.490> ok<00:02:57.490> it's<00:02:58.120> only<00:02:58.270> going

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
right here all right ok it's only going

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.920 
right here all right ok it's only going
to<00:02:58.510> be<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.780> column<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.760> then<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.239> find<00:03:01.570> in

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
to be that column and then you find in

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.759 
to be that column and then you find in
that<00:03:02.970> row<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.959> column<00:03:05.350> where<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:05.620> row

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
that row and that column where that row

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.170 
that row and that column where that row
and<00:03:05.890> column<00:03:06.040> meet<00:03:06.459> it's<00:03:06.700> going<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.910> be<00:03:07.000> right

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and column meet it's going to be right

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.590 
and column meet it's going to be right
here<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:08.350> find<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.040> G<00:03:09.630> ok<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.680> AG<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.600> stop

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
here you find the G ok so you AG is stop

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.290 
here you find the G ok so you AG is stop
codon<00:03:13.959> so<00:03:14.950> what<00:03:15.190> would<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.459> write<00:03:15.610> down<00:03:15.670> for

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
codon so what would you write down for

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.449 
codon so what would you write down for
the<00:03:16.450> for<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.750> amino<00:03:17.170> acid<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:18.010> AG<00:03:18.340> would

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
the for the amino acid that you AG would

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:27.060 
the for the amino acid that you AG would
bring<00:03:18.700> stop<00:03:20.010> ok<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:25.299> let's<00:03:25.810> look<00:03:26.799> at<00:03:26.980> another

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
bring stop ok so let's look at another

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.090 
bring stop ok so let's look at another
base<00:03:28.680> ok<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:30.310> let's<00:03:30.700> say<00:03:31.000> that<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.600> have<00:03:32.100> that

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
base ok so let's say that you have that

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.430 
base ok so let's say that you have that
your<00:03:33.280> code<00:03:33.549> remember<00:03:34.090> this<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.510> mRNA<00:03:35.170> code

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
your code remember this is the mRNA code

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.960 
your code remember this is the mRNA code
that<00:03:36.100> your<00:03:36.280> code<00:03:36.610> is<00:03:37.080> c<00:03:38.280> c8<00:03:39.989> ok<00:03:40.989> CCA<00:03:41.790> find<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
that your code is c c8 ok CCA find the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.090 
that your code is c c8 ok CCA find the
sea<00:03:43.180> on<00:03:43.330> this<00:03:43.510> side<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:44.200> tells<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.860> car

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
sea on this side that tells you the car

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.390 
sea on this side that tells you the car
though<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:46.049> hora<00:03:47.049> yeah<00:03:47.739> horizontal<00:03:48.280> that

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400

what<00:05:18.730> we're<00:05:18.850> looking<00:05:19.120> for<00:05:19.150> ok<00:05:20.110> this<00:05:20.650> is<00:05:20.860> really

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
what we're looking for ok this is really

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.040 
what we're looking for ok this is really
simple<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:22.710> G<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:24.820> then<00:05:25.030> G<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.510> it's<00:05:25.690> whatever

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
simple a G and then G and it's whatever

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.840 
simple a G and then G and it's whatever
that<00:05:26.080> is<00:05:26.200> I<00:05:26.470> know<00:05:26.530> you<00:05:26.650> can't<00:05:26.890> read<00:05:27.040> it<00:05:27.190> and

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
that is I know you can't read it and

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.810 
that is I know you can't read it and
that's<00:05:28.450> fun<00:05:28.690> so<00:05:29.260> just<00:05:30.100> make<00:05:30.370> sure<00:05:30.400> that<00:05:30.580> you

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
that's fun so just make sure that you

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.980 
that's fun so just make sure that you
figure<00:05:31.090> out<00:05:31.120> what<00:05:31.420> it<00:05:31.540> is<00:05:31.660> i<00:05:31.690> think<00:05:31.750> it's

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
figure out what it is i think it's

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.500 
figure out what it is i think it's
argonaut<00:05:32.440> i<00:05:32.470> can't<00:05:32.770> really<00:05:32.860> tell<00:05:33.300> let's<00:05:34.300> say

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
argonaut i can't really tell let's say

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.090 
argonaut i can't really tell let's say
that<00:05:34.750> it's<00:05:35.490> ccc<00:05:36.490> well<00:05:37.150> see<00:05:37.780> in<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.500> C<00:05:38.740> square

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
that it's ccc well see in the C square

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.770 
that it's ccc well see in the C square
see<00:05:39.370> how<00:05:39.490> this<00:05:39.640> is<00:05:39.820> all<00:05:39.940> squared<00:05:40.270> off<00:05:40.390> here<00:05:40.660> and

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
see how this is all squared off here and

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.170 
see how this is all squared off here and
then<00:05:41.530> go<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.040> the<00:05:42.130> sea<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.550> next<00:05:42.790> one<00:05:43.000> and

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
then go to the sea and the next one and

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.440 
then go to the sea and the next one and
then<00:05:43.390> within<00:05:44.200> that<00:05:44.740> see<00:05:45.280> there's<00:05:45.970> another<00:05:46.180> see

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
then within that see there's another see

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.490 
then within that see there's another see
it's<00:05:46.840> proline<00:05:47.520> okay<00:05:48.520> it's<00:05:48.880> really<00:05:49.120> simple<00:05:49.500> so

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
it's proline okay it's really simple so

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.960 
it's proline okay it's really simple so
now<00:05:50.680> what<00:05:50.890> you<00:05:51.010> need<00:05:51.130> to<00:05:51.190> do<00:05:51.430> is<00:05:51.460> you<00:05:51.730> need<00:05:51.760> to
