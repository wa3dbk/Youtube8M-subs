00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
water because cold water does shrink

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.900 
water because cold water does shrink
pores<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.340> often<00:02:21.670> enough

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
pores and if you do that often enough

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.580 
pores and if you do that often enough
you're<00:02:22.660> going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:23.020> your<00:02:23.200> pores<00:02:23.470> are

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590
