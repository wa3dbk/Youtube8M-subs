wouldn't listen

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.860 
wouldn't listen
it's<00:03:42.190> not<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.489> toy<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:44.579> I've<00:03:45.579> crashed<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.180> three

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
it's not a toy and I've crashed it three

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.899 
it's not a toy and I've crashed it three
times<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.680> I've<00:03:47.829> only<00:03:47.980> thrown<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.489> alright

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
times and I've only thrown it alright

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.339 
times and I've only thrown it alright
I've<00:03:49.150> only<00:03:49.299> flown<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.780> three<00:03:50.019> times<00:03:50.230> too<00:03:50.590> so

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
I've only flown it three times too so

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.180 
I've only flown it three times too so
fourth<00:03:53.349> time's<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.680> charm

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
fourth time's the charm

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.289 
fourth time's the charm
so<00:03:55.120> flying<00:03:55.329> this<00:03:55.629> is<00:03:55.900> kind<00:03:56.739> of<00:03:56.829> important<00:03:57.310> if<00:03:58.209> I

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
so flying this is kind of important if I

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.619 
so flying this is kind of important if I
crash<00:03:58.599> this<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:59.549> will<00:04:00.549> not<00:04:00.640> be<00:04:00.700> buying<00:04:01.000> more
