00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:16.660
 rotor review alligator pizza 180 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:20.980
 millimeters used this router 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.690
 somewhere around a year and a half changed it 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.690
 on shimano slx 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.359
 because the rotor did not suit a little 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:36.219
 having big cuts for good 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.769
 cooling nonetheless 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.609
 the rotor has proven itself badly with 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:46.889
 the brakes of the shaman 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:50.649
 I have brakes budget m 465 series 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:54.600
 notes and working with Schwann brake 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.989
 pads and hit for example there is moisture 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.069
 mat rotor 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:04.560
 for a very long time I cleaned it constantly 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:07.030
 whistling buzzed scared people when braking 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:15.400
 now i have shimano slx 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:17.340
 Well, as if the problem has disappeared with 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.440
 other brakes will work well 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.090
 but I only got one 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.550
 negative impressions back at me 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.180
 shimano rotor too 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.420
 they are a shaman alligator pizza 160 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.810
 millimeters and so the same is watching 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.480
 moisture problems 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.500
 the rotor is very hard and normal 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.179
 braking 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.179
 I think to change again on the shaman sex 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.179
 bolts
