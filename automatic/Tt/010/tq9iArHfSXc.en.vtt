00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.430
So, biking is kind of a thing here.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.130
At first it might seem scary to navigate through
all those bikes, but pretty soon you’ll

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.130
be on your way.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.520
It’s a big campus, but riding a bike definitely
makes getting around easier.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.830
Two wheels for the win!

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.450
Or eight wheels.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.330
Your call.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.280
UC Davis is like a museum!

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.140
You can see amazing art, murals, sculptures,
and even hear music all over campus.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.449
Pretty cool.

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.350
Thought chivalry was dead?

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:56.460
Well, think again!

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.940
Prepare to have doors held open for you, “Hey,
how’s it going?” from basically everyone,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.790
and politeness and smiles from other students.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.950
If you love to be outside, then UC Davis is
definitely the place for you.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.740
We’ve got the arboretum on campus, which
is a stretch of redwoods, plant life, and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.780
waterway that’s perfect for taking a walk.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.060
There are trees all over the place, and there’s
plenty of green space for relaxing, studying,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.030
and hanging out, like the quad, right in the
middle of campus!

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.939
Hey, everybody!

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.950
Did you know that by 2020, UC Davis is planning
to have a zero-waste campus!

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.880
That means we’re going to try to stop sending
trash to the landfill, and only produce waste

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.880
that can be recycled, reused, or composted.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.969
Woo hoo!

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.790
Our student farm is amazing.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.490
And we’ve got a biodigester, that eats food
waste and turns it into energy to power the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.840
campus!

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.200
What?!

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.189
And we’re home to West Village, the largest
zero net energy living complex in the entire

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.359
country.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.750
We are all about those solar panels.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:20.660
The UC Davis Coffee House, created by the
Associated Students of UC Davis, is our incredible

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.690
on-campus cafeteria.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.750
A lot of the fruits and veggies we serve even
come from our student farm.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.640
And the food is super good!

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.970
Just look at it!

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.380
And of course, you can always grab a cuppa
joe.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.370
Plus, the CoHo is a huge social hot spot,
great for hanging out with friends, or meeting

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.760
up with a study group.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.100
These little guys are hands down the cutest
members of the university.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.210
You’ll see them everywhere on campus — and
I mean everywhere — eating acorns, doing

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.410
their thing.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.040
But they’re still wild beasts.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.150
Look, but no touchie!
