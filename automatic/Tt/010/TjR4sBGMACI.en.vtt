 flowing waters make a great deal 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.550
 productive different aquatic 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.139
 habitats in brook rivers or in 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.900
 the big streams is the water room 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.970
 permanently in motion 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.259
 moving water offers benefits all the time

 be oxygen or food 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.359
 brought in at the same time undesirable 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.230
 substances dissipated fast flowing waters 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.610
 are usually very clean and clear 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.410
 standing in the gallery of the panta rhei 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.370
 Some organic baked exactly those 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.220
 recreating habitats there are aquariums 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 up to 4,500 liters of content with 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.730
 sophisticated technology even raging 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.470
 Creeks can mimic the aquariums

 judge and aquaristik profi andre 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.300
 baumann has a biotope in the panta rhei 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.940
 for fins suckers from southeast asia 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.280
 dre has set the design of the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.780
 250 liters of aquarium to the condition 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.840
 a fast-flowing body of water 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.420
 ajar different sizes of scree 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.130
 gravel and misjudged the river wood come 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.350
 the natural biotope of the fins 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.299
 suckers right near that fins suckers 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 biotop is part of an ensemble of 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.240
 different biotope aquariums in the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.159
 gallery of the panta rhei as the only one of the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.549
 Three exhibits is one with a strong one 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.469
 flow equipped the used 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.229
 Animals take the replica of Southeast Asia 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.639
 biotope good 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.780
 after a short time they show 

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:35.780
 very natural behavior 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.289
 Next to different fins suckers 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.630
 There are some armor locks in the 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.039
 aquarium the same in Southeast Asia 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.340
 habitats like the fins suckers 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.810
 colonize the stones in the aquarium 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.340
 not yet overgrown and offer the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.709
 Growing up eating a little hard 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.179
 food 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.859
 while some of the space is fast 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.229
 is another name for fins sucker 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:01.679
 stay on the rocks looking for andrea 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.689
 Lining on the top of the wood 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.020
 Wood is occupied by fan shrimps 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.580
 the iata theory aps can with the subjects 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.319
 art in boston at the two front 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.819
 wine pairing feed particles from the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.069
 flow filtering and recycling 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.450
 respectively 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.580
 although the animals are delicate and frail 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:24.689
 Actively they take a place in 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.069
 strong current on the corresponding 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.930
 strong current comes with one 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.620
 pre-production model of the new Heathen sales 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.800
 ecm 42 generated the sharks are sales 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.200
 the flow pumps of the panta rhei 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.060
 the pump turns it small, but it helps 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.000
 requires more than 10,000 liters in the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.950
 hour with minimal energy consumption 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.290
 for a true flow biotope this 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 250 liters can be quite right 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.430
 dimensioned 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.409
 the main problem everyone else in the market 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.739
 located flow pumps was in 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:56.780
 heath bath solved a rectifier worries 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.730
 for laminar flow 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.410
 to understand why this is important 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.260
 Let's see the area hand shrimp 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.120
 on 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.680
 They are looking for the tip of the wood 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.480
 because there is a strong current here 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.590
 the permanent plankton and lining 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.590
 brings in particles 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 with a simple commercial 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.250
 measuring device can be the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.800
 measure the flow velocity 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.760
 at the outlet of the pump it is 90 cm 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.760
 per second 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.300
 a home with 1 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.830
 closer subjects and shrimp are still there 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.830
 50 cm per second 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.860
 where the flow is 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.810
 have fanned out a long time ago and 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.590
 collapsed is the generated small 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.840
 still has a noticeable water flow 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.620
 By the way, the control unit is on 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.269
 40 power set 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.090
 even a greater need for water 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.840
 There is no movement in Hannover 42 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.840
 challenge 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.670
 Visitor of the pantera 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.380
 how can the fins suckers the 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.150
 panzersperren and the area on the way out 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.320
 in a natural flow bilodeau 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.210
 watch the relationship 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.010
 very interesting and the panta rhei head 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.010
 in some even on offspring
