Zeppelin mod test - Part C previous
tests<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.360> have<00:00:09.510> found<00:00:09.920> that<00:00:12.080> when<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.920> vehicle

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
tests I have found that when the vehicle

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.320 
tests I have found that when the vehicle
is<00:00:14.490> connected<00:00:15.089> by<00:00:15.299> anything<00:00:16.130> yet<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.369> minecart

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
is connected by anything yet a minecart

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.310 
is connected by anything yet a minecart
track<00:00:18.480> or<00:00:19.260> even<00:00:20.060> redstone<00:00:21.060> or<00:00:21.390> buttons<00:00:22.050> two

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
track or even redstone or buttons two

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.740 
track or even redstone or buttons two
buttons<00:00:22.740> next<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.250> each<00:00:23.340> other<00:00:23.550> then<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> will

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
buttons next to each other then it will

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.279 
buttons next to each other then it will
grab<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.500> those<00:00:25.619> buttons<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.250> well<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> I've

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
grab on to those buttons as well so I've

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.359 
grab on to those buttons as well so I've
had<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.619> move<00:00:28.800> some<00:00:29.130> things<00:00:29.160> around<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.869> walls

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
had to move some things around the walls

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.520 
had to move some things around the walls
this<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.550> an<00:00:32.700> elevator<00:00:36.410> minecart<00:00:37.410> elevator

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
this is an elevator minecart elevator

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.389 
this is an elevator minecart elevator
first<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.820> must<00:00:39.000> detach<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:40.379> rail<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.370> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
first you must detach that rail so that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.190 
first you must detach that rail so that
it<00:00:41.610> doesn't<00:00:41.940> grab<00:00:42.540> onto<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.200> before<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
it doesn't grab onto the one before it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.279 
it doesn't grab onto the one before it
second<00:00:46.200> let's<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.190> out<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.090> minecart<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
second let's get out of the minecart you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.709 
second let's get out of the minecart you
cannot<00:00:49.559> ride<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> minecart<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.510> use

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
cannot ride in the minecart when you use

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.590 
cannot ride in the minecart when you use
the<00:00:52.559> vehicle<00:00:52.980> otherwise<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:56.600> get

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the vehicle otherwise it will get

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
the vehicle otherwise it will get
confused<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.440> game<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.890> confused<00:00:59.520> on

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
confused the game will get confused on

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.020 
confused the game will get confused on
whether<00:01:00.539> you're<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.960> minecart<00:01:01.500> oh<00:01:04.850> my<00:01:05.850> go

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
whether you're in the minecart oh my go

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:22.190 
whether you're in the minecart oh my go
I<00:01:13.729> must<00:01:14.729> activate<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.540> rail<00:01:21.200> normally

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
I must activate that rail normally

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.350 
I must activate that rail normally
continue<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> whatever<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:23.939> know<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
continue on whatever I don't know how to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.580 
continue on whatever I don't know how to
get<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.750> I'm<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.490> entirely<00:01:26.490> sure<00:01:26.670> how<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> push

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
get it I'm not entirely sure how to push

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.690 
get it I'm not entirely sure how to push
the<00:01:28.590> cars<00:01:33.619> essentially<00:01:34.619> he<00:01:35.220> would<00:01:35.340> push<00:01:35.549> the
