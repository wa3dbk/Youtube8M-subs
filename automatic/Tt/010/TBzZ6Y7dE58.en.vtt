the sides you have 3.5 millimeter
headphone<00:00:42.390> jack<00:00:43.080> for<00:00:43.110> some<00:00:43.650> reason<00:00:44.220> on<00:00:44.400> the

headphone jack for some reason on the

headphone jack for some reason on the
lights<00:00:44.880> on<00:00:45.150> the<00:00:45.270> side<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.810> you've<00:00:45.930> got<00:00:46.050> your

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
lights on the side then you've got your

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
lights on the side then you've got your
volume<00:00:46.260> rocker<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.040> your<00:00:47.430> lock<00:00:47.670> button<00:00:48.000> which

volume rocker and your lock button which

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.220 
volume rocker and your lock button which
does<00:00:48.240> make<00:00:48.390> sense<00:00:48.780> because<00:00:48.900> it<00:00:49.050> doesn't

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
does make sense because it doesn't

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.890 
does make sense because it doesn't
really<00:00:49.320> work<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:51.180> side<00:00:51.450> you've<00:00:51.720> got<00:00:51.750> your

really work on this side you've got your
flashlight<00:00:52.970> which<00:00:53.970> I<00:00:54.270> forget<00:00:54.660> which<00:00:54.720> one<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
flashlight which I forget which one it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.500 
flashlight which I forget which one it
is<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.640> it's<00:00:56.640> pretty<00:00:56.850> bright<00:00:57.060> works

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
is this one it's pretty bright works

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.410 
is this one it's pretty bright works
well<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.440> fine<00:00:58.650> does<00:00:59.310> the<00:00:59.489> job<00:00:59.670> but<00:00:59.970> doesn't

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
well it's fine does the job but doesn't

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.670 
well it's fine does the job but doesn't
really<00:01:00.630> matter<00:01:00.900> because<00:01:01.110> all<00:01:01.230> phones<00:01:01.470> have

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
really matter because all phones have

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
really matter because all phones have
flashlights<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.340> they<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.550> LEDs<00:01:03.030> don't

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
flashlights now they have LEDs don't

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.389 
flashlights now they have LEDs don't
they<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:04.079> is<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> FM<00:01:04.799> radio<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> got

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
they this is for the FM radio but I got

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.920 
they this is for the FM radio but I got
to<00:01:05.489> turn<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.759> phone<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.119> first<00:01:06.540> by<00:01:06.659> pressing

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
to turn the phone on first by pressing

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.480 
to turn the phone on first by pressing
that<00:01:07.049> stupid<00:01:07.439> lock<00:01:07.650> button<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.280> hold

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that stupid lock button you have to hold

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.370 
that stupid lock button you have to hold
it<00:01:08.610> down<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.060> few<00:01:09.120> seconds<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.780> think<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it down for a few seconds I think you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
it down for a few seconds I think you
can<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.680> rid<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.010> setting<00:01:11.400> though<00:01:11.659> on

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
can get rid of that setting though on

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.540 
can get rid of that setting though on
this<00:01:13.050> side<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.590> turn<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> FM<00:01:14.370> radio

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
this side you can turn on the FM radio

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.910 
this side you can turn on the FM radio
from<00:01:15.030> right<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:18.350> don't<00:01:19.350> even<00:01:19.440> know<00:01:19.770> what

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
from right here I don't even know what

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:29.980 
from right here I don't even know what
frequency<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.549> on

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:39.710 

I<00:01:31.270> mean<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.360> sounds<00:01:32.810> okay

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:53.810 

well<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:43.280> guess<00:01:44.280> save<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.700> channel<00:01:52.370> so<00:01:53.370> that's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
well I guess save that channel so that's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.780 
well I guess save that channel so that's
your<00:01:54.180> FM<00:01:54.510> radio<00:01:55.400> so<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.630> user<00:01:57.840> interface<00:01:58.440> is

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
your FM radio so the user interface is

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.420 
your FM radio so the user interface is
obviously<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.880> crappy<00:02:00.270> Java<00:02:00.690> one<00:02:01.050> because<00:02:02.010> it's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
obviously a crappy Java one because it's

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.190 
obviously a crappy Java one because it's
made<00:02:02.880> by<00:02:03.060> tracfone<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.750> that's<00:02:03.870> all<00:02:04.050> they

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
made by tracfone and that's all they

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.690 
made by tracfone and that's all they
have<00:02:04.410> Java<00:02:05.130> phones<00:02:05.580> yay<00:02:06.420> phones<00:02:07.110> from<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
have Java phones yay phones from the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.530 
have Java phones yay phones from the
1990s<00:02:09.410> these<00:02:10.410> buttons<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:11.040> very<00:02:11.700> very<00:02:12.240> very

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.330 
1990s these buttons are very very very
very<00:02:12.720> very<00:02:13.020> flimsy<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.890> when<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.130> press

very very flimsy like when you press
them<00:02:14.550> they<00:02:14.670> move<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.210> sides<00:02:15.510> not<00:02:16.500> very

them they move to the sides not very
well<00:02:17.010> made<00:02:17.220> don't<00:02:17.700> think<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.210> last

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
well made don't think it's going to last

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.830 
well made don't think it's going to last
very<00:02:18.570> long<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.830> screen<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.490> not<00:02:21.270> very<00:02:21.600> very

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
very long the screen is not very very

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.100 
very long the screen is not very very
good<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.530> very<00:02:22.920> low<00:02:23.190> resolution<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.870> very

small and the text is a little hard to
read<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.450> don't<00:02:27.750> think<00:02:28.050> an<00:02:28.980> average<00:02:29.130> person

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
read I don't think an average person

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.790 
read I don't think an average person
would<00:02:29.730> be<00:02:29.820> able<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.350> but<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.560> guess

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
would be able to do it but I guess

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.750 
would be able to do it but I guess
doesn't<00:02:32.100> matter<00:02:32.220> because<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.490> can<00:02:32.610> just

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
doesn't matter because you can just

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.670 
doesn't matter because you can just
enter<00:02:32.910> our<00:02:33.150> phone<00:02:33.330> number<00:02:33.690> with<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> keypad

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
enter our phone number with the keypad

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.970 
enter our phone number with the keypad
yeah<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.470> most<00:02:40.800> basic

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
yeah and this is like the most basic

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.150 
yeah and this is like the most basic
spot<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.730> can<00:02:41.910> have<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.510> do<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.709> FM<00:02:44.010> radio

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
spot you can have I do like the FM radio

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.090 
spot you can have I do like the FM radio
though<00:02:44.930> new<00:02:45.930> phones<00:02:46.230> these<00:02:46.440> days<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.860> those

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
though new phones these days have those

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.400 
though new phones these days have those
anymore<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.300> nice<00:02:48.480> because<00:02:48.810> everything

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
anymore so it's nice because everything

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.120 
anymore so it's nice because everything
has<00:02:49.500> been<00:02:49.590> basically<00:02:49.950> replaced<00:02:50.520> with<00:02:51.020> Pandora

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
has been basically replaced with Pandora

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.440 
has been basically replaced with Pandora
it<00:02:53.130> does<00:02:53.310> come<00:02:53.520> with<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.670> dock<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.209> car

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
it does come with a dock and a car

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.420 
it does come with a dock and a car
charger<00:02:54.720> which<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.170> really<00:02:55.440> like<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:56.280> dock<00:02:56.520> is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
charger which I really like the dock is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.070 
charger which I really like the dock is
proprietary<00:02:59.430> to<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.360> phone<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.840> cannot

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
proprietary to this phone so you cannot

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.140 
proprietary to this phone so you cannot

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
use any other phone with it that means

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.760 
use any other phone with it that means

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
you can't use any other funds like this

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.190 
you can't use any other funds like this
for<00:03:05.430> example<00:03:05.850> like<00:03:05.970> an<00:03:06.270> lg<00:03:06.810> 800<00:03:07.260> G<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:08.550> fits<00:03:09.200> but

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
for example like an lg 800 G it fits but

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.259 
for example like an lg 800 G it fits but
of<00:03:10.320> course<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:10.890> not<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.670> bottom<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:12.150> it

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
of course it's not on the bottom so it

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.020 
of course it's not on the bottom so it
doesn't<00:03:12.540> work<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:14.130> will<00:03:14.370> only<00:03:14.610> work<00:03:14.880> with

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
doesn't work and it will only work with

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.360 
doesn't work and it will only work with
this<00:03:15.209> phone<00:03:15.480> because<00:03:16.320> on<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.920> bottom<00:03:17.040> you

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
this phone because on the bottom you

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.580 
this phone because on the bottom you
have<00:03:17.400> two<00:03:17.820> simple<00:03:18.860> prongs<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.790> go<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.959> to

there<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.160> very<00:03:26.580> simple<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:28.040> don't<00:03:29.040> even

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
there it is very simple I don't even

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.960 
there it is very simple I don't even

LG<00:03:36.360> 800<00:03:36.840> G<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.110> much<00:03:37.350> smaller<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:40.880> LG<00:03:41.880> has

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
LG 800 G is much smaller and the LG has

LG 800 G is much smaller and the LG has
a<00:03:42.150> camera<00:03:42.590> unlike<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.769> Acuto<00:03:44.190> though<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.390> does

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
a camera unlike the Acuto though it does

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.420 
a camera unlike the Acuto though it does
feel<00:03:45.870> better<00:03:46.050> made<00:03:46.320> than<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.650> LG<00:03:46.800> that's<00:03:47.220> for

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
feel better made than the LG that's for

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.220 
feel better made than the LG that's for
sure<00:03:47.610> even<00:03:47.880> though<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.600> buttons<00:03:48.870> are<00:03:48.990> flimsy

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
sure even though the buttons are flimsy

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.590 
sure even though the buttons are flimsy
the<00:03:49.830> LG's<00:03:50.220> are<00:03:50.400> much<00:03:50.580> more<00:03:50.790> flimsy

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
the LG's are much more flimsy

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.020 
the LG's are much more flimsy
and<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.140> LG<00:03:52.500> has<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> stupid<00:03:53.070> little<00:03:53.430> ancient

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
and the LG has a stupid little ancient

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.830 
and the LG has a stupid little ancient
resistant<00:03:54.890> style<00:03:55.890> touchscreen<00:03:56.700> which<00:03:57.450> works

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
resistant style touchscreen which works

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.330 
resistant style touchscreen which works
but<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.800> would<00:03:58.980> recommend<00:03:59.490> getting<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.910> stylus

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
but I would recommend getting a stylus

the<00:04:02.340> speaker<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.150> also<00:04:03.360> not<00:04:03.810> very<00:04:03.840> good<00:04:04.140> on<00:04:04.350> the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
LG on the Alcatel it's much better and I

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.870 
LG on the Alcatel it's much better and I
don't<00:04:07.410> think<00:04:07.740> an<00:04:07.800> elderly<00:04:08.070> person<00:04:08.370> would<00:04:08.670> use

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
don't think an elderly person would use
