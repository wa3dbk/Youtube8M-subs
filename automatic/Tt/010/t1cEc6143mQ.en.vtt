the house from the sims 4 recreated in
the<00:00:03.060> sims<00:00:03.360> 3<00:00:04.040> now<00:00:05.040> they<00:00:05.700> did<00:00:05.970> an<00:00:06.180> amazing<00:00:06.509> job

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
the sims 3 now they did an amazing job

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.470 
the sims 3 now they did an amazing job
for<00:00:07.350> creating<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:07.980> picture<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.330> know

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
for creating this picture and you know

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.820 
for creating this picture and you know
it<00:00:09.750> takes<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.139> lot<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.320> work

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
it takes a lot of work

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.999 
it takes a lot of work
you<00:00:11.309> can<00:00:11.700> now<00:00:12.090> people<00:00:12.809> complain<00:00:13.349> because

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
you can now people complain because

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.180 
you can now people complain because
there's<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.700> bloom<00:00:15.240> effect<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.650> sims<00:00:16.890> 4

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
there's this bloom effect on the sims 4

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.849 
there's this bloom effect on the sims 4
picture<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.940> they<00:00:18.330> say<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.840> oh<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.050> can't<00:00:19.560> see

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
picture and they say that oh I can't see

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.070 
picture and they say that oh I can't see
anything<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> sims<00:00:20.760> 3<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.359> automatically

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
anything the sims 3 is so automatically

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.929 
anything the sims 3 is so automatically
better<00:00:22.609> like<00:00:24.830> I'm<00:00:25.830> escape<00:00:26.279> from<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> finger

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
better like I'm escape from the finger

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.060 
better like I'm escape from the finger
but<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.480> look<00:00:30.779> at<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> sims<00:00:31.439> 4<00:00:31.740> plants

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
but if you look at the sims 4 plants

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.760 
but if you look at the sims 4 plants
they<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:32.610> actually<00:00:33.180> three<00:00:33.390> dimensional<00:00:33.770> they

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
they are actually three dimensional they

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.240 
they are actually three dimensional they
are<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.309> cut<00:00:36.239> outs<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.620> move<00:00:37.890> whenever

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
are not cut outs that that move whenever

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.520 
are not cut outs that that move whenever
you<00:00:38.520> move<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> camera<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.390> rotate<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.410> are

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you move the camera or rotate they are

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.130 
you move the camera or rotate they are
actually<00:00:41.040> three<00:00:41.460> dimensional<00:00:42.030> plants<00:00:42.989> with

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
actually three dimensional plants with

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.069 
actually three dimensional plants with
leaves<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.950> shading<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.809> it's<00:00:45.809> just

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
leaves and shading and it's just

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.529 
leaves and shading and it's just
incredible<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.550> whoa<00:00:47.910> wow<00:00:48.210> now<00:00:48.510> I

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
incredible and it's like whoa wow now I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.270 
incredible and it's like whoa wow now I
can<00:00:48.809> see<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.440> may<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.710> made<00:00:49.950> some

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
can see that they may have made some

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.080 
can see that they may have made some
compromises<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:52.170> graphics<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.340> give<00:00:53.969> us

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
compromises with graphics to give us

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.700 
compromises with graphics to give us
something<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.750> that's<00:00:55.020> gonna<00:00:55.199> take<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
something like this that's gonna take a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.920 
something like this that's gonna take a
little<00:00:55.920> more<00:00:56.100> power<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.730> looks<00:00:57.390> different

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
little more power and looks different

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.709 
little more power and looks different
and<00:00:58.109> looks<00:00:58.440> better<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.430> if<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> look<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and looks better and if you look at the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.510 
and looks better and if you look at the
house<00:01:00.930> people<00:01:01.440> say<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> house<00:01:01.890> looks<00:01:02.219> exactly

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
house people say the house looks exactly

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.049 
house people say the house looks exactly
the<00:01:02.730> same

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the same

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.109 
the same
well<00:01:03.750> look<00:01:04.260> at<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> roof<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
well look at the roof because in the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.530 
well look at the roof because in the
Sims<00:01:06.390> 3<00:01:06.510> roof<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> half<00:01:07.860> wall<00:01:08.540> it's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
Sims 3 roof it's just a half wall it's

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.280 
Sims 3 roof it's just a half wall it's
just<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.990> half<00:01:10.260> wall<00:01:11.600> but<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.710> sims<00:01:14.220> 4

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
just a half wall but it's and in sims 4

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.590 
just a half wall but it's and in sims 4
it's<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.700> quite<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> half<00:01:18.270> wall

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it's it's not it's not quite a half wall

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.649 
it's it's not it's not quite a half wall
it's<00:01:19.110> definitely<00:01:19.740> some<00:01:19.950> sort<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.220> new<00:01:20.400> feature

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
it's definitely some sort of new feature

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.410 
it's definitely some sort of new feature
though<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.460> don't<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.670> my<00:01:23.820> house<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.330> I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
though I don't know my house is so I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.850 
though I don't know my house is so I
don't<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:24.900> called<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.590> that's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
don't know what that's called but that's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.359 
don't know what that's called but that's
um

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
um

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.749 
um
that's<00:01:26.939> three<00:01:27.299> dimensional<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.400> it's<00:01:29.400> like

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that's three dimensional and it's like

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.850 
that's three dimensional and it's like
bridging<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.990> definitely<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> new

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
bridging out and it's definitely a new

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.030 
bridging out and it's definitely a new
feature<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> sims<00:01:36.450> 4<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:37.829> been

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
feature for the sims 4 or that's been

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640 
feature for the sims 4 or that's been
improved<00:01:38.460> upon<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> sims<00:01:39.390> 4<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
improved upon in the sims 4 the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.460 
improved upon in the sims 4 the
Foundation's<00:01:41.549> look<00:01:41.939> nice<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.810> foundations

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
Foundation's look nice the foundations

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.380 
Foundation's look nice the foundations
yes<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.130> zoom<00:01:44.340> into<00:01:44.520> them<00:01:44.790> look

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
yes if you zoom into them look

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.780 
yes if you zoom into them look
three-dimensional<00:01:46.009> they<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.729> have

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
three-dimensional they they they have

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.819 
three-dimensional they they they have
layers<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.049> sims<00:01:49.290> 1

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
layers and the sims 1

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.330 
layers and the sims 1
it's<00:01:50.189> paint<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:51.360> paint<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> cube

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
it's paint it's paint it's a it's a cube

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.910 
it's paint it's paint it's a it's a cube
with<00:01:53.820> paint<00:01:54.180> around<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.299> so

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
with paint around it it's not there so

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.440 
with paint around it it's not there so
that's<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.130> interesting

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that's very interesting

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.810 
that's very interesting
the<00:02:00.750> house<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.469> definitely<00:02:01.619> better<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.340> Sims<00:02:02.549> 4

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the house is definitely better in Sims 4

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.639 
the house is definitely better in Sims 4
and<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.240> tell<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> despite<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.320> bloom

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and I can tell that despite the bloom

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.180 
and I can tell that despite the bloom
effect<00:02:04.890> thank<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.610> very<00:02:05.820> much
