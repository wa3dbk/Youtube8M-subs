Fran<00:00:09.599> will<00:00:09.840> help<00:00:10.080> us<00:00:10.260> learn<00:00:10.500> how<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.800> take

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
Fran will help us learn how to take

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.400 
Fran will help us learn how to take
measurements<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.179> draft<00:00:12.509> our<00:00:12.719> pants<00:00:13.139> block

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
measurements to draft our pants block

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.240 
measurements to draft our pants block
pattern<00:00:14.570> to<00:00:15.570> begin<00:00:15.929> tie<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> ribbon<00:00:16.619> around<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
pattern to begin tie a ribbon around the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.380 
pattern to begin tie a ribbon around the
waistline

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.590 

we<00:00:23.869> make<00:00:24.080> it<00:00:24.260> tight<00:00:24.530> then<00:00:25.400> loosen<00:00:25.790> it<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:26.390> make

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
we make it tight then loosen it to make

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.230 
we make it tight then loosen it to make
sure<00:00:26.630> it<00:00:27.140> fits<00:00:27.410> comfortably

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 

this<00:00:30.960> way<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.410> ribbon<00:00:31.740> will<00:00:31.919> fall<00:00:32.160> exactly<00:00:32.579> on

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this way the ribbon will fall exactly on

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.560 
this way the ribbon will fall exactly on
the<00:00:33.149> waistline

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
straight down to the floor with your

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.699 
straight down to the floor with your
feet<00:02:54.480> together

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.559 

here<00:02:58.709> Fran<00:02:59.159> will<00:02:59.370> move<00:02:59.580> her<00:02:59.790> left<00:03:00.030> foot<00:03:00.269> back

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
here Fran will move her left foot back

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.380 
here Fran will move her left foot back
so<00:03:01.049> we<00:03:01.170> can<00:03:01.349> see<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.769> measurement<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:03.150> leg

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
so we can see the measurement the leg

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.589 
so we can see the measurement the leg
length<00:03:03.629> is<00:03:03.959> 78<00:03:04.650> centimeters

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.180 

next<00:03:09.560> we<00:03:09.709> need<00:03:09.829> to

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
next we need to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.790 
next we need to
