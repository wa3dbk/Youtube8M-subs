00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
that I've created myself or had

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.330 
that I've created myself or had
experience<00:00:14.580> with<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:16.410> essence<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.190> what

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
experience with and the essence of what

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.740 
experience with and the essence of what
I'm<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.640> say<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.449> make<00:00:18.570> them

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
I'm going to say is you can make them

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.500 
I'm going to say is you can make them
yourself<00:00:18.869> very<00:00:19.410> cheaply<00:00:19.859> some<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> very

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
yourself very cheaply some of the very

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.090 
yourself very cheaply some of the very
good<00:00:21.689> ones<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.050> I've<00:00:22.230> seen<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:22.830> rather

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
good ones that I've seen are rather

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.820 
good ones that I've seen are rather
expensive<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.939> rather<00:00:24.230> complicated<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.560> I'm

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
expensive and rather complicated so I'm

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.990 
expensive and rather complicated so I'm
going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> show<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.279> what<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
going to show you what I think is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
going to show you what I think is
perhaps<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.570> cheapest<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> easiest<00:00:28.410> trailer

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
perhaps the cheapest and easiest trailer

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.400 
perhaps the cheapest and easiest trailer
that<00:00:29.099> anyone<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.670> make<00:00:29.730> almost<00:00:30.599> no<00:00:31.019> work<00:00:31.199> at

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that anyone can make almost no work at

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.040 
that anyone can make almost no work at
all<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.910> series<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.300> slides<00:00:33.690> I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
all and it's a series of slides I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.930 
all and it's a series of slides I
haven't<00:00:34.950> got<00:00:35.040> videos<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.550> them<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:35.820> you'll

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
haven't got videos of them but you'll

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.819 
haven't got videos of them but you'll
certainly<00:00:36.149> get<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> ideas<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> there's<00:00:37.649> some

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
certainly get the ideas and there's some

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.220 
certainly get the ideas and there's some
diagrams<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.879> stop<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.660> video<00:00:39.899> at

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
diagrams that you can stop the video at

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.560 
diagrams that you can stop the video at
and<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> look<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.790> those<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.420> how

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and have a look at those and see how

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479 
and have a look at those and see how
it's<00:00:42.750> done<00:00:42.899> there's<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.469> variety<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it's done there's a variety of these and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
it's done there's a variety of these and
the<00:00:44.789> idea<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> make<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.629> about<00:00:45.989> make

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the idea is to make it about make

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.560 
the idea is to make it about make
trailers<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.070> bicycles<00:00:47.760> available<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> anyone

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
trailers on bicycles available to anyone

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110 
trailers on bicycles available to anyone
at<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:49.219> some<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> these<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.550> very<00:00:50.789> strong

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
at all some of these are very strong

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.540 
at all some of these are very strong
they<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.809> carry<00:00:52.079> I've<00:00:52.289> had<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.219> carried

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
they can carry I've had one that carried

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.569 
they can carry I've had one that carried
350<00:00:54.300> kilograms<00:00:54.600> which<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:56.039> stronger<00:00:56.430> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
350 kilograms which is way stronger I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.430 
350 kilograms which is way stronger I
think<00:00:56.879> than<00:00:57.030> mine<00:00:57.300> most<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.109> ones<00:00:58.260> I've

another<00:04:36.490> thing<00:04:36.790> finally<00:04:37.390> make<00:04:38.350> sure<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.650> load

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
another thing finally make sure the load

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.340 
another thing finally make sure the load
is<00:04:39.070> balanced<00:04:39.640> over<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.210> wheel<00:04:40.510> of<00:04:40.840> the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
is balanced over the wheel of the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.800 
is balanced over the wheel of the
trailer<00:04:41.880> where<00:04:42.880> they're<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.270> way<00:04:43.450> to<00:04:43.510> tell

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
trailer where they're the way to tell

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.590 
trailer where they're the way to tell
you've<00:04:43.960> done<00:04:44.140> that<00:04:44.460> load<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.610> up<00:04:45.730> and<00:04:45.910> when<00:04:46.450> you

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
you've done that load it up and when you

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.810 
you've done that load it up and when you
by<00:04:47.050> hand<00:04:47.380> lift<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.890> handle<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.460> trailer

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
by hand lift the handle of the trailer

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.910 
by hand lift the handle of the trailer
up<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.570> should<00:04:49.780> be<00:04:49.900> almost<00:04:50.230> effortless<00:04:50.770> in

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
up it should be almost effortless in

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.830 
up it should be almost effortless in
fact<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.220> ideal<00:04:51.610> is<00:04:51.790> it<00:04:51.910> just<00:04:52.090> balances<00:04:52.270> there

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
fact the ideal is it just balances there

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.440 
fact the ideal is it just balances there
that<00:04:53.440> means<00:04:53.650> it's<00:04:53.830> not<00:04:53.950> going<00:04:54.160> to<00:04:54.250> be<00:04:54.460> bearing

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
that means it's not going to be bearing

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.880 
that means it's not going to be bearing
down<00:04:55.630> on<00:04:55.690> your<00:04:56.080> bike<00:04:56.230> and<00:04:56.260> affecting<00:04:56.800> your

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
down on your bike and affecting your

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.160 
down on your bike and affecting your
balance<00:04:57.190> much<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:58.240> those<00:04:58.420> are<00:04:58.570> some<00:04:58.690> factors

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
balance much so those are some factors

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.810 
balance much so those are some factors
that<00:04:59.380> are<00:04:59.620> re<00:04:59.800> worth<00:05:00.070> considering<00:05:00.730> because

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
that are re worth considering because

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.100 
that are re worth considering because
you're<00:05:01.120> on<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.270> road<00:05:01.540> you've<00:05:01.810> got<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:02.020> keep

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
you're on the road you've got to keep

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.180 
you're on the road you've got to keep
safe<00:05:02.380> all<00:05:02.980> right
