and we're going to start this with check
number<00:02:04.270> 101<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:06.100> next<00:02:06.340> thing<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.520> need<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.670> do

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
number 101 the next thing you need to do

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.820 
number 101 the next thing you need to do
is<00:02:07.000> go<00:02:07.120> over<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.510> micro<00:02:07.870> line<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.560> let's

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
is go over to the micro line and let's

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.870 
is go over to the micro line and let's
just<00:02:09.070> use<00:02:09.190> 1<00:02:09.820> 2<00:02:10.000> 3<00:02:10.240> 4<00:02:10.570> 5<00:02:10.810> 6<00:02:11.050> 7<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.520> micro

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
just use 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 for the micro

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.320 
just use 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 for the micro
line<00:02:14.400> okay<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.580> then<00:02:15.670> for<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.970> account

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
line okay and then for the account

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.030 
line okay and then for the account
number<00:02:16.660> we're<00:02:16.960> just<00:02:17.140> going<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.380> do<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> period

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
number we're just going to do a period

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.410 
number we're just going to do a period
which<00:02:18.190> will<00:02:18.310> give<00:02:18.460> us<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.700> space<00:02:19.090> 1<00:02:19.990> 2<00:02:20.020> 3<00:02:20.380> 4<00:02:20.680> 5<00:02:20.920> 6

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
which will give us a space 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.580 
which will give us a space 1 2 3 4 5 6
the<00:02:22.420> final<00:02:22.600> thing<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.930> need<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.140> check<00:02:23.230> is

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
the final thing you need to check is

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.140 
the final thing you need to check is
over<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:23.950> under<00:02:24.160> miscellaneous<00:02:24.610> if<00:02:25.030> you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
over here under miscellaneous if you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.760 
over here under miscellaneous if you
wanted<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.480> put<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.690> second<00:02:26.200> signature<00:02:26.590> line

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
wanted to put a second signature line

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.950 
wanted to put a second signature line
you<00:02:26.920> can<00:02:27.040> put<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.460> here<00:02:27.730> if<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.690> want<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
you can put that on here if you want to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.660 
you can put that on here if you want to
add<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.110> logo<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.620> your<00:02:29.800> checks<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.520> put

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
add a logo to your checks you can put

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.220 
add a logo to your checks you can put
that<00:02:30.820> on<00:02:30.880> there<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.240> we're<00:02:31.510> going<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.780> hit<00:02:31.870> OK

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
that on there and we're going to hit OK

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.530 
that on there and we're going to hit OK
and<00:02:32.470> now<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.550> see<00:02:33.820> in<00:02:34.090> spot<00:02:34.540> number<00:02:36.270> 42<00:02:37.270> we

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and now you can see in spot number 42 we

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.450 
and now you can see in spot number 42 we
had<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> simple<00:02:38.080> Rock<00:02:38.470> construction<00:02:39.100> checking

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
had a simple Rock construction checking

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.610 
had a simple Rock construction checking
account<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.510> go<00:02:40.540> ahead<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:40.930> hit<00:02:41.020> close<00:02:41.290> on

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
account so go ahead and hit close on

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.180 
account so go ahead and hit close on
that<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.220> go<00:02:42.370> ahead<00:02:42.460> and<00:02:42.640> minimize<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.920> print

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
that and go ahead and minimize the print

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.800 
that and go ahead and minimize the print
loss<00:02:45.370> program<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.120> that's<00:02:46.300> go<00:02:46.450> ahead<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.690> set

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
loss program so that's go ahead and set

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.020 
loss program so that's go ahead and set
up<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.990> check<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.350> print<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:48.490> we're<00:02:48.640> gonna<00:02:48.790> do<00:02:48.940> it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
up a check to print so we're gonna do it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.510 
up a check to print so we're gonna do it
here<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.240> write<00:02:49.420> checks<00:02:49.950> change<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.340> be

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
here to write checks change this to be

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.820 
here to write checks change this to be
printed<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.720> can<00:02:52.870> see<00:02:52.989> that<00:02:53.170> change<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.709> be

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
printed you can see that change it to be

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.790 
printed you can see that change it to be
printed<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.370> we'll<00:02:54.489> make<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.850> date<00:02:55.800> today's
