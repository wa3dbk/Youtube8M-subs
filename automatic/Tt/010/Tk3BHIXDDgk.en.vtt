once<00:00:53.539> kind<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.629> deal<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.629> this

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
once kind of deal so in this in this

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.200 
once kind of deal so in this in this
exact<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> strawberry<00:01:02.609> shake

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
exact one I have the strawberry shake

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
exact one I have the strawberry shake
flavor<00:01:04.820> yeah<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.150> scoop<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.720> 190<00:01:07.409> calories<00:01:07.729> so

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
flavor yeah one scoop is 190 calories so

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.590 
flavor yeah one scoop is 190 calories so
not<00:01:08.909> bad<00:01:10.700> carbs<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:11.820> pretty<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> lower

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
not bad carbs are pretty on the lower

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
not bad carbs are pretty on the lower
end<00:01:12.720> 11<00:01:13.650> grams<00:01:13.950> carbs<00:01:15.619> only<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.830> gram<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
end 11 grams carbs only one gram of

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.640 
end 11 grams carbs only one gram of
sugar<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.729> pretty<00:01:17.909> good<00:01:18.290> big<00:01:19.290> thing<00:01:19.500> is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
sugar so that's pretty good big thing is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
sugar so that's pretty good big thing is
of<00:01:19.830> 55<00:01:20.820> grams<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.270> fiber<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.840> pretty

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
of 55 grams of fiber that's pretty

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.219 
of 55 grams of fiber that's pretty
significant<00:01:23.270> 23<00:01:24.270> grams<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.750> protein<00:01:24.990> per

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
significant 23 grams of protein per

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.859

powder per scoop the one kind of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.569 
powder per scoop the one kind of
downfall<00:01:31.979> i<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:33.740> six<00:01:34.740> grams<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.280> fat<00:01:35.520> per

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
downfall i see is six grams of fat per

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.050 
downfall i see is six grams of fat per
scoop<00:01:36.619> it's<00:01:37.619> kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> lot<00:01:38.189> when<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
scoop it's kind of a lot when you you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.140 
scoop it's kind of a lot when you you
know<00:01:39.090> feed<00:01:39.360> your<00:01:39.509> protein<00:01:40.140> fat<00:01:40.409> ratio
