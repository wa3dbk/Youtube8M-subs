00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.470
 a minimum of layman 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.430

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.950

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.899
 to which kingdom you want so I 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.880
 I 'm just talking about jadson applying 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.369

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.490
 45 days at lazio jadson post 45 I was born here 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.100
 as everyone knows 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.340
 by clicking here clicking here you have 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.020
 coordinates if you click you here there 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.120
 saw if you click here too you 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 here then 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.430
 is it you leave here in these things nothing where 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.970
 boss 45 is born 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.920
 so let's go back where I was 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.210
 so when you click in the center of the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.230
 City 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.480
 in nbc click on the option to carry 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.160
 here to gods sky you are going to come here 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.760
 in this inpc 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.300
 will then choose one of the genes from the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.150
 kingdoms let's rule luck 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.300
 clicking here you already know where good 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.870
 45 is born of them so you can kill 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.360
 the 45 of them are not you in this map 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.610
 Can you walk like one of yours? 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.100
 normal realm only has one 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.430
 You can not use teleportation. 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.410
 You can not tell that you 're in 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.380
 legal map that fails or changes 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.080
 map map is illegal 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.630
 so this is how you are doing 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.640
 wrong but is not and will be the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.770
 same time then you can understand why 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.580
 if you can not do practically 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.890
 nothing that will help you if you hear pi 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.830
 and thinks you're stuck for a bug is not 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.959
 because you're really stuck 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.900
 then you can not 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.410
 transport if you come here and click 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.630
 on here 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.620
 You can not click here in 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.060
 some instance 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.550
 You can not then you do not 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.950
 can you carry you have to walk 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.500
 so when you leave none of the realms 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.230
 re lucky the foggy peak you go 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.600
 out here in this place where I am to 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.040
 you return to your normal realm and power 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.470
 use all teleports all 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.540
 benefits you have is you 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.400
 you can click here on the map 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.070
 here on the map will open this line 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.080
 to itapirense portal aksel of the gods 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.640
 Simple it's just you come here and come back 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.220
 there in the gods sky again 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.550
 You click here He'll walk alone. 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.550
 Until then I'll let it show you 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.130
 Ready, you click here, come back here. 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.200
 you can already use the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.930
 teleport again to notice 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.670
 What practice do you encourage here? 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.040
 can use all the transport that 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.960
 you are already in your kingdom is source 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.670
 So you're already in the kingdom, is it? 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.980
 baby, how are you in heaven? 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.040
 Gods who love year for all the reds 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.720
 but what you can already use your 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.360
 Let's go back and go now. 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.400
 teach her how to invade the center of 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.920
 town we were there is not lucky 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.560
 but that's where the 45 boss was born boss 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.930
 45 you can kill your kingdom killed 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.630
 essays and misty peak christmas 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.400
 then we will proceed here in the center O 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:02.780
 You 're going to be up in the city then. 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.700
 he will get this portal here ready 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.050
 Are you already in the center of the city? 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.700
 So every time you want to go back 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.310
 You'll have to come to this portal here. 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.350
 do not forget the coordinates and then I saw 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.780
 here do not forget and the 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.340
 right coordinates and it has to be everything 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.010
 manual it's no use trying to do 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.260
 automatic transport is not manual 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.960
 to iacc you are already in the center of 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.240
 city here you can walk 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.580
 usually throw wave 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.590
 If you have it there on the map you can 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.610
 kill some players you can 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.640
 others do not 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.940
 I do not know if I need a bug or if it is 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.970
 only a certain amount of level restriction 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.639
 so here is a new O O here where 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.240
 if it does not have to rain on tv 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.810
 is a successful seismology in the nick né channel 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.919
 but it's a colleague of ours here demanding is a 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.740
 great friend 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:06:00.139
 Let's say so, so this is an entry. 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:04.819
 to send in pmn ac with 5-5 but good 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:09.460
 so this is it so here I am already if you 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.460
 You want to come in here? It's the distance. 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.870
 right show right 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.250
 I just do not know if you'll let us do it, let's see. 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.029
 What are you going to let yourself be doing in the 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.080
 general map 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:23.150
 I will enter here in the territory of the beast 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.060
 It's not that I got to do normal, let's go. 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.159
 going out with 14 pounds which is very annoying 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.029
 Ours never give a shit, so let's go 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.990
 go back there 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:34.969
 the map is here only to take or 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.310
 so if you want to see a friend heat 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.379
 that he had yesterday on the map and he killed 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.199
 he then you can go after him 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:45.080
 he wants to stay there give none 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.969
 pats spalla and good so go back 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.919
 then coming back here ready to go there 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:52.120
 map where I was coming back there then 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:52.120
 passed on from the gods, right? 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.350
 I'll be right back, I'll be right back. 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.420
 my normal functions and if you want 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.490
 invading nebulous peak is the same thing 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:14.300
 I just came here to pick cloudy peak 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:16.910
 sky so if you're word is word 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.050
 of jade and will goes from the other kingdoms 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.750
 feel free 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.430
 if you are the ced kingdom is of the sort that 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.800
 will invade the already peak palace 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.230
 nebulous the same and the same thing there 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.750
 it is rich nebulous that invaded the 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.970
 kingdoms is a very simple and well 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.670
 nothing practical a seven- headed bug 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.380
 only that doubt that is well does 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.630
 Growing up here is what you have to do. 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.140
 everything on hand is no use and depends on 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.000
 benefit of vip cloud magic neither in 

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:48.250
 certain it was not so there is a hint of the 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.250
 and until the next tutorials spoke
