and you can start them by seed you can
actually<00:00:56.129> take<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.760> pear<00:00:57.030> seeds<00:00:57.629> from<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.050> pear

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and dry it and start it in the spring it

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.209 
and dry it and start it in the spring it
doesn't<00:01:00.660> always<00:01:00.840> work<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.649> possible

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
root part is covered but the plant part

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.260 
root part is covered but the plant part
in<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> stem<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.890> covered<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
plant them is in the middle of winter or

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.859

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
even late fall or in the early spring

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
even late fall or in the early spring
because<00:01:28.590> they'll<00:01:28.740> start<00:01:28.829> setting<00:01:29.310> roots<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
because they'll start setting roots and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.130 
because they'll start setting roots and
get<00:01:29.939> established<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.020> way

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
get established and then that way

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.660 
get established and then that way
they'll<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.380> ready<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.829> grow<00:01:32.100> when<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> warms

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
they'll be ready to grow when it warms

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.480 
they'll be ready to grow when it warms
up<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.000> spring<00:01:33.680> sometimes<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.860> takes<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
up that spring sometimes it takes you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.010

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
property you might have pear trees that

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
property you might have pear trees that
aren't<00:01:43.560> producing<00:01:43.979> anymore<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:44.909> really

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
aren't producing anymore because really

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
aren't producing anymore because really
after<00:01:45.630> twenty<00:01:45.960> years<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.320> don't<00:01:46.409> produce<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
do about it you can try to trim them

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.039 
do about it you can try to trim them
down<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.939> get<00:01:51.030> them<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.270> grow<00:01:51.390> again<00:01:51.810> but

down and get them to grow again but

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.359 
down and get them to grow again but
really<00:01:52.229> once<00:01:52.560> they've<00:01:52.770> passed<00:01:53.040> their

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
really once they've passed their

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.490 
really once they've passed their
fruiting<00:01:53.790> stage<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.689> can't<00:01:54.990> get<00:01:55.170> any<00:01:55.320> more

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
fruiting stage you can't get any more

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
fruiting stage you can't get any more
fruits<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> pear<00:01:57.899> tree

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
fruits but if you do have a pear tree

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.510 
fruits but if you do have a pear tree
that's<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.710> control<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.369> it's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that's just out of control and it's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.060 
that's just out of control and it's
growing<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> Medusa<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.290> trick<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.770> cut

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
growing like a Medusa the trick is cut

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.429 
growing like a Medusa the trick is cut
it<00:02:02.189> back<00:02:02.399> one<00:02:02.850> third<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.750> height<00:02:03.960> every

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it back one third of the height every

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.560 
it back one third of the height every
year<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> it'll<00:02:05.340> Bush<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.180> grow<00:02:06.360> much

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
year and it'll Bush out and grow much

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.330 
year and it'll Bush out and grow much
better<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.740> really<00:02:08.009> out<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.129> control

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
better so if it's really out of control

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.880 
better so if it's really out of control
cut<00:02:09.090> down<00:02:09.390> one<00:02:09.629> third<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.170> year<00:02:10.440> then<00:02:10.709> one

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
cut down one third one year then one

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.589 
cut down one third one year then one
third<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.370> next<00:02:11.520> year<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.120> way<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.420> can

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
third the next year and that way you can

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.820 
third the next year and that way you can
control<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.260> more

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
control it a little more

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920 
control it a little more
and<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.490> grows<00:02:14.700> -<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.360> doesn't<00:02:15.540> hurt<00:02:15.780> as

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and as it grows - it doesn't hurt as

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.470 
and as it grows - it doesn't hurt as
soon<00:02:16.110> as<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.380> fruits<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.890> finished<00:02:17.250> go<00:02:17.550> in

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
soon as the fruits are finished go in

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.410 
soon as the fruits are finished go in
and<00:02:18.690> prune<00:02:18.990> out<00:02:19.200> all<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.160> wild<00:02:20.640> stems<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and prune out all the wild stems and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.350 
and prune out all the wild stems and
leave<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.690> some<00:02:22.260> base<00:02:22.640> strong<00:02:23.640> stems<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.270> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
leave just some base strong stems in the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.480 
leave just some base strong stems in the
middle<00:02:24.600> at<00:02:24.720> least<00:02:24.900> five<00:02:25.230> three<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.770> five<00:02:26.070> main

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
middle at least five three to five main

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.180 
middle at least five three to five main
branches<00:02:27.030> off<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.210> bottom<00:02:27.690> plant<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.380> that

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
branches off the bottom plant and that

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.000 
branches off the bottom plant and that
way<00:02:29.460> you'll<00:02:30.180> get<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.420> lush<00:02:30.840> plant<00:02:31.320> for<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.770> next

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
way you'll get a lush plant for the next

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.830 
way you'll get a lush plant for the next
year<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.220> lots<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.640> fruit<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.450> make<00:02:33.630> sure

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
year and lots of fruit and make sure

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.420 
year and lots of fruit and make sure
never<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.230> cut<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.500> back<00:02:34.650> more<00:02:34.920> than<00:02:35.040> one<00:02:35.220> third

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
never to cut it back more than one third

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.850 
never to cut it back more than one third
at<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.670> time<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.750> way<00:02:36.960> you'll<00:02:37.380> have<00:02:37.440> lots

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
at a time and that way you'll have lots

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.180 
at a time and that way you'll have lots
of<00:02:38.100> pears<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.670> next<00:02:38.910> year
