calendar so I thought it'd be a good
idea<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:17.010> me<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> video<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.699> one<00:00:17.880> so

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
idea for me to do a video on one so

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.980 
idea for me to do a video on one so
let's<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.660> started<00:00:20.480> taking<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.570> really<00:00:21.840> quick

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
looking at the cooler itself I have to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.280 
looking at the cooler itself I have to
say<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> sexiest<00:01:04.019> large

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290

say I think this is the sexiest large
air<00:01:04.500> CPU<00:01:05.129> cooler<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.729> don't<00:01:06.299> think<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.630> other

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
air CPU cooler I don't think that other

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
air CPU cooler I don't think that other
large<00:01:07.049> air<00:01:07.260> coolers<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> thermal<00:01:08.640> take

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
large air coolers like the thermal take

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.170

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
to contend with it does become very

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.589 
to contend with it does become very

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
difficult to do and I did find it

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.000 
difficult to do and I did find it
literally<00:03:13.959> impossible<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.440> fit<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.709> one<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:14.829> my

Sark propriety - I do think it's the

sexiest large air CPU cooler on the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
market and it is incredibly quiet and

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.950 
market and it is incredibly quiet and
the<00:04:49.000> fact<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.450> can<00:04:49.660> quite<00:04:49.930> happily

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
the fact that it can quite happily

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.470 
the fact that it can quite happily
passively<00:04:50.830> cool<00:04:51.070> a<00:04:51.100> CPU<00:04:51.670> at<00:04:51.820> stock<00:04:52.090> means<00:04:52.360> that

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
passively cool a CPU at stock means that

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.540 
passively cool a CPU at stock means that
if<00:04:52.570> you<00:04:52.720> wanted<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.140> you<00:04:53.770> could<00:04:53.950> lower<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.340> RPM

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
if you wanted to you could lower the RPM

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.280 
if you wanted to you could lower the RPM
at<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:55.000> fans<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.480> still<00:04:55.630> get<00:04:55.810> good<00:04:55.960> sounds

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
at the fans and still get good sounds

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.350 
at the fans and still get good sounds
even<00:04:56.560> when<00:04:56.710> overclocking<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:57.970> do<00:04:58.030> really

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
even when overclocking and I do really

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.970 
even when overclocking and I do really
like<00:04:58.540> these<00:04:58.810> fans<00:04:59.080> they<00:04:59.290> do<00:04:59.380> move<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.650> decent

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
like these fans they do move a decent

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.200 
like these fans they do move a decent
amount<00:05:00.040> of<00:05:00.220> airflow<00:05:00.400> while<00:05:00.820> still<00:05:01.090> being

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
amount of airflow while still being

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.730 
amount of airflow while still being
really<00:05:01.540> quiet<00:05:01.780> so<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.140> do<00:05:02.230> think<00:05:02.530> you'd<00:05:02.650> be

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
really quiet so I do think you'd be

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.010 
really quiet so I do think you'd be
silly<00:05:02.950> to<00:05:03.160> consider<00:05:03.460> replacing<00:05:03.760> them<00:05:04.150> but<00:05:04.960> I

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
silly to consider replacing them but I

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.240 
silly to consider replacing them but I
do<00:05:05.080> think<00:05:05.290> this<00:05:05.440> cooler<00:05:05.680> has<00:05:05.830> one<00:05:06.010> negative

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
do think this cooler has one negative

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.100 
do think this cooler has one negative
point<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.790> that<00:05:06.880> is<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.120> fitting<00:05:07.390> process<00:05:07.510> I

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
point and that is the fitting process I

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.750 
point and that is the fitting process I
don't<00:05:08.470> find<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.860> literally<00:05:09.220> impossible<00:05:09.670> to

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
don't find it literally impossible to

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.250 
don't find it literally impossible to
fit<00:05:09.910> in<00:05:10.000> one<00:05:10.120> of<00:05:10.180> my<00:05:10.270> rigs<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:10.870> you<00:05:10.960> do<00:05:11.080> need<00:05:11.200> to

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
fit in one of my rigs and you do need to

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.870 
fit in one of my rigs and you do need to
be<00:05:11.440> careful<00:05:11.800> if<00:05:11.920> you<00:05:12.040> are<00:05:12.070> considering<00:05:12.700> buying

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
be careful if you are considering buying

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
it's still a little bit fiddly but you

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.400 
it's still a little bit fiddly but you
