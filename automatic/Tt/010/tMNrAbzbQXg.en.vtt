00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
coral coral images of this the what is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
perceived to be as i guard form we have

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.240 
perceived to be as i guard form we have
giratina<00:01:16.619> oh<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.159> has<00:01:17.280> giratina<00:01:17.759> o<00:01:17.939> forms<00:01:18.450> ah

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
that I've come up with awesome but i'll

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.359 
that I've come up with awesome but i'll
give<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:42.479> most<00:01:42.960> possible<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.070> at<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> end

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
give you my most possible one at the end

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.149 
give you my most possible one at the end
this<00:01:45.149> Pokemon<00:01:45.570> could<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> precursor<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:47.130> a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
this Pokemon could be the precursor to a

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.550 
this Pokemon could be the precursor to a
new<00:01:47.340> legendary<00:01:47.820> such<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:48.960> fiona<00:01:49.380> is

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
new legendary such as the way fiona is

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.950 
new legendary such as the way fiona is
to<00:01:49.740> manaphy<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:51.060> Pope<00:01:51.240> one<00:01:51.420> could<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.840> be

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
to manaphy this Pope one could just be

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.310 
to manaphy this Pope one could just be
some<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.770> fairy<00:01:53.520> type<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.509> cannot

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
some kind of a fairy type that cannot

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.880 
some kind of a fairy type that cannot
evolve<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:56.250> its<00:01:56.369> new<00:01:56.549> legendary<00:01:56.880> form<00:01:57.240> but

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
evolve into its new legendary form but

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.090 
evolve into its new legendary form but
can

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
can

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.770 
can
comes<00:02:00.100> from<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.430> legendary<00:02:00.610> type<00:02:01.090> so<00:02:01.390> the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
comes from a legendary type so the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.870 
comes from a legendary type so the
weight<00:02:01.930> manaphy<00:02:02.560> can<00:02:02.800> breed<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.250> be<00:02:03.370> comfy<00:02:03.790> own

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
weight manaphy can breed to be comfy own

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.960 
weight manaphy can breed to be comfy own
I<00:02:04.180> think<00:02:04.870> another<00:02:05.200> legendary<00:02:05.800> can<00:02:06.160> breathe<00:02:06.550> to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
I think another legendary can breathe to

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.560 
I think another legendary can breathe to
make<00:02:07.300> this<00:02:07.510> thing<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.530> then<00:02:08.830> can't<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.940> know

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
make this thing but then can't you know

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.090 
make this thing but then can't you know
actually<00:02:10.840> evolved<00:02:11.260> into<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:11.620> but<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.890> think

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
actually evolved into that but I think

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.440 
actually evolved into that but I think
if<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.490> were<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.730> case<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.150> one<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
if that were the case the one in the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.760 
if that were the case the one in the
movie<00:02:13.510> probably<00:02:13.870> would<00:02:14.110> become<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.620> or

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
movie probably would become that or

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.320 
movie probably would become that or
would<00:02:15.100> go<00:02:15.220> off<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.550> its<00:02:15.700> parent<00:02:15.880> which<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.300> a

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
would go off to its parent which is a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.760 
would go off to its parent which is a
legendary<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:17.410> legendary<00:02:17.890> could<00:02:18.610> be<00:02:18.730> ziege

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
legendary that legendary could be ziege

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.130 
legendary that legendary could be ziege
but<00:02:20.880> more<00:02:21.880> pause<00:02:22.120> believe<00:02:22.480> what<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:22.600> think<00:02:23.050> is

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
but more pause believe what I think is

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.870 
but more pause believe what I think is
going<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.350> happen<00:02:23.380> if<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.890> think<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.430> pokemon

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
going to happen if I think this pokemon

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.120 
going to happen if I think this pokemon
is<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.240> key<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.510> zygarde<00:02:26.170> changing<00:02:26.620> form<00:02:26.890> now

is the key to zygarde changing form now

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.400 
is the key to zygarde changing form now

type<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.550> mom<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.930> key<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.260> zygarde

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
type of mom that is the key to zygarde

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.840 
type of mom that is the key to zygarde
changing<00:03:25.090> forms<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:26.410> think<00:03:27.250> there's<00:03:27.459> going<00:03:27.670> to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
changing forms I think there's going to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.970 
changing forms I think there's going to
be<00:03:27.880> he's<00:03:28.690> gonna<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:29.200> gonna<00:03:29.350> be<00:03:29.590> some<00:03:29.770> kind<00:03:29.950> of

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
be he's gonna it's gonna be some kind of

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.610 
be he's gonna it's gonna be some kind of
a<00:03:30.160> item<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:31.300> this<00:03:31.450> pokemon<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:31.989> gonna<00:03:32.260> rub<00:03:32.500> be

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
a item that this pokemon is gonna rub be

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.100 
a item that this pokemon is gonna rub be
represented<00:03:33.070> by<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.580> game<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.780> is<00:03:34.930> my

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
represented by in the game so this is my

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.350 
represented by in the game so this is my
whole<00:03:35.410> theory<00:03:35.770> this<00:03:36.370> Pokemon<00:03:36.790> needs<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.239> be

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
whole theory this Pokemon needs to be

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.910 
whole theory this Pokemon needs to be
around<00:03:37.600> for<00:03:37.870> as<00:03:37.989> i<00:03:38.080> go<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.290> change<00:03:38.590> form<00:03:38.830> I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
around for as i go to change form I

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.560 
around for as i go to change form I
think<00:03:39.100> zygarde<00:03:39.489> kind<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.790> takes<00:03:40.030> his<00:03:40.239> Pokemon

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
think zygarde kind of takes his Pokemon

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.140 
think zygarde kind of takes his Pokemon
into<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.020> end<00:03:41.170> zone<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:42.190> change<00:03:42.220> its<00:03:42.790> form

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150

game because i think i don't know how
long<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.270> feds<00:04:29.419> e<00:04:29.660> in<00:04:29.870> production<00:04:30.410> form<00:04:30.699> but

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
long the feds e in production form but

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.100 
long the feds e in production form but
if<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:31.940> ask<00:04:32.150> around<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:32.600> internet<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.960> put

if you ask around the internet the put
one<00:04:33.289> games<00:04:33.500> at<00:04:33.620> this<00:04:33.710> point<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:33.979> getting<00:04:34.070> stale

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
one games at this point of getting stale

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.070 
one games at this point of getting stale
so<00:04:35.180> if<00:04:35.449> they<00:04:35.810> are<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:37.789> if<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.240> pokemon<00:04:38.690> is

with<00:05:37.729> x<00:05:37.909> and<00:05:38.060> y<00:05:38.150> form<00:05:38.449> so<00:05:38.900> i<00:05:38.930> think<00:05:39.020> that

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
with x and y form so i think that

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.200 
with x and y form so i think that
because<00:05:39.530> I<00:05:39.620> think<00:05:39.680> now<00:05:40.039> cuz<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.789> first<00:05:41.000> time

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
because I think now cuz the first time

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.510 
because I think now cuz the first time
ever<00:05:41.389> right<00:05:41.599> we<00:05:41.720> have<00:05:41.840> pokemon<00:05:42.169> Z<00:05:42.520> the
