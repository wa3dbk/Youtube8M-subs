more grinding next step you need to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.359 
more grinding next step you need to
return<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.250> Queen<00:01:33.119> cipher<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.960> barkas<00:01:34.680> in

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the tower step 4 you need to go alright

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.399 
the tower step 4 you need to go alright
Marcus<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.060> summon<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> once<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> elder

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
Marcus will summon you once the elder

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.620 
Marcus will summon you once the elder
cipher<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.829> ready<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:45.149> could<00:01:45.329> take<00:01:45.450> anywhere

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
cipher is ready this could take anywhere

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.870 
cipher is ready this could take anywhere
from<00:01:45.899> 24<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.090> 72<00:01:48.200> hours<00:01:49.399> basically<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.759> he's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
from 24 to 72 hours basically what he's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.819 
from 24 to 72 hours basically what he's
doing<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.360> he's<00:01:51.390> taking<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> Queen<00:01:52.290> cipher

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
doing is he's taking the Queen cipher

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.039 
doing is he's taking the Queen cipher
and<00:01:52.979> he's<00:01:53.130> using<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> fix<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.720> elder

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
and he's using it to fix the elder

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.219 
and he's using it to fix the elder
cipher<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> guess<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:57.960> takes

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
cipher and so I guess that just takes

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.459 
cipher and so I guess that just takes
some<00:01:58.439> time<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.130> there<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.460> go<00:01:59.579> more<00:01:59.850> rng<00:02:00.469> step

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
some time so there you go more rng step

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.459 
some time so there you go more rng step
5<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.369> need<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.420> gain<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> thousand<00:02:04.229> points

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
5 you need a to gain a thousand points

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.020 
5 you need a to gain a thousand points
from<00:02:05.340> killing<00:02:06.060> bosses<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.619> arena<00:02:08.030> level

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
from killing bosses in the arena level

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.479 
from killing bosses in the arena level
28<00:02:09.330> bouncers<00:02:09.780> are<00:02:09.899> 75<00:02:10.410> points<00:02:10.800> level<00:02:11.190> 32

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
28 bouncers are 75 points level 32

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.880 
28 bouncers are 75 points level 32
bosses<00:02:12.000> are<00:02:12.180> also<00:02:12.830> 75

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
bosses are also 75

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.440 
bosses are also 75
five<00:02:13.980> points<00:02:14.460> but<00:02:14.730> there's<00:02:14.910> two<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.120> them<00:02:15.240> so

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
five points but there's two of them so

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.620 
five points but there's two of them so
you<00:02:15.540> get<00:02:15.690> 150<00:02:16.590> points<00:02:16.620> from<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.220> level<00:02:18.060> 34
