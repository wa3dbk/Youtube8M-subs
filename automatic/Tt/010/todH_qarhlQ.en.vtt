00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
draw a fall leaf before you begin your

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.870 
draw a fall leaf before you begin your
drawing<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.650> need<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.040> select<00:00:11.429> your<00:00:11.580> subject

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
drawing you need to select your subject

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.169 
drawing you need to select your subject
matter<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.750> I've<00:00:12.900> got<00:00:13.170> several<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.950> them<00:00:14.700> here

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
matter and I've got several of them here

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.240 
matter and I've got several of them here
you<00:00:15.420> want<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.780> pick<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> subject<00:00:16.410> matter<00:00:16.890> that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
you want to pick a subject matter that

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.140 
you want to pick a subject matter that
is<00:00:17.430> interesting<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.590> so<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.890> went<00:00:20.160> outside<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
is interesting and so I went outside and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.029 
is interesting and so I went outside and
I<00:00:21.420> looked<00:00:21.840> at<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> leaves<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.650> ground

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
I looked at the leaves on the ground

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.880 
I looked at the leaves on the ground
there<00:00:23.369> aren't<00:00:23.550> too<00:00:23.730> many<00:00:23.760> yet<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> found

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
there aren't too many yet but I found

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.759 
there aren't too many yet but I found
some<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> felt<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:27.000> might<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:28.109> good

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
some that I felt like might be a good

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.669 
some that I felt like might be a good
example<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.449> need<00:00:30.660> or<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:30.990> you

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
example of what you need or what you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.639 
example of what you need or what you
don't<00:00:31.920> need<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.660> start<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.870> good<00:00:34.079> drawing

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
don't need to start a good drawing

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.780 
don't need to start a good drawing
I<00:00:34.790> found<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.239> leaf<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.340> if<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> look<00:00:38.670> at

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
I found this leaf and if you look at

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
I found this leaf and if you look at
this<00:00:38.879> leaf<00:00:39.149> from<00:00:39.450> all<00:00:39.660> sides<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.440> fairly

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
this leaf from all sides it's fairly

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.950 
this leaf from all sides it's fairly
flat<00:00:41.780> it's<00:00:42.780> green<00:00:43.110> which<00:00:43.770> isn't<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.129> bad<00:00:44.280> thing

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
flat it's green which isn't a bad thing

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.709 
flat it's green which isn't a bad thing
but<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.800> really<00:00:47.219> doesn't<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.120> too<00:00:48.539> much

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
but it really doesn't have too much

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.889 
but it really doesn't have too much
character<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:51.180> thing<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.570> want<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
character and so one thing you want to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
character and so one thing you want to
look<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.739> something<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.399> has<00:00:53.610> character

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
look for is something that has character

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.110 
look for is something that has character
now<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.960> said<00:00:55.379> too<00:00:55.649> much<00:00:55.860> character<00:00:56.250> check

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
now I just said too much character check

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.180 
now I just said too much character check
this<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.520> very<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:00.930> look<00:01:01.859> at

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
this out this is very pretty but look at

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.750 
this out this is very pretty but look at
it<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.940> too<00:01:03.680> wilty<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.949> twofold<00:01:05.250> II

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it it's it's too wilty it's twofold II

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.429 
it it's it's too wilty it's twofold II
it's<00:01:06.000> too<00:01:06.710> much<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:09.119> drawing<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it's too much for a good drawing so you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's too much for a good drawing so you
want<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.189> want<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> eliminate<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:13.010> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
want to you want to eliminate that you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.640 
want to you want to eliminate that you
also<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.090> look<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:16.490> folds<00:01:17.490> creases

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
also want to look for folds creases

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
also want to look for folds creases
flippies<00:01:19.650> anything<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.390> one

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
flippies anything like that this one

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.280 
flippies anything like that this one
would<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.380> fairly<00:01:23.220> good<00:01:23.450> but<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.810> look<00:01:25.080> at

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
would be fairly good but if you look at

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.560 
would be fairly good but if you look at
it<00:01:25.439> from<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:25.799> angles<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.729> may<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.330> little

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it from all angles it may be a little

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.649 
it from all angles it may be a little
bit<00:01:27.780> too<00:01:27.990> complicated<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.579> drawing<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
bit too complicated for a drawing and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.780 
bit too complicated for a drawing and
maybe<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.079> little<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.409> too<00:01:31.740> complicated<00:01:32.250> for

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
maybe a little bit too complicated for

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.660 
maybe a little bit too complicated for
your<00:01:33.390> viewer<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.009> leaf<00:01:35.220> when<00:01:35.520> you're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
your viewer to see the leaf when you're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.370 
your viewer to see the leaf when you're
done<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:37.159> also<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
done I also have this one here which is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.880 
done I also have this one here which is
a<00:01:40.560> pretty<00:01:41.009> color<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.780> again<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.380> kind

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
a pretty color but it's again it's kind

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280 
a pretty color but it's again it's kind
of<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.490> green<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> fact

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
of like the green one in in the fact

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.569 
of like the green one in in the fact
that<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.740> flat<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:49.619> found<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.340> favorite

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that it's flat then I found my favorite

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.870 
that it's flat then I found my favorite
one<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.390> my<00:01:52.290> favorite<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.610> still

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
one and my favorite one you can still

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.770 
one and my favorite one you can still
see<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:55.159> detail<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> leaf<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.570> can

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
see the detail in the leaf but you can

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.940 
see the detail in the leaf but you can
also<00:01:58.020> turn<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.159> from<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.670> sides<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
also turn it from all sides and see the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.300 
also turn it from all sides and see the
nice<00:02:02.210> things<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.659> happening<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
nice things that are happening with the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490 
nice things that are happening with the
underside<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.149> leaf<00:02:06.450> flipping<00:02:07.020> up<00:02:07.229> but

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
underside of the leaf flipping up but

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.490 
underside of the leaf flipping up but
still<00:02:07.829> seeing<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.940> inside<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:10.110> this

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
still seeing the inside so I think this

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.220 
still seeing the inside so I think this
is<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.370> I'm<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.060> try

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
is the one that I'm going to try

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.140 
is the one that I'm going to try
now<00:02:13.440> some<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.040> may<00:02:14.190> say<00:02:14.430> well<00:02:14.610> Linda<00:02:14.970> I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
now some of you may say well Linda I

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.229 
now some of you may say well Linda I
live<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.900> climate<00:02:16.170> where<00:02:16.970> leaves<00:02:17.970> don't

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
live in a climate where leaves don't

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.050 
live in a climate where leaves don't
turn<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.050> they<00:02:19.140> don't<00:02:19.379> fall<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.760> where

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
turn and they don't fall this is where

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.270 
turn and they don't fall this is where
you<00:02:21.180> go<00:02:21.330> outside<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.530> look<00:02:22.560> at<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> trees

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
you go outside and you look at the trees

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.050 
you go outside and you look at the trees
in<00:02:23.550> your<00:02:23.580> yard<00:02:23.760> or<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.690> park<00:02:25.110> or<00:02:25.379> an<00:02:25.950> alley<00:02:26.220> any

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
in your yard or a park or an alley any

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.050 
in your yard or a park or an alley any
place<00:02:27.480> where<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.989> have<00:02:28.230> access<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.069> something

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
place where you have access to something

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.150 
place where you have access to something
that<00:02:30.239> has<00:02:30.630> leaves<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:33.110> trim<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.500> just

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
that has leaves and you trim it you just

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.880 
that has leaves and you trim it you just
trim<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.430> off<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:35.970> tree<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:37.349> trimmed<00:02:37.739> this

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
trim it off your tree and I trimmed this

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.059 
trim it off your tree and I trimmed this
off<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.430> holly<00:02:38.819> bush<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> found<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.380> what

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
off a holly bush that I found and what

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.039 
off a holly bush that I found and what
you<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.150> say<00:02:42.510> well<00:02:42.780> there

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
you do with this is you say well there

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.890 
you do with this is you say well there
are<00:02:43.170> several<00:02:43.530> leaves<00:02:43.980> here<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.330> leaves<00:02:45.599> that

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
are several leaves here the leaves that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.009 
are several leaves here the leaves that
I<00:02:46.080> see<00:02:46.380> aren't<00:02:46.739> particularly<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:48.019> good

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
I see aren't particularly a good

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.089 
I see aren't particularly a good
composition<00:02:49.610> alone<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.720> perhaps<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.590> might<00:02:52.860> try

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
composition alone so perhaps I might try

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.059 
composition alone so perhaps I might try
drawing<00:02:53.720> three<00:02:54.720> or<00:02:54.930> five<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.470> these<00:02:55.680> leaves

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
drawing three or five of these leaves

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.130 
drawing three or five of these leaves
because<00:02:56.670> an<00:02:56.849> odd<00:02:57.000> number<00:02:57.510> makes<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.930> better

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
because an odd number makes a better

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.039 
because an odd number makes a better
composition<00:02:58.650> than<00:02:59.160> an<00:02:59.310> even<00:02:59.700> number<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.269> look

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
composition than an even number and look

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.259 
composition than an even number and look
at<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.590> way

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
at it that way

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.170 
at it that way
so<00:03:03.269> let's<00:03:03.569> get<00:03:03.810> started<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.670> we're<00:03:05.670> ready<00:03:05.910> to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
so let's get started so we're ready to

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.259 
so let's get started so we're ready to
get<00:03:06.360> started<00:03:06.540> drawing<00:03:07.110> I've<00:03:07.500> got<00:03:07.709> my<00:03:07.890> paper

I've got my subject matter and I've got

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.020 
I've got my subject matter and I've got
a<00:03:12.150> black<00:03:12.480> felt-tip<00:03:13.140> pen<00:03:13.610> because<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.640> don't

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
a black felt-tip pen because I don't

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.699 
a black felt-tip pen because I don't
want<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:16.160> get<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.579> wrapped<00:03:18.389> up<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.319> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
want to get so wrapped up in in the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.830 
want to get so wrapped up in in the
drawing<00:03:20.010> itself<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:20.910> feel<00:03:21.269> like<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.630> have

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
drawing itself that I feel like I have

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.620 
drawing itself that I feel like I have
to<00:03:22.109> erase<00:03:22.440> what<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.340> want<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.790> do<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.120> similar<00:03:24.420> to

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
to erase what I want to do is similar to

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.289 
to erase what I want to do is similar to
what<00:03:24.840> we<00:03:25.139> did<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.530> other<00:03:25.709> day<00:03:26.069> I'm<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:27.090> going

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
what we did the other day I'm just going

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.240 
what we did the other day I'm just going
to<00:03:27.359> put<00:03:27.600> my<00:03:27.750> pen<00:03:28.049> down<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.350> I'm<00:03:28.769> going<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:28.980> keep

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
to put my pen down and I'm going to keep

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.379 
to put my pen down and I'm going to keep
it<00:03:29.459> moving<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:31.560> also<00:03:31.799> stop<00:03:32.489> my<00:03:32.790> pen<00:03:33.090> and

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
it moving but I can also stop my pen and

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.900 
it moving but I can also stop my pen and
I<00:03:33.660> can<00:03:33.870> pick<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.230> up<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.829> places<00:03:35.459> where<00:03:35.639> I<00:03:35.700> think

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
I can pick it up in places where I think

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.949 
I can pick it up in places where I think
I<00:03:36.389> need<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.650> put<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.310> some<00:03:38.609> detail<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
I need to put in some detail so the

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.360 
I need to put in some detail so the
first<00:03:40.230> thing<00:03:40.440> I'm<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.799> do<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.160> I'm<00:03:41.340> going

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370

to<00:03:41.549> look<00:03:41.730> at<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.970> leaf<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.600> I'm<00:03:42.690> going<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
to look at the leaf and I'm going to

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.620 
to look at the leaf and I'm going to
find<00:03:43.370> something<00:03:44.370> that's<00:03:44.519> interesting<00:03:45.030> and

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
find something that's interesting and

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.890

I'm<00:03:46.230> going<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.500> pose<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.100> leaf<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.790> then<00:03:48.690> what

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
I'm going to pose the leaf and then what

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.599 
I'm going to pose the leaf and then what
I'm<00:03:49.019> going<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> do<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.709> I'm<00:03:49.889> going<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.100> put<00:03:50.340> my

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
I'm going to do is I'm going to put my

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.129 
I'm going to do is I'm going to put my
pen<00:03:50.910> down<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.889> I'm<00:03:52.889> going<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.400> start<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.329> think

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
pen down and I'm going to start I think

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.339 
pen down and I'm going to start I think
I'm<00:03:55.290> going<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.560> start<00:03:55.829> with<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.160> stem<00:03:56.549> and

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
I'm going to start with this stem and

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.430 
I'm going to start with this stem and
I'm<00:03:58.349> going<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.980> put<00:03:59.340> my<00:03:59.489> pen<00:03:59.730> down<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.989> I'm<00:04:01.230> not

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
I'm going to put my pen down and I'm not

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.360 
I'm going to put my pen down and I'm not
going<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.680> worry<00:04:01.889> too<00:04:02.010> much<00:04:02.250> about<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:07.370> I'm

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
going to worry too much about the I'm

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.430 
going to worry too much about the I'm
not<00:04:08.430> going<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.819> worry<00:04:09.000> about<00:04:09.230> proportion<00:04:10.230> I'm

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
not going to worry about proportion I'm

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.390 
not going to worry about proportion I'm
not<00:04:10.620> going<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.829> worry<00:04:11.040> about<00:04:11.130> anything<00:04:11.870> but

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
not going to worry about anything but

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.469 
not going to worry about anything but
recording<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.549> leaf<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.329> all<00:04:16.289> of<00:04:16.500> its<00:04:16.680> fun

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
recording the leaf and all of its fun

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.710 
recording the leaf and all of its fun
characteristics<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.840> see<00:04:19.320> going<00:04:20.000> on<00:04:21.000> here

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
characteristics that I see going on here

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.770 
characteristics that I see going on here
and<00:04:21.890> so<00:04:22.890> at<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.580> point<00:04:24.000> I'm<00:04:24.300> going<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.539> pick

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
and so at this point I'm going to pick

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.270 
and so at this point I'm going to pick
up<00:04:24.930> my<00:04:25.110> pen<00:04:25.440> again

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
up my pen again
