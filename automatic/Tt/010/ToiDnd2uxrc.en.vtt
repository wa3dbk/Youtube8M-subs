from my last trip to Indonesia and I'm

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.579 
from my last trip to Indonesia and I'm
noticing<00:00:55.699> here<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.179> first<00:00:56.749> thing<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.079> see<00:00:57.440> is

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
noticing here that first thing I see is

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:58.599 
noticing here that first thing I see is
it's<00:00:57.800> kind<00:00:58.039> of<00:00:58.100> dark

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
it's kind of dark

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.579 
it's kind of dark
that<00:00:59.269> often<00:00:59.690> happens<00:01:00.050> since<00:01:00.289> when<00:01:00.469> you're

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
that often happens since when you're

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.500 
that often happens since when you're
underwater<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:01.699> know<00:01:01.760> there's<00:01:01.999> less<00:01:02.239> light

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
underwater you know there's less light

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.930 
underwater you know there's less light
so<00:01:03.199> on<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.100> right-hand<00:01:04.430> side<00:01:04.519> here<00:01:04.670> we're

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
so on the right-hand side here we're

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.870 
so on the right-hand side here we're
going<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.089> be<00:01:05.180> using<00:01:05.480> these<00:01:06.670> adjustments<00:01:07.670> and

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
going to be using these adjustments and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.069 
going to be using these adjustments and
the<00:01:08.090> first<00:01:08.299> one<00:01:08.479> we're<00:01:08.600> going<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:08.780> look<00:01:08.869> at

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
the first one we're going to look at

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.160 
the first one we're going to look at
here<00:01:09.290> is<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.470> smart<00:01:09.829> fix<00:01:10.070> we're<00:01:10.909> going<00:01:11.030> to

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
here is the smart fix we're going to

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.130 
here is the smart fix we're going to
adjust<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.350> amount<00:01:13.329> to<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:14.450> right<00:01:14.689> here<00:01:14.990> and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
adjust the amount to the right here and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.560 
adjust the amount to the right here and
that<00:01:15.890> will<00:01:16.009> bring<00:01:16.189> out<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.149> overall

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
that will bring out the overall

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.660 
that will bring out the overall
brightness<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.259> picture<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:18.799> you<00:01:19.310> can<00:01:19.399> see

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
brightness of the picture so you can see

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.730 
brightness of the picture so you can see
if<00:01:19.729> we<00:01:19.759> can<00:01:19.909> see<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.090> lot<00:01:20.299> more<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:21.290> underwater

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
if we can see a lot more the underwater

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.219 
if we can see a lot more the underwater
scene<00:01:22.100> now<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.549> looks<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.820> lot<00:01:22.939> better<00:01:23.229> so

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
scene now that looks a lot better so

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.300 
scene now that looks a lot better so
that's<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.500> first<00:01:24.710> thing<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:24.950> want<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.159> look

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
that's the first thing you want to look

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.959 
that's the first thing you want to look
at<00:01:25.750> but<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.110> shadows<00:01:27.500> around<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.579> edges<00:01:28.850> here

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
at but the shadows around the edges here

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.760 
at but the shadows around the edges here
you<00:01:29.119> can<00:01:29.240> see<00:01:29.390> are<00:01:29.540> still<00:01:29.780> kind<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.110> dark<00:01:30.439> and

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
you can see are still kind of dark and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.310 
you can see are still kind of dark and
so<00:01:31.579> what<00:01:31.909> we<00:01:32.000> want<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.240> do<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.630> choose<00:01:33.079> this

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
so what we want to do is choose this

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.469 
so what we want to do is choose this
light<00:01:33.649> and<00:01:33.829> shadow<00:01:34.039> setting<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.240> we're<00:01:35.360> going

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
light and shadow setting so we're going

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.050 
light and shadow setting so we're going
to<00:01:35.539> move<00:01:35.689> that<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.140> right<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.380> bit<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.759> you

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
to move that to the right a bit and you

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.850 
to move that to the right a bit and you
can<00:01:38.210> see<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:38.539> it's<00:01:38.659> it's<00:01:39.320> really<00:01:39.619> bringing

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
can see that it's it's really bringing

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.350 
can see that it's it's really bringing
out<00:01:40.130> more<00:01:40.939> detail<00:01:41.950> in<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.939> rest<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:44.299> the

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
picture that was kind of dark before so

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.760

more detail this is already a huge
improvement<00:01:51.680> but<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.820> other<00:01:53.270> thing<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.509> may

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
improvement but the other thing you may

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.529 
improvement but the other thing you may
want<00:01:53.689> to<00:01:54.009> adjust<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.060> color<00:01:56.299> balance

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
want to adjust is the color balance

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.590 
want to adjust is the color balance
because<00:01:57.170> when<00:01:57.380> you're<00:01:57.500> underwater<00:01:58.600> often

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
because when you're underwater often

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.749 
because when you're underwater often
your<00:02:00.170> camera<00:02:00.590> doesn't<00:02:00.770> quite<00:02:01.070> capture<00:02:01.429> the

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
your camera doesn't quite capture the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.340 
your camera doesn't quite capture the
colors<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.149> way<00:02:02.240> they<00:02:02.359> should<00:02:02.420> be<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.200> let's

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
colors the way they should be so let's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.010 
colors the way they should be so let's
go<00:02:03.469> over<00:02:03.560> here<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.039> temperature<00:02:04.549> dial

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
go over here to the temperature dial

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.109 
go over here to the temperature dial
under<00:02:06.020> color<00:02:06.289> and<00:02:07.070> what<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:07.579> want<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.820> do<00:02:07.939> is<00:02:08.000> we

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
under color and what we want to do is we

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.700 
under color and what we want to do is we
want<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.300> slide<00:02:08.570> that<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.020> right<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.530> get<00:02:09.679> a

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
want to slide that to the right to get a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.060 
want to slide that to the right to get a
more<00:02:10.070> warm<00:02:10.399> color<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.560> you'll<00:02:12.560> see<00:02:12.800> here<00:02:13.040> that

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
more warm color and you'll see here that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.370 
more warm color and you'll see here that
the<00:02:13.430> we're<00:02:14.000> getting<00:02:14.240> less<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.900> blue<00:02:15.140> we're

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
the we're getting less of the blue we're

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.740 
the we're getting less of the blue we're
getting<00:02:15.590> more<00:02:15.740> of<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:15.980> reds<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
getting more of the reds and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.680 
getting more of the reds and
oranges<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.440> it's<00:02:18.400> looking<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.820> lot<00:02:19.000> better<00:02:19.360> a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
oranges and it's looking a lot better a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.450 
oranges and it's looking a lot better a
lot<00:02:20.140> more<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.740> what<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:20.980> looked<00:02:21.160> when<00:02:21.310> we

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
lot more like what it looked when we

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.200 
lot more like what it looked when we
were<00:02:21.520> down<00:02:21.760> there<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.400> that's<00:02:24.610> that's<00:02:24.910> looking

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
were down there so that's that's looking

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.670 
were down there so that's that's looking
a<00:02:25.270> lot<00:02:25.330> better<00:02:25.390> now<00:02:25.810> another<00:02:26.230> thing<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.560> may

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
a lot better now another thing you may

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.790 
a lot better now another thing you may
want<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.980> look<00:02:27.130> at<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:28.090> saturation<00:02:28.570> slider

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
want to look at is the saturation slider

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.170 
want to look at is the saturation slider
right<00:02:29.800> here<00:02:29.860> we<00:02:30.250> can<00:02:30.430> move<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.000> right

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
right here we can move that to the right

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.670 
right here we can move that to the right
and<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:32.500> will<00:02:32.680> give<00:02:32.920> just<00:02:33.250> brighter<00:02:34.000> colors

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
and that will give just brighter colors

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.920 
and that will give just brighter colors
often<00:02:35.680> that's<00:02:36.040> really<00:02:36.640> helpful<00:02:36.970> because<00:02:37.090> when

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
often that's really helpful because when

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.420 
often that's really helpful because when
you're<00:02:38.050> underwater<00:02:38.320> your<00:02:38.920> camera<00:02:39.250> doesn't

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
you're underwater your camera doesn't

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.600 
you're underwater your camera doesn't
capture<00:02:39.670> all<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.090> colors<00:02:40.330> very<00:02:40.570> well<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.610> a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
capture all the colors very well and a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.790 
capture all the colors very well and a
final<00:02:43.090> setting<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:43.990> may<00:02:44.110> want<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.440> play

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
final setting that you may want to play

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.220 
final setting that you may want to play
with<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.459> sharpen<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.720> bottom<00:02:46.990> here

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
with is the sharpen on the bottom here

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.620 
with is the sharpen on the bottom here
and<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:48.700> go<00:02:48.820> ahead<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.060> move<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.420> the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
and just go ahead and move that to the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.840 
and just go ahead and move that to the
right<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.840> bit<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.320> you'll<00:02:50.890> see<00:02:50.950> more<00:02:51.400> detail

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
right a bit and you'll see more detail

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
right a bit and you'll see more detail
in<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.660> coral<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.320> in<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.530> fish<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:55.810> a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
in the coral and in the fish and just a

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.710 
in the coral and in the fish and just a
much<00:02:56.020> better<00:02:56.200> picture<00:02:56.440> overall<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:58.570> with

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
much better picture overall so just with

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.340 
much better picture overall so just with
some<00:02:59.110> very<00:02:59.860> quick<00:03:00.250> simple<00:03:01.239> adjustments<00:03:01.840> you

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
some very quick simple adjustments you

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.810 
some very quick simple adjustments you
can<00:03:02.380> make<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.860> picture<00:03:03.100> that<00:03:03.400> looks<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.610> lot

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
can make a picture that looks a lot

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.510 
can make a picture that looks a lot
better<00:03:04.090> than<00:03:04.800> how<00:03:05.800> you<00:03:05.860> first<00:03:06.070> captured<00:03:06.280> it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
better than how you first captured it

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.550 
better than how you first captured it
and<00:03:06.850> we'll<00:03:07.480> be<00:03:07.600> doing<00:03:07.840> more<00:03:07.959> tutorials<00:03:08.500> like

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
this with other programs a little bit

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.199 
this with other programs a little bit
