00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.320 
stretch it open and squeeze it in the
entryway<00:02:19.099> is<00:02:20.840> really<00:02:21.840> small<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.680> inside<00:02:23.519> it's

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
entryway is really small but inside it's

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.030 
entryway is really small but inside it's
actually<00:02:24.569> really<00:02:24.750> big<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:25.379> if<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.709> get<00:02:25.860> it

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
actually really big so if you can get it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.820 
actually really big so if you can get it
inside<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.180> hole<00:02:27.590> yeah

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
inside the hole yeah

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.309 
inside the hole yeah
then<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.099> big<00:02:29.280> enough<00:02:29.370> inside<00:02:29.879> there<00:02:30.450> see<00:02:31.170> it

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
then it's big enough inside there see it

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.369 
then it's big enough inside there see it
drops<00:02:31.620> all<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.830> way<00:02:31.980> down<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.340> there<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:33.379> then

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
drops all the way down to there and then

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.710 
drops all the way down to there and then
again<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.950> obviously<00:02:35.489> hard<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.510> out<00:02:36.599> and

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
again it's obviously hard to get out and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.000 
again it's obviously hard to get out and
I<00:02:36.750> don't<00:02:36.810> feel<00:02:36.989> like<00:02:37.049> doing<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.379> right<00:02:37.650> now

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
I don't feel like doing that right now

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.119 
I don't feel like doing that right now

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
um right there let me try sticking my 3d

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.180 
um right there let me try sticking my 3d
s<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.739> think<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.489> fits<00:03:08.609> real<00:03:08.879> well<00:03:13.190> slide

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
s in it I think it fits real well slide

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.400 
s in it I think it fits real well slide
it<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:16.040> there<00:03:17.040> fits<00:03:17.970> well<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.450> then<00:03:19.169> this<00:03:19.349> is

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
it in there fits well and then this is

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.009 
it in there fits well and then this is
where<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:20.069> gets<00:03:20.430> his<00:03:20.730> name<00:03:21.120> from<00:03:21.180> actually

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019
