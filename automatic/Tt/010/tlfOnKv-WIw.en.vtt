00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
 Hello everyone, TODD: Oh, hi there. 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.640
 Glad you can join me Glad you could join me. 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.520
 You saw my sideline is an indie game developer You caught me moonlighting at my other gig as an indie game developer. 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.460
 I am making some changes for the next version of my game. My friend Gus as a beta test user gave me some feedback I am putting a few touches on the next update of my game, and my friend Gus is here to give me Some feedback for our beta testers. 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.055
 So what good news does Gus have, So, Gus, what's the good news? 

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:18.720
 Todd We added this Uber Leet GUS: Hey, Todd, so this new Uber Leet! 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.400
 The achievement of the game is too simple to achieve that we added, it's way too easy. 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.030
 Really? TODD: Really? 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.238
 Yes, I can win this achievement in 5 minutes. Yeah, I was able to get it in like five minutes. 

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:25.850
 Ok, let me fix this problem TODD: Oh, well, let me fix that here. 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.495
 Modify some code, A little coding, and done. 

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.630
 Can you try to win this achievement again? All right, can you try earning it again? 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.810
 I already have this achievement so I can't regain it GUS: Well, I already have the achievement, so I can't earn it again. 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.351
 Can you reset this achievement for me? Can you, like, reset it for me? 

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:36.850
 What TODD: What? 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.930
 Reset an achievement Reset an achievement? 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.450
 What is my wizard? What am I, some sort of wizard? 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.754
 What is your next feedback What's next on your list? 

00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:42.920
 Do you know this new score leaderboard GUS: Well, you know this new high score leaderboard? 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.380
 Know ok TODD: Yeah. 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.460
 Your beta version of the test user responded that there is a bug. The current score is twice that of the previous GUS: Your beta testers are saying that there's a bug report saying that the scores are now double what they should be. 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.080
 Ok, I can fix this problem TODD: Oh, well, I can fix that. 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.636
 Remove twice the amount of Let's remove the times two, and done. 

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:57.010
 Now let them try All right again, ask them to try again. 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.600
 They have already created these high scores on the leaderboard. Your above fixes will destroy these high scores GUS: Well, they already have these super-high scores on the leaderboard, so it's going to stay broken. 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 Can you remove their scores? Can you remove their scores? 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.690
 What TODD: What? 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.920
 Reset a leaderboard Reset a leaderboard? 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.840
 Again, I am not a wizard, not a wizard. 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 Any other feedback? Is there anything else? 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.980
 There are some cheaters who have found a way to reach the top of the fastest time leaderboard. 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.231
 Can we remove these people from the leaderboards? Can we remove them? 

00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:12.730
 What TODD: What? 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.190
 Remove players from the leaderboard from Remove players from a leaderboard? 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.482
 Ok, let me emphasize that I am not a wizard OK, seriously, I am not a wizard. 

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:18.190
 Speaking of where our wizards went Speaking of, what happened to our wizard? 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.010
 Have we not had a wizard before? Didn't we used to have one on staff? 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.512
 Yes, he left a crystal ball GUS: Yeah, he left a palantir. 

00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:23.053
 wizard! TODD: Wizard! 

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:33.680
 Well, for those of you who have no wizards, I recommend a great management application interface designed for Google Play game services, for those of you who don't have a wizard on staff, we have the next best thing Available-- the management APIs for Google Play game services. 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.405
 The management interface is a set of rest calls that do things that an ordinary player can't do. 

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:44.930
 If you look at these APIs now, I bet 90% of you will use these APIs to reset the data during the test phase. Now if you were to take a look at them, I'd say 90% fall under the "help you reset Stuff during testing" category. 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.760
 So if you want to earn an achievement for a tester or clear it so that they can earn it again, you if you want to earn an achievement for a tester or clear it so you can earn an achievement for a tester or clear it so you can earn an achievement for a test user Can do that. 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.800
 If you want to remove all scores from the leaderboard your testing, you can do that, too. 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.240
 If you upgraded the data format such as turn-based and you need to clear all the old game data, you can do it if you've upgraded, say, your turn-based data format and need to kind of clear out all those old games Well you can do that as well. 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.790
 The only exception is that the remaining 10% of the one exception to all this is this last 10% here. 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.509
 Perhaps this is the most important 10% because it involves a very important task dealing with cheaters and maybe it's the most important 10%, because it takes care of a very important task, dealing with cheaters. 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.554
 Yes, ignoring your hard work, the cheaters will find their way to the tops of your leaderboards. 

00:02:13.554 --> 00:02:15.470
 Look at this guy who has a false face, I mean, look at this guy with his smarmy face. 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.750
 Don't you hate him? Don't you just hate him? 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.790
 Anyway, I hate him I know I do. 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.155
 But you only need to call some APIs. You can never see him with this face. You can make sure you never have to see his cheating face ever again. 

00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:30.587
 The Management API has a way to hide the cheater. This method basically blocks the scores of the cheater on all public leaderboards. The management APIs have a hide call, that basically will block any scores from this user from any of your public leaderboards. 

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:34.190
 Note that this is a lot more effective than just removing a single score. 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.550
 If you remove a score, the player who cheats can make a comeback within 15 minutes. If you were moved a score, this cheating player could go ahead and add something back 15 minutes later. 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.060
 God, he’s like he’s a cockroach or something, just keeps coming back. 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.520
 But you only need to call the hidden method. You can block this player and all the scores he releases later. This is great with all the scores they submit in the future, which is pretty Nice. 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.370
 But if you use the wrong, these Management APIs will hide the risk, such as a player can inadvertently clear the score data, Now in the wrong hands, these management APIs can be dangerous, or at the very least a player could erase a whole bunch of scores they Didn't mean to. 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.140
 So you will notice that we have some restrictions on these APIs. So you'll notice we have a few restrictions on these APIs. 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.754
 First of all, only the users in your test user list can call these API First, only the people in your testers list can call these APIs. 

00:03:05.754 --> 00:03:16.980
 Now you may think that these numbers are small but if you have alpha or beta test users and give them test access to the game service here you may have more test users than you started to imagine. Now you might think that's a small number of people, but remember that if you have alpha or beta testers, and you've given them testing access to game services here, this might be a lot more testers then you original thought. 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.210
 The second management API can only be used by test accounts or unpublished game service resources. The management APIs can only be used on tester accounts or on game service resources that are still in an unpublished state. 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.170
 So if you want to clear the entire leaderboard, as long as the leaderboard hasn't been released yet, do it, you want to erase an entire leaderboard, go ahead and do that, as long as it is a draft leaderboard. 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.590
 If you want to remove all achievements from a player, you can do that, but only for a test player. If you want to remove all the achievements of a player, you can only remove it from a player, you can do that, but only for a test player. 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.610
 If you want to remove published achievements for a normal player, well, sorry, if you want to remove an ordinary player’s already published achievements. 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.930
 You can't do this. You can't do. 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:50.000
 But remember that if you choose an alpha or beta group here as a test user you may affect more users than you expected. But remember, if you've got alpha or beta group selected as testers here, you may have the power To affect more people than you realize. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.100
 In addition, the only exception to the above is the API related to cheating. The exception to all of this is those cheater APIs. 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:05.590
 These APIs can be applied to non-test accounts because people who have cheaters are like two-footed animals that can think like humans. These will work on non-tester accounts, because cheaters are basically their own category of Person-- really person is too generous, more like kind of a bipedal creature capable of basic human-like thought or something. 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.100
 In short, the third point we don't have support for the client library Anyway, third, we don't have a lot of client library support. 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.370
 On the one hand, sometimes you want to be able to clear all the achievements directly in the game, it seems like there might be times you want a convenient, erase all my achievements option directly in your game. 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.632
 But once one or two test users find this button they will become very angry. But all we need is one or two beta testers to accidentally find this button, and you've got some really angry players on your hands. 

00:04:22.632 --> 00:04:24.840
 So there is no client library. How do you do this? So how do you do this stuff without a client library? 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:34.190
 Generally speaking, you only need to send a REST request directly. For example, you can send a Well from a Web App that you know and only have access to it in the test group. Generally speaking, you're going to make raw Rest calls directly, probably from a web app that you've built yourself that only a few people on your test team know about and have access to. 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.320
 But wait a minute, you will say But wait, you say. 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.520
 I am a mobile game developer I'm a mobile game developer. 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.104
 I only care about path finding algorithm collision detection and vertex culling. I'm all about, like, path-finding algorithms and collision detection and vertex culling. 

00:04:41.104 --> 00:04:44.500
 I don't have time to learn the knowledge of the server, such as sending a REST request. I don't have time to learn about server issues like making rest calls. 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.060
 Ok, everyone don't have to worry about Well, don't worry, my pretty little polygon pusher. 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.540
 We have already made a Web App. You can download it using We have a ready-made web app that you can download and use. 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.650
 With just a few steps you can set up and reset the achievements with And a couple of configuration steps, you can set it up to reset achievements. 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.480
 You can reset the game progress You can reset quest progress. 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.460
 You can also delete a turn-based game or clear the test leaderboard to hide some cheaters. You could delete a turn-based game, or you could clear out a test leaderboard and hide some cheaters. 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.150
 The Management API can do a lot of things now. We will add more features in the future. There is a lot more that these management APIs can do, and we'll be adding more capabilities in the future. 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.549
 I suggest you check out the full documentation video, I encourage you to check out the full documentation, which we will link to at the end of this video. 

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:11.590
 Oh, this reminds me of Oh, hey, that reminds me. 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.040
 I should go back to the studio and see what happened. I should probably go back to the studio and check in on things. 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.710
 Ok, Gus All right, Gus. 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.850
 I have reset your achievements so you can regain it. I have reset your achievement so you can earn it again. 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.460
 I also cleared out the bug list and I removed the out of the buggy leaderboard, and I have removed those cheaters so we never have to see their cheating faces ever again. 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.755
 How is the feedback now How's feedback now? 

00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:27.696
 Still very bad GUS: Yeah, it's still pretty terrible. 

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:29.070
 People don't like the updated version of People aren't digging the update. 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.850
 Really? TODD: Really? 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.660
 Is it because of the new boss level? Is it the new boss fight? 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.880
 Is it too difficult? Is it too hard? 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.540
 Not GUS: No. 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.623
 Is it because of the epic loot? TODD: Is it the epic loot? 

00:05:34.623 --> 00:05:35.770
 Is it because it is not enough epic? Is it not epic enough? 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.600
 Not GUS: Nope. 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.580
 Is it because you need to hit the koala's reward level? TODD: Is it-- it's not the new bonus level where you have to punch a koala, is it? 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.760
 Yes, GUS: Yeah. 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.670
 A group of mediocrity TODD: Philistines. 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.725
 They don't understand art at all just don't understand art. 

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:50.084
 They didn't even understand that the koala was a metaphor for cruel review. Do they even get that the koala was a metaphor for oppressive censorship? 

00:05:50.084 --> 00:05:52.500
 You should choose a well-understood metaphor GUS: You should have picked a metaphor that is less fuzzy.
