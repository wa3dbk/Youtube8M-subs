00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.150
 Yes It is this to introduce this time 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.120
 This book 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.760
 It will not be a work light 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:16.930
 Because I said this not to say the joint to the current 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:22.000
 In we have with it is here magnet in it also equipped with a hook 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:28.029
 This is a very useful point so I would like to demonstrate a little bit more 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.630
 Yes, compared Masuno try it than general flashlight little of rumor compared to up here. Well reference 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.929
 I would like 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.929
 Yes 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.400
 A little bit lighter out the original I will help you to do so 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.400
 I want to try to illuminate 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.820
 Here it is 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.820
 came a top little car 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.239
 This is from 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:06.140
 I thought this was a general juice but it is a work light 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.990
 I think that you can see that it can be irradiated more widely than that general one 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.799
 Yes 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.799
 It was done 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.450
 Next time , I would like to come to the car for a while. 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.250
 Only in my heart 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.870
 I will short once This is only work light 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.000
 There is about this brightness 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.690
 about 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.470
 Because it is a magnet 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.470
 Struck with this kind of form 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.650
 It is correct because this has been put 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.590
 In your favorite angle and ticking 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.110
 You can adjust the height freely 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:54.030
 Resulting in about everywhere thought this went It is convenient Well this 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.620
 When the hate of the hook that Well here there is also one place without having but sticks, etc. bonnet 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.770
 I went and I think you set sheets 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.429
 You have me in the same country 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.860
 Irradiate the light in a strange way and say empty 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:11.360
 This is the most convenient point though, though the brightness is also so 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:15.650
 It is Well where I mean got stuck in various places in the culture a little this favorite angle 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.290
 Because there is no jet of the best merit of this work light 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.590
 think 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.590
 The brightness is only this, but it is dark 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:35.780
 Then I would like to end It is a work written in in more than 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.260
 Thank you very much 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.260
 Ah ah ah ah
