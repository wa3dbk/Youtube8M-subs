00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.730 

so<00:00:17.179> in<00:00:17.269> traditional<00:00:17.420> composting<00:00:18.289> you<00:00:18.560> usually

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
so in traditional composting you usually

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.159 
so in traditional composting you usually
have<00:00:19.070> to<00:00:19.220> wait<00:00:19.400> for<00:00:19.810> temperatures<00:00:20.810> to<00:00:21.019> rise

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
have to wait for temperatures to rise

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.630 
have to wait for temperatures to rise
because<00:00:21.680> that's<00:00:21.919> just<00:00:23.919> like<00:00:24.919> nitrogen<00:00:25.250> starts

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
because that's just like nitrogen starts

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.069 
because that's just like nitrogen starts
to<00:00:25.730> break<00:00:25.910> down<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:26.329> temperatures<00:00:26.899> get

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
to break down and temperatures get

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.810 
to break down and temperatures get
really<00:00:27.320> high<00:00:27.500> in<00:00:27.769> traditional<00:00:28.189> composting

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
really high in traditional composting

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.759 
really high in traditional composting
because<00:00:29.509> of<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.750> worms<00:00:29.960> because<00:00:30.470> of<00:00:30.710> the

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
because of the worms because of the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.920 
because of the worms because of the
aeration<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:31.550> just<00:00:32.269> the<00:00:32.509> way<00:00:32.629> that<00:00:32.780> they

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
aeration and just the way that they

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.770 
aeration and just the way that they
cultivate<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.470> soil<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.670> temperatures<00:00:35.089> stay

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
cultivate the soil the temperatures stay

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.710 
cultivate the soil the temperatures stay
relatively<00:00:36.230> low<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.670> that<00:00:37.879> allows<00:00:38.390> for

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
relatively low and so that allows for

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.600 
relatively low and so that allows for
back<00:00:38.870> more<00:00:39.230> bacteria<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:39.829> stay<00:00:40.010> alive<00:00:40.250> in<00:00:40.489> it

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
back more bacteria to stay alive in it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.040 
back more bacteria to stay alive in it
because<00:00:40.940> they<00:00:41.089> don't<00:00:41.269> really<00:00:41.390> like<00:00:41.629> high<00:00:41.870> high

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
because they don't really like high high

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.860 
because they don't really like high high
temperatures<00:00:43.000> which<00:00:44.000> again<00:00:44.300> allows<00:00:44.600> for<00:00:44.809> the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
temperatures which again allows for the

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.819 
temperatures which again allows for the
process<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.290> be<00:00:45.440> faster

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.770 

basically<00:00:51.829> all<00:00:51.950> you<00:00:52.070> need<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.700> healthy<00:00:53.540> worms

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
basically all you need is healthy worms

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.900 
basically all you need is healthy worms
and<00:00:54.110> food<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:54.890> give<00:00:55.040> them<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.520> what<00:00:55.790> we're

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
and food to give them and what we're

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.530 
and food to give them and what we're
using<00:00:56.090> for<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.480> food<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:58.239> lot<00:00:59.239> e-waste

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
using for the food is lot e-waste

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.460 
using for the food is lot e-waste
because<00:01:00.170> body<00:01:00.920> produces<00:01:01.550> about<00:01:02.210> 200<00:01:03.050> pounds<00:01:03.170> a

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
because body produces about 200 pounds a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.840 
because body produces about 200 pounds a
week<00:01:03.680> of<00:01:03.920> food<00:01:04.850> waste<00:01:05.089> which<00:01:05.900> is<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.080> lot<00:01:06.320> and

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
week of food waste which is a lot and

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.370 
week of food waste which is a lot and
the<00:01:07.850> college<00:01:08.210> has<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.510> pay<00:01:08.630> for<00:01:08.869> that<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.290> get

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
the college has to pay for that to get

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.950 
the college has to pay for that to get
rid<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.800> so<00:01:10.060> what<00:01:11.060> we're<00:01:11.210> trying<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.509> do<00:01:11.690> is

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
rid of it so what we're trying to do is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.330 
rid of it so what we're trying to do is
we're<00:01:12.229> trying<00:01:12.259> to<00:01:12.500> see<00:01:12.650> if<00:01:12.770> we<00:01:12.860> can<00:01:13.009> use<00:01:13.160> worms

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
we're trying to see if we can use worms

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.300 
we're trying to see if we can use worms
to<00:01:13.700> eat<00:01:13.729> that<00:01:14.090> weighs

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 

I'm<00:01:21.240> aquaponics<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> type<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
I'm aquaponics is the type of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.200 
I'm aquaponics is the type of
hydroponics<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.610> growing<00:01:23.909> plants

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
hydroponics which is growing plants

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.730 
hydroponics which is growing plants
without<00:01:24.299> soil<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.990> any<00:01:25.200> sort<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> growing

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
without soil or any sort of growing

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
without soil or any sort of growing
media<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.759> aquaponics<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.689> unique<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.079> that

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
media but aquaponics is unique in that

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.980 
media but aquaponics is unique in that
instead<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.039> using<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.460> nutrient<00:01:30.299> tank<00:01:30.539> that<00:01:30.960> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
instead of using a nutrient tank that is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.170 
instead of using a nutrient tank that is
full<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.680> different<00:01:32.100> nutrients<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
full of the different nutrients and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.389 
full of the different nutrients and
vitamins<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.899> plants<00:01:34.170> need<00:01:34.250> we<00:01:35.250> use<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
vitamins that the plants need we use a

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.850 
vitamins that the plants need we use a
fish<00:01:35.610> tank<00:01:35.850> which<00:01:36.539> has<00:01:36.780> our<00:01:37.110> fish<00:01:37.679> think

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
fish tank which has our fish think

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.679 
fish tank which has our fish think
that's<00:01:37.979> tilapia<00:01:38.399> in<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:39.450> fish

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that's tilapia in it and the fish

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
that's tilapia in it and the fish
provide<00:01:40.110> ammonia<00:01:40.860> into<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> system<00:01:41.610> which<00:01:41.909> is

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
provide ammonia into the system which is

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.779 
provide ammonia into the system which is
converted<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.450> nitrites<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:43.049> nitrates<00:01:43.140> which

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
converted to nitrites and nitrates which

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.590 
converted to nitrites and nitrates which
we're<00:01:44.789> kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.060> building<00:01:45.179> blocks<00:01:45.360> for

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
we're kind of the building blocks for

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.740 
we're kind of the building blocks for
plants

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.990 

well<00:01:50.290> this<00:01:50.410> is<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.560> 320<00:01:51.160> gallon<00:01:51.400> tank

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
well this is a 320 gallon tank

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.150 
well this is a 320 gallon tank
the<00:01:52.060> fish<00:01:52.270> we<00:01:52.990> can<00:01:53.110> hold<00:01:53.200> about<00:01:53.290> 150<00:01:53.890> fish<00:01:54.040> in

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
the fish we can hold about 150 fish in

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.150 
the fish we can hold about 150 fish in
there<00:01:54.340> healthily<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:56.110> then<00:01:56.290> these<00:01:56.470> grow<00:01:56.950> beds

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
there healthily and then these grow beds

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.350 
there healthily and then these grow beds
are<00:01:57.400> also<00:01:57.550> made<00:01:57.790> out<00:01:57.880> of<00:01:58.000> IBC<00:01:58.360> totes<00:01:58.750> as<00:01:58.900> well

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
are also made out of IBC totes as well

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.850 
are also made out of IBC totes as well
the<00:02:01.360> design<00:02:01.630> was<00:02:01.840> pretty<00:02:02.350> simple<00:02:02.710> it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
the design was pretty simple it

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.560 
the design was pretty simple it
originally<00:02:03.190> started<00:02:03.340> with<00:02:03.640> an<00:02:03.940> M<00:02:04.090> flow<00:02:04.330> growth

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
originally started with an M flow growth

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.350 
originally started with an M flow growth
system<00:02:04.990> which<00:02:05.229> is<00:02:05.790> these<00:02:06.790> beds<00:02:07.000> were<00:02:07.090> full<00:02:07.150> of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
system which is these beds were full of

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.060 
system which is these beds were full of
gravel<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.259> plants<00:02:08.530> were<00:02:08.619> planted<00:02:08.649> in

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
gravel and the plants were planted in

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
gravel and the plants were planted in
that<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.340> then<00:02:09.429> they<00:02:09.550> were<00:02:09.640> flooded<00:02:10.060> and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
that and then they were flooded and

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.830 
that and then they were flooded and
drained<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.020> nutrient<00:02:11.890> water<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.720> this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
drained of the nutrient water but this

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
drained of the nutrient water but this
system<00:02:13.990> here<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.380> we<00:02:14.440> built<00:02:14.650> when<00:02:14.770> we

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
system here that we built when we

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.530 
system here that we built when we
brought<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.130> here<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:15.880> decided<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.300> put<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
brought it here we decided to put the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.990 
brought it here we decided to put the
grow<00:02:16.720> beds<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.080> floor<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:18.100> just<00:02:18.370> let<00:02:18.850> the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
grow beds on the floor and just let the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.270 
grow beds on the floor and just let the
plants<00:02:19.510> sit<00:02:19.660> on<00:02:19.780> rafts<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.890> they're<00:02:21.010> actually

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
plants sit on rafts so they're actually

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.890 
plants sit on rafts so they're actually
sitting<00:02:21.820> on<00:02:22.000> these<00:02:22.120> rafts<00:02:22.480> floated<00:02:22.780> in<00:02:22.870> water

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
sitting on these rafts floated in water

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.420 
sitting on these rafts floated in water
and<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.380> roots<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:23.709> kind<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.040> hang<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.370> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
and the roots just kind of hang in the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.610 
and the roots just kind of hang in the
nutrient<00:02:24.820> solution

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.619 

what<00:02:30.250> we<00:02:30.370> hope<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:30.849> is<00:02:31.000> be<00:02:31.150> able<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.360> ramp

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
what we hope to do is be able to ramp

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.470 
what we hope to do is be able to ramp
this<00:02:31.810> up<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.459> extent<00:02:33.819> that<00:02:33.909> once<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.330> can

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
this up to the extent that once we can

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.210 
this up to the extent that once we can
prove<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.870> concept<00:02:35.379> that<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:35.680> can<00:02:35.830> do<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.069> here

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
prove the concept that we can do it here

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.890 
prove the concept that we can do it here
at<00:02:36.310> Messiah<00:02:36.640> with<00:02:36.909> food<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:37.510> can<00:02:37.659> produce

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
at Messiah with food that we can produce

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.680 
at Messiah with food that we can produce
and<00:02:38.319> don't<00:02:38.890> have<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.220> purchase<00:02:39.459> then<00:02:40.390> we<00:02:40.510> can

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
and don't have to purchase then we can

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.539 
and don't have to purchase then we can
ramp<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.110> up<00:02:41.319> where<00:02:41.560> we<00:02:41.650> can<00:02:41.830> do<00:02:41.980> Tomatoes

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
ramp this up where we can do Tomatoes

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.330 
ramp this up where we can do Tomatoes
year-round<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:44.049> fish<00:02:44.530> year-round<00:02:44.799> and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
year-round and fish year-round and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.430 
year-round and fish year-round and
possibly<00:02:46.209> other<00:02:46.420> crops<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:46.959> broccoli<00:02:47.230> and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
possibly other crops like broccoli and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.710 
possibly other crops like broccoli and
cauliflower<00:02:47.769> indoors<00:02:48.610> where<00:02:49.329> we<00:02:49.420> would<00:02:49.599> be

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
cauliflower indoors where we would be

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.509 
cauliflower indoors where we would be
able<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.019> supply<00:02:50.379> a<00:02:50.470> large<00:02:50.799> percentage<00:02:51.400> of

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
able to supply a large percentage of

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:00.240 
able to supply a large percentage of
that<00:02:51.579> need

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250
