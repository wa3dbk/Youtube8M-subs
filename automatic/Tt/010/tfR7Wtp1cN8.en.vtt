00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.479 
and we'll talk about these arena mods
for<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> backstage<00:02:07.530> areas<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:07.830> bit<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
for the backstage areas a little bit you

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.300 
for the backstage areas a little bit you
see<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.630> 204<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.289> believe<00:02:11.039> those

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
see the do for the 204 I believe those

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.620 
see the do for the 204 I believe those
codes<00:02:11.580> are<00:02:11.700> exactly<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.150> same<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.420> every

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
codes are exactly the same for every

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.270 
codes are exactly the same for every
single<00:02:12.810> backstage<00:02:13.230> area<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:13.890> check<00:02:14.100> that

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
single backstage area you can check that

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.160 
single backstage area you can check that
on<00:02:14.489> codex<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> think<00:02:15.870> they're<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.050> same

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
on codex but I think they're the same

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.110 
on codex but I think they're the same
but<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.160> last<00:02:17.340> two<00:02:17.550> zero<00:02:17.850> zero<00:02:17.910> zero

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
but that and the last two zero zero zero

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.120 
but that and the last two zero zero zero
zero<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> zero<00:02:18.810> three<00:02:19.290> whatever<00:02:19.470> those

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
zero and the zero three whatever those

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.270 
zero and the zero three whatever those
change<00:02:20.870> zero<00:02:21.870> zero<00:02:22.019> zero<00:02:22.050> zero<00:02:22.230> zero<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.830> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
change zero zero zero zero zero is to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.890 
change zero zero zero zero zero is to
change<00:02:23.519> just<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.820> smackdown<00:02:24.390> arena<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.810> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
change just the smackdown arena to the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.290 
change just the smackdown arena to the
backstage<00:02:25.290> areas<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.970> year<00:02:27.090> all

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
backstage areas I think this year all

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.270 
backstage areas I think this year all
the<00:02:27.480> zeros<00:02:27.720> plus<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.709> last<00:02:28.860> year<00:02:29.070> will<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
the zeros plus the last year will be a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.070 
the zeros plus the last year will be a
one<00:02:29.519> would<00:02:29.670> be<00:02:29.760> raw<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:29.970> other<00:02:30.630> than<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.810> see

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
one would be raw but other than that see

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.870 
one would be raw but other than that see
it's<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> same<00:02:31.890> setup<00:02:32.519> but<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.690> last<00:02:33.900> code<00:02:34.260> is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
it's the same setup but the last code is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.580 
it's the same setup but the last code is
you<00:02:35.880> know<00:02:36.000> different<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.050> we're<00:02:37.230> gonna<00:02:37.320> start

you<00:06:15.940> can<00:06:16.090> go<00:06:16.210> I<00:06:16.240> mean<00:06:16.419> there's<00:06:16.690> a<00:06:16.780> point<00:06:16.990> in<00:06:17.320> the

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
you can go I mean there's a point in the

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.159 
you can go I mean there's a point in the
backstage<00:06:18.370> area<00:06:18.550> where<00:06:18.850> you<00:06:18.970> goes<00:06:19.960> like<00:06:20.080> an

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
backstage area where you goes like an

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:21.480 
backstage area where you goes like an
invisible<00:06:20.320> wall<00:06:20.740> so<00:06:20.919> you<00:06:21.010> really<00:06:21.190> can't<00:06:21.370> go

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490
