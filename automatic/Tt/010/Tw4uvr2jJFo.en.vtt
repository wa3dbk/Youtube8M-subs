00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 yes hello people today i show you how 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.230
 your project casa steering wheel right one 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.210
 if you can think for example 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.099
 somehow problem with that has it 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.259
 steering wheel or that steering too much 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.960
 is sensitive or dare very much 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.910
 poorly controlled 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.800
 and yes , I'll just give it a go 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.170
 give some tips how you change that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 can or just like the steering wheel 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.220
 Set right to you go first 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.010
 in the main menu of options then on 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.610
 controls then you should join 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.780
 Priest first real steering wheel all 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.260
 specify 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.200
 by default this is actually 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.590
 specified here and here you bite 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.469
 I like to have content for steering 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.620
 development on employed horst fiedler 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.000
 105 3 it can you yourselves 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.700
 that's just the attitude 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.969
 when the steering should respond so 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.379
 if I have to put 12 70 or 50 here 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.530
 I already stock up a bit 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.050
 before really turning in but me 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.710
 I recommend 3 or 3 to 5 I recommend 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.210
 then you should the sensitivity to 100 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.590
 because we make them underneath 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.860
 did not have a full steering angle 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.510
 as well as 100 on perforce 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 you can zero the special cwt 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.720
 but also let the temperatures here 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.720
 you can not stop here 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.759
 should the complete angle specified 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.810
 be the steering wheel from one side to the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.570
 others can do 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.829
 In my case 180 degrees so if I 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.979
 the steering wheel now to the left 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.409
 turn and then as far as possible after 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.650
 turn right then I have a total of 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.200
 180 degrees for my steering wheel 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.750
 So that's just how he does that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.570
 you can just go on 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.040
 calibrated and click on start there 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.840
 do now simply so what should 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.600
 the steering wheel now in to the maximum 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.369
 on the maximum steering diaz has 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.829
 set as a few times to the left 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.540
 and then turn right to next and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.670
 then tolerated and 90 degrees 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.780
 that's just me with it now 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.000
 recognized 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.730
 90 degrees c 180 degrees steering wheel because of that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.200
 now turn this handlebar to 90 degrees 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.530
 I also do it twice in both 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.069
 directions and I press on next and 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.660
 also from simons safe really x yes mgs 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.830
 Controls should now be your angle 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.930
 be listed here 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.690
 from your steering wheel and then you should 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.880
 also hopefully the car better 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.980
 can control 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.300
 I does you helped and then 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.840
 I say goodbye and see you 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.840
 next time
