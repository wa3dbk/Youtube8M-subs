00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.980
 it goes really well actually 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.880
 it is a band or no it has become quite famous in the city and beyond 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.790
 would be a large influx of people that is actually more than we can here 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.780
 the for that cafe located in a former nursery on the 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.039
 friesestraatweg runs like crazy 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.330
 maybe that is the group with the restaurant where you can eat for free 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.679
 the concept is simple 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.489
 get volunteers from producers, supermarkets and bakeries and farmers 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.759
 all kinds of food on what may no longer be sold but what is still fine 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.079
 is edible 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.350
 and then this one catches on but the limit of growth is as good as 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.280
 reached last summer it was really completely full then I said for the food 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.789
 people had to wait in line to miss resistance put first dishes 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.210
 to the second dish 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.450
 And the downside to that is that we actually want an experience that every people 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.320
 can sit quietly and enjoy and the fact that you have nothing in return 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.510
 having to do something different is worked every year, it just barely falls 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.550
 from what is on the markets to pick up is what they have found there 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.750
 but it is also smaller, nice quality it says 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.780
 I've already eaten you too much 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.350
 the preparation of meals without meat or fish is done by a large group 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.490
 volunteers 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.920
 if you just look what are all gone 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.800
 according to 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 all kinds of people hung up 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.340
 perfect to actually eat 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.830
 You should actually just share that I know every kitchen when it is needed 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.870
 from DIY I am someone who 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.410
 horn i think that i want to go to can do better maybe there 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.340
 almost needed maintenance 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.500
 and then complete families complete the students 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.410
 the elderly and anyone who wants to stop food waste can do two 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.909
 come by once a week for a free meal this year to eat you 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.530
 awesome 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.110
 to cope with the influx in the near future, the organization is doing a lot 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.780
 call 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.400
 there are many places that do 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.290
 are very suitable for his session while you provide the necessary space and the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.470
 kitchen and it doesn't have to be every day one day a week 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.250
 Standards would say let it run while watch vid like panties 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.250
 other ideas it is not nothing fixed concept everything is possible 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.180
 you can find the free cafÃ© on the grounds of the garden in the city 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.710
 and that is near the railroad crossing on the friesestraatweg
