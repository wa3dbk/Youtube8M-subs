00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.210
 here at the ranch the bugle of the unam 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.210
 from your doctor 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.600
 you get the experience 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.240
 152 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.320
 of this work 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.740
 If you can recommend it to your 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.740
 product 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.650
 --results 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.390
 Well first of all let me 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.670
 to mention our thanks to 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.829
 papalotla seeds because these areas 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.350
 that you planted 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.809
 we have managed to focus thanks to the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.670
 donation of seeds of these new 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.610
 these new varieties of brachiaria or 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.620
 new brachiaria hybrids 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.490
 in the first instance they have been giving 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.830
 very good results to the establishment 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:03.440
 I can tell you that this grass is 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:06.410
 the 17 52 we sowed it on the 18th 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.530
 of May of this year we made a 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.280
 complete preparation of the land and 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.900
 we sow the seed broadcast 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 about 8 kilos per hectare 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.729
 approximately 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.189
 in two hectares that are what we have 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.659
 of recent sowing previously 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.210
 we had planted one hectare of the year 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.030
 past and how can you observe 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.000
 the growth 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.940
 four months after being planted 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.640
 it is extraordinary plants 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.960
 they have very good development and in this 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.820
 moment as you can observe we have a 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.490
 proposed stretching a flowering 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.940
 profuse what is indicative of a very 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.509
 good production of grass seed 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.570
 we have not measured the production yet nor 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.960
 of forage or milk production but 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.450
 we already have an experiment on the door 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.490
 we will start in the month of October where 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.560
 let's compare milk production 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.950
 of this pasture of 1752 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.030
 with other grasses that we have adjacent 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.310
 to this paddock and they are basically 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.360
 native prairies with some star a 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.540
 little brachiaria straight etcetera and then 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.940
 very clear that with the results that 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.910
 we have had to planting are obvious 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.680
 and this gives us an idea of ​​the ability 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.870
 that has growth and cover 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.990
 quickly the land we can 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.360
 recommend it as a grass like a grass 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.480
 very promising for the regions of the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.590
 tropic and obviously seeds 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.270
 papalotla must have many more 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.960
 possibilities so to speak of 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.960
 developing 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.390
 of sales with this kind of with this guy 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.830
 of materials that I repeat again are 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.980
 very promising because they have a 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.180
 extraordinary development for their 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.459
 four months just that they have stable 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.010
 this doctor this network was already and already takes 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.370
 some grazing 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.890
 the center of pasture development 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.400
 in the establishment sedan let's say it 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.400
 so training grazing are factors 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.720
 that are made light in order to 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.819
 allow the removal of the clump 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.069
 of the plants and that 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.290
 better establish each plant in this 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.659
 At the moment we led a grazing that occurred 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.959
 about a month ago around 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:39.310
 of August 19 I have the first 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.890
 grazing east by 3 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.330
 this question here what I have given 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.330
 mind that I 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.030
 mainly 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.840
 he was very damaged by the bread his minor 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.890
 has damaged we have not observed damage from 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.740
 false meter even in plants that 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.230
 They are usually very resistant by 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.150
 example home grass native grass 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.210
 braid we know here weird 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.890
 sometimes it suffers the damage of the false meter and 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.109
 this year in the first growth 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.959
 after the rains we had damage not 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.160
 only in star that is usually 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.520
 resistant in quotes but also 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.729
 in 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.190
 in native grass even in pasture 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.349
 elephant and in taiwan we had some of the 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.590
 year of false meter 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:38.169
 comparatively the damage he received in 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.229
 this false meter plant only 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.900
 was limited to the roadside some 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.229
 how many meters 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.139
 and we can review plants that are in 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.509
 this moment then completing with all 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.759
 with all its leaves the damage is not 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.320
 evident and instead we can go to others 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.300
 last of native granma like the one 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.360
 it's opposite where we still observe 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.070
 the damage of the volcano others have come 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.190
 So this means that at least 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.350
 in this sense of resistance 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.569
 type of pests is also that we are 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.429
 It shows a very promising material 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.630
 of the many that counts for 

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:14.910
 sticks claudia mind 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.350
 very many times others not the contrary 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.840
 thank you for allowing us 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.210
 work with these these grasses so 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.400
 promising and what good at the end of 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.110
 accounts come to benefit all the 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.550
 livestock tropical world average 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.550
 some invitation for the 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.820
 come here to 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.100
 and we are the experimental center 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.280
 of the faculty of veterinary medicine 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.350
 of the unam because we are open to everything 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.410

 the new varieties that we have and the 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.190
 management they are receiving
