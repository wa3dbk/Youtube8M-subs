00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.679
 A new trailer has been released and releases the movie.

 a sign-up link for you to sit 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.900
 I think the direct video link let's see 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.020
 If you have there, why not forget? 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.090
 Come on, there's more stuff, I was there . 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.300
 map a detailed look that the player 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.800
 was 3 km 23 number 24 and I thought the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.960
 following a pump because it is a server 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.520
 so I saw play from the start to 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.310
 make a note there playing let me 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.730
 Happy something extra because I want 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.310
 a quick fight and such to her again 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.360
 catch the big waves very soon 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.970
 playing in a whole 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 I do not know how much to play and now 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.440
 he returned to have a little more will and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.480
 then came this new pec that improved 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.890
 quite a yunet code 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.940
 so I went to look for a server and it goes 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.850
 play a good guy this was a disgrace 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.970
 it was too hard to find a good server 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.200
 to play face I can stay 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.659

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.060
 four servers in the case most 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.790
 I do not see them doing that because 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.580
 without any player playing that is very 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.190
 very few people playing in series 2 gum 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.960
 I do not know what's happening to me. 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.630
 I saw the son of 13 until he made a 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.120
 please pack the staff there on the page 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.850

 a lot of people playing well at the end of three 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.830
 face and then she put the government of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.619
 Grace neither and rented a lot a scoundrel 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.460
 and micro server 24 new york chicago 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.250
 los angeles 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.560
 everything that is place and face most 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.540
 servers are annotated 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.670
 the staff is complaining a lot dear 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.219
 I found this one so far 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.800
 unfortunately for anyone who answers 30 br 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.320
 still 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.300
 what we what chances are there of 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.650
 so American seductive random 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.270
 find a Brazilian in Cyprus that 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.770
 It was strange but expensive after I 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.630
 I played a lot and I tried to go back to 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.080
 new number was 4 km was a lot 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.840
 difficult 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.790
 the number was from 3 to 0 the half-minute to 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.680
 find a cool server to play without 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.200
 Pain green opinion has no winner 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.920
 pachuca winner dÃ©lia at the moment is 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.460
 always crowded you imagine is then it is 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.770
 hard to find brde server folks 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.810
 will play but if we have gringo winner 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.180
 with 150 pine in the case of this company 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.110
 set there are two clocks 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.820
 playing now was number 24 in making the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.560
 prince but most every customer who 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.900
 was encountering empty server 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.270
 that no one was playing what 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.120
 had people playing were full 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.900
 khan difficult step the chance is very 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.580
 cool 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.560
 seems to have given a revitalized even 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.390
 as I said on facebook lombello escape the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.000
 I promise she has very much 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.650
 players are very cool, man 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.330
 easy to play because the staff is new and 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.950
 such is that thing 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.600
 It's still interesting to play face 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.090
 personnel who are still three ahead 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.220
 it's worth the joke it still has 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.500
 game installed or have to install the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.660
 vital game that is interesting that gives 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.070
 to play a lot there, give it to who 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.720
 more interesting it is that the 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.640
 staff is playing is new staff and 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.989
 you will be training only sights aside 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.730
 that knows 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.040
 the staff is not accustomed set 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.720
 but he was arrested on count pb by breaking 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.459
 games and henrique all the games here 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.830
 they are not bf 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.480
 Do not buy the same or even know 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.890
 even in f4 who did not have the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.600
 first will stay then get it 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.000
 Open thanks will know 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.470
 but in fact it is very easy to play there 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.959
 so interesting and cool dose in each 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.520
 Grace to roll and I played a little bit 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.050
 also to see the four-year-old son 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.450
 able to find a server for 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.280
 play games do not let me the game is this 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.989
 from which the state of ms has more 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.840
 a match that was worth but not 2003 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.090
 michael played and it's cool, I 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.800
 I think it can not really be improved 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.870
 enough and I'm doing my set was the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.660
 I swear maybe my tests because I do not 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.979
 I played as much as I wanted and I was 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.530
 with a little problem on the internet these 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.270
 days 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.560
 What do I think I'm going to show? 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.150
 show you what happens 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.920
 while the poll with this broad begins 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.660
 to have problems on the internet you have a 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.240
 idea of what happens in the game I recorded 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.620
 here what happened i do not know it is 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.139
 happening to be an actor was with a 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.570
 Tower problem in the case is not the 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.870
 radio but from the towers on the poles 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.040
 where it passes the fiber optic cables 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.300
 I think a bottle with the problem does not 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.800
 I know what happened. 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.860
 and so I'll try to show you 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.200
 A video composed of late does not have 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.750
 has nothing to comment on anything you will see is 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.650
 that I left a test on the cheat cm 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.390
 site 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.910
 I think the google website even in 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.880
 uol site that is a Brazilian site and 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.020
 they will see how much difference that 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.810
 affects the tijuca 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.510
 the subtotal set of pico by nico rosberg 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.220
 in lotion see and it's something I think 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.020
 some people do face this 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.760
 you can not do tests now and never 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.470
 did not know how they can test 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.280
 to see if it was installing problem 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.320
 Internet 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.000
 it's worth doing this test there is 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.650
 interesting and I think there may be a 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.690
 fight when you want to fight with a 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.050
 technical support at your service provider and 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.120
 What is happening but coming back to 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.440
 I've seen the game and I've done it. 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.810
 that part of me there that I can say 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.090
 That was good too because I got it. 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.780
 play well at home and playing in a 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.260
 server as the server there. 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.729
 I noticed that the tire also influences it. 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.370
 Obvious if you play the second Brazilian 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.830
 the vital will have a greater advantage but 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.110
 playing on gringo servers that do not 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.100
 I'm playing there and playing 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:59.060
 quiet k 1 150 150 depending on maximum 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.039
 after they changed the one type of game 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.020
 that I put there the maximum the frequency 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.550
 reads if you still have questions about how to 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.910
 put to the maximum my life in which I 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.440
 make a video to show you more 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.050
 there was also the episode must have 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.810
 perceived that going easy is difficult 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.580
 it's not a crazy thing to change and the 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.010
 frequency but if you have any questions about my 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.110
 life where I can for you to leave no 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.729
 I know if the consoles have this option not 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.470
 be all the islands change some 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.780
 thing option looks that thing i know 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.780
 that on the pc changes and changes a lot for you 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.409
 to change there the world frequency of the type 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.779
 of game 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.909
 You have our game option then 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:37.099
 as in the pc it changes quite interesting 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.330
 you playing on maxed out psc 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.800
 if the internet can handle 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.679
 I know that many people were bearing 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.239
 house but it was problem is that I had is the 

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:46.399
 proof he was having there I do not know 

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:47.749
 What did they really do to fix it? 

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:49.399
 I know they've sorted it out somehow 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:51.769
 there and now it's working 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:54.679
 quietly I'll move on to I want 

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:56.749
 show you off as this is what 

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:58.550
 we do not know but personal comments and 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:01.399
 if there are no doubters who were 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.279
 how to change it the frequency of the net 

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:07.249
 koudela I can only video one 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:08.689
 showing this as it seems that some 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:12.979
 people have not figured out how to 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:14.599
 is why and comes already with options the option 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:15.649
 of disabled 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.719
 so the people have to go there and 

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:19.369
 enable it then this is the part of the 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:21.860
 People had to leave, I do not know how I did. 

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:23.629
 I'm 20, this match is a 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.449
 practice I played with a team with 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:28.550
 16 consequence of the beginning of the campaign 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:31.039
 bigger with muffler was fun 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.689
 so this is it is that I have shown 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:34.009
 if you know when that force of that 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:38.229
 that favorites and no more came out a 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:38.229
 hug even more and spoke ah
