00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 to the unknown people on youtube I am 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.980
 daily beast in a call of gameplay 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.590
 duty advanced warfare and today I'm with 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.170
 press raymond carr will leave on the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.360
 description your channel and today I wanted you 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.580
 to teach a trick is it for you 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.340
 you know if you do not know then you go to the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.369
 store and you see that there are micropayments worth 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.910
 and you will say what the fuck is that and with that 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.550
 Well, the exoskeleton that I have here 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:34.460
 you have to buy what's worth it and I'm going to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:38.219
 teach how to get it free and 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.670
 the trick is to get on top of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.129
 exo one that you have not bought clear and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.910
 your partner has to have has to 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.039
 be him the leader of the session not this 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 while you do not have it as well 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:59.329
 you have to look for game heading game 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.329
 and we left the exoskeleton worth 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.609
 but let's get out now 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.829
 but what 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.840
 the bad thing is that you can see that 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:16.590
 he has done the trick or can not see it 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.320
 others and that does not last forever 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.299
 or you have to do it using many 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.070
 times yes or each time you go to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.350
 play it because it does not always stay 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.890
 but I also think it works with the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.890
 helmets 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.159
 James 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.159
 it has come out 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.340
 uy I have left 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.590
 a tie 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.570
 and now let's try now with a 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.570
 adhesive helmet 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.640
 ah 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.979
 we are going to put the car 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.490
 that is, the bolide helmet, that's cool 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.350
 mallet 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.350
 to see the search for departure 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.849
 ostias 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.849
 fuck I did not see myself male 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.590
 it's not who I have not seen if I had the 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.810
 helmet 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.810
 because it was like there was nothing 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.250
 if it jumps 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.530
 recovered from the break 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.510
 Well, before I had time to kill 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.510
 one 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.050
 I will not have it now I suppose 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.170
 no I do not have now but surely yes 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.220
 yes yes I think it will be 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.860
 what I want to check and know if yes 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.340
 it serves with a camouflage to see looks for 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.340
 from now 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.950
 not one that goes that went down jumps jumps 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.230
 well this has been for today I hope 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.760
 that you liked at the time of 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.030

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.030
