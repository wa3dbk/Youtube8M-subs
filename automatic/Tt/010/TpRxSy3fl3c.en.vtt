seen some tank shots before in top by
visa<00:02:30.340> week<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:30.909> that<00:02:31.299> was<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.629> ridiculous<00:02:32.260> one

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
visa week but that was a ridiculous one

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.160 
visa week but that was a ridiculous one
similar<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.400> last<00:02:33.549> time<00:02:33.909> we<00:02:34.540> had<00:02:34.690> one<00:02:34.900> from<00:02:35.079> a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
similar to last time we had one from a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.259 
similar to last time we had one from a
ridiculous<00:02:35.620> range<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.220> was<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.579> beautiful

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
ridiculous range that was just beautiful

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.789 
ridiculous range that was just beautiful
precision<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.870> think<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.200> only<00:02:38.230> had<00:02:38.500> before

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
precision I think the only had before

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:39.960 
precision I think the only had before
was<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.950> little<00:02:39.190> bit<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.310> luck<00:02:39.489> but<00:02:39.730> i<00:02:39.760> think

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
was a little bit of luck but i think

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.789 
was a little bit of luck but i think
that<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:40.329> he<00:02:40.720> timed<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.140> very<00:02:41.440> well<00:02:41.560> they're

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
that one he timed it very well they're

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.460 
that one he timed it very well they're
very<00:02:42.010> nice<00:02:42.459> skill<00:02:42.819> for<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:43.420> shot<00:02:43.870> moving<00:02:44.349> on

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
very nice skill for that shot moving on

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.610 
very nice skill for that shot moving on

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
is and this such a really difficult map

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.640 
is and this such a really difficult map
I<00:02:51.849> remember<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.420> nearly<00:02:53.049> complete<00:02:53.470> this<00:02:53.590> game

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
I remember I nearly complete this game

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.800 
I remember I nearly complete this game
myself<00:02:53.950> actually<00:02:54.340> cannot<00:02:54.879> do<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.329> last<00:02:55.540> level

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
myself actually cannot do the last level

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.979 
myself actually cannot do the last level
is<00:02:56.440> beyond<00:02:57.040> ridiculous<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.629> guy<00:02:58.780> makes

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
is beyond ridiculous but this guy makes

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.330 
is beyond ridiculous but this guy makes
this<00:02:59.109> level<00:02:59.379> look<00:02:59.470> quite<00:02:59.650> easy<00:02:59.859> searching

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
this level look quite easy searching

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.009 
this level look quite easy searching
quite<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.579> tricky<00:03:00.909> one<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.239> lot<00:03:01.599> of<00:03:01.629> balance

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
quite a tricky one a lot of balance

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.470 
quite a tricky one a lot of balance
needed<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.530> lot<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.769> skill<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:03.340> timing<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.359> he

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
needed a lot of skill and timing and he

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.539 
needed a lot of skill and timing and he
managed<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.170> go<00:03:05.440> through<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.769> absolutely

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
managed to just go through it absolutely

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.640 
managed to just go through it absolutely
faultlessly<00:03:07.000> for<00:03:07.599> a<00:03:07.629> ridiculous<00:03:08.109> fast<00:03:08.379> time

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
faultlessly for a ridiculous fast time

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.680 
faultlessly for a ridiculous fast time
it<00:03:08.799> really<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.280> always<00:03:09.700> think<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.269> these<00:03:10.420> guys

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
it really I always think of these guys

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.509 
it really I always think of these guys
drive<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.230> like<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.379> thousand<00:03:11.950> times<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:12.400> then

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
drive it like a thousand times and then

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.580 
drive it like a thousand times and then
they<00:03:12.640> finally<00:03:12.940> get<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:13.299> fast<00:03:13.660> time<00:03:13.930> or<00:03:14.230> they

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
they finally get that fast time or they

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.020 
they finally get that fast time or they
literally<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.310> good<00:03:15.519> but<00:03:15.730> they're<00:03:15.880> just

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
literally that good but they're just

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.599 
literally that good but they're just
first<00:03:16.329> time<00:03:16.630> every<00:03:17.319> time<00:03:17.430> perfect<00:03:18.430> balance

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
first time every time perfect balance

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.120 
first time every time perfect balance
perfect<00:03:19.419> kind<00:03:19.599> of<00:03:19.720> momentum<00:03:20.349> going<00:03:20.799> on<00:03:20.919> what

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
perfect kind of momentum going on what

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.379 
perfect kind of momentum going on what
it's<00:03:21.220> really<00:03:21.430> about<00:03:21.549> in<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.000> game<00:03:22.180> when<00:03:22.269> it

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
it's really about in this game when it

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.180 
it's really about in this game when it
gets<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.690> harder<00:03:22.870> levels<00:03:23.349> you<00:03:23.709> have<00:03:23.919> to<00:03:24.069> get

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
gets the harder levels you have to get

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.159 
gets the harder levels you have to get
the<00:03:24.280> momentum<00:03:24.599> absolutely<00:03:25.599> correct<00:03:26.019> and

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
the momentum absolutely correct and

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.440 
the momentum absolutely correct and
