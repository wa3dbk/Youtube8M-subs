00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 so when a step has become a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.310
 recipe channel in which siena are 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.610
 around 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.100
 let's say this video I wanted to propose 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.410
 a mash how to do 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.690
 in a traditional way a pastone for i 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.500
 fish that we will then freeze and 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.810
 we will give small portions year watch that 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.560
 we need it, I want to see it all 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.240
 procedure and above all I will tell you which ones 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.210
 ingredients are best suited for 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.670
 make this stick which in 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.379
 this case I think what we 're going to do 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:44.989
 at home and it is therefore less 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:48.500
 trivial salad potatoes where on the is 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.750
 other citizens that it is better to take the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.300
 tender part of the leaf from the end of life 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.129
 the bottom one more white to 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.220
 then decline to meat over meat 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.129
 citizen instead that is good 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.400
 very important to avoid fatty meat 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:11.049
 so maybe avoid pork and beef 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.520
 you have to give us meat that anyway 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.740
 before fat in this case 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.619
 use dictators fake chicken part 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.259
 then take a saucepan with water 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.670
 and we're going to boil everyone, not always 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.990
 nothing because this will make it more 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.640
 to keep 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:35.060
 all the vegetables and fruit will be more 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.079
 then easy to blend it and get a 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.079
 homogeneous compound 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.590
 well then let's boil everything 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.289
 including meat throughout all 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.619
 ingredients that you are going to 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.329
 put in the stamps for a few minutes then the 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.969
 in this case I had this 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.399
 ingredient this independently 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:05.630
 otherwise you can enter very well of 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.450
 everything from zucchini to aubergines to 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.600
 words there are a lot of recipes of gods 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.810
 pastones for tropical pleasure in 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.520
 aquarium and you can do a search on 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.510
 inter predict which ingredients are 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.620
 more or less fit for purpose is a beautiful one 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.620
 blend for everything
