00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:20.450 

and<00:01:09.920> here's<00:01:10.820> what<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.270> trails<00:01:11.539> like

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.489

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
so as you see the manual only folds once

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.260 
so as you see the manual only folds once
and<00:01:23.890> this<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.460> because<00:01:24.729> this<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.060> Hong

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270
