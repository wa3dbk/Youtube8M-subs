00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 good afternoon everyone with you i'm sanchez and 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.620
 Today I will show Easter eggs from the game 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.300
 hardline battlefield 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.300
 drove 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.300
 more 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.840
 Well, let's start with Easter eggs which 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.730
 is on the business center map 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.650
 if you walk a little to the museum then 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.540
 be able to see the advertising posters on 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.730
 which shows films that should 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.040
 get out but then you can immediately notice 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.930
 reference to the show is possible like red bull 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.300
 Candy the walking dead 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.960
 even the font of this inscription is very similar 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.010
 further reminded me a poster with the poster 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.560
 planet monkeys 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.540
 now it seems to me personally nearby 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.580
 from there you can also find a skyscraper 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.530
 mirrored windows coming up from all 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.600
 parties you will see absolutely normal and 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.729
 reflection but precisely on one side 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.100
 if you come closer you can see 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.560
 blocks from the game minekravtov turning around you 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.690
 You may notice that the design of the street is not 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:47.050
 such as in reflection is a reference to 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:48.640
 minecraft is pretty cool nearby 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.619
 there is a big museum which also has 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.720
 poster with tyrannosaurus rex like you 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.520
 know the developers of battlefield often 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.560
 add prehistoric creatures to the game 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.360
 in all parts of the series we could see 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.550
 dinosaurs and direct references to that 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.649
 time hareline will also be endowed 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.940
 such Easter eggs that also 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.940
 adds interests to the game 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.599
 further in the mall there is a sign on 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.550
 which ishimura written for barrel oars 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.830
 games releases the famous series ded 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.420
 space so here ishimura is a space 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.040
 ship from the game dead space 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.349
 so space fans 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.349
 adventures will be able to find such easter eggs 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.780
 starting to play buried this same map but 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.930
 points of rebirth squads you will be able to 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.480
 find the tips on the table if you click on 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.180
 someone your hero will be able to give them an order 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.430
 It looks fun this Easter eggs to all 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.900
 American police who are not indifferent 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:51.110
 refers to this delicacy 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:52.880
 donut also if you go to 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.310
 some skyscraper where there is an elevator and 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.290
 on this elevator card and little you can 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.090
 see the developers logo and shit 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.980
 games on numbers 4 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.200
 many are still credited for this easter egg 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.599
 card instead of a token for which also 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.769
 written number 4 battlefield 4 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.780
 so that it means think for yourself I personally 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.430
 how not to try and shoot him somehow 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.810
 interact no interactions 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.810
 I can not 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.770
 further on the map is a sandstorm at 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.440
 Capturing points in one of the houses can 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.760
 destroy the floor and find a small room 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.070
 for create drugs 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.230
 If you take to lead the card you might think 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.240
 that this is a reference to the series breaking bad 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.830
 in which also the stage setting was 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.830
 very similar to this card 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:58.170
 but on the map bank you can see 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.300
 A lot of easter eggs can also be found here. 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.490
 poster written by shakers 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.770
 but it is the sac is highlighted in red and 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.170
 translated as hickey or full words 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.660
 as a sucker immediately you can remember the movie 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.590

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.180
 vampire hickey 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.360
 and which is a parody of 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.670
 famous twilight also if you 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.609

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.140
