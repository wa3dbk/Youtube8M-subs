00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
platform if you're doing and even use a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.670

with a lot of people have is making end

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.350 
with a lot of people have is making end
of<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.710> traps<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.190> Enderman<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.060> steal<00:02:09.239> your

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
of in traps is Enderman will steal your

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.630 
of in traps is Enderman will steal your
blocks<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.840> escape

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.010 

now<00:02:14.640> I'm<00:02:14.849> sure<00:02:15.060> there<00:02:15.239> are<00:02:15.330> other<00:02:15.480> ways<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.720> do

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
now I'm sure there are other ways to do

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.600 
now I'm sure there are other ways to do
an<00:02:16.110> Enderman<00:02:16.500> trap<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.489> only

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
an Enderman trap but this is the only

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.130 
an Enderman trap but this is the only
way<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.760> I've<00:02:18.060> discovered<00:02:18.569> without<00:02:18.810> them

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
way that I've discovered without them

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.220 
way that I've discovered without them
teleporting<00:02:19.800> away<00:02:20.239> we<00:02:21.239> did<00:02:21.510> build<00:02:21.840> another

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
teleporting away we did build another

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.260 
teleporting away we did build another
version<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.709> this<00:02:22.860> trap<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.700> server<00:02:24.030> that

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
version of this trap on the server that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.670 
version of this trap on the server that
I<00:02:24.330> play<00:02:24.660> on<00:02:26.270> yeah<00:02:27.270> we<00:02:27.420> had<00:02:27.569> about<00:02:27.720> 700<00:02:28.319> Enderman

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
I play on yeah we had about 700 Enderman

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.750 
I play on yeah we had about 700 Enderman
in<00:02:28.800> about<00:02:29.010> 30<00:02:29.190> seconds<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.819> was<00:02:30.300> not<00:02:30.630> good<00:02:30.900> so

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
in about 30 seconds it was not good so

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.370 
in about 30 seconds it was not good so
yeah<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.209> build<00:02:33.660> your<00:02:33.780> wall<00:02:33.989> around<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
yeah you build your wall around the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.650 
yeah you build your wall around the
outside<00:02:34.739> like<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:37.370> now<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:39.209> without

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
outside like so now you can do without

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.830 
outside like so now you can do without
the<00:02:40.260> wall<00:02:40.590> being<00:02:41.010> fully<00:02:41.819> enclosed<00:02:42.209> like<00:02:42.569> that

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the wall being fully enclosed like that

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.590 
the wall being fully enclosed like that
I<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.650> did<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.430> try<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.000> reduce<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
I just did that to try and reduce a

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.770 
I just did that to try and reduce a
little<00:02:45.750> bit<00:02:45.989> of<00:02:46.110> visual<00:02:46.350> lag<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:47.630> don't<00:02:48.630> think

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
little bit of visual lag I don't think

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.289 
little bit of visual lag I don't think
it's<00:02:48.900> helping<00:02:49.069> but<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.459> need<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.730> wall<00:02:51.060> to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
it's helping but you do need the wall to

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.860 
it's helping but you do need the wall to
be<00:02:51.510> at<00:02:51.780> least<00:02:52.260> one<00:02:52.620> brick<00:02:52.890> high<00:02:53.130> otherwise<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
be at least one brick high otherwise the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.039 
be at least one brick high otherwise the
end<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.140> an<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.650> escape<00:02:59.540> you<00:03:00.540> can<00:03:00.660> either<00:03:00.810> have

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
end of an can escape you can either have

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.660 
end of an can escape you can either have
the<00:03:01.200> one<00:03:01.349> brick<00:03:01.590> high<00:03:01.799> here<00:03:03.560> oops<00:03:04.560> wow<00:03:05.069> really

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
the one brick high here oops wow really

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.370 
the one brick high here oops wow really
going<00:03:06.000> great<00:03:06.180> today<00:03:08.989> yeah<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.080> can<00:03:10.200> either

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
going great today yeah you can either

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.410 
going great today yeah you can either
have<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.530> one<00:03:10.650> brick<00:03:10.860> up<00:03:11.040> here<00:03:11.340> or<00:03:11.549> when<00:03:12.269> you

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
have the one brick up here or when you

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.809 
have the one brick up here or when you
use<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.019> quicksand<00:03:13.620> because<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.519> trap

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
use the quicksand because the this trap

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.520 
use the quicksand because the this trap
does<00:03:15.030> use<00:03:15.269> quicksand<00:03:15.720> as<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.109> can<00:03:16.200> see<00:03:16.320> here

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
does use quicksand as you can see here

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.360 
does use quicksand as you can see here
yeah<00:03:16.859> in<00:03:17.040> quicksand<00:03:18.829> you<00:03:19.829> can<00:03:20.010> put<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.280> beside

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
yeah in quicksand you can put it beside

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.660 
yeah in quicksand you can put it beside
the<00:03:20.549> quicksand<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.410> like<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.709> now<00:03:23.609> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
the quicksand a like so now the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.430 
the quicksand a like so now the
quicksand<00:03:24.239> has<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.540> be<00:03:24.630> two<00:03:24.900> blocks<00:03:25.079> high

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
quicksand has to be two blocks high

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.590 
quicksand has to be two blocks high
otherwise<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.250> will<00:03:26.340> not<00:03:26.579> actually<00:03:26.850> suffocate

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
otherwise it will not actually suffocate

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.410 
otherwise it will not actually suffocate
the<00:03:27.750> end<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.170> they<00:03:28.739> all<00:03:28.890> just<00:03:29.220> sit<00:03:30.060> there<00:03:30.239> so

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
the end of it they all just sit there so

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.099 
the end of it they all just sit there so
to<00:03:30.480> speak<00:03:31.609> if<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.030> one<00:03:33.269> block<00:03:33.480> too<00:03:33.690> low<00:03:33.900> now

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
to speak if it is one block too low now

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.020 
to speak if it is one block too low now
just<00:03:34.500> keep<00:03:34.709> rising<00:03:35.609> above<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.910> won't

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
just keep rising above it and it won't

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.910 
just keep rising above it and it won't
ever<00:03:39.299> suffocate<00:03:39.900> them<00:03:40.079> so<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.319> have<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.620> have

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
ever suffocate them so you have to have

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.620 
ever suffocate them so you have to have
the<00:03:42.019> quicksand<00:03:43.019> being<00:03:43.380> one<00:03:44.130> brick<00:03:44.519> two<00:03:45.420> bricks

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
the quicksand being one brick two bricks

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.270 
the quicksand being one brick two bricks
high<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.880> way<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.900> will<00:03:49.200> suffocate<00:03:49.769> them<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
high that way it will suffocate them the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.460 
high that way it will suffocate them the
second<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.790> try<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.540> second<00:03:51.840> they<00:03:51.959> spawn<00:03:52.230> it

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
second a try the second they spawn it

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.830 
second a try the second they spawn it
will<00:03:52.560> speak<00:03:52.799> in<00:03:52.950> suffocating<00:03:53.549> law<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
will speak in suffocating law and the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.610 
will speak in suffocating law and the
reason<00:03:55.139> for<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.380> roof<00:03:55.530> over<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.130> top<00:03:57.319> yeah<00:03:58.319> I

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
reason for the roof over the top yeah I

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.940 
reason for the roof over the top yeah I
just<00:03:58.799> let<00:03:58.980> me<00:03:59.069> finish<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.519> here

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.080 

oh<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.670> pump<00:04:02.880> guts<00:04:03.180> um<00:04:04.340> yes<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.670> reason<00:04:05.970> why

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
oh you pump guts um yes the reason why

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.930 
oh you pump guts um yes the reason why
we<00:04:06.239> have<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.630> roof<00:04:06.959> over<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.440> top<00:04:07.739> is<00:04:08.400> because

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
we have the roof over the top is because

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.880 
we have the roof over the top is because
Enderman<00:04:09.510> when<00:04:09.840> they're<00:04:10.020> in<00:04:10.110> quicksand<00:04:10.500> will

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
Enderman when they're in quicksand will

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.180 
Enderman when they're in quicksand will
like<00:04:11.730> any<00:04:11.940> mob<00:04:12.239> try<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.870> swim<00:04:13.230> up<00:04:13.410> through<00:04:13.620> it

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
like any mob try and swim up through it

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.740 
like any mob try and swim up through it
and<00:04:14.989> while<00:04:15.989> they<00:04:16.169> can't<00:04:16.440> get<00:04:16.680> out<00:04:17.329> it<00:04:18.329> still

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
and while they can't get out it still

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.390 
and while they can't get out it still
becomes<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.169> real<00:04:19.320> pain<00:04:19.620> having<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:20.010> wait<00:04:20.190> for

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
becomes a real pain having a wait for

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.330 
becomes a real pain having a wait for
them<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.519> die<00:04:20.820> because<00:04:21.150> they<00:04:21.690> don't<00:04:21.720> die

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
them to die because they don't die

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.530

enough above that it won't actually kill

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.690 
enough above that it won't actually kill
them<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.850> that<00:04:32.850> becomes<00:04:33.210> troublesome<00:04:34.639> but<00:04:35.639> I

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
them and that becomes troublesome but I

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.240 
them and that becomes troublesome but I
am<00:04:36.060> using<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.479> tier<00:04:36.750> 5<00:04:36.960> spawner<00:04:37.440> but<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.950> can

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
am using a tier 5 spawner but you can

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.310 
am using a tier 5 spawner but you can
use<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:39.870> think<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.560> is<00:04:40.710> tier<00:04:41.070> 3<00:04:41.580> spawner<00:04:41.970> is<00:04:42.320> the

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
use I think it is tier 3 spawner is the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.350 
use I think it is tier 3 spawner is the
lowest<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.950> you<00:04:44.100> can<00:04:44.310> use<00:04:44.580> because<00:04:44.790> tier<00:04:45.150> 1

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
lowest that you can use because tier 1

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.150 
lowest that you can use because tier 1
and<00:04:45.540> 2<00:04:45.660> will<00:04:45.870> not<00:04:46.020> allow<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.320> enemy<00:04:46.680> to<00:04:46.710> spawn

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.969 
and 2 will not allow the enemy to spawn
as<00:04:48.139> there<00:04:49.139> is<00:04:49.229> not<00:04:49.410> enough<00:04:49.650> space

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
as there is not enough space

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:56.480 
as there is not enough space
I<00:04:50.870> should<00:04:51.870> probably<00:04:52.110> test<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:55.310> but<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.340> do

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
I should probably test that but I do

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.400 
I should probably test that but I do
know<00:04:56.669> that<00:04:56.850> a<00:04:57.090> tier<00:04:57.360> 5<00:04:57.570> definitely<00:04:57.810> works<00:04:58.169> and

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
know that a tier 5 definitely works and

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.670 
know that a tier 5 definitely works and
a<00:04:58.470> t4<00:04:58.919> should<00:04:59.190> also<00:04:59.460> work<00:05:02.180> whoops<00:05:03.180> oh<00:05:03.510> great

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
a t4 should also work whoops oh great

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.960 
a t4 should also work whoops oh great
what's<00:05:04.860> happening<00:05:06.500> there<00:05:07.500> we<00:05:07.590> go

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
what's happening there we go

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.029 
what's happening there we go
say<00:05:08.970> you<00:05:09.030> want<00:05:09.390> to<00:05:09.479> put<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.930> spawner<00:05:10.560> I'm

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
say you want to put the spawner I'm

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.560 
say you want to put the spawner I'm
gonna<00:05:11.760> get<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:11.880> soul<00:05:12.120> KH<00:05:13.850> s11<00:05:14.850> block<00:05:15.090> off<00:05:15.300> the

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
gonna get a soul KH s11 block off the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.140 
gonna get a soul KH s11 block off the
floor<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:17.220> just<00:05:17.340> simply<00:05:17.669> grab<00:05:17.880> your

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
floor and you just simply grab your

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.520 
floor and you just simply grab your
ender<00:05:19.110> Enderman<00:05:19.830> soul<00:05:20.400> shard<00:05:20.700> and<00:05:21.360> you<00:05:22.110> put<00:05:22.440> it

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
ender Enderman soul shard and you put it

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.450 
ender Enderman soul shard and you put it
in

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.959 

and<00:05:28.460> as<00:05:29.059> you<00:05:29.240> can<00:05:29.330> see<00:05:29.389> as<00:05:30.219> they<00:05:31.219> spawn<00:05:31.550> they

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
and as you can see as they spawn they

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.179 
and as you can see as they spawn they
will<00:05:32.210> be<00:05:32.360> suffocated<00:05:33.050> it<00:05:33.259> takes<00:05:33.499> a<00:05:33.619> while<00:05:33.800> yes

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
will be suffocated it takes a while yes

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.579 
will be suffocated it takes a while yes
but<00:05:34.749> this<00:05:35.749> is<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:35.990> only<00:05:36.169> way<00:05:36.319> to<00:05:36.379> kill

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:36.589 
but this is the only way to kill

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.249 
but this is the only way to kill
Enderman<00:05:37.009> without<00:05:37.309> it's<00:05:37.490> a<00:05:38.180> teleporting<00:05:39.050> away

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
Enderman without it's a teleporting away

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.450 
Enderman without it's a teleporting away
without<00:05:41.680> no<00:05:42.680> no<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:42.889> can't<00:05:43.099> even<00:05:43.159> want<00:05:43.339> hit

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
without no no you can't even want hit

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.920 
without no no you can't even want hit
them<00:05:43.610> anymore<00:05:43.819> we<00:05:44.119> were<00:05:44.360> testing<00:05:44.719> that<00:05:44.809> one

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
them anymore we were testing that one

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.529 
them anymore we were testing that one
out<00:05:45.080> too<00:05:45.289> yes<00:05:46.069> apparently<00:05:46.430> if<00:05:46.819> you<00:05:46.999> hit<00:05:47.389> an

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
out too yes apparently if you hit an

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.279 
out too yes apparently if you hit an
Enderman<00:05:47.990> with<00:05:48.619> anything<00:05:49.779> they<00:05:50.779> teleport

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
Enderman with anything they teleport

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:59.070 
Enderman with anything they teleport
away<00:05:51.349> and<00:05:51.710> then<00:05:51.949> die<00:05:52.159> which<00:05:53.089> becomes<00:05:53.509> annoying

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.170 

so<00:06:00.080> there<00:06:00.379> you<00:06:00.469> have<00:06:00.499> it<00:06:00.709> there's<00:06:01.129> an<00:06:01.669> Enderman

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
so there you have it there's an Enderman

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.769 
so there you have it there's an Enderman
trap<00:06:02.479> that<00:06:02.990> is<00:06:04.119> well<00:06:05.119> I<00:06:05.149> wouldn't<00:06:05.449> say<00:06:05.569> perfect

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
trap that is well I wouldn't say perfect

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.439 
trap that is well I wouldn't say perfect
as<00:06:06.289> there<00:06:07.069> could<00:06:07.369> probably<00:06:07.759> room<00:06:08.240> for

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
as there could probably room for

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.929 
as there could probably room for
improvement<00:06:09.050> but<00:06:09.619> this<00:06:09.770> can<00:06:09.979> be<00:06:10.009> used<00:06:10.249> for<00:06:10.369> any

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
improvement but this can be used for any

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.320 
improvement but this can be used for any
mom<00:06:11.599> not<00:06:11.809> just<00:06:11.839> Enderman<00:06:12.969> but<00:06:13.969> if<00:06:14.089> you<00:06:14.149> want<00:06:14.270> to

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
mom not just Enderman but if you want to

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.070 
mom not just Enderman but if you want to
use<00:06:14.419> it<00:06:14.569> for<00:06:14.599> any<00:06:14.869> other<00:06:14.930> mob<00:06:15.259> the<00:06:17.080> quicksand

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
use it for any other mob the quicksand

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.929 
use it for any other mob the quicksand
here<00:06:18.229> has<00:06:18.529> to<00:06:18.709> go<00:06:18.740> one<00:06:19.099> block<00:06:19.279> further<00:06:19.610> down

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:19.939 
here has to go one block further down

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.519 
here has to go one block further down
otherwise<00:06:20.389> it<00:06:20.599> won't<00:06:20.719> suffocate<00:06:21.139> the<00:06:21.409> other

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:21.529 
otherwise it won't suffocate the other

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.790 
otherwise it won't suffocate the other
mob<00:06:21.800> they<00:06:22.669> will<00:06:22.879> just<00:06:23.119> spawn<00:06:23.689> in<00:06:23.930> and<00:06:24.169> stand

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
mob they will just spawn in and stand

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.010 
mob they will just spawn in and stand
there<00:06:24.979> like<00:06:25.099> idiots<00:06:27.099> so<00:06:28.099> there<00:06:28.939> you<00:06:29.059> have<00:06:29.089> it

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
there like idiots so there you have it

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.449 
there like idiots so there you have it
if<00:06:30.349> anybody<00:06:30.770> can<00:06:30.919> come<00:06:31.009> up<00:06:31.159> with<00:06:31.189> any

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:33.459 
if anybody can come up with any

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:36.040 
if anybody can come up with any
reasonable<00:06:34.459> upgrades<00:06:35.269> to<00:06:35.539> it<00:06:35.689> that<00:06:35.839> might

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
reasonable upgrades to it that might

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.699 
reasonable upgrades to it that might
make<00:06:36.229> it<00:06:36.259> more<00:06:36.409> efficient<00:06:37.039> or<00:06:37.870> faster<00:06:38.870> you<00:06:39.589> can

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:39.709 
make it more efficient or faster you can

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:43.179 
make it more efficient or faster you can
also<00:06:39.830> get<00:06:39.979> little<00:06:40.219> golems<00:06:40.610> or<00:06:42.069> transposes<00:06:43.069> or

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 
also get little golems or transposes or

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:44.499 
also get little golems or transposes or
something<00:06:43.519> in<00:06:43.610> here<00:06:43.789> to<00:06:43.909> pick<00:06:44.059> up<00:06:44.240> all<00:06:44.389> these

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
something in here to pick up all these

if you walk in there without being in
creative<00:06:49.729> mode<00:06:49.759> they<00:06:50.120> will<00:06:50.509> attack<00:06:50.839> you<00:06:50.959> even

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
creative mode they will attack you even

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.879
