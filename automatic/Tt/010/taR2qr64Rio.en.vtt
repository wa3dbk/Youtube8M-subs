00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
carburetor problems due to the fact that

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.450 
carburetor problems due to the fact that
it's<00:00:31.910> 26<00:00:32.910> Fahrenheit<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:33.989> anyway<00:00:34.350> gives<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
it's 26 Fahrenheit but anyway gives you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.020 
it's 26 Fahrenheit but anyway gives you
an<00:00:35.520> idea<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> sound<00:00:36.510> like

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
an idea what it's going to sound like

00:00:38.030 --> 00:01:07.570 
an idea what it's going to sound like
okay<00:00:40.399> right<00:00:41.399> now<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.579> run<00:00:41.850> here

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.190

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
thinking if I keep making runs like that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
thinking if I keep making runs like that
the<00:01:10.440> neighbors<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> phone<00:01:11.490> 9-1-1
