00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
this video inter I'm going to start off

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:58.989 
this video inter I'm going to start off
with<00:00:57.710> talking<00:00:58.070> about<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.280> design<00:00:58.609> because<00:00:58.940> I

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
with talking about the design because I

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:00.549 
with talking about the design because I
think<00:00:59.210> that's<00:00:59.359> very<00:00:59.420> important<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.260> that's

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
think that's very important and that's

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.979 
think that's very important and that's
one<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.070> reasons<00:01:01.429> this<00:01:02.420> smartphone<00:01:02.719> is

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
one of the reasons this smartphone is

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.280 
one of the reasons this smartphone is
different<00:01:03.379> than<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:03.769> HTC<00:01:04.460> One<00:01:04.670> m8<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:05.269> like<00:01:06.200> I

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
different than the HTC One m8 so like I

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.470 
different than the HTC One m8 so like I
said<00:01:06.350> it's<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.130> basically<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.700> plastic

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
said it's it's basically a plastic

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.310 
said it's it's basically a plastic
version<00:01:09.380> of<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:10.040> HTC<00:01:10.220> One<00:01:11.120> m8<00:01:11.660> there's<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.050> lot

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
version of the HTC One m8 there's a lot

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.440 
version of the HTC One m8 there's a lot
of<00:01:12.350> similarities<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.430> design<00:01:13.790> but<00:01:14.330> it's

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
of similarities in the design but it's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.750 
of similarities in the design but it's
also<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:15.260> design<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:15.710> think<00:01:15.920> it's<00:01:16.280> also<00:01:16.430> based

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
also the design I think it's also based

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.660 
also the design I think it's also based
off<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.300> design<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.840> HTC<00:01:18.500> one<00:01:18.770> m7<00:01:19.070> which

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
off the design of the HTC one m7 which

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.540 
off the design of the HTC one m7 which
is<00:01:19.820> last<00:01:20.060> year's<00:01:20.380> HTC<00:01:21.380> One<00:01:21.650> flagship<00:01:22.190> model

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
is last year's HTC One flagship model

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.640 
is last year's HTC One flagship model
and<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:23.600> can<00:01:23.750> definitely<00:01:23.810> tell<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:24.260> there's

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
and you can definitely tell that there's

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.650 
and you can definitely tell that there's
design<00:01:25.130> elements<00:01:25.550> of<00:01:25.670> both<00:01:25.880> smartphones<00:01:26.270> put

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
design elements of both smartphones put

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.200 
design elements of both smartphones put
together<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.260> this<00:01:27.410> but<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.310> plastic<00:01:28.880> and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
together in this but it is plastic and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.210 
together in this but it is plastic and
it<00:01:29.630> does<00:01:29.780> not<00:01:29.960> carry<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.500> same<00:01:30.650> aluminum

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
it does not carry the same aluminum

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.010 
it does not carry the same aluminum
unibody<00:01:31.870> feel<00:01:32.870> that<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.310> HTC<00:01:34.310> One<00:01:34.550> m8<00:01:34.970> had<00:01:35.270> so

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
unibody feel that the HTC One m8 had so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.870 
unibody feel that the HTC One m8 had so
that's<00:01:36.500> one<00:01:36.860> major<00:01:37.070> feature<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.790> you're

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
that's one major feature that you're

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.490 
that's one major feature that you're
going<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.120> missing<00:01:38.510> out<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:38.660> with<00:01:39.050> this<00:01:39.230> and

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
going to be missing out on with this and

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.830 
going to be missing out on with this and
another<00:01:39.710> thing<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.850> dual<00:01:41.060> camera<00:01:41.510> setup

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
another thing is a the dual camera setup

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.270 
another thing is a the dual camera setup
so<00:01:42.020> there<00:01:42.200> is<00:01:42.320> no<00:01:42.470> dual<00:01:42.650> camera<00:01:43.010> you'll<00:01:43.160> be

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
so there is no dual camera you'll be

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.430 
so there is no dual camera you'll be
getting<00:01:43.370> one<00:01:43.820> camera<00:01:44.300> however<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.230> one

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
getting one camera however that one

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.860 
getting one camera however that one
camera<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:46.070> capable<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:47.120> a<00:01:47.150> 13<00:01:47.720> megapixel

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
camera is capable is a 13 megapixel

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.530 
camera is capable is a 13 megapixel

is<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.819> device<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:49.450> design<00:02:50.080> like<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.680> said

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
is that the device is design like I said

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.699 
is that the device is design like I said
it's<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.070> mix<00:02:51.250> between<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.670> m7<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> MA<00:02:53.170> but

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
it's a mix between the m7 and the MA but

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.680 
it's a mix between the m7 and the MA but
it's<00:02:53.860> also<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.280> back<00:02:54.550> seems<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:55.090> bit<00:02:55.269> different

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690
