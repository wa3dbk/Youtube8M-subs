that<00:00:57.649> on<00:00:58.649> first<00:00:58.949> glance<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.399> might<00:00:59.520> look<00:00:59.699> ok

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that on first glance it might look ok

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
that on first glance it might look ok
but<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.840> area<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> top<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
but there's an area at the top and the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
but there's an area at the top and the
bottom<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.699> don't<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:04.229> kind<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
bottom here that don't this kind of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.310 
bottom here that don't this kind of
space<00:01:04.860> left<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:07.049> box

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
space left here that's because this box

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
space left here that's because this box
is<00:01:07.560> looking<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.130> an<00:01:08.280> exact<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:09.119> two<00:01:09.270> free

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
is looking for an exact for two free

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.399 
is looking for an exact for two free
ratio<00:01:10.020> image<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.580> saved<00:01:12.290> 800<00:01:13.290> x

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
ratio image so one that's saved 800 x

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.780 
ratio image so one that's saved 800 x
600<00:01:13.770> pixels<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.760> 1024<00:01:15.659> x<00:01:15.869> 768<00:01:16.560> pixels<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.369> this

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
600 pixels or 1024 x 768 pixels and this

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.490 
600 pixels or 1024 x 768 pixels and this
image<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.270> notebook<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:19.259> slightly

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
image in notebook is actually slightly

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.560 
image in notebook is actually slightly
smaller<00:01:19.979> than<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.549> i<00:01:20.610> need<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.909> change<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
smaller than that so i need to change it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.740 
smaller than that so i need to change it
to<00:01:22.140> make<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> fit<00:01:22.759> now<00:01:23.759> depending<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.450> their

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
to make it fit now depending on their

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.469 
to make it fit now depending on their
