close the door you need to hold the
button<00:02:57.220> down<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.720> will<00:02:58.720> demonstrate<00:02:58.870> that<00:03:00.150> open

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
button down I will demonstrate that open

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.509 
button down I will demonstrate that open
it<00:03:01.239> up<00:03:01.389> I<00:03:01.660> don't<00:03:02.590> need<00:03:02.799> to<00:03:02.859> hold<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.220> go<00:03:03.340> up

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
it up I don't need to hold it to go up

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.180 
it up I don't need to hold it to go up
just<00:03:03.549> four<00:03:04.209> down

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
just four down

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.660 
just four down
just<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.150> safety<00:03:06.390> thing<00:03:07.190> I'm<00:03:08.190> surprised

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
just like a safety thing I'm surprised

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.780 
just like a safety thing I'm surprised
at<00:03:08.910> how<00:03:09.030> quiet<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.570> unit<00:03:09.870> actually<00:03:09.990> is<00:03:10.790> there

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
at how quiet this unit actually is there

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.700 
at how quiet this unit actually is there
we<00:03:11.910> go<00:03:12.030> if<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.300> just<00:03:12.540> click<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> button<00:03:12.930> once

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.740 

that's<00:03:16.710> what<00:03:16.800> happens<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:18.300> got<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.540> hold<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
that's what happens you got to hold the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.470 
that's what happens you got to hold the
button<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:20.310> get<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.550> go<00:03:20.670> down

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.729 

and<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:26.500> know<00:03:26.620> that's<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.069> rail<00:03:27.310> again<00:03:28.739> once

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
and you know that's the rail again once

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:30.720 
and you know that's the rail again once
it<00:03:29.830> gets<00:03:29.950> all<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.099> way<00:03:30.190> done<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.430> can<00:03:30.550> close

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
it gets all the way done you can close

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.570 
it gets all the way done you can close

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
it but for the OneTouch close you've got

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.180 
it but for the OneTouch close you've got
to<00:03:33.700> have<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:34.030> number<00:03:34.330> four<00:03:34.540> dip<00:03:34.720> switch<00:03:34.930> up

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
to have that number four dip switch up

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.800 
to have that number four dip switch up
so<00:03:36.190> yeah<00:03:37.950> here's<00:03:38.950> your<00:03:39.040> forest<00:03:39.430> setting<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
so yeah here's your forest setting the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.140 
so yeah here's your forest setting the
clutch<00:03:41.140> is<00:03:41.739> actually<00:03:42.280> how<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:42.520> works<00:03:42.760> maybe

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
clutch is actually how this works maybe

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150 
clutch is actually how this works maybe
I'll<00:03:43.989> take<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:44.200> off<00:03:44.470> into<00:03:44.709> another<00:03:44.770> video

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
I'll take this off into another video

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.920 
I'll take this off into another video
the<00:03:45.580> vacation<00:03:46.090> switch<00:03:46.330> is<00:03:46.480> actually<00:03:46.780> right

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
the vacation switch is actually right

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.380 
the vacation switch is actually right
here<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:48.100> cuts<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.670> power<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:49.150> everything

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
here that cuts the power to everything

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.360 
here that cuts the power to everything
so<00:03:49.900> like<00:03:50.110> if<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.410> go<00:03:50.650> click<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.040> button<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.280> the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
so like if I go click the button on the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.940 
so like if I go click the button on the
remote

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
remote

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.830 
remote
nothing<00:03:53.950> I<00:03:54.190> don't<00:03:54.670> think<00:03:55.150> it'll<00:03:55.300> even<00:03:55.480> respond

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
nothing I don't think it'll even respond

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.740 
nothing I don't think it'll even respond
to<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:55.989> wall<00:03:56.140> consoles<00:03:57.390> nope

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
to the wall consoles nope

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.240 
to the wall consoles nope
so<00:03:59.680> that's<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.310> vacation<00:04:00.850> switch<00:04:01.120> there<00:04:02.250> you

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
so that's the vacation switch there you

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.229 
so that's the vacation switch there you
know<00:04:03.370> like<00:04:03.580> like<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.360> said<00:04:04.569> to<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.810> light<00:04:05.080> and

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
know like like I said to the light and

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.210 
know like like I said to the light and
if<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.510> forest<00:04:07.959> setting<00:04:08.230> goes<00:04:08.590> off<00:04:08.799> the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
if the forest setting goes off the

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.670 
if the forest setting goes off the
lights<00:04:09.430> will<00:04:09.640> blink<00:04:09.760> forever<00:04:10.650> what<00:04:11.650> I

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
lights will blink forever what I

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.630 
lights will blink forever what I
demonstrate<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.690> 50<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.780> course<00:04:14.049> more

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
demonstrate that 50 of course more

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.010 
demonstrate that 50 of course more
you<00:04:16.630> know<00:04:16.750> just<00:04:17.440> down<00:04:21.600> all<00:04:22.600> right<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:22.930> would

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
you know just down all right this would

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.900 
you know just down all right this would
be<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.230> last<00:04:23.440> run<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.400> rails<00:04:24.580> probably

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
be the last run so the rails probably

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:33.570 
be the last run so the rails probably
gonna<00:04:25.000> explode<00:04:25.360> any<00:04:25.540> second<00:04:26.880> here<00:04:27.880> we<00:04:27.970> go<00:04:32.580> you

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
gonna explode any second here we go you

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.470 
gonna explode any second here we go you
can<00:04:33.730> see<00:04:33.940> this<00:04:34.150> thing<00:04:34.330> blinks<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:36.820> ill<00:04:37.090> blink

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
can see this thing blinks it ill blink

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.330 
can see this thing blinks it ill blink
forever<00:04:37.990> until<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.470> hit<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.710> button<00:04:38.980> next
