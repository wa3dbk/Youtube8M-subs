00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.529
 download and install the elder scrolls v 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.320
 skyrim 5 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.960
 I have been here right game he so then 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.189
 You're going to need two programs. 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.760
 is the daemon tools are daemon all 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.650
 You'll use it to emulate the game. 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.000
 then it has to be the light version that the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.469
 free version 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.530
 then link is in the description of the video 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.620
 you are low and he is there normally and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.570
 bittorrent or torrent or subtitle 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.789
 Because I think faster. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.170
 only you can use the tone and also 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.329

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.950
 click to download and install the two and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.199
 people already have the two programs 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.610
 People are going to need us, we're going 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.160
 after you've downloaded btoy you're going 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.960
 coupling of the sport in this site here that I 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.320
 I'll leave it in the video description. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.880
 the game has 5.12 gb to that you use is 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.409
 after you've installed chronic you 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.290
 will hitch tanks 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.900
 iac will appear here if you use 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.200
 chrome them and click on start the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.150
 application and then it will appear in the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.939
 bittorrent in torrent I think not 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.460
 appears in the media do not let it go here 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.619
 appear the way outta where the game 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.270
 go after you installed it, I'll go 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.619
 put here in the case on the desktop 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.470
 on the desktop only I already have 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.240
 then there will appear by that name she 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.540
 will appear by the name you downloaded 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.450
 that elder scrolls v block skyrim goes 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.720
 appear to survive only here that goes 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.430
 appears the contents of the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.549
 bakery folder is downloading 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.680
 So you do not change anything here, it's here. 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.170
 You change the way alone and here 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.659
 brother does not mark anything from ok 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.990
 and then it will start to download personal look 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.270
 delay is learning this internet is the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.450
 It takes a lot of time, I do not know. 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.810
 but then after you've downloaded it is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.250
 Only you open I'm going to delete here. 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.170
 the internet will get older than her 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:24.239
 already is but once downloaded is okay you will 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.489
 where you put it to download and there it goes 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:32.370
 this folder appears here 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.730
 r the rgr and such appear two files one 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.860
 here are people will not use the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.200
 system information and another is the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.900
 image file with what this one 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.600
 It's the biggest one we'll use. 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.470
 so there you go and open your daemon 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.799
 tools 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.690
 after you installed it yours 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.600
 I'm not sure you do not 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.790
 will show up here because it might be 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.690
 the first time you are using 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.739
 then it will not open anything is then 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:09.000
 You're going to have to take the picture is a 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.360
 a device to show with you 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.040
 so you're going to add a 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.180
 virtual drive detect is not the ss is of 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.030
 t 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.790
 then it will trigger the device and as 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.100
 if there was a drive here here in 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.130
 add image and then you will search 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.370
 the file you downloaded this image from 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.410
 to you click open and it will appear 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.239
 so here you already have to the 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.810
 game information here you give two 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.900
 clicks and there it will be as if you 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.940
 had placed a cd on your computer 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.889
 can not close the tozzo daemon and will 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.810
 appear and executed the installer and 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.470
 open the folder to view files you 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.260
 will run the installer and there goes 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.750
 appear so here you click 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.730

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.290
 paste your affection 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.750
 I will not be there because it will not 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.549
 give problem in the middle that already has more 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.090
 basically this is after you 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.920
 installed will appear a folder is with 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.319
 the caresses is that you can not click 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.160
 in it we still can not play now 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.810
 the game're not then is cracked 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.299
 After that, what are you going to do? 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.300
 installed six faces 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.060
 there you found the program snake or 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.919
 in the place that you are students and I already 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.949

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:42.300
 with both of them and that is already in the law 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.669

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.370
