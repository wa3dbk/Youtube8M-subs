00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.330
 and then people tibet beauty serve bringing 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.519
 a test on gtx 550 ti with the game is a 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.519
 3 At Play in So Beautiful 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.580
 size of the map that it has and very realistic 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.800
 a very realistic war game 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.369
 so gtx is making it beautiful that it did 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.080
 the game 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.400
 I will not say that you can call all the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.160
 options to show you but so 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.070
 gives to play to play gives and gives to play 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 well and be satisfied with graphing or 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.960
 texture very high objects high ground 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.280
 High shade high as incredible as it sounds 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.530
 particles that cloud pattern let 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.379
 high this pixel to pixel leave very 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.559
 High pattern that is tall 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.789
 so far the detainee was even 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 leaving 1366 by 768 which is the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.649
 standard resolution and here I have already 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.350
 filters proof is very heavy 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.510
 gives to enable more fps drops below 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.270
 30 so it's not very interesting 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 UECE is essential to leave very oua 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.150
 high but gives to us left in the high 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.580
 I paid a little ips and that's fine. 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.980
 the game is running cool can come has 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.920
 enough character here together the map 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.990
 open graffiti beautiful clouds are 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.900
 very cool very cool because all 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.750
 haunts the light 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.370
 I think it's really cool, this is just it. 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.340
 so I did not have time to play this game 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.320
 so I have no idea how 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.780
 do to this 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.260
 I know it's very difficult for the guys 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.630
 so is the combat is very far is how 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.660
 really should be that thing of a 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.640
 call of duty severin meeting ky 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.610
 rifle expectation 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.130
 It's one thing, but let's just say 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.390
 so do not 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.050
 so the game is running cool you guys 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.550
 can always see the average of 30 fps 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.960
 Of course you can not say too much. 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.229
 asking that there be above 30 40 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.350
 fps that really is complicated this to 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.690
 this board or two games like that me 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.820
 in that quantity of the species 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.239
 but let's see if I can do it 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:25.890
 something that we have to 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.890
 catching the day will stay here 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.020
 Over my motherfucking motherfucker, I'll do it. 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.020
 a shit already 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:01.990
 looks to face her face in her head 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:06.740
 because I'll try to see it too 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:12.260
 do something fucking shot down a 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:14.030
 airplane to the chart is very cool 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.630
 I need to learn how to play this. 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.920
 seems very interesting to remember that 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.050
 This is a mission I'm doing. 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:27.230
 on the single player even if the team is 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:29.570
 much for them here will be 30 already I do not 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:37.660
 I'm seeing these guys, man. Remember that. 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:37.660
 God is trading a fungus since I found 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.270
 this internet of 10 more 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:07.320
 samira moves a lot 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:17.430
 I think I already killed the lady, she's going to stop. 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:23.850
 will attack and I will not admit it 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:25.710
 This game was gonna go upstairs and see if it came. 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.190
 anything 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.190
 Where's the man? 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:37.169
 the bands have already killed repeaters 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:44.189
 that the key to the 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:45.210
 our ours ours ours died is without 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:49.530
 chance 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.219
 You can not play here without training. 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.960
 it 's really 100% funk rock 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:57.300
 to see the guys will pass me 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.979
 Good, I particularly think so. 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.479
 Interestingly, this time we 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.729
 You have to learn to play for up to 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.080
 like the game it is because we get only 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.080
 playing moment you will not like the 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.060
 truth game but anyway this is you 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.449
 can see that it does not consume much of the 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.099
 plate processing cores 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.219
 It was also cool, the temperature 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:20.340
 despite the drama forced to go on 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:23.250
 settings it did well when not 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.259
 is satisfied oil also had a 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.240
 airplane falling explosion so no 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.039
 I thought it was cool. 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.439
 in this matter we are holding 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.210
 I hope you have enjoyed yourself 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.039
 They liked to let liquidity that 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.379
 sign up and participate in the draw that 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:41.389
 will have been signed up and it is 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.389
 That's when I said it and went
