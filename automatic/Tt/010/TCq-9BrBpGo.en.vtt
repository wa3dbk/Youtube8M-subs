00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.509
 signature of an agreement for 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.639

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.019
 entrepreneur thick wessels and mayor

 the elders of enschede put one 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.530
 signature in the middle of the runway for 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.910
 diesfeldt house 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.279
 You were there in the middle of that runway 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.480
 was there a party today 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.460
 they do become a best level 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.750
 that very festive character and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.580
 top entrepreneurs from the province 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.500
 overijssel were present at the top 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.910
 of provincial politics 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.560
 they have the county's college 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.000
 hengelo enschede oldenzaal that were 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.109
 all present to show anyway 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.160
 that they have the best for that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.050
 airport 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 u see wessels now left and peering and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.850
 sign east concession agreements 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.829
 which gives wessels the right to 49 years 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.239
 make use of the terrain 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.649
 but everything first to make money a lot of money 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.809
 millions of millions but how many 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.460
 yes i think there is one but today already 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.829
 once before fruit I think there 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.840
 that makes sense than to tell you was 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.100
 both become known once but not 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.780
 today 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 because I also want the other one 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 partners who will later in here 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.339
 Participate 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.979
 I have to mention them and they are 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.420
 not known today because the will be 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.860
 said so many hundred thousand 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.479
 passengers needed to make it profitable 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.189
 get to know you a bit like 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.360
 entrepreneur should be how much you 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.250
 investments have now let it 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.860
 leave it to experts to not 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.780
 everyone who god how much party sissing 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.610
 Need I think he thereafter 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.030
 The calculation is that most are not a full 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.439
 and so we don't go there so f5 we 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.880
 must therefore be left to experts 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.990
 but let them take a chance now 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.689
 maurice there are still problems 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.220
 well not that much actually on it 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.110
 politically, all the lights resemble 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.790
 vegetables are set and so can the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.350
 figures travo who can go the farther 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.700
 You must try to meet a lot of people 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.140
 to get to that area they go 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.759
 in the form of an amusement park 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.090
 an educational park party should 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.950
 come 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.390
 but before everyone is there must 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.100
 of course you will have infrastructure 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.810
 you must build roads to people and 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.229
 to bring me in and to leave again 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.310
 lead 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.020
 but Mr. Wessels has the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.729
 solution for now 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.340
 so many roads we think of 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.340
 I think that mainly from 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.190
 the investment are the buildings and the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.080
 parking that you must have 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.580
 I think that's the biggest 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.290
 investments you bet on a branch 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.510
 from the a1 I think 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.799
 yes but that is agreed to in 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.319
 covenant 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.660
 just say that this comes and they hope 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.010
 my opening tool shows him that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.260
 is nevertheless an advantage if you have such 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.540
 straight from the a1 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.430
 here you can also go back 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.110
 come on what is there now left 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.280
 spoken because oh what yes hears 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.480
 actually at the airport 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.099
 it was actually the talk of this 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.049
 moment nobody wanted for camera 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.910
 respond to the bankruptcy of van 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.590
 about where both the entrepreneurs is the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.670
 politics was actually talking about nothing 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.590
 different because of course there is one 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.269
 contrast a paradox in that you 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.730
 on the one hand, a concession agreement 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.500
 signs to run an airport 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.120
 and on the other hand you notice it that way 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.519
 Travel giant Feet goes a bigger one 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.930
 contrast actually does not exist 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.700
 well we are going to wait and see how it goes 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.120
 all goes further maurice thank you 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.120
 all right
