 first of all I'm going to show you a 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.179
 console that you should already know 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.189
 this console is the nintendo 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:36.899
 entertainment system this console was born 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.920
 on July 15 , 1983 in Japan and here 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.820
 in america he left on October 18 , 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.280
 1985 base managed with 8 bits and app and it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 it handled with a great revolution since 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.519
 they changed the controls as you can see 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.589
 they were the first 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.989
 they implemented the crosshead in the controls 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.079
 the two buttons and the game that you 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.760
 first connect was mario bros something that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.430
 you already know that it was demanded 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.470
 miyamoto the one who created this game as 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 can see we have here a console in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.570
 your box in perfect condition and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.240
 we have one that this console has 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.580
 been with me for a long time 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 for my first console we have some 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.670
 titles that I want to show you that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.130
 they really are very good for your 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.340
 ability that they have as the punch out 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.490
 for example we have the ninja gaiden in 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.340
 against of course and some others that 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.800
 they also marked the way 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.840
 video game 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.240
 This is the first console my 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.120
 collection I want to show you equal 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.470
 way the next that as you what 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.890
 can see is the super nintendo this 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.580
 super nintendo console came out on 21 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.330
 November 1990 in Japan and the 13th 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.620
 August of 1991 in america here 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.390
 handled with 16 bits and well what very 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.000
 good that I had this console is that 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.340
 they changed the controls here it was already handled 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.310
 in 6 buttons and we have the possibility of 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.250
 play then some titles that already 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.070
 we can see in arcade how can be the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.990
 street fighter the killer instinct by 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.950
 example the final fight these are also 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.500
 a collection that I have of cartridges 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.660
 the next console that I want 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.010
 show him 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.879
 the nintendo 64 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.409
 this nintendo came out on June 23, 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:42.840
 1996 in Japan and on September 29, 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.159
 1996 in america here revolution and 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.200
 nintendo because we already had the 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.900
 possibility to connect 4 commands to the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.610
 time it was very useful since in some 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.480
 games so if you could have fun 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.610
 too much with this type of peripherals 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.769
 Now also changed the 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.299
 controls as you can see it was added 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.170
 a mix a exit pardon to analogous with the 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.190
 which could we handle some games 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.519
 we have the same way in the collection 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.970
 some of the titles that have most 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.590
 liked as you can see here this is the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.069
 I liked the most of all, which is the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.459
 zelda ocarina of time and good all 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.440
 consoles that you can see at the time 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.810
 they work and they are in perfect 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.269
 conditions also here implemented 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.879
 the rumble pack that this was to have you 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.410
 have a sense of movement in the 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.020
 control 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.170
 and the first memory cards that 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.850
 are the embera tripod and the next 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.720
 console that I want to show you 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:50.710
 the game and the game club came out on 14 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.620
 September 2001 in Japan and the 18th 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.840
 November 2001 in america here 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.650
 I change an attempt because they have already started 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.560
 have the cedÃ© format that would be micro cd 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.780
 in this case they have the 4 ports for 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.480
 the control we already have his house also 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.190
 they changed the controls and we have 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.610
 some titles that have also 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.020
 liked a lot 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.020
 those who can see here 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:23.070
 we continue with the next one with console the 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.410
 next console came out is that is 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.170
 after the win that everyone already owes 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.360
 know this console came out on 19 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.080

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.030
 December 2006 in america this 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.040
 console also changed the controls 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.920
 we have the possibility of now playing 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.770
 with infrared which the movement of 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.720
 each of these controls makes that 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.630
 effectively move the character that 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.880
 we are driving we have the possibility 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.670
 of also having a flyer for 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.930
 there we have our flyer and some 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.270
 titles that I also liked 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.270
 too much like donkey kong country 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.960
 returns as the new super mariobros 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.700
 min 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.330
 mario kart that we have it from that side 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.290
 also and good here we have these 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.290
 titles too 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.950
 and other consoles that I want to show you 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.740
 also that they are no longer in the range 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.039
 Nintendo 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.370
 are the playstation and playstation what 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.620
 we have on this side how can you see the 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.280
 first playstation 1 which can 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.569
 see in between came out on December 3 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:34.419
 1994 in Japan and September 9 , 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.940
 1995 in america this also already 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.030
 revolutionized quite a bit since it was 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.009
 they put two sticks and analogs in the 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.380
 control we had the possibility of 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:48.639
 save our games also in the 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.800
 memory card we have your formats 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.650
 They were also decided although they took a 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.810
 little in loading were very good in their 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.800
 time this console was not so powerful 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.830
 like the nintendo 64 because it was handled 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.650
 with 32 bits but still had a lot 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.310
 success since we had the feeling of 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.139
 buy something high definition 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.940
 right away we also had the possibility 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:17.689
 to have play 2 this one is this 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.180
 console 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:24.210
 on March 4, 2000 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.229
 and this was in Japan and on October 26 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:31.259
 of the same year of 2000 in america here 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:34.080
 this console really started to change 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.900
 all because we had the possibility of 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.570
 already have better games better 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.250
 graphs we have some here by 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.340
 example the dance mat that also 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.860
 we have some games like him 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.849
 way in which we can find 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.659
 several titles 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:54.459
 that really seem very good to me 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:57.479
 same way here we have some games 

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:57.479
 that are from play 1 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.200
 and finally I'm going to show you one of 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.650
 the consoles that I could not acquire in their 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:13.010
 moment but in this new version of 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.560
 this console that is the megadrive sega or 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.110
 sega genesis as we knew it here in 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.150
 america this console also has 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.940
 many games that are that were very 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.280
