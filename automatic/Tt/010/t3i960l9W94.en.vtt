team<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.930> big<00:00:49.320> moments<00:00:49.500> throughout<00:00:50.280> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
team in big moments throughout this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
team in big moments throughout this
season<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.750> because<00:00:51.899> he<00:00:52.140> had<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.559> game

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
season so just because he had one game

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.319 
season so just because he had one game
where<00:00:53.010> he<00:00:53.039> missed<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> few<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> them<00:00:53.820> doesn't

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
where he missed a few of them doesn't

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
where he missed a few of them doesn't
mean<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.719> should<00:00:54.899> jump<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.260> top<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.620> now<00:00:55.860> we're

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
would have to be Atlantis Paul Millsap

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.800 
would have to be Atlantis Paul Millsap
he<00:01:15.479> had<00:01:15.600> 34<00:01:16.080> points<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.740> 15<00:01:17.610> rebounds<00:01:17.640> why<00:01:18.630> was

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
he so dominant in today's game well I
was<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> bit<00:01:21.030> surprised<00:01:21.360> by<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.840> told<00:01:22.200> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
was a bit surprised by that I told you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.230 
was a bit surprised by that I told you
before<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.950> game<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.700> thought<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
before this game that I thought the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.340 
before this game that I thought the
Celtics<00:01:24.600> were<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> teams<00:01:25.200> have

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
Celtics were one of the teams have

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.719 
Celtics were one of the teams have
matched<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.950> well<00:01:26.220> with<00:01:26.430> him<00:01:26.580> because

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
matched up really well with him because

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
matched up really well with him because
Brandon<00:01:27.240> Bass<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.689> him<00:01:28.200> pretty<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.650> have

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
Brandon Bass and him pretty much have

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.870 
Brandon Bass and him pretty much have
the<00:01:28.860> same<00:01:28.950> body<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> same<00:01:29.729> athletic

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the same body the same athletic

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.060 
the same body the same athletic
abilities<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:31.170> Brandon<00:01:31.500> Bass<00:01:31.619> didn't<00:01:31.890> play

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
abilities but Brandon Bass didn't play

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.530 
abilities but Brandon Bass didn't play
that<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:32.640> Boston<00:01:32.970> starters

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
that much because Boston starters

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
that much because Boston starters
weren't<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> floor<00:01:34.229> very<00:01:34.770> much<00:01:34.920> this

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
weren't on the floor very much this

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.679 
weren't on the floor very much this
afternoon<00:01:35.970> because<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.329> didn't<00:01:36.540> play<00:01:36.659> that

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
afternoon because they didn't play that

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.660 
afternoon because they didn't play that
well<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> group<00:01:37.470> Brad<00:01:38.009> Stevens<00:01:38.369> went<00:01:38.549> with

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
well as a group Brad Stevens went with

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
well as a group Brad Stevens went with
the<00:01:38.729> second<00:01:39.090> unit<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.570> most<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> game<00:01:40.049> but

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the second unit for most of the game but

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.050 
the second unit for most of the game but
I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:41.070> that's<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> reasons<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
I think that's one of the reasons that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.389 
I think that's one of the reasons that
Millsap<00:01:42.600> had<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> great<00:01:43.560> performance<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
Millsap had a great performance and the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.859 
Millsap had a great performance and the
other<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.759> because<00:01:45.149> he's<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.720> good

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
other is just because he's a really good

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
other is just because he's a really good
player<00:01:45.990> he<00:01:46.290> does<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> lot<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.829> things<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.250> he

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
player he does a lot of things well he

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.460 
player he does a lot of things well he
shoots<00:01:48.000> well<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> perimeter<00:01:48.720> he<00:01:49.290> knows

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
think they knew that they had to bring

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.400 
think they knew that they had to bring
it<00:02:19.120> because<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.510> starters<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:20.110> didn't<00:02:20.350> play

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
it because the starters just didn't play

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.200 
it because the starters just didn't play
well<00:02:20.650> today<00:02:20.860> they<00:02:21.460> knew<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.670> when<00:02:21.880> they<00:02:21.940> came
