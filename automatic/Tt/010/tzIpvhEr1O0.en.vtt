00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 that I bring you a video here super 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.660
 quick to mention in the last 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.150
 news about the map pack the dlc 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190

 Tuesday that comes without Tuesday 29 and good 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.990
 Well, the players that we play in this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.270
 it's a 3 and I started let's see that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.699
 will wait on February 28 but this one 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.019
 what I want to say is that recently the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.939
 official page of every subtle of youtube 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.369
 a trailer called 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.170
 replay be that the bring does not show much 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.940
 about what the map pack is 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.920
 revolution we press shows some 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.399
 certain images like 14 seconds of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.170
 gameplay and well then talk about the 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.030
 new maps on the new model of 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.860
 zombies for those who did not know this 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.539
 is going to see a new zombie model a 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.010
 new map of zombies and a new weapon 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.690
 of the multiplayer so good for 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.860
 start from below I'm going here I'm going to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.350
 show some certain images of the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.360
 maps we have the grint map that is a 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.850
 It has been said that as a child it has been 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.219
 said that he's going to have let's say he's going to 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.020
 be a skating rink in the angels 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.270
 not in venice that I deform I think it is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.010
 a city in california but good this 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.220
 in the end you will make a small map going to 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.660
 have many curves 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.270
 for being a skating rink and they have said 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.680
 which is to change the style as the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.390
 players play call of duty as 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.090
 as the kind of that we're 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.710
 accustomed let's say to straight walls 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.940
 and straight corners and well they said that 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.860
 it will be a drastic change what we are 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.110
 accustomed to play we also have the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.330
 downhill map that is a resort 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.380
 ski a snow mountain where is the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.910
 First snow map to be introduced 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.140
 two whites and they said it will be 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.060
 pretty big pretty good for 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.160
 assault rifles heavy machine guns 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.260
 as well as for distance shots is 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.210
 cards obviously is snipers and 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.710
 well he has basically his cable car 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.940
 that when the ones that go up and down and if 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.410
 this one again it 's noon they 're told 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.729
 they kill you then and you can ride 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.900
 within them to go up and down the 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.150
 mountain but admitted that they are 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.369
 interactive in that sense this one also 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.680
 we will have not for you that have said 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.090
 that will be a desert temple italy the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.800
 of missions in the others vido 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.990
 previously they will be left the same 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.180
 a link on screen in the description 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.400
 those two videos but good in a temple 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.710
 a sanctuary in china is desert has 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.300
 let's say it seems to perceive many 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.970
 they believed that if in addition it would look like 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.350
 map temple of war hour but apparently 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.080
 not being so will be quite different but 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.470
 good is in a skeptical tone and for 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.510
 last we have the map to hydro she 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.100
 what I mentioned is a map are some 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.390
 facilities in pakistan has a 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.860
 stream of water flowing in the middle 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.110
 map that I quote crossings in the middle of the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.970
 mind when they are flowing the subject is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.760
 now to tell you about the new way 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.550
 of game this simply shown that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.680
 yes that gave 34 seconds to eat is a 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.750
 zombie is not much that serves I suppose 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.340
 it will be quite fun to play 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.390
 with many friends because I hope that 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.110
 can play more than four people 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.570
 because I do not know would be a lot 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.860
 2 I'm not saying it's going to be fun but 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.900
 you could take more advantage if you 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.780
 will play more than 4 people now on the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.280
 new zombie map of the rise not 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.870
 they have shown practically nothing 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.940
 they showed this millisecond image 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.950
 where you see the three characters three of 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.170
 the other characters and shooting and if 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.330
 the speed tail is set prc 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.760
 going up the elevator I do not know how it's going to 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.110
 work this I do not know if it's that 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.880
 specific advantage that will be in the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.470
 sensor I do not know if they have that as we say 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.420
 that we have within the control where 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.650
 choose what advantage you want to buy and that 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.989
 advantage that will go through the sensor 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.580
 but in the trailer that is equal it is 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.230
 I'll leave in a link 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.880
 bring in the video so that you notice 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.290
 that part of the sensor goes super fast 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.570
 so I do not know if we're going to have a time 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.580
 specific on a certain floor of the building 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.990
 where we could grab the advantages or 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.670
 is that it stops on a floor and we have to 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.790
 get to that floor to buy our 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.650
 advantages I do not know but I missed that 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.260
 and added that we say that it will give a change 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.100
 in the way of how we are 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.900
 accustomed to seeking the advantage in the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.120
 zombie mode now the most important thing that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.670
 it was read in the trailer is about the new 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.320
 pencil gun that jeep and this what 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.040
 I said earlier it's a hybrid between 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.360
 this high flash and his rifle is a new 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.560
 multiplayer weapon have confirmed that 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.880
 is going to be multiplayer that is not going to be 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.380
 of zombie good I guess you will be added 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.600
 the zombies but they have given some detail 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.550
 of this weapon have said that although not 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.890
 have the s pack even if you do not have the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.630
 revolution pack if it kills hari that 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.490
 have this weapon used in any 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.600
 You can remove it from the game mode or 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.850
 you can use it even if you do not have it 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.020
 let's say it's bought it can be 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.340
 remove obviously you can not do the 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.510
 challenges since you do not have it blocked 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.120
 but you can use it there is no 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.040
 problem with that they have also said that 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.480
 if you want to unlock the camouflage 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.200
 diamond this weapon has to have the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.390
 Golden 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.020
 obviously the diamond the other rifles 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.540
 and that if you do not have others their rifles 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.280
 in gold this one can not have this weapon 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.750
 in diamond but that this weapon is not going to 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.730
 be a requirement for others 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.390
 his rifles in diamonds I explain if 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.370
 you have the mp7 will go if you have five of the 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.810
 six your rifles in gold and you're missing 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.340
 one to get diamond you do not need 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.260
 Bring keeper pencil to diamond for 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.300
 get all the others are rifles and 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.680
 diamonds but if you need the diamond 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.120
 of the other possible to carry this 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.340
 diamond so that's how it has 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.320
 described it seems to me that the best way 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.240
 to use from processes like flashes 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.830
 now in the video they have put it with a 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.110
 white camouflage here shows them the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.820
 images 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.810
 at the beginning I thought that this will be a 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.550
 new as flash and it will come as the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.660
 tlc but then I noticed that in the 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.760
 images that have shown 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.680
 principle of this weapon is like that is the 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.810
 camouflage disarms white camouflage with 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.220
 that blue line I wish they would put it as a 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.380
 new camouflage for all weapons 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.940
 but good for now I think nothing 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.220
 more are like exclusive flash of this 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.810
 weapon and the last thing I want to mention 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.630
 leaving aside all the news with 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.690
 this dlc is that within a few 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.670
 days from I suppose that what 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.830
 will do before the new pack comes out 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.290
 of maps this always before it's 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.670
 an entity that becomes a new dlc psuv in 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.290
 an update a new patch for 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.960
 all the consoles at the same time for 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.040
 xbox playstation and pc then it looks like 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.510
 will bring what they have said that will bring 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.700
 I get many updates going to 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.280
 look for new weapons will take him down to 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.630
 other weapons so I would tell them if 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.860
 for example at this moment has a 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.420
 weapon that are going up and they like 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.650
 much for example the ms ms or the 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.800
 sub-machine guns I think they're going to lower them 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.030
 even more the pd w the mmc so if in 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.410
 this moment they are using it 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.460
 I recommend that they get to know of 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.990
 all the fields the people that take out 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.610
 separate as they have said they are going to 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.800
 download certain weapons and upload other weapons 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.480
 I hope the exception goes up to a lot of people 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.169
 he expects him to climb gunshot injuries 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.509
 It does not work 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.860
 for nothing but good said that they take out 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.539
 that patch that will fix many bugs 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.340
 they are going to fix a lot of problems that you have 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.400
 the game will go up weapons will go down 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.710
 weapons so good if they have weapons that 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.610
 they like at this moment a lot 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.740
 unlock in all challenges since 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.689
 they will probably lower it and 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.219
 last the last last thing I want them 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:26.370
 to mention is that this weekend has 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.719
 gone the experience of 25 on Friday 25 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.129
 until Monday to celebrate the pack of
