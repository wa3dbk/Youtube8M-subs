 part of this cereal will be destined to 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.989
 the international market 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.210
 lack of space for storage and 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.740
 logistics for the outflow of production are 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.400
 the main problems of the sector 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.430
 Brazilian agriculture in the country only 16% 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.190
 of producers are able to keep 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.560
 than they reaped the past two years

 South Cup invested about 100 million 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.260
 increase the capacity of 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.660
 storage today the seven units 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.950

 he is capitalizing he is capitalizing on 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.360
 gration of the product stocked and 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.690
 for this the importance of increasing the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.659
 storage capacity for service 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.020
 storage capacity offered to the 800 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.769
 of the cooperative is charged a real and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.099
 seventy cents and a fortnightly rate of 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.310
 12 cents per bag represents 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.870
 for the farmer 3% of the cost of 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.540
 production here 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.930
 according to the commercial manager the grain 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.359
 classified and standardized for later 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.109
 be marketed through guilt itself. 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.000
 your 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.219
 the producer has a safety and 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 put this product stored in our 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.510
 style 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.670
 because we can keep 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.159
 this quality of product is not 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.290
 in addition to the assurance that this product 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.780
 It will not stop being his 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.459
 The model we work on is the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.799
 producer to identify the best 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.549
 moment he is already marketing the 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.829
 product 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.310
 This made it much easier for us to 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:58.639
 cost of the freight issue of time and 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.849
 amount of trucks is the cost of 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.419
 production and that we are well 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.939
 happy with the service which has the 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:10.310
 storage requires care 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.319
 particular with regard to the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.150
 product preservation 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.260
 it is like it is a product or 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.239
 food is often human 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.060
 sometimes indirectly to 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.470
 human consumption is not of importance and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.030
 have quality products 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.049
 so for this we have a program 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.909
 Control Pest Control 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.400
 rodents and especially not 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.949
 lose because the associate left 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.109
 storable he wants to know lanuf in time 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.879
 to sell the product I will try to 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.609
 conditions of 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.699
 requires strict humidity control and 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.819
 temperature inside the bells made 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:52.699
 through periodic monitoring and 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.699
 temperature has paper in the mass of the grain 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.799
 the air inside the unit and respect 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:01.609
 with us you can see all this here 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.069
 the weight of the sector and maize also 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.169
 Not with the equipment, we can 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.319
 space to store what was collected and 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.810
 sell at the most opportune moment 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.790
 quality of grain guaranteed 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.139
 tranquility for the rural producer pays 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.380
 a charge that is normal of everything warehouse 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.259
 So you leave it there and stay there.
