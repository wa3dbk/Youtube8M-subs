something that plagues na scene but this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.450 
something that plagues na scene but this
time<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:29.640> turned<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.660> game

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
time it really it really turned the game

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.030 
time it really it really turned the game
and<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.329> having<00:00:33.540> mash<00:00:33.989> me<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> hyper

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
and so not having mash me on a hyper

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.500 
and so not having mash me on a hyper
carry<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.489> think<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.030> hurt<00:00:36.300> them<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
carry you think it really hurt them that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.000 
carry you think it really hurt them that
game<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.079> were<00:00:37.170> talking<00:00:37.200> about<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:37.829> need

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
game you were talking about they need

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.290 
game you were talking about they need
that<00:00:38.190> yeah<00:00:38.460> i<00:00:38.489> definitely<00:00:38.790> thought<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.210> were

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that yeah i definitely thought they were

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.610 
that yeah i definitely thought they were
gonna<00:00:39.420> end<00:00:39.600> up<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.140> hyper<00:00:40.350> care<00:00:40.590> i

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
gonna end up going with the hyper care i

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.540 
gonna end up going with the hyper care i
thought<00:00:40.800> they're<00:00:40.920> gonna<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> vein

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
thought they're gonna go with the vein

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
thought they're gonna go with the vein
again<00:00:41.850> i<00:00:42.059> think<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> reason<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.960> didn't<00:00:43.230> was

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
again i think the reason they didn't was

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.389 
again i think the reason they didn't was
because<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.590> were<00:00:43.649> kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.950> afraid<00:00:44.129> they

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
because they were kind of afraid they

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.799 
because they were kind of afraid they
might<00:00:44.550> run<00:00:44.789> into<00:00:44.940> two<00:00:45.180> V<00:00:45.329> two<00:00:45.360> lanes<00:00:45.629> which

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
might run into two V two lanes which

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
might run into two V two lanes which
they<00:00:45.989> did<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.200> veins<00:00:46.710> not<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.190> great<00:00:47.340> into

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
they did and veins not that great into

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.850 
they did and veins not that great into
to<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.760> too<00:00:48.230> but<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> definitely<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to be too but I definitely think that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.319 
to be too but I definitely think that
the<00:00:50.100> hyper<00:00:50.460> carry<00:00:50.730> would<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.940> benefited

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the hyper carry would have benefited

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.639 
the hyper carry would have benefited
them<00:00:51.420> more<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.960> seems<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.350> their<00:00:52.500> play

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
them more like it seems like their play

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.860 
them more like it seems like their play
style<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:53.370> best<00:00:53.969> when<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.690> hyper

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
style is best when they have that hyper

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990 
style is best when they have that hyper
carry<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> support<00:00:55.920> man<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.280> think<00:00:56.910> that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
carry with the support man I think that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
carry with the support man I think that
they'll<00:00:57.120> go<00:00:57.239> back<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.780> Game<00:00:57.899> five<00:00:58.250> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
they'll go back to this in Game five so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.520 
they'll go back to this in Game five so
what<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.270> tell<00:01:00.510> us<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:01.230> through

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.200 
what can you tell us is going through

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
embrace it um yeah it's definitely a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.490 
embrace it um yeah it's definitely a
huge<00:01:12.210> nerve-wracking<00:01:12.840> experience<00:01:12.900> because

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
huge nerve-wracking experience because

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.450 
huge nerve-wracking experience because
pretty<00:01:13.710> much<00:01:13.830> everything<00:01:14.280> they've<00:01:14.430> worked

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pretty much everything they've worked

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
pretty much everything they've worked
for<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.030> last<00:01:15.150> four<00:01:15.360> months<00:01:15.390> comes<00:01:15.780> down

for for the last four months comes down
to<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.229> game<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.790> call<00:01:18.060> black

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
to this game I think for call black

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.640 
to this game I think for call black
there<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:18.930> bit<00:01:19.049> better<00:01:19.170> mindset

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
there and a little bit better mindset

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
there and a little bit better mindset
after<00:01:20.280> winning<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.610> last<00:01:20.850> game<00:01:21.150> Chris

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.679 
or they might not actually be on till
but<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.520> something<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.360> tilts

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
but it's something that's kind of tilts

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.969 
but it's something that's kind of tilts
you<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.140> throw<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> game<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> barren

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you when you do throw a game a barren

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.260 
you when you do throw a game a barren
because<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> were<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.820> close<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
because you know you were so close to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.679 
because you know you were so close to
winning<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.130> they<00:01:32.369> might

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
winning so I think that they might

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
winning so I think that they might
perform<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.990> little<00:01:34.229> bit<00:01:34.320> worse<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.979> game

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
perform a little bit worse in this game

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.219 
perform a little bit worse in this game
because<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.850> fact<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.930> threw

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
because of the fact that they just threw

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.350 
because of the fact that they just threw
such<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> big<00:01:37.920> game<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.729> gotta<00:01:38.939> ask<00:01:39.030> her<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
such a big game and I gotta ask her is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.819 
such a big game and I gotta ask her is
the<00:01:39.479> final<00:01:39.780> question<00:01:40.200> who<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.650> think<00:01:40.680> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the final question who do you think is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.210 
the final question who do you think is
gonna<00:01:40.890> come<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.400> top<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.990> think<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
gonna come out on top I think that

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.410 
gonna come out on top I think that
although<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.490> curse<00:01:44.729> Academy<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> win

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
although I want curse Academy to win

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.630 
although I want curse Academy to win
because<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.140> obviously<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.890> though<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> lot<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
because I obviously like though a lot of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
because I obviously like though a lot of
players<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:49.020> they're<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:49.710> good<00:01:49.860> friends<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
players and they're all good friends of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
players and they're all good friends of
mine<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.640> i<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.210> call<00:01:51.360> blacks<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
mine but i think they call blacks in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.100 
mine but i think they call blacks in
better<00:01:52.200> shape<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:52.710> um<00:01:53.840> not<00:01:54.840> only<00:01:54.990> do

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
better shape right now um not only do

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.719 
better shape right now um not only do
they<00:01:55.200> blues<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.340> last<00:01:56.520> match

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
they blues like going to the last match

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.200 
they blues like going to the last match
which<00:01:56.909> hasn't<00:01:57.180> actually<00:01:57.450> mattered<00:01:57.960> yet<00:01:58.649> but

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
which hasn't actually mattered yet but

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.310 
which hasn't actually mattered yet but
theoretically<00:02:00.210> that's<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.750> advantage<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
theoretically that's an advantage and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.649 
theoretically that's an advantage and
the<00:02:02.040> fact<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:03.180> won<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> last

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the fact that they just won the last

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.120 
the fact that they just won the last
game<00:02:03.869> they<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.290> high<00:02:04.500> spirits<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.040> into

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
game they have high spirits going into

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.499 
game they have high spirits going into
this<00:02:05.310> last<00:02:05.369> match<00:02:05.759> i<00:02:05.969> think<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.360> they'll

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
this last match i think that they'll

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
this last match i think that they'll
probably<00:02:07.170> end<00:02:07.350> up<00:02:07.469> taking<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.149> alright

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
probably end up taking it alright

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.130 
probably end up taking it alright
