your abs where it doesn't feel right or

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.780 
your abs where it doesn't feel right or
if<00:00:32.070> you'll<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.700> start<00:00:32.910> pulsating<00:00:33.480> at

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
if you'll just start pulsating at

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.790 
if you'll just start pulsating at
different<00:00:35.790> periods<00:00:36.090> where<00:00:36.630> even<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.680> want

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
different periods where even if you want

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.619 
different periods where even if you want
five<00:00:38.040> mile<00:00:38.250> an<00:00:38.399> hour<00:00:38.489> maybe<00:00:38.969> thirty<00:00:39.300> mile<00:00:39.510> an

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
five mile an hour maybe thirty mile an

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.510 
five mile an hour maybe thirty mile an
hour<00:00:39.719> hitting<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> brakes<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:43.430> taking<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
hour hitting the brakes so taking the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.180 
hour hitting the brakes so taking the
actual<00:00:44.730> sensor<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:45.840> easy<00:00:46.190> but

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
actual sensor off is really easy but

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.040 
actual sensor off is really easy but
it's<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:48.149> time<00:00:48.360> consuming<00:00:48.510> just

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it's just a little time consuming just

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.900 
it's just a little time consuming just
to<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.700> take

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to get to it because you have to take

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
to get to it because you have to take
off<00:00:51.059> your<00:00:51.210> wheelie<00:00:51.600> rotor<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.410> your<00:00:52.530> caliper

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
off your wheelie rotor and your caliper

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.279 
off your wheelie rotor and your caliper
assembly<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> I'd<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> take<00:00:55.469> off<00:00:55.649> your<00:00:55.800> wheel

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
assembly so I'd you take off your wheel

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.330 
assembly so I'd you take off your wheel
your<00:00:58.289> caliper<00:00:59.629> will<00:01:00.629> sit<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.469> already

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
your caliper will sit up there I already

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.750 
your caliper will sit up there I already
took<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.699> off<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.860> take<00:01:04.860> your<00:01:04.979> rotor<00:01:05.159> off<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
took it off and take your rotor off and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.590 
took it off and take your rotor off and
sitting<00:01:06.750> down<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.790> is<00:01:08.790> where<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> actual

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
sitting down here is where the actual

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.920 
sitting down here is where the actual
sensor<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.880> now<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> screwed<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:13.409> a

the<00:02:18.340> first<00:02:19.340> socket<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.000> use<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.870> 17<00:02:21.550> that's

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
the first socket that use the 17 that's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.130 
the first socket that use the 17 that's
for<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.270> bolt<00:02:23.570> here<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:25.610> bolt<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.960> your

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
for this bolt here that bolt is on your

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.840 
for this bolt here that bolt is on your
caliper<00:02:27.770> or<00:02:28.190> your<00:02:28.670> brake<00:02:29.350> assembly<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:31.490> sits

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
caliper or your brake assembly that sits

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.220 
caliper or your brake assembly that sits
right<00:02:31.970> here<00:02:32.270> that'll<00:02:32.540> be<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> first<00:02:32.960> one<00:02:33.200> you

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
right here that'll be the first one you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.830 
right here that'll be the first one you
pull<00:02:33.470> off<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.850> take<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.180> off<00:02:35.330> take<00:02:35.630> that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
pull off so you take that off take that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.420 
pull off so you take that off take that
off<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.670> then<00:02:38.320> take<00:02:39.320> this<00:02:39.560> off<00:02:39.830> or<00:02:40.010> quick<00:02:42.430> this

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
off and then take this off or quick this

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.730 
off and then take this off or quick this
will<00:02:43.640> actually<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.090> pop<00:02:44.780> right<00:02:45.110> out<00:02:45.350> and

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
will actually just pop right out and

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.480 
will actually just pop right out and
then<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:47.720> order<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.990> get<00:02:48.170> your<00:02:48.490> caliper

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
then in order to get your caliper

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.970 
then in order to get your caliper
assembly<00:02:49.520> off<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.900> have<00:02:51.020> these<00:02:51.170> bigger<00:02:51.440> bolts

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
assembly off you have these bigger bolts

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.040 
assembly off you have these bigger bolts
that<00:02:52.700> will<00:02:52.880> actually<00:02:53.180> connect<00:02:53.480> into<00:02:53.810> this

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
that will actually connect into this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.790 
that will actually connect into this
that's<00:02:54.650> why<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:54.890> had<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.130> sitting<00:02:55.430> there<00:02:56.800> but

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
that's why I had it sitting there but

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.310 
that's why I had it sitting there but
the<00:02:58.070> caliper<00:02:58.490> bolts<00:02:58.790> here<00:02:59.030> are<00:02:59.360> 18<00:02:59.930> metric<00:03:00.350> and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
the caliper bolts here are 18 metric and

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.750 
the caliper bolts here are 18 metric and
couldn't<00:03:03.320> quite<00:03:03.500> get<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.010> off<00:03:04.160> with<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.550> the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
couldn't quite get it off with just the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.110 
couldn't quite get it off with just the
normal<00:03:05.230> socket<00:03:06.230> wrench<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.670> how<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.820> get<00:03:07.940> my

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
normal socket wrench so how to get my

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.040 
normal socket wrench so how to get my
deep<00:03:08.300> well<00:03:08.860> impact<00:03:09.860> grade<00:03:10.240> 18<00:03:11.240> metric<00:03:11.540> out<00:03:11.720> I

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
deep well impact grade 18 metric out I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.610 
deep well impact grade 18 metric out I
put<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.740> on<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.950> breaker<00:03:13.310> bar<00:03:13.490> I<00:03:14.410> use<00:03:15.410> that

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
put that on the breaker bar I use that

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.610 
put that on the breaker bar I use that
to<00:03:15.770> break<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.130> loose<00:03:16.160> because<00:03:17.290> being<00:03:18.290> here<00:03:18.530> in

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
to break it loose because being here in

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.900 
to break it loose because being here in
Michigan<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.160> freezing<00:03:19.460> cold<00:03:19.730> weather

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
Michigan in the freezing cold weather

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.730 
Michigan in the freezing cold weather
and<00:03:20.150> salt<00:03:20.420> just<00:03:20.690> kind<00:03:20.840> of<00:03:20.900> locks<00:03:21.140> up<00:03:21.410> after<00:03:21.680> a

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
and salt just kind of locks up after a

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.990 
and salt just kind of locks up after a
while

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
while

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.460 
while
so<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.360> might<00:03:23.510> need<00:03:23.600> some<00:03:23.750> extra<00:03:23.810> leverage<00:03:24.170> to

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
so you might need some extra leverage to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.760 
so you might need some extra leverage to
help<00:03:24.500> pop<00:03:24.800> it<00:03:24.980> loose<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:26.230> new<00:03:27.230> sensor<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.680> I

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
help pop it loose a new sensor that I

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.640 
help pop it loose a new sensor that I
got<00:03:27.950> sits<00:03:28.370> here<00:03:28.520> in<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.670> bag<00:03:28.850> um<00:03:29.470> looks<00:03:30.470> just

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
got sits here in the bag um looks just

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.130 
got sits here in the bag um looks just
identical<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.520> other<00:03:31.670> one<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.840> stuff

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
identical to the other one the stuff

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.220 
identical to the other one the stuff
that<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.680> use<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.340> take<00:03:34.550> that<00:03:34.700> off<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:35.780> Allens

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
that I use to take that off the Allens

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.270 
that I use to take that off the Allens
here<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.860> five<00:03:37.100> metric<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:39.040> that's<00:03:40.040> how

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
here it's a five metric and that's how

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.610 
here it's a five metric and that's how
small<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.850> bolt<00:03:41.150> is<00:03:41.360> I<00:03:41.690> showed<00:03:42.230> that<00:03:42.470> I

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
small that bolt is I showed that I

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.680 
small that bolt is I showed that I
showed<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.459> where<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.790> unscrew<00:03:44.570> it<00:03:44.600> from

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
showed you where to unscrew it from

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.750 
showed you where to unscrew it from
earlier<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:45.350> make<00:03:46.010> sure<00:03:46.130> you<00:03:46.190> don't<00:03:46.280> lose<00:03:46.550> that

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
earlier so make sure you don't lose that

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.860 
earlier so make sure you don't lose that
I<00:03:47.140> use<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.260> really<00:03:48.470> small<00:03:48.770> screwdriver<00:03:49.370> just<00:03:49.670> to

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
I use a really small screwdriver just to

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.660 
I use a really small screwdriver just to
pop<00:03:50.870> all<00:03:51.080> those<00:03:51.260> clips<00:03:51.560> off<00:03:51.740> of<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.160> frame<00:03:52.459> and

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
pop all those clips off of the frame and

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.540 
pop all those clips off of the frame and
then<00:03:53.300> that's<00:03:53.570> the<00:03:53.920> pair<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:54.950> pliers<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.490> I

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
then that's the pair of pliers that I

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.810 
then that's the pair of pliers that I
used<00:03:55.760> up<00:03:55.970> pull<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:57.190> bottom<00:03:58.190> part<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:58.459> sensor

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
used up pull the bottom part that sensor

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.320 
used up pull the bottom part that sensor
straight<00:03:59.180> out<00:03:59.300> of<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.480> hole

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
straight out of the hole

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.760 
straight out of the hole
and<00:04:02.330> then<00:04:02.450> before<00:04:02.630> you<00:04:02.780> go<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.990> do<00:04:03.200> any<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
and then before you go to do any of the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.160 
and then before you go to do any of the
work<00:04:04.450> kind<00:04:05.450> of<00:04:05.510> actually<00:04:05.750> taking<00:04:05.870> out<00:04:06.020> the

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
work kind of actually taking out the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.070 
work kind of actually taking out the
sensor<00:04:06.560> make<00:04:07.430> sure<00:04:07.580> you<00:04:07.700> take<00:04:07.940> out<00:04:08.120> your

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
sensor make sure you take out your

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.140 
sensor make sure you take out your
negative<00:04:09.709> battery<00:04:09.920> cable<00:04:10.100> you're<00:04:10.790> dealing

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
negative battery cable you're dealing

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.660 
negative battery cable you're dealing
with<00:04:11.209> a<00:04:11.300> lot<00:04:11.450> electronics<00:04:12.400> if<00:04:13.400> you're<00:04:13.550> never

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
with a lot electronics if you're never

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.199 
with a lot electronics if you're never
taking<00:04:14.300> off<00:04:14.450> your<00:04:15.220> negative<00:04:16.220> battery<00:04:17.000> cable

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
taking off your negative battery cable

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.420 
taking off your negative battery cable
before<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:19.070> just<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.810> 8<00:04:20.810> metric<00:04:21.320> wrench<00:04:22.070> or

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
before it's just a 8 metric wrench or

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.800 
before it's just a 8 metric wrench or
socket

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
a negative battery cable already got

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.530 
a negative battery cable already got
disconnected<00:04:27.410> obviously<00:04:28.150> just<00:04:29.150> take<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.450> on

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540
