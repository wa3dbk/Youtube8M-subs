00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.550 
yes indeed there are several scientific
papers<00:04:38.900> showing<00:04:39.170> that<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:41.180> skin<00:04:41.450> can<00:04:41.660> adapt

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
papers showing that the skin can adapt

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.600 
papers showing that the skin can adapt
to<00:04:43.010> sunlight<00:04:44.050> by<00:04:45.050> slowly<00:04:45.350> increasing<00:04:45.980> the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
to sunlight by slowly increasing the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.720 
to sunlight by slowly increasing the
dose<00:04:47.030> of<00:04:47.330> ultraviolet<00:04:48.290> radiation<00:04:48.520> with<00:04:49.520> some

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
dose of ultraviolet radiation with some

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.670 
dose of ultraviolet radiation with some
buds<00:04:49.940> for<00:04:50.120> example<00:04:50.540> so<00:04:51.020> there<00:04:51.320> have<00:04:51.440> been

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
buds for example so there have been

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.410 
buds for example so there have been
scientific<00:04:52.400> studies<00:04:52.730> about<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.150> as<00:04:53.300> well

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
scientific studies about this as well

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.210 
scientific studies about this as well
yes<00:04:53.600> there<00:04:53.960> are<00:04:54.080> several<00:04:54.290> scientific<00:04:54.770> studies

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
yes there are several scientific studies

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.350 
yes there are several scientific studies
we<00:04:55.370> also<00:04:55.580> paid<00:04:55.940> attention<00:04:56.300> to<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:57.140> item<00:04:57.710> and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
we also paid attention to this item and

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.550 
we also paid attention to this item and
our<00:04:59.740> results<00:05:00.740> show<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.490> controlled

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
our results show that the controlled

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.680 
our results show that the controlled
exposure<00:05:04.660> of<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.720> skin<00:05:06.290> in<00:05:06.470> tanning<00:05:06.830> salons

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
exposure of the skin in tanning salons

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.040 
exposure of the skin in tanning salons
and<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.870> was<00:05:09.020> three<00:05:09.590> times<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:10.100> week<00:05:11.050> during

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
and it was three times a week during

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.120 
and it was three times a week during
several<00:05:12.830> weeks<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:14.240> provided<00:05:14.920> slightly<00:05:15.920> more

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
several weeks it provided slightly more

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.190 
several weeks it provided slightly more
than<00:05:16.160> and<00:05:16.520> doubling<00:05:16.940> of<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.930> natural

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
than and doubling of the natural

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.500 
than and doubling of the natural
protection<00:05:18.710> mechanisms<00:05:19.430> so<00:05:19.880> this<00:05:20.060> natural

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
protection mechanisms so this natural

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.870 
protection mechanisms so this natural
reaction<00:05:20.990> actually<00:05:21.650> acts<00:05:22.040> like<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.400> sunscreen

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
reaction actually acts like a sunscreen

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.650 
reaction actually acts like a sunscreen
yeah<00:05:23.690> that's<00:05:23.930> correct<00:05:24.110> it's<00:05:24.950> a<00:05:25.510> kind<00:05:26.510> of

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
yeah that's correct it's a kind of

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.830 
yeah that's correct it's a kind of
sunscreen<00:05:27.340> natural<00:05:28.340> sunscreen<00:05:28.550> when<00:05:29.510> we

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
sunscreen natural sunscreen when we

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.070 
sunscreen natural sunscreen when we
compare<00:05:30.200> it<00:05:30.320> with<00:05:30.350> with<00:05:30.980> a<00:05:31.280> sunscreen<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:32.080> it

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
compare it with with a sunscreen is it

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.290 
compare it with with a sunscreen is it
has<00:05:33.260> had<00:05:33.440> my<00:05:33.590> advantages<00:05:34.340> because<00:05:34.610> it's<00:05:35.120> a

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
has had my advantages because it's a

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.440 
has had my advantages because it's a
waterproof<00:05:36.260> sweat<00:05:37.010> proof<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.550> it<00:05:37.970> cannot<00:05:38.270> be

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
waterproof sweat proof and it cannot be

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.080 
waterproof sweat proof and it cannot be
removed<00:05:38.660> by<00:05:39.290> towel<00:05:39.560> and<00:05:39.860> you<00:05:40.580> don't<00:05:40.820> have<00:05:40.910> to

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
removed by towel and you don't have to

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.180 
removed by towel and you don't have to
apply<00:05:41.360> it<00:05:41.419> several<00:05:42.140> times<00:05:42.320> a<00:05:42.500> day<00:05:42.530> on<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:42.919> skin

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
apply it several times a day on the skin

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.220 
apply it several times a day on the skin
how<00:05:43.490> do<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.820> processes<00:05:44.390> in<00:05:44.480> the<00:05:44.510> skin<00:05:44.810> provide

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
how do the processes in the skin provide

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.440 
how do the processes in the skin provide
this<00:05:45.440> protection<00:05:45.700> actually<00:05:46.700> it's<00:05:46.850> a<00:05:46.940> very

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
this protection actually it's a very

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.870 
this protection actually it's a very
complex<00:05:48.169> process<00:05:48.740> and<00:05:49.070> it<00:05:49.310> consists<00:05:49.820> of

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
complex process and it consists of

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.240 
complex process and it consists of
different<00:05:50.690> components<00:05:51.290> at<00:05:51.740> least<00:05:52.010> three

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
different components at least three

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.880 
different components at least three
components<00:05:52.850> the<00:05:52.970> first<00:05:53.180> is<00:05:53.390> slow<00:05:54.169> buildup<00:05:54.710> of

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
components the first is slow buildup of

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.490 
components the first is slow buildup of
pigmentation<00:05:55.580> so<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.510> skin<00:05:56.750> is<00:05:56.870> getting<00:05:57.230> dark

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
pigmentation so the skin is getting dark

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.460 
pigmentation so the skin is getting dark
the<00:05:58.370> second<00:05:58.730> is<00:05:58.850> thickening<00:05:59.419> of<00:05:59.600> the<00:05:59.630> skin<00:05:59.750> the

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
the second is thickening of the skin the

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.620 
the second is thickening of the skin the
skin<00:06:00.680> is<00:06:00.950> slowly<00:06:01.250> getting<00:06:01.580> figured<00:06:02.240> it

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
skin is slowly getting figured it

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.930 
skin is slowly getting figured it
applies<00:06:03.050> especially<00:06:03.200> to<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.980> surface<00:06:04.310> of<00:06:04.760> the

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
applies especially to the surface of the

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.590 
applies especially to the surface of the
skin<00:06:05.180> so<00:06:05.990> called<00:06:06.230> a<00:06:06.410> horny<00:06:06.950> layer<00:06:07.160> and<00:06:07.600> the

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
skin so called a horny layer and the

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.840 
skin so called a horny layer and the
third<00:06:08.870> component<00:06:09.350> is<00:06:09.770> not<00:06:10.430> very<00:06:10.669> well

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
third component is not very well

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.150 
third component is not very well
understood<00:06:10.990> but<00:06:11.990> it's<00:06:12.200> certainly<00:06:12.919> very

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
understood but it's certainly very

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.100 
understood but it's certainly very
important<00:06:13.850> there<00:06:14.390> are<00:06:14.510> some<00:06:14.630> biochemical

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
important there are some biochemical

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.340 
important there are some biochemical
processes<00:06:15.830> which<00:06:16.430> can<00:06:16.700> be<00:06:16.880> speed<00:06:17.510> up<00:06:17.660> by<00:06:18.020> by

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
processes which can be speed up by by

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.650 
processes which can be speed up by by
adaptive<00:06:18.980> skin<00:06:19.250> adaptation<00:06:19.880> so<00:06:20.360> for<00:06:20.630> example

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
adaptive skin adaptation so for example

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.650 
adaptive skin adaptation so for example
the<00:06:21.229> negative<00:06:21.830> influence<00:06:22.550> of<00:06:22.700> sunlight<00:06:23.090> can

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
the negative influence of sunlight can

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.730 
the negative influence of sunlight can
be

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
be

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.330 
be
repaired<00:06:25.580> easily<00:06:26.060> and<00:06:26.630> faster<00:06:27.169> if<00:06:27.889> the<00:06:28.130> skin

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
repaired easily and faster if the skin

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.219 
repaired easily and faster if the skin
is<00:06:28.370> adapted<00:06:28.910> of<00:06:29.090> course<00:06:29.419> there<00:06:29.660> are<00:06:29.720> also<00:06:29.840> some

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
is adapted of course there are also some

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.469 
is adapted of course there are also some
people<00:06:30.289> that<00:06:30.710> burn<00:06:30.949> very<00:06:31.220> quickly<00:06:31.400> and<00:06:31.940> never

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
people that burn very quickly and never

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.559 
people that burn very quickly and never
10<00:06:32.810> what<00:06:33.199> about<00:06:33.289> then<00:06:33.759> yes<00:06:34.759> these<00:06:35.150> people

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 
10 what about then yes these people

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.360 
10 what about then yes these people
cannot<00:06:36.199> really<00:06:36.560> burn<00:06:37.520> very<00:06:37.669> easily<00:06:37.819> and<00:06:38.389> they

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
cannot really burn very easily and they

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.370 
cannot really burn very easily and they
some<00:06:40.370> of<00:06:40.490> them<00:06:40.610> cannot<00:06:41.110> cannot<00:06:42.110> make<00:06:42.349> any

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
some of them cannot cannot make any

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.010 
some of them cannot cannot make any
extra<00:06:42.949> pigmentation<00:06:43.610> so<00:06:44.300> they<00:06:44.479> are<00:06:44.630> not<00:06:44.780> able

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
extra pigmentation so they are not able

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.400 
extra pigmentation so they are not able
to<00:06:45.319> fully<00:06:45.560> benefit<00:06:46.009> from<00:06:46.280> differently<00:06:46.819> normal

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
to fully benefit from differently normal

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.830 
to fully benefit from differently normal
natural<00:06:48.410> protection<00:06:48.770> mechanisms<00:06:49.430> and<00:06:49.840> they

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
natural protection mechanisms and they

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.439 
natural protection mechanisms and they
must<00:06:51.050> be<00:06:51.199> extremely<00:06:51.710> careful<00:06:51.979> in<00:06:52.639> the<00:06:52.729> Sun<00:06:52.940> so

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
must be extremely careful in the Sun so

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.559 
must be extremely careful in the Sun so
they<00:06:53.660> are<00:06:53.780> not<00:06:54.220> allowed<00:06:55.220> to<00:06:55.550> use<00:06:55.580> tanning<00:06:56.419> bath

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569 
they are not allowed to use tanning bath
