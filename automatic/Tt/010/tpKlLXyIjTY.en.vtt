00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
that if we could get on on we could we

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.290 
that if we could get on on we could we

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
could open some holes for Mark and make

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.030 
could open some holes for Mark and make
some<00:01:05.510> of<00:01:05.600> those<00:01:05.690> DBS<00:01:05.930> tackling<00:01:06.560> which<00:01:06.710> isn't

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the best job probably in the world so

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.450 
the best job probably in the world so
that<00:01:09.290> was<00:01:09.380> kind<00:01:09.560> of<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.680> game<00:01:09.800> plan<00:01:10.040> going<00:01:10.070> in
