00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
got a locking piece and then you pop the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.350 
got a locking piece and then you pop the
lever<00:01:19.100> well<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:19.520> one<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.820> basically<00:01:20.240> just

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
lever well this one you basically just

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.860

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
saved me 20 bucks to put into something

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.750 
saved me 20 bucks to put into something
else<00:01:39.320> let<00:01:39.740> me<00:01:39.770> put<00:01:39.920> it<00:01:40.010> back<00:01:40.040> in<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.250> case<00:01:40.490> let's

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
else let me put it back in a case let's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.850 
else let me put it back in a case let's
test<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.180> see<00:01:41.300> if<00:01:41.480> the<00:01:41.630> plug<00:01:41.780> works<00:01:42.050> alright

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
test and see if the plug works alright

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.860 
if my mod worked okay or if it's too big
okay<00:02:00.980> so<00:02:01.040> slight<00:02:01.490> issue<00:02:01.730> with<00:02:01.910> my<00:02:02.420> homemade

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
okay so slight issue with my homemade

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.960 
okay so slight issue with my homemade
cable<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:04.370> had<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.730> little<00:02:05.390> metal<00:02:06.170> piece<00:02:06.410> that

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
cable it had a little metal piece that

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.339 
cable it had a little metal piece that
came<00:02:07.970> up<00:02:08.179> off<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.479> connector<00:02:08.929> that<00:02:09.049> I<00:02:09.109> went

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
came up off the connector that I went

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.770 
came up off the connector that I went
ahead<00:02:09.409> and<00:02:09.530> soldered<00:02:10.159> my<00:02:10.280> ground<00:02:10.579> to<00:02:10.879> and<00:02:11.150> is

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
ahead and soldered my ground to and is

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.320 
ahead and soldered my ground to and is
just<00:02:12.170> lightly<00:02:12.530> too

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
just lightly too

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330 
just lightly too
so<00:02:13.720> I'm<00:02:13.840> gonna<00:02:13.930> go<00:02:14.110> ahead<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.320> have<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.830> grind

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
so I'm gonna go ahead and have to grind

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.980 
so I'm gonna go ahead and have to grind
out<00:02:15.550> just<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.850> little<00:02:16.090> bit<00:02:16.210> if<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.690> want<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> have

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
out just a little bit if I want to have

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.020 
out just a little bit if I want to have
this<00:02:17.140> as<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.350> backup<00:02:17.680> cable<00:02:18.250> or<00:02:18.370> be<00:02:18.520> able<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.760> use

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
this as a backup cable or be able to use

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
this as a backup cable or be able to use
this<00:02:19.240> one<00:02:19.740> other<00:02:20.740> than<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.780> latch

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
this one other than that the latch

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.740 
this one other than that the latch
mechanism<00:02:23.320> is<00:02:23.830> really<00:02:24.070> tight<00:02:24.490> there<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.540> no

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
mechanism is really tight there is no

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.200 
mechanism is really tight there is no
safety<00:02:26.050> so<00:02:26.410> yeah<00:02:26.740> guess<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.160> could<00:02:27.490> pop<00:02:27.730> open

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
safety so yeah guess it could pop open

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.890 
safety so yeah guess it could pop open
but<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> plan<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.380> velcro<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.220> around<00:02:30.520> plan<00:02:31.420> also

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
but I plan to velcro it around plan also

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.600 
but I plan to velcro it around plan also
when<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.080> cut<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:32.500> off<00:02:32.740> is<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:32.980> apply<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.310> nice

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
when I cut this off is to apply a nice

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.140 
when I cut this off is to apply a nice
little<00:02:33.820> bead<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.270> velcro<00:02:34.690> on<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.020> side<00:02:35.980> or<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
little bead of velcro on the side or the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.660 
little bead of velcro on the side or the
bottom<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.660> then<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.170> back<00:02:38.410> plate<00:02:38.830> along

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
bottom and then on the back plate along

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.370 
bottom and then on the back plate along
here<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.180> when<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.360> mounted<00:02:40.750> on<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> front<00:02:41.200> of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
here so when I mounted on the front of

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.800 
here so when I mounted on the front of
the<00:02:41.560> wing<00:02:41.770> it's<00:02:42.520> also<00:02:42.730> adhered<00:02:43.240> and<00:02:43.450> kept<00:02:43.630> in

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
it's a pretty good little case and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.270 
it's a pretty good little case and
should<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.450> trick<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.410> for<00:02:53.650> 30<00:02:53.830> dollars<00:02:53.980> I
