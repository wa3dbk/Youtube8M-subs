hi<00:00:05.450> guys<00:00:05.720> and<00:00:05.990> this<00:00:06.710> video<00:00:07.010> will<00:00:07.130> you<00:00:07.250> take<00:00:07.430> a

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
hi guys and this video will you take a

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.180 
hi guys and this video will you take a
look<00:00:07.700> at<00:00:07.940> GL<00:00:08.780> benchmark<00:00:09.490> 2.7<00:00:10.490> on<00:00:10.850> the<00:00:11.360> Nexus<00:00:11.690> 7

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
look at GL benchmark 2.7 on the Nexus 7

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.790 
look at GL benchmark 2.7 on the Nexus 7
the<00:00:13.240> graphics<00:00:14.240> displayed<00:00:14.780> in<00:00:15.050> this<00:00:15.410> benchmark

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
the graphics displayed in this benchmark

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.060 
the graphics displayed in this benchmark
are<00:00:16.309> simply<00:00:16.849> mind-blowing<00:00:17.599> and<00:00:17.750> they<00:00:18.740> are<00:00:18.860> on

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
are simply mind-blowing and they are on

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.310 
are simply mind-blowing and they are on
par<00:00:19.099> with<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.790> graphics<00:00:20.180> of<00:00:20.360> PlayStation<00:00:21.020> 3

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
par with the graphics of PlayStation 3

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.839 
par with the graphics of PlayStation 3
and<00:00:21.470> Xbox<00:00:21.529> 360<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:22.790> let's<00:00:23.540> see<00:00:23.810> how<00:00:24.710> well<00:00:25.130> Nexus

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
and Xbox 360 so let's see how well Nexus

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.760 
and Xbox 360 so let's see how well Nexus
7<00:00:26.149> handle<00:00:26.509> these<00:00:26.720> kind<00:00:27.020> of<00:00:27.169> graphics<00:00:29.649> so<00:00:30.649> I'll

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
7 handle these kind of graphics so I'll

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.450 
7 handle these kind of graphics so I'll
be<00:00:30.919> running<00:00:31.070> on<00:00:31.939> screen<00:00:32.360> tests<00:00:32.890> so<00:00:33.890> we<00:00:34.070> can<00:00:34.250> see

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
be running on screen tests so we can see

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.599 
be running on screen tests so we can see
the<00:00:34.640> graphics<00:00:35.000> in<00:00:35.149> action<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:39.320> I'll<00:00:40.190> also

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
the graphics in action and I'll also

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:48.440 
the graphics in action and I'll also
benchmark

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:00.479 

gl<00:00:49.200> benchmark<00:00:49.650> 2.5<00:00:51.380> on<00:00:52.380> screen

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:19.230 

that's<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.629> let's<00:01:01.930> turn<00:01:02.260> it

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.020 

as<00:01:19.329> you<00:01:20.200> can<00:01:20.350> see<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.890> graphics<00:01:21.399> displayed<00:01:21.880> in

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
as you can see the graphics displayed in

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.639 
as you can see the graphics displayed in
this<00:01:22.210> benchmark<00:01:22.630> are<00:01:23.200> insane

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
this benchmark are insane

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.109 
this benchmark are insane
and<00:01:27.780> Nexus<00:01:28.780> 7<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.259> struggling<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.830> lot<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.970> show

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
and Nexus 7 is struggling a lot to show

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.749 
and Nexus 7 is struggling a lot to show
these<00:01:31.360> kind<00:01:31.600> of<00:01:31.750> graphics<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:33.220> framerate<00:01:33.490> is

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
these kind of graphics the framerate is

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.469 
these kind of graphics the framerate is
hardly<00:01:34.180> around<00:01:34.420> 3<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:34.810> 5<00:01:35.020> frames<00:01:35.799> per<00:01:35.979> second

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
hardly around 3 to 5 frames per second

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.899 
hardly around 3 to 5 frames per second
which<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.509> not<00:01:38.439> at<00:01:38.560> all<00:01:38.679> playable<00:01:41.580> but<00:01:42.580> this<00:01:42.759> is

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
which is not at all playable but this is

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.289 
which is not at all playable but this is
going<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.479> future<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.340> games<00:01:45.340> on<00:01:45.759> tablets

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
going to the future of games on tablets

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.520 
going to the future of games on tablets
and<00:01:46.539> phones<00:01:47.369> maybe<00:01:48.369> in<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.670> year<00:01:48.850> or<00:01:48.939> so<00:01:49.530> phones

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
and phones maybe in a year or so phones

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.199 
and phones maybe in a year or so phones
and<00:01:50.740> tablets<00:01:51.159> will<00:01:51.310> be<00:01:51.399> powerful<00:01:51.700> enough<00:01:51.850> to

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
and tablets will be powerful enough to

00:01:52.209 --> 00:02:13.180 
and tablets will be powerful enough to
handle<00:01:52.539> these<00:01:52.690> kind<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.110> graphics

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.130 

and<00:02:13.280> now<00:02:14.090> 2.5<00:02:14.960> Egypt<00:02:15.820> which<00:02:16.820> was<00:02:17.140> reasonably

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
and now 2.5 Egypt which was reasonably

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:51.830 
and now 2.5 Egypt which was reasonably
good<00:02:18.350> on<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.950> Nexus<00:02:19.280> 7

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.600 

and<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.500> flooring<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.069> completely

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
and the flooring is completely

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.190 
and the flooring is completely
reflective

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
reflective

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.100 
reflective
and<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.640> armor<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.270> also<00:02:59.130> reflecting<00:03:00.130> light

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.740 

in<00:03:04.590> there<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:04.920> what<00:03:05.100> reflection<00:03:05.790> going<00:03:06.060> on

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.390 

so<00:03:11.750> these<00:03:11.870> kind<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.290> graphics<00:03:12.709> are<00:03:12.860> also<00:03:13.010> quite

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
so these kind of graphics are also quite

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.559 
so these kind of graphics are also quite
heavy

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.369 

or<00:03:18.049> any<00:03:18.290> kind<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.680> tablet<00:03:18.920> or<00:03:19.250> phone<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:20.379> Nexus

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
or any kind of tablet or phone and Nexus

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:27.490 
or any kind of tablet or phone and Nexus
7<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.799> doing<00:03:23.409> a<00:03:24.409> reasonable<00:03:25.129> job<00:03:25.900> with<00:03:26.900> these

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
7 is doing a reasonable job with these

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.809 
7 is doing a reasonable job with these
kind<00:03:27.829> of<00:03:27.920> traffic's<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:30.769> is<00:03:30.890> not<00:03:31.099> super<00:03:31.430> smooth

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
kind of traffic's it is not super smooth

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:39.130 
kind of traffic's it is not super smooth
but<00:03:32.269> still<00:03:32.900> smooth<00:03:33.170> enough

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.950 

the<00:03:39.890> frame<00:03:40.130> rate<00:03:40.310> must<00:03:40.520> be<00:03:40.640> around<00:03:41.000> 15<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.630> 20

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
the frame rate must be around 15 to 20

00:03:41.960 --> 00:04:28.890 
the frame rate must be around 15 to 20
fps

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.379 

so<00:04:29.730> jail<00:04:30.730> benchmark<00:04:31.180> 2.7<00:04:32.139> TX<00:04:32.620> HD<00:04:33.160> has<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:34.000> frame

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
so jail benchmark 2.7 TX HD has a frame

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.870 
so jail benchmark 2.7 TX HD has a frame
rate<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.650> 5.4<00:04:35.650> fps<00:04:36.240> whereas<00:04:37.240> 2.5<00:04:38.110> Egypt<00:04:38.650> has<00:04:38.919> 14

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
rate of 5.4 fps whereas 2.5 Egypt has 14

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.420 
rate of 5.4 fps whereas 2.5 Egypt has 14
fps<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:42.160> this<00:04:42.340> was<00:04:42.729> GL<00:04:43.270> benchmark<00:04:43.870> 2.7<00:04:44.860> on<00:04:45.070> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
fps so this was GL benchmark 2.7 on the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.270 
fps so this was GL benchmark 2.7 on the
Nexus<00:04:45.790> 7<00:04:45.840> hope<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:46.990> enjoyed<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.500> video<00:04:47.650> see
