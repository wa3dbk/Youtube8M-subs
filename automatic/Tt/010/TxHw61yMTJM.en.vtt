 wiesbadener brita-arena have 28 teams 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.180
 only one goal the best youth team 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.730
 to become in Germany and at 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.210
 world final in Poland em country while 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.550
 his 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.449
 even the opening ceremony is something quite 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.699
 special 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.560
 in the almost european champion mood 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.560
 the young kickers get into the rapture 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.660
 numerous teams of top teams 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.090
 like the hsv schalke 04 hertha 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.710
 from berlin or rising greuther 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.630
 FÃ¼rth want Germany cup 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.370
 win 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.770
 good chances are worth the sv 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.900
 bergisch gladbach from last year 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.850
 after all, semi-finalists the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.480
 gladbacher have it first 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.680
 to do with the strong tsg Hoffnungheim 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.170
 pappenheim presses and marks 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.210
 fast 100 makes in the early phase 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.820
 the tournament the fresher impression 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.229
 bergisch gladbach holds against it can the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.340
 but hopeheimer's not 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.710
 hold properly 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.930
 the increase to two to zero the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.270
 Berg guys do not put on yet 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.160
 At the end, the last bit of luck is missing 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.560
 the game is lost 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.560
 but the will of the team is unbroken 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.900
 not just for the gladbacher ask 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.970
 the first soft ones 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.300
 everywhere is highly motivated by points 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.729
 Do not fight so close to the em 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.000
 in poland and ukraine give all 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.000
 teams do their best just like their favorites 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.390
 but the young kickers not only have 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.179
 cutting off your role models 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.090
 the winning team wink to the world final 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.190
 something very special which all this year 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.990
 recommended , of course, fits perfectly because 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.350
 The children play exactly in the stadium 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.840
 would 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.240
 next week the em will be opened 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.910
 Recommended in the Warsaw National Stadium 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.950
 With 58,000 seats I believe that 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.069
 this is a big reward for the children 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.840
 When the reward builds up, too 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.550
 gladly pick bergisch gladbacher 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.680
 in the preliminary round, they still had 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.480
 four points are earned and are now 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.200
 earned in the eighth-finals 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.940
 here the opponent ksv baunatal is called that 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.709
 game is almost balanced 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.260
 on both sides is great use 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.510
 commanded finally helps the baunatal 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.430
 a little luck than the bergisch 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.000
 gladbacher keeper the leather over the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.950
 shoulder slips out of the team nrw urges 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.959
 on the compensation but the time is running 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.769
 from that 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.410
 baunatal rejoices over the 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.630
 quarterfinal feeder and for the boys out 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.519
 the mountain is the dream of the title 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.180
 dreamed up for this year 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.880
 the final of the danone nations cup 2012 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.030
 is held in front of a large backdrop 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.060
 hertha bsc berlin against the arminia 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.060
 Bielefeld 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.340
 and on the 5th of the herthan juniors do 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.410
 Immediately powerful pressure and work out 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.600
 the field superiority but the arminia 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.880
 does not sleep and the lively striker 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.850
 surprisingly uses a rebound and 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.290
 wet ice cold 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.930
 Arminia Bielefeld on the way into 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.740
 World finals Berliners will not find any 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.130
 answer more 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.700
 and the game is off now 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.190
 insulating 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.680
 fans and players completely freaked out and 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.540
