00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.490 
here because I don't have any other
color<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.910> probably<00:02:59.270> would<00:02:59.510> rather<00:02:59.630> use<00:03:00.050> blacks

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
color I probably would rather use blacks

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.230

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
and if you have black might want to use

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.600 
and if you have black might want to use
that<00:03:02.450> if<00:03:03.020> you<00:03:03.200> don't<00:03:03.470> have<00:03:03.710> a<00:03:03.770> coat<00:03:04.010> hanger<00:03:04.190> why
