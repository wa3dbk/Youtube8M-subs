00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.300 
hello Jessie here at GPS city I have the

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.980 
hello Jessie here at GPS city I have the
GPS<00:00:06.839> map<00:00:07.080> 6e<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.610> base<00:00:09.000> model<00:00:09.030> mapping

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
GPS map 6e this is a base model mapping

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.379 
GPS map 6e this is a base model mapping
unit<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.709> 24<00:00:11.190> megabytes<00:00:11.789> of<00:00:12.000> mapping

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
unit with about 24 megabytes of mapping

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.359 
unit with about 24 megabytes of mapping
in<00:00:12.539> it<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:13.110> very<00:00:13.320> similar<00:00:13.619> to<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.010> etrex

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:14.369 
in it it's very similar to the etrex

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.949 
in it it's very similar to the etrex
units<00:00:14.789> except<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.570> got<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> different

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:15.959 
units except it's got a different

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.470 
units except it's got a different
interface<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.039> also<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.520> uses<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.910> Quadra

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
interface and also it uses a Quadra

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.530 
interface and also it uses a Quadra
feeler<00:00:18.810> helix<00:00:19.200> antenna<00:00:19.620> which<00:00:19.890> will<00:00:20.730> help<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
feeler helix antenna which will help the

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.420 
feeler helix antenna which will help the
unit<00:00:21.840> receive<00:00:22.140> satellite<00:00:22.650> signals<00:00:23.040> a<00:00:23.160> little
