00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.600
 hi friends, i hope you are very well 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:11.080
 today I am here to bring you the second 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.180
 part of the recipes made with shells 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.630
 of egg now is what we're going to 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.150
 use on the outside of the 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.259
 peel formerly we remove the strips 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:27.789
 internal and we made ourselves in the extract of 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:29.409
 d with hyaluronic acid and collagen 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.349
 in extract background of talitas 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.920
 internal products that provide hyaluronic acid and 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.230
 Collagen 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.929
 and well in another minute I'll explain 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.890
 as happening now let's occupy the 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:45.350
 part of the outside of the shell that I eat 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.960
 I told them previously it 's loaded 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.149
 of calcium carbonate and what are we going to 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.539
 do now is a supplement to take 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.539
 Really 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.129
 that will provide us with calcium 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.550
 strengthen the nails and the rest the subject with 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.100
 the calcium is that it is not diluted in water and 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.600
 it is very difficult to absorb already 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.580
 investigate mind and more externally by 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.470
 so it's going to be a product that is used 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.630
 on the outside with the eggshell with 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.390
 calcium 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.689
 the truth that has little effect now 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.970
 I believe little in these products that 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.619
 they say they are to strengthen the nails 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.750
 that come the truth that the absorption 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.560
 of calcium is so so difficult through 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.610
 of the skin that I do not believe of the same 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.740
 nails that I do not believe them too much but of 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.500
 each one is what we are going to do is use 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.350
 these cascaritas and we are going to do our 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.569
 supplement that we need for that I 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.610
 I'm going to put the recipe in the 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.810
 screen we need the shells of 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.900
 egg without dried talitas clean 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.500
 previously 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.210
 The first thing we do is grind well 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.760
 finite egg shells too 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.370
 we could do it like that without putting a lot 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.080
 but the idea that to be able to extract everything 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.510
 the carbonate or the most amount of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.130
 carbonate is the more surface of 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.170
 contact we have is when the shell 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.200
 it's well ground I have the machine 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.200
 grinder so good the advantage and 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.290
 placed to grind there and invited me say 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.170
 a little time that is needed when 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.590
 you occupy the mortar not only you die 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.070
 manually put all the powder of 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.230
 egg shells in a jar always 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.420
 the charges have to be almost double 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.660
 of volume in which we are going to add 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.790
 then the peels and the vinegar and 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.790
 now you will know why 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.780
 the size of the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.080
 container what we are going to do next 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.140
 is to cover all the eggshells on 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.020
 powder that we made with the vinegar of 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.959
 apple we are going to add little by little and 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.730
 stirring you're going to realize that this 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.470
 begins to make effervescence and is for 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.810
 the same thing that told them that we need 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.150
 a container of a container a little 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.700
 more bigger 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.340
 I left by placing him a little until he 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.500
 a paste and I'm adding this to 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.220
 As the carbonate is extracted from 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.319
 calcium will be releasing the gas that is 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.000
 a carbon dioxide doing 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.720
 effervescence so we have to be 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.099
 a little while beating until he leaves 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.040
 lowering the effervescence as it is 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.010
 when we prepare these liquids 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.599
 let's say for the uat has put sales 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.420
 effervescent as we have to 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.220
 let it rest a little bit after 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.989
 that I rest for a while and the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.540
 effervescence or the great part of the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.180
 effervescence we put it in the jar 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.370
 and we cover this we leave this 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.370
 bottle after about two weeks 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.220
 resting but if it is important that 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.010
 every day or every other day we 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.930
 let's open the bottle so that the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.720
 gas the carbon dioxide that is going 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.970
 issuing at the time of going out of iu 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.430
 that the acid the vinegar is extracting 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.770
 the calcium carbonate and here that we 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.780
 is left is a vinegar let's say full of 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.070
 calcium acetate that helps us to 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.070
 as a supplement 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.870
 once we have two weeks of 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.020
 macerated 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.090
 what we do is simply filter the 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.660
 vinegar is going to leave the solids 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.490
 one side and the liquid for another that what 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.110
 we can do is take it every day 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.110
 one tablespoon or two tablespoons 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.430
 also if you want you can leave it with 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.220
 the solid inside the jar go filtering 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.620
 before each use that depends on each one 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.300
 it is always important to keep it in 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.390
 the refrigerator or in the cool place 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.390
 so that it stays much longer 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:06.529
 result that the surplus that we have left 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:09.139
 of granulating those solids is a 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.969
 excellent exfoliant for the feet 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.369
 that you simply keep it in a 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:16.389
 refrigerated place ideally I would 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:20.449
 add a little bit of glycerin to 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.949
 boost conservation a little 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.039
 so try it for the exfoliation of 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:29.299
 feet is excellent I do not recommend it for 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:32.499
 exfoliation of good face I'm here I 

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:32.499
 I have here if you notice 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.630
 an extract that I was when it's already 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.860
 like a month and if they are fixed it's still 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.120
 with a lot of calcium that puts white 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.940
 so then I'm going to go back to 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.349
 filter and I'm going to use it to 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.160
 simply the truth that when I do not 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:58.400
 Take a tablespoon of vinegar as well 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:02.150
 bitter ah but good in the background one what 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.490
 takes as a contribution above all to our 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.490
 bones that are women we have 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.009
 they took few all their lives if they did not 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.069
 You have the mortar that appears in the 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:16.470
 video you do not have the grind I 'm going to 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:19.240
 show here how it is 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:23.440
 look they can not see 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:28.630
 but it is very very finite that it remains without 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:32.229
 men with the mortar so it's re 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:35.139
 easy to demolish the egg shells of 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:38.470
 made the best of the little girl 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.479
 we kind of painted them and then 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.099
 we would stick them saying we decorated as well as 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.770
 if they were nothing bits of sand 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:47.610
 we made decorations or collage using the 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.550
 painted egg shells 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.939
 ground so another of the utilities 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.129
 that can give egg shells 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:58.080
 that normally in their bouquets of snacks 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.469
 if we vote a lot and even the powder 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.469
 comes out 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.509
 from the shell 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.759
 so good another one of the things that 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.050
 I wanted to comment is that many people 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.779
 they have told me good but if we were 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.119
 ready and we could calmly 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:19.160
 take it like a spoonfuls a spoonful 

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:21.500
 and water but I do not recommend them because 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.900
 the egg as resolvable in water 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.810
 reacts with acid and by reacting with 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.490
 acid releases a gas that is what 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.010
 we show there in the video that he makes 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.250
 effervescence and what happens if you take it 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.880
 in the stomach has been then those 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:40.280
 acids will generate a swelling 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:44.290
 horrible just because they will be 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.290
 reacting there and then that 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:54.460
 but to decide a bit of vinegar you 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.500
 put the calcium supplement for 

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.690
 take daily and contribute almost what is 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.060
 so difficult again with the food that 

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.940
 usually we have with the 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.979
 modern diet so good the 

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.349
 I see in another video telling you what else 

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:11.379
 we are going to do taking advantage of what we 

00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:15.009
 is still the eggs of the 

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:19.650
 husks that is the residue this that we 

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:19.650
 is going to be left of the vinegar so we see it
