00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:17.900
 oh yeah good morning good morning 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.050
 he was hugging for a pretty video 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.859
 brief to an express video even suggested 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.689
 because that's it 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.849
 you saw it in the title we're going 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.519
 talk a little bit about the contest at 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.589
 leucate so games halo pic because there is 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.149
 some small elements to add for 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.260
 those who might not be 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.150
 still aware that they would have everything 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.200
 simply not understood 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.300
 so here's a little booster 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.920
 just to be sure everything will be clear 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.890
 before the end of the contest end of the contest 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.100
 which happens so this Sunday to know the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.480
 October 28, 2012 of course one that I 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.380
 I will not specify, but I say 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.590
 still so in fact yes I 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.060
 accurate and so is basically it you 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.790
 stays less than a week to send 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.560
 your participation so if you ever 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.540
 indeed count well participate 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.930
 do not forget that you only have 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.729
 until Sunday already first 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.469
 compared to that besides tried in 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.499
 wherever possible send us your 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.219
 participation as early as possible before 

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.780
 Sunday 1 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.700
 when I have it sooner it's not 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.380
 Sunday if possible before 8 am 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.899
 evening and I say well this week the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.310
 as soon as possible because we have already had 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.179
 necessarily still applications 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.819
 so is I finally mean 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.369
 participations is good there have been 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.439
 small problems mostly mainly 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.619
 at the level of the main test that 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.240
 is the big trip the course we had 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.659
 some small problems on some 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.710
 passages in this instance for example the 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.770
 mango or other and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.630
 and which makes that we can not validate the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.130
 course so we were forced to 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.900
 to contact people to tell them 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.280
 to send us an application so 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.040
 it's time wasted for a lot of 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.450
 world one for onu staff for the person 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.080
 in itself as well as wasting time 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.759
 somehow 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.190
 so it's not good for everyone 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.869
 so really his chance to try at 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.310
 maximum we send us the soonest 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.020
 possible 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.759
 Tuesday Wednesday Thursday is the earliest 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.619
 possible so that if ever there is a little 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.830
 not that we can send you back a 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.970
 message and warn you of everything that 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.070
 do not go and you can arrange it 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.040
 because we will not be able to accept two 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.320
 applications passed on October 28 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.239
 finally from next monday what 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.170
 so at least you know it after if 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.820
 you want to take the risk of 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.190
 send it Sunday do it right you 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.360
 seems but if there is a lesser error 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.410
 in the application we will not be able 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.910
 accept it so we tell you when 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.070
 even we are here and it's really 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.630
 to send as soon as possible to 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.620
 precisely speaking the occurrence of the passage 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.360
 than to pose seemingly problem 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.280
 and when you're sure you do not 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.080
 do not make the same mistake the passage 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.000
 towards the end in mongoose is done 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.970
 to the banshee you must not go down 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.290
 on this platform that is not who 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.760
 is not a platform on 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.340
 which one is supposed to continue on foot 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.930
 have done from the moment we go up 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.190
 in the mangouse we stay there until 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.670
 move to banshee like that at least 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.280
 it's clear 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.450
 and compared to the clips always for 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.950
 the big trip you send us 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.849
 as we already said but 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.500
 apparently it does not necessarily 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.060
 may have been clear when you 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.489
 send your application with the big 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.290
 trip if your passage does not start 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.030
 from the beginning of the game but that you 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.250
 do several failures at the beginning and that 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.989
 you really start the course at 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.879
 bout of home not me 5 5 minutes two 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.980
 parties in this case do not send us 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.349
 not the whole part go back in 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.230
 cinema and in you save the clip 10 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.120
 seconds before the beginning of 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.239
 of the true passage you make up 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.980
 the end do not send us the part 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.110
 in full because it's a long time 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.030
 for us and that's a lot 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.709
 fewer possibilities for really everything 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.610
 to do well and everything so basically again 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.620
 once it's a waste of time to 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.420
 everyone so especially do not forget 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.650
 if the party does not start to do so 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.780
 your journey does not begin as soon as 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.819
 beginning of the recorded part a clip 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.379
 is not here from here are the 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.690
 people it was a small booster shot 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.099
 we hope in any case that this contest 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.360
 In any case, you can have fun 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.299
 to spend time waiting 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.319
 to leucate that is coming up fast and I 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.120
 so you are saying very soon for a 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.610
 another video talking about halo 4 which 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.700
 is fast approaching hall just want 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.700
 to say 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.660
 bang 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.770
 six months 14 more than two weeks
