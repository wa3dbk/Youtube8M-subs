00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.170
 and how are you and a little sad policies 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.580
 because you have to dismiss the summer but 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.790
 good we have to receive with arms 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.580
 well open to autumn and with it os 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.560
 I bring a pickup very easy to make and 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.560
 that will set a trend this season 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 he's picked up he has nothing girls 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.480
 it's just an unnamed pigtail 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 high or good the pigtail you can put it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.000
 where you allow me as I have the little hair 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.220
 short 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.200
 that I have more loose hair because the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.840
 I do long but if you have it as slam or 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.940
 same is very cool and with the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.100
 stripe in the middle and then we just have to 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.660
 select a pair of fabric stones 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.330
 that we like and we can cut them 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.730
 even of clothes or anything that 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.559
 let's have it there and with those pieces of 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.610
 cloth we will make the braids myself for example 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.769
 with these pieces that you see here what 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.470
 first thing we're going to do is a queue 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.930
 well high and tight but that's good 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.240
 tastes so you will choose where 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.399
 you prefer highest lowest stripe to 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.530
 half a line to the side once the 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:15.240
 pigtail so that we stay more fixed and 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.100
 from wet effect we throw the gel 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.560
 the first fabric that we are going to use 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.960
 among all those we select will be 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.780
 the longest so in this way the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.840
 we will go around and letting 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.750
 two strips fall 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.460
 the laps we give depend on what 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.079
 long as our pigtail is but 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.909
 it always suits him that the strips of 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.789
 the fabric is a bit long so that 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.009
 look more we take the three pieces of 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.619
 fabric that we previously cut and the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.780
 mechanism will be very simple by taking a 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.600
 piece of cloth we tie with a rubber band 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.299
 up and then like a normal braid 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.299
 We separated the hair into three strips and the 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.299
 we make one here over there over there 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.840
 As you already know for colors 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.610
 you can make the braids that you want and 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.610
 unleash your imagination 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.130
 and this is ready 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.500
 good girls, as you can see, this is the 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.960
 final result is also a collected 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.090
 super comfortable and as you have seen very 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.250
 easy to do but I also want to know 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.010
 what do you do and what do you do ? 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.050
 things you think they will take away in autumn already 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.540
 you know commenting here if you liked 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.400

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.400
