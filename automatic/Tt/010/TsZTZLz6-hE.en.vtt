to start this project off I'm going to
be<00:00:07.240> using<00:00:07.569> super<00:00:07.960> sculpey<00:00:08.139> and<00:00:08.500> super<00:00:08.889> sculpey

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
be using super sculpey and super sculpey

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.360 
be using super sculpey and super sculpey
firm<00:00:09.670> mixed<00:00:10.420> and<00:00:10.570> this<00:00:11.080> is<00:00:11.230> my<00:00:11.379> work<00:00:11.620> area<00:00:11.920> it's

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370 
firm mixed and this is my work area it's

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.580 
firm mixed and this is my work area it's
the<00:00:12.850> same<00:00:13.119> size<00:00:13.330> as<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.690> inside<00:00:13.990> of<00:00:14.020> my<00:00:14.230> oven

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
the same size as the inside of my oven

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
there

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.610 
there
that<00:02:15.730> looks<00:02:15.940> like<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.120> lizard<00:02:16.330> already<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.530> I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
that looks like a lizard already and I

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.910 
that looks like a lizard already and I
haven't

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
haven't

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.059 
haven't
put<00:02:18.099> any<00:02:18.250> clay<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.930> yeah<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.380> oil<00:02:20.860> can

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
put any clay on it so yeah the oil can

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.339 
put any clay on it so yeah the oil can
really<00:02:21.310> help<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.700> shape<00:02:21.940> something<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.630> it

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
really help you shape something and it

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.479 
really help you shape something and it
saves<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.860> lot<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.130> money<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.640> clay<00:02:26.489> this

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
saves you a lot of money in clay this

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.089 
saves you a lot of money in clay this
would<00:02:27.670> probably<00:02:27.790> Bend<00:02:28.150> like<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.890> 3/4<00:02:29.890> pound

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
would probably Bend like a 3/4 pound

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.210 
would probably Bend like a 3/4 pound
lizard<00:02:30.520> if<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:31.150> had<00:02:31.390> used<00:02:31.930> solid<00:02:32.319> clay<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:36.069> now

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
lizard if I had used solid clay so now

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.979 
lizard if I had used solid clay so now
I'm<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.520> building<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.209> pad<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> platform

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
I'm just building a pad like a platform

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.830 
I'm just building a pad like a platform
for<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.380> sit<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:41.770> top<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.630> got<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.690> make

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
for that to sit on top of I got to make

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.100 
for that to sit on top of I got to make
it<00:02:43.870> big<00:02:44.080> enough<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:45.459> know<00:02:45.780> have<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> whole

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
it big enough to you know have the whole

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.070 
it big enough to you know have the whole
sculpture<00:02:47.940> be<00:02:48.940> able<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.150> sit<00:02:49.330> on<00:02:49.450> there<00:02:49.660> I'm

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
sculpture be able to sit on there I'm

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
sculpture be able to sit on there I'm
not<00:02:50.200> worried<00:02:50.470> about<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.739> legs<00:02:50.920> right<00:02:51.160> now<00:02:53.100> see

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
not worried about the legs right now see

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.500 
not worried about the legs right now see
now<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.280> had<00:02:54.489> just<00:02:54.700> made<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.030> big<00:02:55.209> enough<00:02:55.450> for

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
now I had just made it big enough for

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.870 
now I had just made it big enough for
that<00:02:55.900> now<00:02:56.440> I'm<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.830> I<00:02:57.010> did<00:02:57.549> some<00:02:57.730> little

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
that now I'm on it I did some little

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.350 
that now I'm on it I did some little
weird<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.930> I'm<00:02:59.170> going<00:02:59.560> twice<00:02:59.920> as<00:03:00.220> thick<00:03:00.360> so

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
weird I I'm going twice as thick so

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.900 
weird I I'm going twice as thick so
that's<00:03:01.540> two<00:03:01.720> full<00:03:02.080> sheets<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:03.640> know<00:03:03.730> the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
that's two full sheets you know the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.210 
that's two full sheets you know the
thickest<00:03:04.269> setting<00:03:04.390> on<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.130> polymer<00:03:06.130> clay

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
thickest setting on the polymer clay

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.789 
thickest setting on the polymer clay
pasta<00:03:06.670> machine<00:03:08.130> basically<00:03:09.130> two-ply<00:03:09.819> I<00:03:10.799> don't

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
pasta machine basically two-ply I don't

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.430 
pasta machine basically two-ply I don't
know<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.100> my<00:03:12.670> argument<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.360> it's<00:03:14.230> got<00:03:14.410> a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
know the my argument is it's got a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.949 
know the my argument is it's got a
really<00:03:14.709> good<00:03:15.040> foundation<00:03:15.940> for<00:03:16.150> me<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.840> build

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
really good foundation for me to build

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.600 
really good foundation for me to build
this<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:18.120> now<00:03:19.120> I'm<00:03:19.269> just<00:03:19.560> kind<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.680> taking<00:03:21.430> that

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
this on now I'm just kind of taking that

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.550 
this on now I'm just kind of taking that
it<00:03:21.910> was<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.480> little<00:03:22.600> excess<00:03:22.989> down<00:03:23.140> there<00:03:23.380> I'm

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
it was a little excess down there I'm

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.479 
it was a little excess down there I'm
just<00:03:23.890> pushing<00:03:24.070> it<00:03:24.310> up<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:26.190> foil<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
just pushing it up to the foil the

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.759 
just pushing it up to the foil the
armature<00:03:27.940> all<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.230> way<00:03:29.350> around<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:32.170> kind<00:03:32.680> of

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
armature all the way around and kind of

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.990 
armature all the way around and kind of
like<00:03:32.920> smoothing<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.579> little<00:03:33.820> bit<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:36.190> bulged

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
like smoothing it a little bit it bulged

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.759 
like smoothing it a little bit it bulged
out<00:03:37.180> on<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.570> side<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.049> had<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.320> cut<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.530> out

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
out on that side so I had to cut it out

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.150 
out on that side so I had to cut it out
but<00:03:39.329> I'm<00:03:40.329> just<00:03:40.660> pushing<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.410> up<00:03:41.470> pinching<00:03:42.040> it

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
but I'm just pushing that up pinching it

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.280 
but I'm just pushing that up pinching it
all<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> way<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.549> it<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:43.030> both<00:03:43.359> both<00:03:43.780> sides<00:03:44.019> all

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
all the way to it on both both sides all

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.340 
all the way to it on both both sides all
the<00:03:44.320> way<00:03:44.500> around<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:45.760> where<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.150> pad<00:03:46.959> that

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
the way around to where the pad that

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.680 
the way around to where the pad that
it's<00:03:47.739> sitting<00:03:48.010> on<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.370> now<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.850> same<00:03:49.209> shape<00:03:49.480> as

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
it's sitting on is now the same shape as

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.670 
it's sitting on is now the same shape as
that<00:03:50.220> armature<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.690> know<00:03:52.780> from<00:03:53.079> here<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.290> just

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
that armature you know from here I just

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.180 
that armature you know from here I just
I<00:03:53.859> put<00:03:54.190> some<00:03:54.400> sheets<00:03:54.609> on<00:03:54.880> top<00:03:54.910> of<00:03:55.329> that<00:03:56.190> now

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
I put some sheets on top of that now

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.509 
I put some sheets on top of that now
what<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.730> did<00:03:57.970> here<00:03:58.329> is<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.570> did<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.410> full<00:03:59.769> a<00:04:00.010> full

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
what I did here is I did a full a full

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.059 
what I did here is I did a full a full
thickness<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:01.180> what<00:04:01.780> I'm<00:04:01.900> using<00:04:02.290> right<00:04:02.440> now<00:04:02.620> I

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
thickness is what I'm using right now I

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.599 
thickness is what I'm using right now I
did<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.060> whole<00:04:04.299> layer<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.750> that<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.370> what<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.400> was

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
did a whole layer of that and what I was

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.940 
did a whole layer of that and what I was
thinking<00:04:06.640> behind<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.930> instead<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:08.739> doing<00:04:08.890> a

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
thinking behind the instead of doing a

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.069 
thinking behind the instead of doing a
second<00:04:09.370> full<00:04:09.640> layer<00:04:09.910> like<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.480> did<00:04:10.660> underneath

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
second full layer like I did underneath

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.590 
second full layer like I did underneath
I<00:04:11.319> did<00:04:12.220> another<00:04:12.459> layer<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:12.880> only<00:04:13.030> half<00:04:13.329> the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
I did another layer but only half the

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.580 
I did another layer but only half the
thickness<00:04:14.970> because<00:04:15.970> I'm<00:04:16.690> going<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.470> be

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
thickness because I'm going to be

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.180 
thickness because I'm going to be
putting<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:18.010> layer<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.910> cane<00:04:19.239> on<00:04:19.539> there<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.829> I

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
putting a layer of cane on there and I

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.520 
putting a layer of cane on there and I
figured<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:22.600> know<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:22.900> will<00:04:23.050> be<00:04:23.169> my<00:04:23.350> other

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
figured you know that will be my other

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.339 
figured you know that will be my other
half<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:25.000> so<00:04:25.479> it'll<00:04:25.660> still<00:04:25.870> be<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.140> same

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
half of a so it'll still be the same

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.710
