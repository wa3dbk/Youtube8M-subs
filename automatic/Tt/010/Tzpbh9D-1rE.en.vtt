00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.769
 so dearman 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.519
 TV is all possible we have 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.540
 fear we are still at 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.600
 wiesmann 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.520
 and something changed we are now everything 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.619
 Somewhat severed stood von Vollmer 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.740
 landed and of course we are all 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.990
 curious what's new from the brand 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 Vollmer to report 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.940
 yes he would I always lives on we 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.040
 are proud to have taken the brand 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.600
 we will deliver the usual quality 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.010
 Also in the future we have the complete 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.040
 assortment taken over 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.500
 it has now appeared new catalog and 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
 Nevertheless, we still wanted to top that and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.730
 have been in the last two three months 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.970
 a new technology is developing that way 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.470
 called volmarstein art the mandate 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.640
 all art I have to do now 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.050
 to imagine under it 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 this is a segment composite material 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.700
 sand and a solvent-free glue 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.079
 material that gives us the opportunity 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.290
 natural materials for replicating 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:13.579
 wall cobblestone plates roofs 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.030
 everything you know in stone 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.710
 recreate 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.509
 So I can assure you dear 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.250
 spectators we also have a small one 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.020
 model range of her lying 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.970
 Of these natural stones only this one 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.930
 tunnel portal to show 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.250
 It is also very difficult and you can 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.390
 Also very nice the fine detailing 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.250
 See that is really a 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.000
 It's really hard 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.280
 like stone 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 It looks like that's off federal 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.049
 feels like stones but it is yes 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.900
 not only these tunnel portals, too 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.240
 at the beginning the support walls the 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.530
 Support walls, for example, exactly and there 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 they had betrayed me dear matthias 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.220
 wissmann that you can even offer 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.350
 right and has the possibility with the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.400
 to acquire a budget hole from and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.950
 then you can shape it to the shape you want 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.840
 For example, they bring corners around corners 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.229
 edges or something better 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.800
 can 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.720
 so you can 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.720
 the tunnel portals, so to speak, or the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.710
 At the beginning, the times are right 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.400
 Adjust conditions as you do 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.230
 the plant must have let the track 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.580
 There are no borders across the track 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.840
 set with which we are still standing 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.600
 At the beginning of the development we have the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.790
 first products now presented but 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.620
 the assortment will be available soon 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.770
 expand very large that applies to 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.770
 the track's zero trace of the trailers 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:38.170
 h0 tmn all friends of vollmer die 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.210
 God's sake now believed 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.340
 It's all over, it's all gone 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.840
 be curious what you new now 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.910
 develop for the so-called 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.530
 track-wide and we also have one here 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.660
 The models are standing in the background and 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.010
 they are really fantastic from exactly 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.080
 Convince yourself of this 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.790
 new system try it out 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.410
 you the trade and use the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.990
 Materials let them show you 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.070
 We will have a new experience 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.370
 also have a beautiful here 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.530
 system is on street pavement is the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.420
 from the same material of the 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.850
 road-solid made of the same material 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.620
 There are intersections of soft corners 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.230
 so that you get the complete 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.840
 cobblestone street train 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.880
 So it is possible to emulate others 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.440
 These innovative developments are the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.570
 now introduce us here on this 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.940
 fair hope that in the future on the mountain 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.320
 That's right for both 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.040
 Vollmer as well as the other two 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.060
 Brands 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.040
 we licked blood, we stand behind 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.270
 all three brands alike and 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.010
 We will always be back in the future 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.400
 come up with new models and great ideas 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.410
 to let 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.120
 that will be the modellbahner the 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.459
 modellbahner is interested in the above all 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.400
 We are loyal to the home of viessmann and kiwi 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.800
 the brand is still full 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.300
 continue to pay homage and say human 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.700
 great that we continue to do so 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.010
 So the idea is very old 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.660
 program is there and also something new there 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.350
 exactly and it will always be 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.790
 give something new sunday I say 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.130
 I think we have the right one 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.380
 made a decision and this 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.730
 cult objects the cult models will be 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.980
 continue to give it would be a pity if 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.470
 The brand would have disappeared from the market 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.760
 and reckon that we are within 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.750
 the next few months with the 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.380
 complete assortment again 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.320
 able to deliver 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.760
 matthias wissmann prefers it was a 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.070
 great statement from you to fullmer 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.260
 the confession so full man that one very much 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.090
 many model train friends very positive 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.800
 now understood we want 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.550
 them for the fair for the rest 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.860
 All the best in the rest of the day 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.150
 many many good ideas and then many years 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.980
 Let's see what's next next
