00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
access amount of sodium all right now it

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.839 
access amount of sodium all right now it
says<00:02:43.050> total<00:02:43.680> carbohydrates<00:02:44.430> 13

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
says total carbohydrates 13

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.369 
says total carbohydrates 13
carbohydrates<00:02:45.480> obviously<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.200> going<00:02:46.319> to

carbohydrates obviously it is going to

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.600 
carbohydrates obviously it is going to
have<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.530> lot<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.769> there's<00:02:47.129> going<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.459> lot

all<00:02:54.620> carbohydrate<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.840> dietary<00:02:56.840> fiber<00:02:57.170> is

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
all carbohydrate and dietary fiber is

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.780 
all carbohydrate and dietary fiber is
you<00:02:57.680> know<00:02:57.829> three<00:02:58.159> grams<00:02:58.780> 12%<00:03:00.340> 12%<00:03:01.340> dietary

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
you know three grams 12% 12% dietary

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.819 
you know three grams 12% 12% dietary
fiber<00:03:02.090> sugars<00:03:03.019> it's<00:03:03.230> three<00:03:03.560> grams<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:05.530> as<00:03:06.530> you

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
fiber sugars it's three grams and as you

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.710 
fiber sugars it's three grams and as you
can<00:03:06.950> see<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.280> says<00:03:07.489> protein<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.239> gives<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.599> you

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
can see it says protein it gives you you

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.509 
can see it says protein it gives you you
know<00:03:08.840> how<00:03:09.019> much<00:03:09.200> protein<00:03:09.409> per<00:03:09.799> serving<00:03:09.829> so

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
know how much protein per serving so

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.180 
know how much protein per serving so
there's<00:03:11.329> 12<00:03:11.840> grams<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.409> eat<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.709> whole<00:03:12.920> if

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
there's 12 grams you eat the whole if

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.530 
there's 12 grams you eat the whole if
you're<00:03:13.370> doing<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.700> whole<00:03:13.849> thing<00:03:14.060> it's<00:03:14.239> 12

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
you're doing the whole thing it's 12

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.449 
you're doing the whole thing it's 12
grams<00:03:14.840> you're<00:03:15.590> not<00:03:15.709> going<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:15.950> drink<00:03:16.129> just<00:03:16.400> a

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
grams you're not going to drink just a

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.800 
grams you're not going to drink just a
half<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.790> cup<00:03:16.819> you're<00:03:17.209> going<00:03:17.329> to<00:03:17.420> basically

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
half a cup you're going to basically

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.390 
half a cup you're going to basically
drink<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.260> whole<00:03:18.409> thing<00:03:18.440> most<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.159> the<00:03:19.220> time

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
drink the whole thing most of the time

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.920 
drink the whole thing most of the time
so<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:21.500> says<00:03:21.709> three<00:03:22.400> grams<00:03:22.760> if<00:03:23.359> there's<00:03:23.689> three

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
so it says three grams if there's three

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.930 
so it says three grams if there's three
grams<00:03:24.230> per<00:03:24.769> serving<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.489> there's<00:03:25.700> going<00:03:25.849> to<00:03:25.909> be

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
grams per serving so there's going to be

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.729 
grams per serving so there's going to be
12<00:03:26.299> grams<00:03:26.629> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.870> whole<00:03:27.019> thing<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.470> got<00:03:27.590> you

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
12 grams of the whole thing you got you

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.920 
12 grams of the whole thing you got you
got<00:03:27.859> to<00:03:27.980> take<00:03:28.099> that<00:03:28.129> into<00:03:28.310> consideration<00:03:28.930> and

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
got to take that into consideration and

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.420 
got to take that into consideration and
obviously<00:03:30.260> on<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.560> bottom<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.900> says<00:03:33.430> vitamin

also you know you also got to take into
consideration<00:03:56.659> that<00:03:56.690> this<00:03:57.230> food<00:03:57.889> label<00:03:58.340> you

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
consideration that this food label you

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.819 
consideration that this food label you
know<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.150> based<00:03:59.540> off<00:03:59.810> of<00:03:59.870> a<00:04:00.049> 2,000<00:04:00.799> calorie

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
know is based off of a 2,000 calorie

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.189 
know is based off of a 2,000 calorie
diet<00:04:02.079> so<00:04:03.079> what<00:04:03.949> they<00:04:04.129> mean<00:04:04.400> by<00:04:04.609> that<00:04:04.819> is<00:04:05.199> 2,000

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:06.199 
diet so what they mean by that is 2,000

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.610 
diet so what they mean by that is 2,000
calories<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:08.000> know<00:04:08.120> they're<00:04:08.810> assuming<00:04:09.199> that

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
calories you know they're assuming that

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.159 
calories you know they're assuming that
you're<00:04:09.769> taking<00:04:10.040> in<00:04:10.129> 2,000<00:04:10.669> calories<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.780> if

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
you're taking in 2,000 calories so if

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.379 
you're taking in 2,000 calories so if
you're<00:04:12.349> taking<00:04:12.709> in<00:04:12.859> more<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:14.060> know<00:04:14.209> they're
