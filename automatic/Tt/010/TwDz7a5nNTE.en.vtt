00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
this game mode will be obviously a lot

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.730 
this game mode will be obviously a lot
of<00:01:44.369> fun<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.240> obvious<00:01:45.840> reasons<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
of fun for you for obvious reasons and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.440 
of fun for you for obvious reasons and
once<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.970> kind<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> mediocre<00:01:48.960> crowd<00:01:49.619> dies<00:01:50.009> out

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
once the kind of mediocre crowd dies out

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.810 
once the kind of mediocre crowd dies out
a<00:01:51.450> little<00:01:51.899> bit<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.350> i<00:01:52.409> think<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.040> game<00:01:53.579> mode

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
a little bit more i think the game mode

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.230 
a little bit more i think the game mode
will<00:01:54.090> become<00:01:54.509> even<00:01:54.840> more<00:01:54.869> fun<00:01:55.579> and<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.180> more

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
will become even more fun and a lot more

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.080 
will become even more fun and a lot more
competitive<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:59.280> guys<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:02.399> yeah<00:02:02.640> overall

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
competitive for you guys so yeah overall

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.810 
competitive for you guys so yeah overall
for<00:02:03.840> mediocre<00:02:04.110> pilots<00:02:04.860> don't<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.520> see

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
for mediocre pilots don't really see

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.469 
for mediocre pilots don't really see
this<00:02:06.000> game<00:02:06.299> mode

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
this game mode

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.160 
this game mode
holding<00:02:08.890> their<00:02:09.890> interest<00:02:10.520> or<00:02:10.850> our<00:02:11.210> interest

for<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.190> long<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.850> do<00:02:13.970> believe<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.720> this

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
for that long but I do believe that this

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.470 
for that long but I do believe that this
will<00:02:15.050> be<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> good<00:02:15.680> game<00:02:16.310> mode<00:02:16.640> for<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.209> more

them out with heat seekers and chain

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.089 
them out with heat seekers and chain
guns<00:04:29.729> so<00:04:30.590> yeah<00:04:31.759> anyways<00:04:33.529> my<00:04:34.529> suggestion

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
guns so yeah anyways my suggestion

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.179 
guns so yeah anyways my suggestion
instead<00:04:35.909> of<00:04:36.029> taking<00:04:36.449> flares<00:04:37.169> or<00:04:37.499> ECM<00:04:38.069> jammer

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:38.189 
instead of taking flares or ECM jammer

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:44.779 
instead of taking flares or ECM jammer
is<00:04:38.819> to<00:04:39.389> take<00:04:39.629> the<00:04:41.449> fire<00:04:42.449> extinguisher<00:04:43.789> because

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
is to take the fire extinguisher because

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.409 
is to take the fire extinguisher because
often<00:04:45.180> times<00:04:45.210> when<00:04:45.719> a<00:04:46.430> if<00:04:47.430> you're<00:04:47.789> unable<00:04:47.999> to

break<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.659> lock<00:04:52.099> then<00:04:53.099> and<00:04:54.139> they<00:04:55.139> disable<00:04:55.770> your

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
break a lock then and they disable your

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.399 
break a lock then and they disable your
jet<00:04:56.189> with<00:04:56.430> their<00:04:56.580> heat<00:04:56.759> seekers<00:04:57.270> oftentimes<00:04:57.930> I

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
jet with their heat seekers oftentimes I

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.800 
jet with their heat seekers oftentimes I
