00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 Welcome to the organic farm we are 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.320
 here in the floating world of minecraft 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:16.800
 I am no longer ebel of 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:19.609
 keyboard and here sometimes by things such 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.609
 beautiful coast here 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.480
 we exchange the gold nuggets that it 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.840
 our money goes against the chips 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:38.690
 in here sitting here this playtime 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:47.239
 neither have not won 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:51.559
 have not won 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.129
 still have not won 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:00.049
 won 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:03.199
 but we won ok yes what is 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:06.049
 this is a slot machine in 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.630
 Minecraft specifically for multiplayer 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.880
 suitable as the server admin 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.290
 or throw slot machine can do there 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.409
 You can go out again here 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.180
 the tournament took out gold 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.750
 swap and now here 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.580
 how did I build it up? 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.430
 is not that complicated first 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.400
 time to put a team in here 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.540
 throws that tight push that abuts 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:44.650
 This causes aging on this cable 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:48.590
 what you should see here so cable 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.890
 stumbling, and redeemed a signal and recs 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.190
 from what the first thing that these 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.830
 sound of oneself which means yes 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.009
 now what has come in says 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.399
 some players year is okay then will 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.759
 the signal passed up here 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:10.729
 to all these will be dispensers 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.230
 dispenser times activated and that is 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.390
 actually the most important part 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.390
 because if you see here 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.440
 Unfortunately I did not care for ori 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.980
 and zombie swine moment it is one 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.800
 to one here either ship one 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:44.110
 If so, then he will be out here in the wall 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:52.180
 gets stuck or a zombie the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:03:01.290
 then here it falls here in the village 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.290
 then falls here actually falls inler 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.880
 so you die then and will be from here 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.490
 if the zombie here in Dorstenfeld 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.580
 redstone signal guided here 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.880
 turn that torch off that exactly 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.489
 same thing happens with the other three 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.580
 but now a one in one chance 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.160
 that you always win 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.110
 Well not really a gamble so 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
 even gambling but not so 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.500
 firmly 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:42.360
 that's why you need the whole thing 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:46.140
 You can build 23 or 100 times and then build 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.330
 you have a circuit here only if 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.640
 all three rescuers and torches so if 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.410
 a zombie is everywhere this is going to be 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.450
 signal off here if this 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.660
 signal is out gives this redstone 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.760
 Torch goes through splits yes 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.760
 once first to the sounds 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.040
 and if you won and here too 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:19.049
 this dispenser then activates all 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.620
 even down to the rear as the two 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.790
 signal too weak 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:32.730
 That happens if you do not use the devices 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:36.080
 corrects blabla so that too 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:43.050
 then back the profit 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:47.250
 this one plays and that's why 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.889
 great because you can decide well how 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.480
 we say good luck 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.670
 I want a really big one 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.630
 Gamble then I'll stop here 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:03.970
 all legal zombie zombies power 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:07.480
 because of that the dispenser has the choice 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.570
 fall between four times and once 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.550
 zombie that means one to four is the 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.450
 chance at one of part speak 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.460
 Overall , one train can have one 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.070
 you can somehow figure out I can 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:26.770
 do that and comments write something 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:29.010
 you do that's it on the whole 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.990
 now only a hint for the 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.610
 Completing come multiplayer yes 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.410
 so that nobody comes to steal the profit 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.830
 now only a small tip for the 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.650
 people who then build in multiplayer 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.979
 and have a backend server as well as ever 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.979
 t'aime 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.330
 there is a plugin that is called 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:06:01.950
 make detector with the chamber 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:04.210
 so you can build great things 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.260
 addiction is there again at youtube 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:11.950
 We sailor explained and then see 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:15.460
 you can build it that way if 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.510
 It passes through a signal and so on 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.010
 you can really look that 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:24.669
 not somebody somehow now 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:29.979
 comes with with cobblestone beck and says 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:32.320
 yes I link stone and then win and 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:36.880
 here again the acting with the the 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.539
 deceptive teuscher yes that basen big 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.280
 all 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:41.380
 You can go through this circuit here 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.580
 also under the casino or whatever 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.050
 always you want to do 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:50.509
 that's it I hope you liked it 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.259
 writes criticism or what do I know in the 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:57.710
 comments as you liked or 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:07:04.060
 what he wants to see next I can 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:04.060
 let's see what I can build and 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:12.129
 to do tutorials 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:12.129
 I hope you liked it and ciao
