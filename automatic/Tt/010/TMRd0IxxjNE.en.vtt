this is a passing and receiving drill

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.660 
this is a passing and receiving drill
it's<00:00:09.540> great<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:11.010> working<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.340> trapping

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
it's great for for working on trapping

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.180 
it's great for for working on trapping
on<00:00:12.030> receiving<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.690> ball<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.920> also

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
on receiving the ball and it's also

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.460 
on receiving the ball and it's also
worked<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.670> great<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.089> working<00:00:15.809> on<00:00:16.049> passing

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
worked it great for working on passing

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.109 
worked it great for working on passing
but<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> biggest<00:00:17.220> thing<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.550> reception<00:00:18.000> here

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
but the biggest thing is reception here

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.279 
but the biggest thing is reception here
that's<00:00:18.270> we're<00:00:18.390> doing<00:00:18.420> receiving<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> ball

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
that's we're doing receiving the ball

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.500 
that's we're doing receiving the ball
we're<00:00:19.590> focusing<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.609> correcting<00:00:21.270> an<00:00:21.359> error

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
we're focusing on correcting an error

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.810 
we're focusing on correcting an error
that<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.840> lot<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.199> players<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.550> they

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
that a lot of players have is that they

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.009 
that a lot of players have is that they
wait<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.330> ball<00:00:24.510> when<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> ball<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
wait for the ball when the ball is

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.540 
wait for the ball when the ball is
passed<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.439> them<00:00:25.590> instead<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.279> towards

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
passed to them instead of going towards

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.310 
passed to them instead of going towards
the<00:00:27.029> ball<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.420> towards<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> trajectory<00:00:28.289> of

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the ball going towards the trajectory of

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560 
the ball going towards the trajectory of
the<00:00:28.439> ball<00:00:28.590> that's<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.490> we<00:00:29.609> want<00:00:29.849> them<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.150> do

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the ball that's what we want them to do

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.900 
the ball that's what we want them to do
when<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> ball<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.560> being<00:00:31.650> passed<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.489> wanted

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
when the ball is being passed we wanted

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.549 
when the ball is being passed we wanted
to<00:00:33.030> read<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> ball<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.840> go<00:00:34.020> towards<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
to read the ball and go towards the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.160 
to read the ball and go towards the
trajectory<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> ball<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.750> consists<00:00:37.110> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
trajectory of the ball so it consists of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
trajectory of the ball so it consists of
four<00:00:37.410> lines<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.670> line<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:39.239> they're

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
four lines and this line here they're

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.180 
four lines and this line here they're
going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> pass<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.350> ball<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
going to pass the ball you see the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.860 
going to pass the ball you see the
dotted<00:00:41.399> white<00:00:41.670> line<00:00:42.270> that's<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> trick

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
dotted white line that's the trick

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.139 
dotted white line that's the trick
that's<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.680> path<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> ball<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> then

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
that's the the path of the ball and then

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.889 
that's the the path of the ball and then
the<00:00:45.329> solid<00:00:45.750> white<00:00:46.200> line<00:00:46.469> or<00:00:46.770> arrow<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the solid white line or arrow is the the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.900 
the solid white line or arrow is the the
path<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> player<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.579> they're<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
path of the player so they're going to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.880 
path of the player so they're going to
pass<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.510> ball<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:52.230> player<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
pass the ball this player is going to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.760 
pass the ball this player is going to
course<00:00:53.370> run<00:00:53.989> towards<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> ball<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.410> receive

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
course run towards the ball to receive

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
course run towards the ball to receive
because<00:00:56.370> we're<00:00:56.670> forcing<00:00:57.090> them<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.239> because

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
because we're forcing them to because

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.170 
because we're forcing them to because
this<00:00:58.050> light<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.680> player<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.879> point

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
this light here this player at the point

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.840 
this light here this player at the point
of<00:01:00.239> pass<00:01:00.480> they're<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> sprint<00:01:01.850> they're

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
of pass they're going to sprint they're

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.100 
of pass they're going to sprint they're
going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> try<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.270> take<00:01:03.480> off<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.809> try<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
going to try and take off and try and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.880 
going to try and take off and try and
beat<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.309> player<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> ball<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.590> see

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
beat this player to the ball so you see

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.100 
beat this player to the ball so you see
how<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.520> code<00:01:08.760> back<00:01:09.240> further<00:01:09.659> it's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
how we have this code back further it's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130 
how we have this code back further it's
not<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.400> same<00:01:11.610> distance<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.960> you're

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
not the same distance now if you're

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.990 
not the same distance now if you're
these<00:01:13.710> players<00:01:13.950> are<00:01:14.280> beating<00:01:14.670> these<00:01:14.760> players

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
these players are beating these players

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.149 
these players are beating these players
we<00:01:15.210> need<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> move<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.780> cone<00:01:16.020> further<00:01:16.890> back

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
we need to move this cone further back

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.219 
we need to move this cone further back
okay<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.479> actually<00:01:18.689> probably<00:01:18.900> move

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
okay and you can actually probably move

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.749 
okay and you can actually probably move
another<00:01:19.439> four<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:19.770> five<00:01:19.830> feet<00:01:20.189> back<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.610> make

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
another four or five feet back to make

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.690 
another four or five feet back to make
it<00:01:20.850> easier<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.630> player<00:01:22.580> after<00:01:23.580> they

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
