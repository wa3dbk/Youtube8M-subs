threading it through as you've probably
seen<00:00:53.239> previously<00:00:54.109> so<00:00:54.260> you've<00:00:54.379> got<00:00:54.499> a<00:00:54.530> good

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
seen previously so you've got a good

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.270 
seen previously so you've got a good
foot<00:00:55.579> or<00:00:56.269> 18<00:00:56.659> inches<00:00:57.440> or<00:00:59.859> call<00:01:00.859> it<00:01:01.010> what<00:01:01.129> you

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
like 50 cent 50 centimeters of rope at

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.430 
like 50 cent 50 centimeters of rope at
the<00:01:03.829> other<00:01:04.040> end<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.330> we've<00:01:05.510> got<00:01:05.690> one<00:01:05.930> but

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
the other end so we've got one but

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.350 
the other end so we've got one but
that's<00:01:06.620> not<00:01:06.920> safe<00:01:07.190> yet<00:01:07.490> because<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.210> whole

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
that's not safe yet because the whole

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.499 
that's not safe yet because the whole
thing<00:01:08.600> can<00:01:08.780> still<00:01:09.020> come<00:01:09.259> apart

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
thing can still come apart

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.310 
thing can still come apart
however<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:13.040> ends<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.460> right<00:01:13.610> direction

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
however the ends in the right direction

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.010 
however the ends in the right direction
so<00:01:15.320> looking<00:01:16.280> at<00:01:16.399> the<00:01:16.549> strands<00:01:16.909> that<00:01:17.360> come<00:01:17.630> from

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
so looking at the strands that come from

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.859 
so looking at the strands that come from
the<00:01:18.530> double<00:01:19.250> fisherman's<00:01:19.460> way<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:20.659> end

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
the double fisherman's way this end

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.190 
the double fisherman's way this end
comes<00:01:21.110> out<00:01:21.320> I<00:01:21.649> like<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:22.430> follow<00:01:22.969> that<00:01:23.119> I<00:01:23.600> like

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
got a good couple of feet second time

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.850 
got a good couple of feet second time
you<00:01:32.149> cross<00:01:32.390> over<00:01:34.750> back<00:01:35.750> through<00:01:36.140> two<00:01:36.530> loops

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
you cross over back through two loops

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.850 
you cross over back through two loops
pull<00:01:39.579> it<00:01:40.579> reasonably<00:01:41.060> tight<00:01:41.500> hold<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.649> two

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
reasonably generous tails and I

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.249 
reasonably generous tails and I
personally<00:01:54.320> am<00:01:54.409> more<00:01:54.829> than<00:01:54.859> happy<00:01:55.009> if<00:01:55.579> I<00:01:56.509> crank

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
personally am more than happy if I crank

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.649 
personally am more than happy if I crank
the<00:01:57.500> knot<00:01:57.710> side<00:01:58.039> I'm<00:01:58.369> perfectly<00:01:59.060> happy<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.420> up

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
so on tails that lengths very strong

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.140 
so on tails that lengths very strong
very<00:02:05.420> reliable
