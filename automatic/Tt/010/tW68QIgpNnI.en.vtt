a couple of them to that I think hip new

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.680 
a couple of them to that I think hip new
brakes<00:04:20.620> on<00:04:20.860> him<00:04:21.090> but<00:04:22.090> that<00:04:22.210> looks<00:04:22.390> like<00:04:22.540> an

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
brakes on him but that looks like an

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.840 
brakes on him but that looks like an
uber<00:04:23.050> week<00:04:23.230> I<00:04:23.590> looked<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.550> couldn't<00:04:24.730> find

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
uber week I looked and I couldn't find

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.500 
uber week I looked and I couldn't find
the<00:04:25.150> tip<00:04:29.250> second<00:04:30.250> one<00:04:30.340> I<00:04:30.430> found<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:31.150> was<00:04:31.270> full

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
the tip second one I found it was full

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.840 
the tip second one I found it was full
pretty<00:04:32.290> much<00:04:32.500> all<00:04:32.740> as<00:04:32.860> this<00:04:33.010> one<00:04:33.250> was<00:04:33.550> standing

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
pretty much all as this one was standing

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.680 
pretty much all as this one was standing
straight<00:04:34.330> up<00:04:34.450> like<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:35.050> in<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.320> dirt<00:04:36.690> and

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
straight up like this in the dirt and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.530 
straight up like this in the dirt and
that<00:04:37.720> side<00:04:38.140> looks<00:04:38.380> okay<00:04:38.770> but<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.880> side<00:04:40.210> here

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
that side looks okay but this side here

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:49.390 
that side looks okay but this side here
is<00:04:40.570> really<00:04:41.230> nice

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.570 

tip<00:04:50.030> broke<00:04:50.330> and<00:04:50.770> I'm<00:04:51.770> thinking<00:04:52.190> it's<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.430> new

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
tip broke and I'm thinking it's a new

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.110 
tip broke and I'm thinking it's a new
break<00:04:52.880> also<00:04:53.300> because<00:04:53.720> it's<00:04:53.990> got<00:04:54.290> I<00:04:55.030> don't<00:04:56.030> know

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
break also because it's got I don't know

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.700 
break also because it's got I don't know
what<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.419> is<00:04:56.479> I<00:04:56.780> don't<00:04:57.080> know<00:04:57.470> what<00:04:57.590> this

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
what this is I don't know what this

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.469 
what this is I don't know what this
comes<00:04:57.979> from<00:04:58.130> roots<00:04:58.540> nor<00:04:59.540> wat<00:04:59.810> that's

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
comes from roots nor wat that's

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.909 
comes from roots nor wat that's
especally<00:05:02.479> stuff<00:05:02.750> but<00:05:03.050> anyway<00:05:03.380> it<00:05:03.530> goes<00:05:03.710> right

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
especally stuff but anyway it goes right

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.040 
especally stuff but anyway it goes right
up<00:05:04.100> to<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.310> edge<00:05:04.490> that<00:05:04.820> doesn't<00:05:05.180> go<00:05:05.300> into<00:05:05.660> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
up to the edge that doesn't go into the
