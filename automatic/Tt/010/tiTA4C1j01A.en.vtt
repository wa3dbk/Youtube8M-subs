00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.719
 r 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
 With 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.289
 Now you wanted to run after a debilitating war 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.300
 their time 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.529
 then could 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.529
 Percent did not really hit 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.460
 Paper 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.089
 Lierow one must say I use the novel of the Eifel not some 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.410
 official opening Blender 2 5 5 but that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.550
 because soft that you often glander 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.180
 can not download herbal quark across borders 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.610
 that is clear that often call 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.080
 Dawkins already pre-installed 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.390
 offer very practical and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.760
 sda yes, I'll just show you now 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.620
 listen here 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.480
 at least everyone 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.540
 we open more of a user preferences 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.930
 around 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.610
 the menu 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.250
 here practiced in the act 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.590
 HÃ¼ser Preference then I go to relevance 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.390
 now is 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.999
 then we see Ana and Gallois without end 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.670
 because they are similar 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 can I take him to the company 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.900
 and 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.070
 Here, for example, we take this percent at Memmingen 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.380
 that he is practically completely open second division do not care 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.380
 Ulrich Thiessen makes a mouse click 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
 So wait, I'm already on it 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.940
 for alloys 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.530
 which now 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.490
 People from Klecken do not right-click on the object 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.800
 and we are skidding 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.340
 to the camera but just into nothing then I have this tandem with 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.459
 Mini skirt try 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.510
 in the context of this something like Alcatel importance 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.239
 al-rahman even 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.489
 that is very cool and 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.989
 it continues 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.949
 Lisandro Lopez again 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.769
 if we too 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.559
 and here the whole of Rome everywhere where human colon stands 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:40.789
 I'll show you that in this standard mini-wm 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.059
 this Mersch 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.059
 for MÃ¼nster 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.009
 around freeway currency 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.549
 and if we are now 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.919
 per hub business at the mersch 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.799
 they can 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.799
 that it is quiet 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.379
 wrong security lies 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.639
 because next to 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.639
 the whole is not clicked 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.269
 Phelps 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.269
 You have to be careful and make every effort 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.159
 Huml 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.789
 I want to watch the game me 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:52.829
 Here you can also install to download what I had so times 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.829
 Can I download the stuff I can do 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:04:00.079
 resumed in the sea for the many 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.939
 Weichert font back 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.019
 although this one has been here recently 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.999
 I want to see how here 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.189
 Great new things like sda 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.349
 Of course, things you do not need 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.080
 No 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.080
 OK 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.949
 Mon 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.289
 then we have other great things here VII 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.129
 To customers the solutions are looking for tamers 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.960
 So a partial draw the stuff completely 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.169
 Episode 1 5 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.129
 but 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.909
 would have to see for ourselves what we need 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.789
 Century it was to this vote 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.270
 he dances like I said on Levi like 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.879
 Victoria has been able to search the new job 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.110
 those countries want to fight for it 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.229
 the Wars then by my side 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.430
 and 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.430
 writes 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.539
