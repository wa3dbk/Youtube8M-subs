00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 honey come home I can not I'm 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.120
 trying to exploit the dow I'm alone 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.510
 minecraft 1.7 point 10 let's see a 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.510
 mod 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.949
 the question is that we are beyond 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.890
 some turrets a system of turrets 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.730
 pillars I do not know how to call it exactly 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.039
 what are you here 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.509
 pillar interdiction is but good we have 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.440
 on land a land of certain is and 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.660
 then the other three lands so 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.380
 projectiles now we will see it is the have 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.030
 normal entity 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.520
 let's see it here we go now of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.250
 tier 1 that has one is with four of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 piedrabuena two of cactus dye 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.190
 strict a fire hearts the load up 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.630
 the fire an interface and an iron 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.110
 we do two of tier 1 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.970
 and what's the use, let's see 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 and I think that this is fine because 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.650
 it's pretty clear 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.120
 here for example this we put it 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.010
 around houses is the tier 1 that 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.360
 It is the weakest but we put it on 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.180
 Around the house you have seen it 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.030
 we do two we can put it in a 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.990
 and in another corner of the house and when 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.300
 make 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.950
 they approach sayings or well rather not 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.850
 allows many young people to approach 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.509
 you see 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.490
 pushes us off the pillars of the 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.040
 question that we can make of land that 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.659
 is with the tier 1 4 of you now good 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.020
 ball because I see the creever out there like 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.020
 approaches 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:46.570
 and two of lapis lazuli a few heads of 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.520
 fire and one gold 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.159
 the point is that with this we can 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.100
 send further 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.770
 You see he left it quite then we have it 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.689
 of 3 which is the highest the highest rank 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.109
 of people pushes us further still 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.319
 which is with the 24 piedmontese 4 tier of 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.420
 restore a load of these fire and a 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:10.440
 diamond and this one that sends us also 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.870
 super far on the and Spanish 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.459
 beige but this for example to this one what 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.700
 is pushing towards you you want 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.790
 send it to this one you want to send it to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.489
 the best here 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.489
 It's a bit like that 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:36.409
 is super cool does not work with 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.010
 normal monsters only with hostiles is 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.010
 that makes me very funny 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.889
 the problem is that as you have seen 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.909
 times like changing the direction of 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.099
 this one that we've taken out there for 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.010
 example the best one that is here what 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.569
 want to send there 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.610
 that's why I say that that can be a 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.129
 problem because if we have our house 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.930
 here for example let's say we have the 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.489
 bed here 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.019
 this is the door of the house if 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.480
 Suddenly you give this to push him to 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.430
 Here we put the clipper inside 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.209
 From home 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.879
 it's an example that's why I say it's cool but 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.159
 same in certain areas, the same at home is 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.250
 a tad dangerous danger point plan because before 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.379
 they were thinking and I say one looks one 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.359
 payroll of mine you already know me that 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.859
 I'm very silly co sweet come home no 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.459
 can i'm trying to explode agenda 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.459
 I'm alone 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:34.540
 and then we have us going to see them 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.209
 a position both own axis the end is not going 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.829
 to rest is that they are nonsense 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.379
 look here we do not have these that are the 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.840
 of the projectile and it's a bit weird is 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:48.120
 with four of piedrabuena dos de cactus 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.980
 in putting here an arrow and iron is used 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.569
 in fact the characters are the same but 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.560
 they change the arrow by the load of 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.660
 fire as you are seeing 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.830
 and this is supposed to be what it does is 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.849
 dodge as it attracts projectiles 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.650
 that you put one against 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.870
 skeletons but it's not me 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.400
 I do not know I do not know 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.930
 but it's not clear I have all this I do not 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.590
 there are clippers, wait, let's put it 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.590
 outside 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.950
 OK 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.140
 because you push us you can not to the 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:27.880
 people man is worth now and this is 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.880
 suppose as I say let's see 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.409
 You see, it's super weird how this works 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.479
 because what it does is attract those who 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.759
 all the arrows are falling there 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.189
 they all fall to the three of the tier 3 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.080
 mola more good are they attack each other 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:47.100
 but you see that the arrows have gone almost 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.290
 all here 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.990
 as it protects you projectiles is 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.590
 pretty white skeleton and now for 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.410
 true 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.510
 It is very cool indeed they are giving us 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.060
 a lot of the time and stays 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.010
 almost everything around here as I can be 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.460
 very good to protect you because to the east 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.460
 you know this 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.880
 and a lot of people because this is done 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.710
 based powder arrows but is very real 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.760
 he said how these work but good he 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.100
 supposed to be for that for the 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.450
 projectiles to avoid being given to you 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.340
 but it's good from the dead you have a 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.740
 bot curio 7 east of the turrets mola 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.330
 a lot to dodge or to carry 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:31.620
 the bugs attack by sack 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:34.300
 I love my god inside the ground 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.490
 I suppose more than 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.490
 they can go crazy for you 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.480
 but I'm curious now I'm putting 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.430
 all of 13 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.570
 that this can not be good and we are going to 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.570
 put a criterion that does not burn 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:59.540
 I want to try things has come out not 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.540
 no no no no it is not within 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.540
 is inside is not supposed to be there 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.340
 many forces pushing him 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.610
 but I'm curious now 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.610
 For this 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.990
 they do not move but the others 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.990
 they love 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.000
 here it becomes very good as you see it is 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.150
 pretty cool and useful especially this 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.250
 dodging bugs cool a lot 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:35.700
 I love Spanish but good in itself 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.200
 description is for 1.7 point 10 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.210
 if it is shaped etc as always 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.210
 I think about the heap 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.370
 for the most indicated and we are
