 the chinese popular opening did that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.429

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.980

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.330
 that they sold them in the intertoys 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.859
 that she thought it would be a nice idea or 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.510
 odd three of those you yes that 's it 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.920

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.329
 so normally you have 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.230
 now a very nice cardboard 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.969

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.149
 because it is nice to just be you 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.079
 take it once in my youth 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 because I used to do this of course 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.440
 and I just mean effe 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.969
 for the joke a lot and you go this fat 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.469
 Well naturally find here a like 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.910
 if you would like more of this again 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.320
 then you shouldn't let this out again 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.370
 let's know in the comments 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 otherwise it would be the other two packets 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.270
 just make it on screen 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.650
 let's start formatting 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.930
 from that you grab a very fat one 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.979
 black shares guard on top of you 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.510
 Seeing that pokémon just isn't 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.130
 racist is an orange charizard and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.390
 black jerry your it is all we can 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.500
 are going to open it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.030
 I'm really still curious 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.650
 how it looks i see myself there on it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.700
 screen still nice to see myself 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.259
 I do n't know the balls ponders well 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.430
 is recorded and I just go too 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.900
 I am wondering then in this 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.310
 can open viewing angles 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.509
 luckily I have the language good attitude 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.040
 facades can actually be ingrained on 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.479
 I am more permanent that I really do a whole lot 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.189
 annoying attitude for my room 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.720
 the very uncomfortable to it too 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.579
 and of course you have a question 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.960
 how I'm going to grab this normally open 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.549
 I think I can do that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.140
 get into my know the i can really 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.700
 Never make normal things that you 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.290
 kind of a gun so leave it here 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.700
 we'll see if I can get over it 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.930
 a decent way so i don't 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.680
 a pick up again mole 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.680
 that is something about which 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 solé again that you are my girlfriends 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.939
 have it revealed 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.939
 rest in peace playstation 3 controller 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.090
 well that is at least down here 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.200
 malawi opened up more that was him again 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.910
 so what to expect in general 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.540
 is therefore not something that really annoys me 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.130
 suprised 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.080
 I have a very cool charizard here 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.400

 like behind and then maybe that I go 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.680

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.390

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.709

 generally pretty epic from that 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.709

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.299

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.380
 by the way a then their comment so that 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.239
 is actually a card that is not itself 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.130
 but you do get one so it is 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.410

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.910

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.930
 just for a moment this is one 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.430
 a reverse and see you can see 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.800
 he is also a special together like one 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.060
 very nice tool and then let me go 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.380
 never go on well in block so that 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.600

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.430
 spectacularly so I did n't believe 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.750

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.950
 from well I'm gonna get your epic card 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.030
 it is also only it is funny that 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.710
 so actually twice the same 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.030
 maps where both and another 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.900
 for what is generally is whole 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.520
 rare 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.750

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.830
 hard like your rooms there i am 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.120
 super happy with it 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.440
 if you look very epic out of love 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.390
 can see it is an asterisk so that 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.620
 is a hard job and so they are the 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.900
 two cards that we have drawn 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.370

 and then make music where I have it often 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.890
 then of course it also costs money cato 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.120
 don't do it very often but suggest 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.800
