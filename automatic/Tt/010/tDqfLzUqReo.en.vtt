00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.660
 schedule

 I remind you that I currently reside in 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.269
 USA for reasons of studies but let's go 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:30.710
 how is the title as a game announcing 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.989
 the 25th in the amount of messages that I 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.269
 they have arrived for good and that they have 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.670
 basically arrived comments and 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.960
 comments on the facebook page 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.730
 messages through the website that 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.129
 I remind you that if you want to talk 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.720
 with me you can talk to me through 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.510
 of the page time by the way forgive that 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.769
 we initial the boy of this that 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.080
 right now I 'm realizing the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.530
 noise that was making but let's see it's worth 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.879
 guys how they play ever in 2025 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.220
 many of you have told me that 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.650
 you have bought him 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.960
 the season pass 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.140
 no pardon that you reserve stage the game 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.420
 and that you can not play between 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.470
 you know said Nestor and that you charge for 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.470
 one if you can not play 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.119
 guys I 'm not loving anything that 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.399
 it is clear but the content of 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.850
 not so 225 enters a section that is 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.170
 called bonus at least in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.289
 better bonuses also calls them 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.250
 bonus maybe it's your name 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.250
 bonus 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.260
 inside that is they are looking for departure 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.880
 you can choose the hard game because 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.030
 teams signed down but you have a 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.250
 section called bonus or 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.830
 bonus I'm not too sure in this 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.840
 section is characterized because only 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.380
 there are the smallest maps including 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.899
 never in 2025 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.329
 and another question is how do I play with 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.030
 zombies I have the little boy but I do not know what 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.500
 but I do not know a consumerism buys me 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.840
 the baby birthing I can not when they are 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.969

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.630

 a downloadable content later 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.160

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.660
 225 for those who want to play them and 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.349
 that are confirming both my but 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.780
 they still do not notice 225 in and basically 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.090
 I wanted to resolve this doubt for users 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.120

 game and I do not know does not show up in any 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.900
 side I'm not really sure the truth 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.689
 surely what 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.019
 is that I do not know I'm not very sure 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.120
 I have xbox but look at surely 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.209

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.319

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.500
 once you have downloaded a 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.900
