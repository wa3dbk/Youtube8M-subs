00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
then after forming the group we have to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.300 
then after forming the group we have to
establish<00:02:16.120> we<00:02:16.690> have<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.900> make<00:02:17.310> program

was have a very good leadership they can

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.129 
was have a very good leadership they can
organize<00:04:02.079> everything<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.540> annual<00:04:04.780> plan

after<00:04:05.560> we<00:04:05.680> make<00:04:05.889> a<00:04:05.919> plan<00:04:06.400> they<00:04:07.180> can<00:04:07.449> lead<00:04:07.720> by

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
after we make a plan they can lead by

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.270 
after we make a plan they can lead by
themselves<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:09.449> implement<00:04:10.449> the<00:04:10.599> program<00:04:11.280> so

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
themselves to implement the program so

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.280 
themselves to implement the program so
that's<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.699> really<00:04:13.329> significant<00:04:14.019> change<00:04:14.169> that
