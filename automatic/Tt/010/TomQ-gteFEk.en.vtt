right wave I knew they were the waves
are<00:01:13.030> there<00:01:13.380> fortunately<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:14.440> just<00:01:14.710> picked<00:01:14.920> the

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
are there fortunately I just picked the

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.740 
are there fortunately I just picked the
wrong<00:01:15.040> ones<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:15.880> know<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.060> try<00:01:16.300> to<00:01:16.360> pick<00:01:16.570> the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
wrong ones you know I try to pick the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.109 
wrong ones you know I try to pick the
the<00:01:16.780> first<00:01:17.410> one<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.979> set<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.490> thought<00:01:18.940> was

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
the first one of the set I thought was

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.930 
the first one of the set I thought was
it<00:01:19.300> would<00:01:19.930> be<00:01:19.960> better<00:01:20.229> but<00:01:20.470> Hardy<00:01:20.920> got<00:01:21.789> the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
it would be better but Hardy got the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.359 
it would be better but Hardy got the
ones<00:01:22.119> behind<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.899> guess<00:01:23.289> his<00:01:23.740> waves<00:01:24.130> were

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
ones behind and I guess his waves were

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.760 
ones behind and I guess his waves were
better<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:25.090> with<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.990> he<00:01:26.289> got<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.590> highest

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
better and with that he got the highest

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.320 
better and with that he got the highest
scores<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.920> was<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:30.069> an<00:01:30.220> amazing<00:01:30.520> event<00:01:30.850> none
