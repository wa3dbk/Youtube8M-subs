00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.140
 that was not done to it's 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.440
 she also noticed German yet when comes the moment of 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.099
 compare their classes and another without additives 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.099
 they will be able to be proud of the result 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.869
 There is no photo 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.419
 and for the consumer either 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.960
 but what exactly do we find in these additives 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.819
 that make light products 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.819
 and are we sufficiently informed about their composition 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.870
 it's david edged a few miles from brussels I got 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.820
 went for the answers 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.840
 at the end of this industrial zone 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.180
 hides a very discreet line 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.410
 subsidiary of one of the largest European chemical groups 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.410
 one of the most used additives in the industry is manufactured 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.800
 the case is 41 years old 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.180
 more commonly called initiative 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.440
 and the commercial manager of the machined 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.000
 Michel van den Berghe 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.930
 is proud to show us 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.930
 everything you can do with its miracle product 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.930
 while Montpellier 0-1 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.820
 the principal education of a salaried college 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.840
 the world 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 the food sector is 2% a year the application 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.350
 at the World level 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.530
 to succeed the double 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.860
 the lightest judged the first market for him it's the candies pez 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.870
 but we also know Latin because if in pharmaceutical cells 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.090
 photo dandruff 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.720
 and even shampoos 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.120
 me then% 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.110
 the members of this panel 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.049
 but for that 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.530
 you have to produce more and more 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.840
 so here the zine is running at full speed 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.000
 and the famous gelatin of Michel van den Berghe 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.880
 here it comes out 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 at the end of the chain 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.370
 prada is bitter 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.830
 it's his spaghetti 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.710
 sticking to the fingers 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.810
 once the ring 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.469
 their sailboat 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.469
 All rights reserved 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.689
 three or four days of transformation 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.099
 in the bowels of a factory or these huge vats 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.319
 filled with acid and boiling water 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.039
 make a dampness prevail 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.969
 tropical 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.689
 and in the middle of this stuffy atmosphere 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.569
 there is a detail that strikes the visitor 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.749
 and who enters 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.749
 to the most protected premises of the factory 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:48.919
 a pungent smell 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.859
 dacic burnt distress 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.939
 who floats on the whole site 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.379
 to the outside of the machined 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.209
 and the reason for this smell 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.249
 there she is 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.689
 it's the material 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.799
 with which gelatin is made 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.239
 the sa4r 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.939
 this will bring both fault 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.459
 the agreement of the pork skin that arrive by whole pallets in its factory 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.559
 a raw material that costs him almost nothing 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.559
 and they buy all over Europe 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.309
 all a report yes 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:21.289
 we can see 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:22.749
 and every day 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:27.159
 nearly 150 tons of pork rind waiting according to garp 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.629
 to be devoured by a steel monster 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.629
 evocative name 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.919
 thanks to this cheap raw material 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.349
 michel van den berghe manages to sell his gelatin at less than 5 euros per kilo 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.999
 an unbeatable price that we constantly need new 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:01.139
 markets 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.369
 but who is doing well right now 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:06.499
 it is precisely the light products market 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:09.499
 the tax is not perfect but it paid 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.419
 here is co-signed 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.759
 light agora 40% 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.759
 then learn to choose going on the terrace 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.849
 I saw things from the same angle the biggest brands lanson 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.689
 in March this year a crime 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.779
 or the hope of change 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.120
 here is a fly at home under the name of the estuary 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.139
 then a product for the next hours 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.539
 so with less fat 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.080
 so to stabilize 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.150
 the product 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.150
 for matignon that have been produced in the design team 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.689
 a product that manufacturers do not hesitate to use in large 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:49.800
 amount 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.110
 the only problem 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.039
 I know he sometimes forgets to write it on the labels 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.389
 when we look at them we become the gelatin 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.740
 not the origin of the product 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.110
 he shot me but he is the cause of the gelatin why 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.790
 I'm not from when is that the problem they hosted with 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.790
 it 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.580
 subsequently barred from the promise made at this age it is a very subject 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.509
 sensitive 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.509
 asus still has some 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:25.089
 the Jewish Muslim community and others 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.860
 with the problem launch with that 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.530
 and it would be disappointing when they went to the pump 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.729
 buyers do not know if it takes 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.289
 the solution 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.870
 but it's true that good 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.870
 because suddenly it goes from the port of marseille to apply 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.270
 other weight problem 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.270
 partnerships 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.639
 a question that leaves michel van den berg speechless 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.490
 and to which no agrifood brand has wished 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.360
 reply 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.919
 despite our many requests 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.520
 to believe that pork gelatin is a subject he prefers to stay 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.099
 discreet
