ready to go this early but what we did

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.280 
ready to go this early but what we did
is<00:02:13.600> we<00:02:13.630> had<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.960> fellow<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:14.920> has<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> plastic

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
is we had a fellow that has a plastic

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.800 
is we had a fellow that has a plastic
multi<00:02:17.290> machine<00:02:17.530> coming<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.550> he's<00:02:19.510> already

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
multi machine coming in and he's already

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.930 
multi machine coming in and he's already
as<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.590> see<00:02:20.830> here<00:02:21.070> he's<00:02:21.280> already<00:02:21.520> got<00:02:21.790> the

as you can see here he's already got the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.170 
as you can see here he's already got the
multi<00:02:22.330> laid<00:02:22.800> we've<00:02:23.800> already<00:02:24.010> got<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.460> receded

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
multi laid we've already got it receded

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.470 
multi laid we've already got it receded
into<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.650> winter<00:02:26.920> rye<00:02:27.130> which<00:02:27.460> is<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.820> tall

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
into to the winter rye which is the tall

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.170 
into to the winter rye which is the tall
growing<00:02:28.900> grain<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.620> clover<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.850> under

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
growing grain and clover it's under

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.140 
growing grain and clover it's under
seeded<00:02:31.510> with<00:02:31.630> clover<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:33.130> we're<00:02:33.760> doing<00:02:33.910> that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
seeded with clover and we're doing that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.020 
seeded with clover and we're doing that
basically<00:02:34.600> for<00:02:34.900> weed<00:02:35.140> control<00:02:35.850> we've<00:02:36.850> got

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
basically for weed control we've got

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.720 
basically for weed control we've got
about<00:02:37.410> anywhere<00:02:38.410> from<00:02:38.680> eight<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.190> ten<00:02:39.400> feet<00:02:39.670> in

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
about anywhere from eight to ten feet in

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.470 
about anywhere from eight to ten feet in
between<00:02:39.970> rows<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.520> what<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.700> allow<00:02:43.060> us<00:02:43.090> to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
between rows and what that allow us to

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.340 
between rows and what that allow us to
do<00:02:43.660> is<00:02:44.020> one<00:02:44.590> window<00:02:44.950> when<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.450> rye<00:02:46.990> grain

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
do is one window when the the rye grain

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.140 
do is one window when the the rye grain
is<00:02:47.500> really<00:02:47.710> tall<00:02:47.950> we<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.430> we<00:02:48.670> can<00:02:48.820> come<00:02:49.030> and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
is really tall we can we can come and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.600 
is really tall we can we can come and
sickle<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.630> down<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.200> it'll<00:02:50.350> actually<00:02:50.610> it'll

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
sickle it down and it'll actually it'll

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.460 
sickle it down and it'll actually it'll
actually<00:02:51.790> cool<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.630> plastic<00:02:53.080> mulch<00:02:53.260> down

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
actually cool the plastic mulch down

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.290 
actually cool the plastic mulch down
when<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.770> gets<00:02:53.920> real<00:02:54.130> hot<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.240> other

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
when it gets real hot but the other

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.760 
when it gets real hot but the other
thing<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.720> we'll<00:02:55.930> be<00:02:56.110> able<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.290> go<00:02:56.410> in<00:02:56.560> here<00:02:56.590> and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
thing is we'll be able to go in here and

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.620 
thing is we'll be able to go in here and
mow<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.340> between<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.820> rows<00:02:58.060> instead<00:02:58.360> of

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
mow in between the rows instead of

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.870 
mow in between the rows instead of
having<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.870> cultivate<00:02:59.470> so<00:03:00.430> we've<00:03:00.580> got<00:03:00.760> the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
having to cultivate so we've got the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.910 
having to cultivate so we've got the
plastic<00:03:01.090> mulch<00:03:01.510> which<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.020> a<00:03:02.050> great<00:03:02.320> weed

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
plastic mulch which is a great weed

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.560 
plastic mulch which is a great weed
barrier<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.610> then<00:03:03.970> we'll<00:03:04.150> have<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.740> the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
barrier and then we'll have the the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.660 
barrier and then we'll have the the
ability<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.960> mobile<00:03:08.350> site<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.740> so<00:03:08.980> hopefully

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
ability to mobile site it so hopefully

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.400 
ability to mobile site it so hopefully
to<00:03:09.760> keep<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.060> weeds<00:03:10.240> down<00:03:10.570> because<00:03:11.200> it's

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
to keep the weeds down because it's

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.940 
to keep the weeds down because it's
basically<00:03:12.420> an<00:03:13.420> all-consuming<00:03:13.810> job<00:03:14.380> on<00:03:14.650> you

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
basically an all-consuming job on you

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.320 
basically an all-consuming job on you
know<00:03:15.070> something<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.580> size<00:03:15.820> when<00:03:16.209> you're

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
know something this size when you're

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.030 
know something this size when you're
trying<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.930> fight<00:03:17.170> weed<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:17.709> that's<00:03:17.890> really

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
trying to fight weed so that's really

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.520 
trying to fight weed so that's really
the<00:03:18.280> purpose<00:03:18.520> behind<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.330> in<00:03:20.230> order<00:03:20.410> again

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
the purpose behind it and in order again

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.500 
the purpose behind it and in order again
we<00:03:20.770> had<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.040> lay<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.550> time<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.880> year<00:03:21.910> in

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
we had to lay it this time of year in

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.020 
we had to lay it this time of year in
order<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.410> allow<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:25.260> rye<00:03:26.260> grain<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.880> get

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
order to allow the the rye grain to get

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.350 
order to allow the the rye grain to get
tall<00:03:28.300> enough<00:03:28.600> by<00:03:29.140> springtime<00:03:29.830> you<00:03:30.430> know<00:03:30.580> I'm

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
tall enough by springtime you know I'm

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.080 
tall enough by springtime you know I'm
talking<00:03:31.720> about<00:03:31.780> probably<00:03:32.350> may<00:03:32.760> May<00:03:33.760> when<00:03:33.940> it

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
talking about probably may May when it

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.370 
talking about probably may May when it
really<00:03:34.360> starts<00:03:34.660> getting<00:03:34.870> warm<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.290> then

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
really starts getting warm and then

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.199 
really starts getting warm and then
we'll<00:03:35.500> be<00:03:35.620> able<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.830> sickle<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.340> down<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:36.940> then

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
we'll be able to sickle it down and then

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.509 
we'll be able to sickle it down and then
we'll<00:03:37.390> just<00:03:37.420> have<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.830> once<00:03:38.830> it's<00:03:39.040> settled<00:03:39.370> down

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
we'll just have a once it's settled down

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.670 
we'll just have a once it's settled down
they'll<00:03:39.790> just<00:03:39.970> be<00:03:40.120> rows<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.600> clover<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.290> in

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
they'll just be rows of clover and in

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.710 
they'll just be rows of clover and in
between<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.220> plastic<00:03:42.700> which<00:03:43.209> we<00:03:43.390> can<00:03:43.540> then<00:03:43.570> go

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
between the plastic which we can then go

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.080 
between the plastic which we can then go
go<00:03:44.350> in<00:03:44.530> with<00:03:44.739> just<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.070> railer<00:03:45.610> mower<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.060> mow

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
go in with just a railer mower and mow

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.150 
go in with just a railer mower and mow
it<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:46.959> that'll<00:03:47.140> make<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.560> whole<00:03:47.739> lot<00:03:47.769> easier

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
it so that'll make it a whole lot easier

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.990 
it so that'll make it a whole lot easier
on<00:03:48.400> weed<00:03:48.700> control<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.890> as<00:03:50.890> we're<00:03:51.070> heading<00:03:51.190> as

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
on weed control and as we're heading as

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.860 
on weed control and as we're heading as
