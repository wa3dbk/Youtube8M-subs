00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 So today it's about fat because fat helps 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.919
 not only in weight loss and 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.360
 performance enhancing but is whole 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.330
 By the way, it is also vitally important 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.390
 when you are which fat by how much you 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:26.430
 of which is fat and wants 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:36.809
 explain today there is the once 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 saturated fat can remember 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.379
 this fixed at room temperature 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.870
 for example butter or lard and 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.379
 but is still in sausage and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.360
 cream 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.329
 then there are the trans fat ones 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.350
 even saturated fats keep this content in 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.100
 bockhorn 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.770
 I love popcorn chips fries or 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.960
 ready pizza on which you should if it 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.250
 really do not go because they have 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.980
 Bad influence on the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.489
 Cholesterol It's called heart disease 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.040
 can 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.619
 Generating trans fat is easy 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.799
 and polyunsaturated fats not 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.220
 oils such as rapeseed oil olive oil linseed oil 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.009
 walnut oil and soybean oil or are included 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.479
 yes still in avocados or seeds 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.729
 that is, if you are long, for example 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.470
 not off then you can just do it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.409
 a bit slow together 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.340
 for example, in salad easy 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.340
 unsaturated fats 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.689
 can be produced by the body itself 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:49.659
 become 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:51.579
 the polyunsaturated fats too 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.259
 Essential fats are called 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.189
 vital for the body and 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.829
 our will pay in omega 3 wines 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.590
 Oil pipe tuna or salmon and in 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.140
 omega 6 grapeseed soya and wheat 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.659
 products which fed should actually 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.759
 cooking says olive oil like to use 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.310
 are cooked at low temperature 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.930
 the immoral fat ends quickly 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.209
 destroyed and traded to their structure 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.099
 to be harmful, that is saturated 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.940
 In this case, fat is better for cooking 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.900
 and roast 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.269
 there are coconut oil grapefruit or butter on the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.269
 Best for suitable and soybean oil 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.560
 walnut oil the unsaturated fats can 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.480
 then just a little bit over the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.920
 make salad or into court with it 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.980
 you are optimally supplied 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.370
 So, feast has nine kilocalories per 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.370
 gram 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:48.409
 is very high in calories but that 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:50.810
 should not scare off because greasy that 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.730
 means when you take fat in the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.980
 I'll tell you in a moment 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.739
 save you the calories one without the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.730
 fat would actually have taken to the 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.049
 So summarize 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.120
 25 to 35 percent of the carin 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.099
 Admission requests should be made in bold 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.010
 that means its basic turnover of 2,000 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.549
 kilocalories a day is 65 grams 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.409
 fat 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.959
 they should be mostly out 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.849
 unsaturated fats insist that he eg 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.699
 In the daytime full of nuts is too 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.949
 recommend or avocado a bit of oil 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:25.010
 on the salad or salmon and 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:28.010
 tuna should be the saturated fat 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.959
 only one-third of the fat content of the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.069
 Daily necessities are here 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.810
 mostly from natural 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.780
 to win dairy products if they 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.019
 not out of the hat and please do not off 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.609
 rock pizza so that 's it for me 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.729
 I hope I was able to help you a lot 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:46.310
