00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
think the one I have right here unless

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.430 
think the one I have right here unless
you<00:00:54.650> are<00:00:55.030> unless<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.210> have<00:00:56.300> a<00:00:56.450> very<00:00:56.750> zoomed<00:00:57.260> in

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.960 
you are unless you have a very zoomed in
lens<00:00:57.620> if<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.040> have<00:00:58.160> sort<00:00:58.490> of<00:00:58.550> a<00:00:58.640> wide<00:00:58.820> angle

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.660 
lens if you have sort of a wide angle
lens<00:00:59.150> then<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.980> might<00:01:01.190> get<00:01:01.340> some<00:01:01.550> of<00:01:01.610> the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
lens then you might get some of the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.970 
lens then you might get some of the
tripod<00:01:02.060> legs<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.450> you<00:01:02.900> can't<00:01:03.320> use<00:01:03.560> a<00:01:03.590> tripod

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
tripod legs in you can't use a tripod

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.270 
tripod legs in you can't use a tripod
like<00:01:04.400> this<00:01:04.580> one<00:01:04.790> because<00:01:05.120> this<00:01:05.330> one<00:01:06.280> won't

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
like this one because this one won't

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880 
like this one because this one won't
like<00:01:08.030> taupe<00:01:08.360> like<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:08.840> if<00:01:09.230> you<00:01:09.470> wanted<00:01:09.740> to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
like taupe like this if you wanted to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.700 
like taupe like this if you wanted to
like<00:01:10.010> move<00:01:10.190> your<00:01:10.340> camera<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.710> portrait

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
like move your camera to a portrait

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.830 
like move your camera to a portrait
position<00:01:13.430> this<00:01:13.580> one<00:01:13.820> actually<00:01:14.180> has<00:01:14.480> a<00:01:14.510> moving

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
position this one actually has a moving

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.700 
position this one actually has a moving
head<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.230> you<00:01:15.320> need<00:01:15.620> to<00:01:15.860> have<00:01:15.980> a<00:01:16.040> moving<00:01:16.430> head

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
head so you need to have a moving head

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.590 
head so you need to have a moving head
technically<00:01:18.710> I<00:01:18.950> guess<00:01:18.980> you<00:01:19.640> could<00:01:20.210> do<00:01:20.420> this

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
technically I guess you could do this

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.600 
technically I guess you could do this
like<00:01:20.950> like<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.390> but<00:01:23.390> if<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.590> tried<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.130> hold

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
like like that but if you tried to hold

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.120 
like like that but if you tried to hold
it<00:01:25.880> then<00:01:26.540> this<00:01:27.110> thing<00:01:27.409> would<00:01:27.560> kind<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:27.890> poke

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
it then this thing would kind of poke

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.160 
it then this thing would kind of poke
you<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:28.880> don't<00:01:29.090> know<00:01:29.330> that<00:01:29.360> if<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:30.020> was

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
like I'm just trying to picture what

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.030 
like I'm just trying to picture what
would<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.600> would<00:02:41.600> be<00:02:41.739> instead<00:02:42.739> of<00:02:42.800> having

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
would that would be instead of having

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.460 
would that would be instead of having
where<00:02:43.790> my<00:02:44.060> hand<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.989> would<00:02:45.080> be<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.290> one

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
where my hand is that would be the one

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.550 
where my hand is that would be the one
so<00:02:45.800> yeah<00:02:46.489> so<00:02:47.090> there<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.360> go<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.870> what<00:02:48.050> you<00:02:48.200> need

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
so yeah so there you go so what you need

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.890 
so yeah so there you go so what you need
to<00:02:48.620> do<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.830> tighten<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.190> like<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.900> think

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
to do is tighten it like this think

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.199 
to do is tighten it like this think
about<00:02:51.080> tight<00:02:51.430> make<00:02:52.430> sure<00:02:52.459> it's<00:02:52.730> very<00:02:52.910> tight

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
about tight make sure it's very tight

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.610 
about tight make sure it's very tight
because<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.780> kind<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:53.959> breaks<00:02:54.200> actually<00:02:54.590> I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
because it kind of breaks actually I

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.640 
because it kind of breaks actually I
thought<00:02:54.830> this<00:02:55.160> tripod<00:02:55.550> then<00:02:56.239> mount<00:02:56.750> your

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
thought this tripod then mount your

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.440 
thought this tripod then mount your
camera<00:02:57.680> on<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.700> might<00:02:58.820> not<00:02:58.940> be<00:02:59.060> able<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.269> see

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
camera on you might not be able to see

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.850 
camera on you might not be able to see
it<00:02:59.540> because<00:02:59.690> I<00:02:59.780> can't<00:02:59.989> even<00:03:00.080> see<00:03:00.410> where<00:03:00.650> my

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
it because I can't even see where my
