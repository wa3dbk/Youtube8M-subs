one<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.060> we're<00:00:24.180> doing<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.720> gonna<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
one that we're doing it's gonna have a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.099 
one that we're doing it's gonna have a
bubble<00:00:25.710> effect<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.490> around<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.300> tree<00:00:27.570> so

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
bubble effect going around the tree so

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.259 
bubble effect going around the tree so
I've<00:00:28.320> started<00:00:28.619> by<00:00:28.800> cutting<00:00:29.250> my<00:00:29.369> burlap<00:00:29.789> into

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I've started by cutting my burlap into

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.450 
I've started by cutting my burlap into
strips<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.170> we're<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:32.130> wrapping

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
strips and we're going to be wrapping

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.660 
strips and we're going to be wrapping
these<00:00:32.940> strips<00:00:33.480> around<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.649> tree<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
these strips around the tree now the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.430 
these strips around the tree now the
tree<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.210> I'm<00:00:36.329> using<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.110> actually

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
tree that I'm using here is actually

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.100 
tree that I'm using here is actually
just<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.770> white<00:00:38.160> styrofoam<00:00:38.910> cone<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.930> I've

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
just a white styrofoam cone that I've

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.319 
just a white styrofoam cone that I've
covered<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.860> craft<00:00:41.219> paper<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> covered

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
covered with craft paper now I covered

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.720 
covered with craft paper now I covered
it<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.420> craft<00:00:42.780> paper<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.379> two<00:00:43.410> reasons<00:00:44.010> one

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
it with craft paper for two reasons one

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.729 
it with craft paper for two reasons one
I<00:00:45.059> think<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> hot<00:00:45.750> glue<00:00:46.020> sticks<00:00:46.440> better

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
I think that the hot glue sticks better

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.340 
I think that the hot glue sticks better
if<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.190> use<00:00:47.219> paper<00:00:47.789> around<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:49.140> we

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
if you use paper around it and two we

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990 
if you use paper around it and two we
don't<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> white<00:00:50.190> styrofoam

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
don't want to see the white styrofoam

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.619 
don't want to see the white styrofoam
underneath<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.989> through<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> burlap<00:00:53.629> so

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
underneath it through the burlap so

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.900 
underneath it through the burlap so
we're<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:54.930> gonna<00:00:55.140> start<00:00:55.530> by<00:00:55.800> seeing<00:00:56.640> how

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
I'm gonna put a little more hot glue

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.910 
I'm gonna put a little more hot glue
just<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.520> reinforce<00:02:03.819> it<00:02:04.270> on<00:02:04.359> the<00:02:04.479> back<00:02:04.630> side

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.979 

just<00:02:11.920> continue<00:02:12.610> around<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.060> rest<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.840> way

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
just continue around the rest of the way

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.170 
just continue around the rest of the way
if<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:14.860> measured<00:02:15.190> correctly<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.760> should<00:02:15.790> meet

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
if we measured correctly it should meet

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.660 
if we measured correctly it should meet
up<00:02:16.329> in<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.540> back<00:02:16.720> which<00:02:16.989> it<00:02:17.140> does<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:18.549> then

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
up in the back which it does and then

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.979 
up in the back which it does and then
we're<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.819> gonna<00:02:19.030> put<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> little<00:02:19.690> bit<00:02:19.870> of

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
we're just gonna put a little bit of

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.160 
we're just gonna put a little bit of
glue<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.440> back<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:21.720> secure<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.989> right

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
glue on the back and secure that right

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.240 
glue on the back and secure that right
in<00:02:23.500> place<00:02:23.739> as<00:02:23.980> well<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:26.349> now<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.769> see<00:02:27.040> that

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
in place as well so now you can see that

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.680 
in place as well so now you can see that
we're<00:02:27.400> kind<00:02:27.579> of<00:02:27.670> getting<00:02:27.790> these<00:02:28.090> bubbles

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
we're kind of getting these bubbles

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.780 
we're kind of getting these bubbles
right<00:02:29.049> here<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:30.129> we're<00:02:30.280> just<00:02:30.310> gonna<00:02:30.489> keep

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
right here and we're just gonna keep

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.990 
right here and we're just gonna keep
going<00:02:31.060> around<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.720> tree<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:31.989> like<00:02:32.319> this<00:02:33.000> to

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
going around the tree just like this to

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.699 
going around the tree just like this to
make<00:02:34.180> our<00:02:34.329> burlap<00:02:34.690> bubbles<00:02:35.110> go<00:02:35.290> all<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.680> way

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
make our burlap bubbles go all the way

00:02:35.709 --> 00:03:05.790 
make our burlap bubbles go all the way
up<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.069> tree

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.320 

maybe<00:03:06.800> just<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.130> couple<00:03:07.160> more<00:03:07.670> pieces<00:03:07.850> at<00:03:08.210> this

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
maybe just a couple more pieces at this

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.670 
maybe just a couple more pieces at this
point<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.040> friends<00:03:11.200> so<00:03:12.200> now<00:03:12.440> we've

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
point that is it friends so now we've

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.800 
point that is it friends so now we've
gone<00:03:12.860> all<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.400> way<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.940> top<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.330> our<00:03:14.480> tree

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
gone all the way to the top of our tree

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.870 
gone all the way to the top of our tree
and<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.710> like<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.190> way<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.550> it<00:03:16.700> actually

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
and I like the way that it actually

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.630 
and I like the way that it actually
looks<00:03:17.480> pretty<00:03:17.600> rugged<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.890> does<00:03:19.160> have<00:03:19.400> some<00:03:19.610> of

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
looks pretty rugged it does have some of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.400 
looks pretty rugged it does have some of
the<00:03:19.820> fraying<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.660> strings<00:03:21.050> and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
the fraying and the strings and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.020 
the fraying and the strings and
everything<00:03:21.860> but<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.160> think<00:03:22.220> that's<00:03:22.580> what<00:03:22.790> gives

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
everything but I think that's what gives

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.690 
everything but I think that's what gives
it<00:03:23.270> that<00:03:23.500> really<00:03:24.500> great<00:03:24.770> kind<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.130> country

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700
