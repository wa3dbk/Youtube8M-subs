00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everyone and welcome to apple 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.099
 news for you today I propose you 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.490
 a comparative between the fourth ipad 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.860
 generation and the iphone 5 as you the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.980
 know the iphone 5 has a 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.130
 a6 processor while the fourth ipad 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.539
 generation to him inherited from the youngest the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.160
 processor at 6x and for this I'm going 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 offer you a test that will be 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.980
 separated in three stages the first 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.829
 step will be starting the device 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.469
 the second stage the launch of 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.940
 different native applications and for 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.399
 finish the third stage 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.780
 turning off the device so that you 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.360
 can you report on 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.680
 processor performance 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.899
 here I'll let you see the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.149
 video and we'll start with the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.390
 first step which is the startup of 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.390
 the device 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.390
 and that's it and two devices have started 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 and as you have seen, this is 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.060
 the iphone 5 that started the 1st 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.110
 we will finally move to the second 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.420
 step which is the launch of 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.680
 different applications 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.680
 we will start with the app store 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.610
 no we will launch the application 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.610
 clock 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.950
 this time it's the application 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.950
 camera 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.350
 safari 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.440
 a slight advance is visible on 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.440
 the iphone 5 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.799
 only at his game 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.130
 applications started almost 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.840
 simultaneously as you have been able to 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.280
 realize 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.280
 and now a last application 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.820
 if it's the ipad the winner here for 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.710
 the second step we'll go to 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.310
 the last step which is extinction 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.310
 of the device 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.820
 and here is the ipad 4 has already done his 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.520
 extinction 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.520
 while iphone 5 is still running 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.790
 and that's our test is over 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.500
