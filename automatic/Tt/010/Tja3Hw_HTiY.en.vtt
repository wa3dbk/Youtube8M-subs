what<00:00:07.680> I'm<00:00:07.770> gonna<00:00:07.890> be<00:00:08.069> doing<00:00:08.099> here<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.940> show<00:00:09.240> you

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
what I'm gonna be doing here is show you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.070 
what I'm gonna be doing here is show you
the<00:00:09.690> test<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.099> few<00:00:11.340> SSDs<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.179> set<00:00:12.389> up<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.990> a

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
the test of a few SSDs that set up in a

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.220 
the test of a few SSDs that set up in a
rate<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:14.030> these<00:00:15.030> are<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.389> instead<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.020> 40

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
rate so these are two instead of 40

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.590 
rate so these are two instead of 40
gigabytes<00:00:17.270> models

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
gigabytes models

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.500 
gigabytes models
first<00:00:20.290> I'm<00:00:20.470> just<00:00:20.500> going<00:00:20.800> to<00:00:20.890> show<00:00:21.490> you<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.880> IDs

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.810 

the<00:00:29.109> second<00:00:29.560> thing<00:00:29.770> I'm<00:00:29.920> gonna<00:00:30.070> show<00:00:30.400> you<00:00:30.460> this

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
the second thing I'm gonna show you this

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.229 
the second thing I'm gonna show you this
a<00:00:31.210> basic<00:00:31.960> benchmark<00:00:32.559> of<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.340> sequential<00:00:33.760> read

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
a basic benchmark of the sequential read

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.189 
a basic benchmark of the sequential read
and<00:00:34.450> write<00:00:34.630> speeds<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.829> rates<00:00:36.129> your<00:00:36.520> setup

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
and write speeds this rates your setup

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.530 
and write speeds this rates your setup
I'm<00:00:38.199> using<00:00:38.230> a<00:00:38.620> little<00:00:39.220> application<00:00:39.850> called

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
I'm using a little application called

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:49.740 
I'm using a little application called
SSD<00:00:41.110> benchmark<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:48.519> write<00:00:48.699> speeds<00:00:49.150> on<00:00:49.480> these

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
SSD benchmark the write speeds on these

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.200 
SSD benchmark the write speeds on these
drives<00:00:50.050> isn't<00:00:50.530> very<00:00:50.830> impressive<00:00:51.250> as<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.089> can

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
drives isn't very impressive as you can

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
drives isn't very impressive as you can
see<00:00:52.420> almost<00:00:53.199> seven<00:00:54.160> megabytes<00:00:54.610> per<00:00:54.820> second

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
see almost seven megabytes per second

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.819 
see almost seven megabytes per second
but<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.040> read<00:00:57.220> speed<00:00:57.579> is<00:00:57.780> more<00:00:58.780> impressive<00:00:59.050> as

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
but the read speed is more impressive as

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.580 
but the read speed is more impressive as
you<00:01:00.040> can<00:01:00.190> also<00:01:00.339> see<00:01:00.730> pushing<00:01:01.600> 300<00:01:02.199> megabytes

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
you can also see pushing 300 megabytes

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.330 
you can also see pushing 300 megabytes
per<00:01:02.739> second

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.950 

I've<00:01:06.340> made<00:01:06.759> this<00:01:07.000> bad<00:01:07.930> file<00:01:08.289> or<00:01:08.710> batch<00:01:08.979> file

2008<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.740> pretty<00:01:30.160> heavy<00:01:30.399> programs

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.510 

as<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.219> can<00:01:40.310> see<00:01:40.549> it's<00:01:41.079> pretty<00:01:42.079> much<00:01:42.200> done

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.530 

very<00:01:45.120> fast

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.080 

just<00:01:53.200> flipping<00:01:53.920> through<00:01:54.090> purities

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
just flipping through purities

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.970 
just flipping through purities
applications<00:01:55.750> as<00:01:55.870> you<00:01:55.900> can<00:01:56.200> see<00:01:56.410> they're<00:01:56.650> all

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
applications as you can see they're all

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:08.609 
applications as you can see they're all
open<00:01:57.310> arrays<00:01:58.210> go

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.710 

so<00:02:09.619> pretty<00:02:09.830> impressive<00:02:10.220> speeds<00:02:10.670> that's<00:02:11.150> sick

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
so pretty impressive speeds that's sick

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.930 
so pretty impressive speeds that's sick
last<00:02:12.590> thing<00:02:12.740> you're<00:02:12.830> just<00:02:12.860> gonna<00:02:13.130> reboot<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
last thing you're just gonna reboot the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
whole system you can see just how fast

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:40.160 
whole system you can see just how fast
it<00:02:17.120> goes

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:49.440 

I'm<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:41.410> gonna<00:02:41.650> quadcore<00:02:42.130> into<00:02:44.640> q6600<00:02:48.450> 2.40
