good<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:26.130> user<00:03:26.310> interface<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.300> camera<00:03:27.780> is

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
good the user interface of the camera is

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.550 
good the user interface of the camera is
not<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.980> bad<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.670> very<00:03:29.850> simple<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.560> you
