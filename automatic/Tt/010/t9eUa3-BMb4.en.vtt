have done a great job they've recruited
well<00:02:06.689> they've<00:02:07.560> put<00:02:07.920> together<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.310> good

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
well they've put together a good

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.369 
well they've put together a good
strength<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.030> conditioning<00:02:09.509> program<00:02:09.989> our

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
strength and conditioning program our

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.520 
strength and conditioning program our
athletes<00:02:11.069> are<00:02:11.370> are<00:02:11.610> more<00:02:11.900> healthy<00:02:12.900> when

they're injured they recover more
quickly<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.840> think<00:02:16.470> our<00:02:16.620> sports<00:02:16.950> medicine

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
quickly I think our sports medicine

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.460 
quickly I think our sports medicine
program<00:02:17.849> has<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.239> come<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.569> long<00:02:18.660> ways<00:02:19.110> and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
program has really come a long ways and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.130 
program has really come a long ways and
prospered<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.610> it's<00:02:20.790> paying<00:02:21.450> dividends<00:02:22.020> in

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
prospered and it's paying dividends in

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.100 
prospered and it's paying dividends in
football<00:02:22.560> as<00:02:23.220> well<00:02:23.640> as<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.629> every

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.770 
football as well as it is in in every
other<00:02:25.260> sport<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.980> have<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.120> really

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780

is<00:03:46.680> he's<00:03:47.640> very<00:03:47.670> high-energy<00:03:48.500> he's<00:03:49.500> got<00:03:49.769> a

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
is he's very high-energy he's got a

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.789 
is he's very high-energy he's got a
pretty<00:03:50.730> well<00:03:51.060> conceived<00:03:51.629> notion<00:03:52.230> as<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.439> how

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
pretty well conceived notion as to how

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.039 
pretty well conceived notion as to how
he<00:03:52.830> wants<00:03:53.340> things<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.700> fit<00:03:53.970> together<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.599> I

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
he wants things to fit together and I

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.420 
he wants things to fit together and I
think<00:03:55.290> that's<00:03:55.530> part<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:55.980> reason<00:03:56.099> why

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
think that's part of the reason why

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.520 
think that's part of the reason why
we've<00:03:56.670> made<00:03:56.939> progress<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:57.930> quickly<00:03:58.349> I<00:03:58.379> think

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
we've made progress so quickly I think

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.550 
we've made progress so quickly I think
he<00:03:58.980> he's<00:03:59.549> understood<00:04:00.420> where<00:04:00.900> our<00:04:01.080> strengths

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
he he's understood where our strengths

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.350 
he he's understood where our strengths
were<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.769> where<00:04:02.129> our<00:04:02.280> weaknesses<00:04:02.849> were<00:04:03.030> and

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
were and where our weaknesses were and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.880 
were and where our weaknesses were and
he's<00:04:03.599> gone<00:04:03.900> about<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.290> process<00:04:04.769> of

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
he's gone about the process of

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.160 
he's gone about the process of
complementing<00:04:05.549> that<00:04:05.730> he<00:04:06.480> brings<00:04:06.659> an<00:04:06.870> awful

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
complementing that he brings an awful

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.869 
complementing that he brings an awful
lot<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.290> energy<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.159> he<00:04:08.310> brings<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.670> lot<00:04:08.819> of

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
lot of energy to it he brings a lot of

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.789 
lot of energy to it he brings a lot of
vision<00:04:09.360> he's<00:04:09.569> been<00:04:09.780> around<00:04:10.019> quality<00:04:10.590> football

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
vision he's been around quality football

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.699

programs<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> long<00:04:11.909> long<00:04:12.150> time<00:04:12.709> including

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
programs for a long long time including

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.509 
programs for a long long time including

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
as a long time player and I just think

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.020 
as a long time player and I just think
that<00:04:17.639> that<00:04:18.570> sort<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.049> focus<00:04:19.500> has<00:04:20.040> really<00:04:20.549> paid

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
that that sort of focus has really paid

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.809 
that that sort of focus has really paid
dividends<00:04:21.660> for<00:04:21.989> us

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:22.819 
dividends for us

individual<00:05:21.690> institutions<00:05:22.379> that<00:05:22.530> we<00:05:22.680> were

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
individual institutions that we were

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.499 
individual institutions that we were
looking<00:05:23.129> at<00:05:23.190> came<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:23.639> with<00:05:23.879> with

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
looking at came in with with

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.570 
looking at came in with with
stipulations<00:05:24.900> in<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.740> eleventh<00:05:26.129> hour<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.550> I

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
stipulations in the eleventh hour and I

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.860 
stipulations in the eleventh hour and I
think<00:05:26.789> our<00:05:26.909> Commissioner<00:05:27.389> made<00:05:27.569> the<00:05:27.690> right

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
think our Commissioner made the right

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.779 
think our Commissioner made the right
choice<00:05:28.139> and<00:05:28.169> saying<00:05:28.860> we're<00:05:29.279> going<00:05:29.430> to<00:05:29.490> move<00:05:29.610> on

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
choice and saying we're going to move on

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.719 
choice and saying we're going to move on
and<00:05:29.849> go<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.719> another<00:05:31.050> go<00:05:31.860> to<00:05:31.919> another<00:05:32.190> process

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
and go to another go to another process

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.870 
and go to another go to another process
and<00:05:33.000> we<00:05:33.599> had<00:05:34.319> already<00:05:34.560> taken<00:05:34.889> Colorado<00:05:35.639> at

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
and we had already taken Colorado at

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.740 
and we had already taken Colorado at
that<00:05:36.060> point<00:05:36.389> and<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:37.319> we<00:05:37.770> were<00:05:38.330> had<00:05:39.330> had<00:05:39.539> some

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
that point and and we were had had some

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.309 
that point and and we were had had some
conversations<00:05:40.469> with<00:05:40.560> Utah<00:05:41.039> and<00:05:41.219> so<00:05:41.400> I<00:05:41.639> think

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 
conversations with Utah and so I think

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.120 
conversations with Utah and so I think
geographically<00:05:43.319> it<00:05:43.440> makes<00:05:43.650> perfect<00:05:43.860> sense

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
geographically it makes perfect sense

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.659 
geographically it makes perfect sense
it's<00:05:44.789> going<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.060> help<00:05:45.870> us<00:05:46.110> drive<00:05:46.669> television

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
it's going to help us drive television

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.519 
it's going to help us drive television
ratings<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.779> and<00:05:49.580> cable<00:05:50.580> clearances<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:52.169> the

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529

Denver<00:05:52.979> and<00:05:53.190> Colorado<00:05:53.340> markets<00:05:54.180> are<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.479> 15th

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
Denver and Colorado markets are the 15th

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.890 
Denver and Colorado markets are the 15th
largest<00:05:55.319> adi<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.310> in<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.879> united<00:05:57.360> states<00:05:57.389> and

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
largest adi and in the united states and

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.290 
largest adi and in the united states and
so<00:05:58.080> that's<00:05:58.229> a<00:05:58.379> good<00:05:58.590> addition<00:05:58.830> for<00:05:59.069> us<00:05:59.370> Salt

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
so that's a good addition for us Salt

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.689 
so that's a good addition for us Salt
Lake<00:06:00.509> is<00:06:00.779> as<00:06:00.990> well<00:06:01.199> they're<00:06:02.039> a<00:06:02.069> little<00:06:02.219> like

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
Lake is as well they're a little like

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.309 
Lake is as well they're a little like
the<00:06:02.969> rest<00:06:03.180> of<00:06:03.330> a<00:06:03.449> lead<00:06:03.659> the<00:06:03.840> league<00:06:04.020> we<00:06:04.289> have

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
the rest of a lead the league we have

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.350 
the rest of a lead the league we have
really<00:06:04.710> good<00:06:04.860> metropolitan<00:06:05.639> areas<00:06:05.969> but<00:06:06.180> we

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
really good metropolitan areas but we

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.420 
really good metropolitan areas but we
don't<00:06:06.690> have<00:06:06.870> a<00:06:06.900> lot<00:06:07.020> of<00:06:07.169> population<00:06:07.919> density

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
don't have a lot of population density

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.320 
don't have a lot of population density
so<00:06:08.669> it<00:06:08.789> creates<00:06:09.060> some<00:06:09.270> challenges<00:06:09.300> for<00:06:10.050> us<00:06:10.110> but

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
so it creates some challenges for us but

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.469 
so it creates some challenges for us but
we<00:06:12.330> have<00:06:12.539> one<00:06:12.840> more<00:06:13.110> year<00:06:13.469> on<00:06:14.190> one<00:06:14.909> part<00:06:15.240> of<00:06:15.360> our

better stops on to the bowl alignment
it's<00:07:39.490> it's<00:07:39.820> just<00:07:40.060> kind<00:07:40.330> of<00:07:40.389> the<00:07:40.599> the
