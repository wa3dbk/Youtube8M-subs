00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.250
 listen to us we hope you have 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.900
 still today to talk about a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.730
 beauty box so this is the first time 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.340
 what to do with the review of a beauty box and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.490
 in fact I take the opportunity of a 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.310
 partnership with beat box forgets that 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.080
 beautiful box who offered me 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.640
 send me boxes from ban monks 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.060
 to test and talk if I 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.310
 I wanted 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.680
 I really wanted to share my 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.270
 opinion with you because I love tics 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.420
 of the brand the fact that they work 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.800
 with brands my organic tendency or 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.850
 in any case with components 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.980
 not too chemical chemicals precisely and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.739
 especially it is suitable for skins 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.810
 black it's really a box made for 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.190
 shoot him all the women and that's 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.470
 true that there was finally there is very little 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.880
 boxing beauty adapted to black skin 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.770
 in the markets there was there big beauty 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.450
 box I think but it is not too much 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.710
 walk so I was really 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.110
 very happy when I was offered 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.409
 test his products and so it's me if 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.329
 I received the boxing of the month of February which 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.869
 was focused on the theme of 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.790
 Valentine's Day 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.490
 so all products have arrived in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.109
 a pooch with writing or the fuck is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:20.759

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.740

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.899
 profile on the internet anyway I had 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.319
 did a boxing review in the month of 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.939
 November 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.310
 I made an article on the blog you 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.109
 put somewhere in the video or 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.639
 well warned info invites you to 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.619
 look lucidly so that you 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:45.149
 can have more details on the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.889
 boxing and his concept and everything and everything and 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.299
 all the theme of Valentine's Day so 

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.090
 it's a selection of products for 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.529
 precisely put in value then there it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.069
 did not pass but it can be used to 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.749
 something else 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.219
 there were three brand products at 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.649
 my suitcases so I'm really going very 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.439
 happy to have received these 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.819
 products because brings to id his 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.770
 brands that I really hear a lot 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.770
 spoken with very positive opinions and 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 I wanted to try them and so the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.860
 first product is shampoo 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.300
 pampering with acacia honey with aloe 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.190
 vera 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.780
 and cinnamon and so all 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.510
 products are paraben free silicone free 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.860
 without sulphate and with ingredients here 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.790
 of the creature of agriculture 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.110
 biological so that's really 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.580
 beatbox ethic and I found 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.890
 really in all the products that I have 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.440
 received since the month of November so 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.790
 surely very happy 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.440
 then the second product from 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.960
 amelie death and the after shampoo 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.090
 pampering him obama's lawyer 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.940
 christie has had jo bouts is at the edge of 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.490
 the water qq butter knew that could accuse 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.500
 not too much how is it pronounced then 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.030
 the third product from amelie so 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.160
 it's the cream well fly tent so 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.690
 it's a moisturizing cream with honey 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.700
 acacia with aloe vera so that's 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.250
 really moisturizing ingredients and he 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.110
 look forward to trying these products I hope 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.480
 able to talk about it soon either in 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.140
 video be an article on the blog I have 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.480
 received in boxing a hydrating milk from 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.140
 the saba sultana so it's a milk 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.570
 moisturizer with argan oil with a 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.740
 smell a little muscular 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.730
 usually I do not really like it 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.770
 kind of time but then I find that 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.970
 it is quite subtle escapes a smell 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.830
 a little powder I find that 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.140
 rather not bad so the format is a bit 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.750
 small and suddenly I think I 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.520
 would put in my purse or so if 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.080
 I'm going on a trip it's always good 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.630
 to have products of this size 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.140
 so as not to clutter it 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.480
 I received in boxing a gloss of the 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.980
 mark b the worst cosmetics and so 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.470
 it is a gloss that is formulated also to 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.480
 base of natural ingredients 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.330
 it's a rose that makes an effect a little 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.860
 little nude with glitter on 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.750
 do I swatch it and so 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.100
 here it is like this but in fact it is 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.120
 enough it's pretty subtle 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.770
 I find it not bad because we have 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.040
 always need a gloss they are 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.209
 not too bright that can serve either to 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.190
 sublimate the tent of the lips either 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.110
 brought another effect a purple red 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.820
 that we would have put under 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.709
 the Benin is to brush the level 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.540
 so I find that when you shoot yourself in 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.420
 does it all the gloss remains stuck 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.750
 in so suddenly that and goes out while 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.090
 made 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.590
 then there was a cream for the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.269
 hands concerned only a big failure 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.380
 of hand cream because I have 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.359
 very dry hands so suddenly 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.669
 I was very happy to receive this 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.070
 cream of at home air basin bass tunes 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.380
 it's a brand that 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.900
 German and here too it's a cream to 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.200
 glycerin base also makes from 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.560
 of natural ingredients with 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.620
 the lull to just calm down and 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.390
 soothed and repair the skin and I like 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.770
 really this cream even if it is 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.300
 really very rich but I do not like 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.950
 really not what it really moisturizes 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.720
 well hands so the evening before you get 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.100
 bed I find it perfect then he 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.480
 there was a small brush a brush 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.530
 it is rather a gadget in fact so there 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.170
 also I find it not bad because 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.290
 it's a handbag size there too 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.370
 when going on a trip or township when 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.570
 we do not want to clutter and so 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.130
 we slip into the purse and that 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.650
 really helps not to get excited 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.270
 with his brush 30 cm long and 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.580
 finally a sheriff's lipstick mail 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.110
 which dries in 60 seconds we will place a 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.480
 red too a bit a little it's a red 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.130
 also pearly I tried them he is 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.950
 rather not bad and really wise too 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.330
 very quickly so for the holy theme 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.920
 valentin finally it's pretty good 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.830
 because here we have to prepare for 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.030
 the last minute of having to have a 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.680
 notebook that dries in a very short time 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.080
 it's really handy when you're fed up 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.300
 in fact varnishes one tale applied it 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.190
 you just have to touch something even 20 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.660
 minutes later for our work 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.620
 without a voice completely zapped so I 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.210
 find that really allow to have 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.640
 put a varnish that dry quickly 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.380
 in boxing then there will also be a 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.960
 contest in the month of April to win 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.490
 to win a beauty box I you 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.840
 invite me to follow me on the networks 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.670
 so social on facebook intervenes 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.040
 mainly because we actually have 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.110
 more europe organized two contests of 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.370

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.230
 that the video be deleted there that my 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.600

 invites you to remain vigilant about 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.590

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.390
