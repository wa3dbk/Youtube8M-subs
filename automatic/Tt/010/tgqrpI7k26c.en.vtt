didn't<00:00:52.330> make<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.690> native<00:00:52.960> support<00:00:53.380> as<00:00:53.590> far<00:00:53.620> as

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
didn't make the native support as far as

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.940 
didn't make the native support as far as
I<00:00:53.980> know<00:00:54.040> they<00:00:54.370> do<00:00:54.430> make<00:00:54.700> native<00:00:55.090> support<00:00:55.239> of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
I know they do make native support of

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.640 
I know they do make native support of
the<00:00:56.950> resolution<00:00:57.280> this<00:00:57.820> big<00:00:58.030> so<00:00:58.989> I<00:00:59.230> found

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
the resolution this big so I found

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:11.100 
the resolution this big so I found
something<00:01:08.100> options<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.340> instead<00:01:09.910> of<00:01:10.110> putting

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
something options and instead of putting

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.350 
something options and instead of putting
fullscreen<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.100> my<00:01:12.520> native<00:01:12.729> resolution

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
fullscreen and my native resolution

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.020 
fullscreen and my native resolution
output<00:01:14.340> fullscreen<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.729> know<00:01:15.910> and<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.880> we

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
output fullscreen you know and here we

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:28.609 
output fullscreen you know and here we
go<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:20.229> have<00:01:21.060> resolution<00:01:22.060> of<00:01:23.460> 57<00:01:24.460> 60<00:01:24.880> on<00:01:25.380> 1080p

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.660 

isn't<00:01:29.619> it<00:01:29.710> cool<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.500> here<00:01:32.890> we<00:01:32.979> have<00:01:33.130> our<00:01:33.250> Indian

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
isn't it cool so here we have our Indian

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.550 
isn't it cool so here we have our Indian
tree<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:35.500> can<00:01:35.740> move<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.580> down<00:01:36.789> here<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:38.380> have

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
tree you can move it down here we have

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.910 
tree you can move it down here we have
our<00:01:38.800> map<00:01:39.340> map<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.210> useless<00:01:40.390> unless<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:41.619> move<00:01:41.770> it

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
our map map is useless unless I move it

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.859 
our map map is useless unless I move it
somewhere<00:01:42.100> out<00:01:42.310> there<00:01:42.340> let's<00:01:43.119> see<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.300> can<00:01:43.660> I

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
somewhere out there let's see I can I

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.840 
somewhere out there let's see I can I
can<00:01:44.229> do<00:01:44.380> anything<00:01:44.619> I<00:01:44.890> guess<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:48.220> I<00:01:48.250> can

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
can do anything I guess there so I can

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.570 
can do anything I guess there so I can
run<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.330> can<00:01:49.509> see<00:01:49.899> some<00:01:50.140> extra<00:01:50.770> information<00:01:50.890> on

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
run I can see some extra information on

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.290 
run I can see some extra information on
the<00:01:51.850> sides<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.479> have<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.459> turn<00:01:54.459> my<00:01:54.640> head<00:01:54.670> no

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
the sides I have to turn my head no

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.919 
the sides I have to turn my head no
which<00:01:56.080> is<00:01:56.110> not<00:01:56.380> very<00:01:56.619> comfortable<00:01:57.539> but<00:01:58.539> in

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
which is not very comfortable but in

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.740 
which is not very comfortable but in
general<00:01:59.380> is<00:02:00.220> very<00:02:00.340> experience<00:02:01.060> than<00:02:01.270> just<00:02:01.300> one

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
general is very experience than just one

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.410 
general is very experience than just one
one<00:02:02.039> so<00:02:03.039> at<00:02:03.399> least<00:02:03.580> I<00:02:03.759> can<00:02:03.910> run<00:02:04.060> with<00:02:04.090> my

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420
