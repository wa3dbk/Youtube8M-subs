have<00:00:05.310> come<00:00:05.730> into<00:00:05.910> situation<00:00:06.509> because<00:00:06.810> I

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
have come into situation because I

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.080 
have come into situation because I
didn't<00:00:07.140> have<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.410> likes<00:00:07.620> at<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.069> time<00:00:10.759> well<00:00:11.759> I

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
didn't have to likes at that time well I

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.879 
didn't have to likes at that time well I
scored<00:00:12.480> before<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.139> but<00:00:13.320> not<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
scored before like that but not in the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.860 
scored before like that but not in the
NHL<00:00:14.309> but<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.120> sometimes<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.809> just

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
NHL but you know sometimes it's just

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.140 
NHL but you know sometimes it's just
instincts<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.680> front<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.070> nets<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.580> I'm

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
instincts in front of the nets and I'm

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.540 
instincts in front of the nets and I'm
lucky<00:00:18.359> when<00:00:18.710> happy<00:00:19.710> where<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> legs

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
lucky when happy where have the legs

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.660 
lucky when happy where have the legs
come<00:00:20.730> from<00:00:21.230> well<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.320> know<00:00:22.470> when<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.220> no

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
come from well you know when you have no

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.670 
come from well you know when you have no
confidence<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.869> don't<00:00:25.050> score<00:00:25.380> then

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
confidence you don't score then

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.679 
confidence you don't score then
sometimes<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> legs<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.300> heavier<00:00:27.630> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
sometimes the legs just get heavier and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.080 
sometimes the legs just get heavier and
heavier<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.680> mindset<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.400> be

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
heavier then your mindset have to be

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.060 
heavier then your mindset have to be
like<00:00:30.330> reverse<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> little<00:00:31.320> things<00:00:31.710> right

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
like reverse to the little things right

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.220 
like reverse to the little things right
you<00:00:32.610> know<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.940> then<00:00:33.090> take<00:00:33.300> small<00:00:33.600> steps<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
you know and then take small steps and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.799 
you know and then take small steps and
you<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.460> four<00:00:36.239> goals<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.570> four

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
you know now have four goals in four

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.740 
you know now have four goals in four
games<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.350> i<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:38.070> its<00:00:38.190> product<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:39.480> like

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
games but i think its product for like

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.650 
games but i think its product for like
small<00:00:40.110> step<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.910> five<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> ten

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
small step like in like five to ten

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.770 
small step like in like five to ten
games<00:00:42.899> before<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.980> games<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.600> know
