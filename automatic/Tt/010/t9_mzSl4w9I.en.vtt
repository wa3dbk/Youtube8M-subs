00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
little bit so I found it best to start

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.910 
little bit so I found it best to start
with<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.239> glue<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> teaspoon<00:00:52.800> or

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
with very little glue like a teaspoon or

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.760 
with very little glue like a teaspoon or
two<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.520> gradually<00:00:54.420> add<00:00:54.600> water<00:00:54.930> otherwise

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
two and gradually add water otherwise

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.529 
two and gradually add water otherwise
you<00:00:56.100> end<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.430> constantly<00:00:56.879> having<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.420> add

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
you end up constantly having to add

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
you end up constantly having to add
water<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.170> sin<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> before<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
water to sin it and before you know it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.990 
water to sin it and before you know it
you<00:00:59.820> made<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.090> buckets<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.840> glue<00:01:01.760> then<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> can

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you made of buckets of glue then it can

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.630 
you made of buckets of glue then it can
start<00:01:03.030> ripping<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.809> pasting<00:01:04.369> cover<00:01:05.369> the

where to buy it

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.569 
where to buy it
start<00:02:37.569> off<00:02:37.690> with<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.959> thin<00:02:38.200> layer<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:39.220> cuttings

start off with a thin layer the cuttings

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:40.920 
start off with a thin layer the cuttings
might<00:02:39.790> get<00:02:39.940> wet<00:02:40.120> again<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:40.599> don't<00:02:40.780> worry

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
might get wet again but don't worry

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.819 
might get wet again but don't worry
about<00:02:41.079> that<00:02:41.290> too<00:02:41.620> much

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
about that too much

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.430 
about that too much
it<00:02:42.459> will<00:02:42.609> also<00:02:42.790> dry<00:02:43.150> again<00:02:43.299> once<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:44.230> first

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
it will also dry again once the first

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.259 
it will also dry again once the first
layer<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.680> dried<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.459> will<00:02:45.579> protect<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.030> paper

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
layer is dried it will protect the paper

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.899 
layer is dried it will protect the paper
so<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> next<00:02:47.170> layer<00:02:47.349> will<00:02:47.620> go<00:02:47.769> easier<00:02:48.190> keep

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
so the next layer will go easier keep

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.460 
so the next layer will go easier keep
putting<00:02:49.239> on<00:02:49.359> layers<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.959> let<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.170> varnish

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
putting on layers and let the varnish

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.990 
putting on layers and let the varnish
dry<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:50.889> between<00:02:51.220> until<00:02:51.609> you're<00:02:51.790> satisfied

dry in between until you're satisfied
with<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.659> result<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.400> did<00:02:54.400> about<00:02:54.609> five<00:02:54.909> layers

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
with the result I did about five layers

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.059 
with the result I did about five layers
of<00:02:55.299> varnish<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:55.989> make<00:02:56.139> sure<00:02:56.319> every<00:02:56.680> part<00:02:56.859> was

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
of varnish to make sure every part was

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.509 
of varnish to make sure every part was
properly<00:02:57.519> covered<00:02:57.849> and<00:02:58.569> that's<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.440> you<00:03:00.340> can

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
properly covered and that's it you can

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.369 
properly covered and that's it you can
also<00:03:00.670> use<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:01.120> technique<00:03:01.450> on<00:03:01.599> your<00:03:01.750> desk<00:03:02.019> or
