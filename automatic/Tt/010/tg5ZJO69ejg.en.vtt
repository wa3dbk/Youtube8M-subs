open we've done some shooting before not
with<00:00:36.750> such<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> light<00:00:37.289> camera<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.250> light

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
with such a light camera and this light

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.000 
with such a light camera and this light
camera<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.449> allow<00:00:39.809> us<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.649> more<00:00:40.770> flexible

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
camera can allow us to be more flexible

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
camera can allow us to be more flexible
and<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.760> go<00:00:42.120> quickly<00:00:42.390> into<00:00:42.660> different

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and going go quickly into different

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.670 
and going go quickly into different
points<00:00:47.149> it's<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.300> very<00:00:48.539> interesting<00:00:48.660> tool<00:00:49.350> if

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
points it's a very interesting tool if

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.790 
points it's a very interesting tool if
we<00:00:49.890> want<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.030> live<00:00:51.510> capture<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.350> frida

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
we want to have a live capture of frida

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.069 
we want to have a live capture of frida
contents<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.910> very<00:00:54.300> interesting<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.019> us

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
contents so it's very interesting for us

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.729 
contents so it's very interesting for us
to<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.550> assess<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.940> performances<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.899> terms

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to to assess the performances in terms

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
to to assess the performances in terms
of<00:00:59.010> depth<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> rain<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:02.850> 3d<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.750> most

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
of depth on the rain in 3d the most

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.170 
of depth on the rain in 3d the most
important<00:01:04.379> thing<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.160> course<00:01:05.370> focus<00:01:05.910> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
important thing is of course focus and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
important thing is of course focus and
iris<00:01:06.630> things<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.350> standard<00:01:07.800> cameras<00:01:08.190> but

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
iris things like standard cameras but

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.460 
iris things like standard cameras but
you<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.640> also<00:01:08.850> convergence<00:01:09.630> point<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.230> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you have also convergence point which is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.950 
you have also convergence point which is
very<00:01:11.040> very<00:01:11.160> important<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.150> make<00:01:12.300> good

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
very very important to make good

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:24.010 
very very important to make good
pictures<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.240> nice<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.960> look<00:01:15.990> at

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.240 

it's<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.140> nice<00:01:25.320> camera<00:01:25.740> yes<00:01:26.460> yes<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:28.250> see

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
it's a nice camera yes yes we will see

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.430 
it's a nice camera yes yes we will see
if<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.900> result<00:01:31.370> pictures<00:01:32.370> are<00:01:33.210> very<00:01:34.110> good

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
if the result pictures are very good

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:46.910 
if the result pictures are very good

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
definition for eng for reporting so good

system<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:50.550> rendering<00:01:51.000> looks<00:01:51.300> quite<00:01:51.630> natural

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
system the rendering looks quite natural

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.670 
system the rendering looks quite natural
because<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:53.640> distance<00:01:54.540> between<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.530> two

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
because the distance between the two

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.810 
because the distance between the two
camera<00:01:56.399> sensor<00:01:56.940> is<00:01:58.070> equivalent<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.250> the

shoots<00:02:03.720> looks<00:02:04.229> quite<00:02:04.770> natural<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:07.020> result

shoots looks quite natural so result

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.500 
shoots looks quite natural so result
pretty<00:02:08.250> good<00:02:08.540> in<00:02:09.540> terms<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.929> three<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.500> very

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
pretty good in terms of three and very

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:25.230 
pretty good in terms of three and very
