00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello how about this jd techno today we're going 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.910
 to look at how to hack a wifi network because 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.580
 the web came out but 5 I know we're going to 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.189
 use that the interface is very changed 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.560
 it really is very good and this I do 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.840
 in order to actually check if 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.450
 your own wifi network is vulnerable the 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.700
 program to change that password that 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.730
 has though many good already use in 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.950
 reality to use wifi outside the one of 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.340
 one then the first thing we have to 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.740
 to do is obviously have an ipod iphone 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.660
 touch or ipad be blocked without the 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.000
 jailbreak this can not be done 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.440
 they have to be released if they do not have 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.530
 done a jailbreak they do not know how it is 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.270
 click here a thousand videos to go to a 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.900
 tutorial so you can see how that is done 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.130
 break after we have to go to cydia 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.050
 and in Syria what we have to do is 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.120
 very simple is very easy we have to 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.820
 install three things first we have to 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.760
 go to install a repo we have to go to 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.450
 handle sources and we have to add 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.040
 this repository and font already I in the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.240
 description of the video said exactly 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.670
 the direction 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.950
 in loading here also if they do not know how to use 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.200
 yes dÃ­az and do not know how to install how 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.049
 add epoxy how to install applications 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.210
 from cydia click here 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.240
 in the video to know a little more about 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.430
 that here we go go directly to the program 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 you have to install report and then in 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.860
 the search engine simply have to put 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.630
 here in the search engine and web and it's going to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.840
 leave what they have to install that in 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.360
 my case is going to be the web pro 5 of 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.430
 dysphonia me that is already created and have 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.230
 to install the dictionaries 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.110
 that are installed directly is also 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.310
 say already the dictionaries are called 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.180
 well and web st dictionaries and also those 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.430
 and web 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.130
 bt dictionaries so they install those 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.660
 three things occupy enough this megas or 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.370
 the dictionaries so you have to have 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.260
 patience 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.909
 those three and web dt 7 and 51 that are left 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.789
 it's installed 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.030
 they go to the sprint board and they will have here 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.069
 in my case I put it here to the lic or not 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.530
 if you are not going to have it obviously here 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.220
 in the good sprint somewhere they go to 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.959
 have the web application pro 5 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.790
 segment in the application comes the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.459
 application before doing anything is going to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.239
 settings and here are going to register 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.239
 application 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.140
 and here in the code it puts in three letters 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.440
 anyone either does not interest 30 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.850
 anyone you give to accept you give 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.940
 validity 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.080
 and ready that easy we have the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.810
 application activated in the book is created 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.930
 which is a valid password so 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.480
 easy is ready they put dan up here and what 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.200
 They can start using we go again 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.470
 to exploits and here they will appear 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.600
 all wifi signals that can 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.290
 Hack unfortunately I can not 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.290
 show because in my country Argentina does not 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.020
 supports no wifi network this program 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.030
 this works for some countries not for 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.560
 all is a matter of how good what 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.330
 try install later and you will see if 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.250
 works are not in the dictionaries of 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.050
 last one that takes a long time to install and 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.270
 are in the program that is a second and 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.530
 they try it to see if they give or not later if 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.720
 or if the dictionaries have to be 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.200
 install them 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.510
 You see here re says their covers 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.050
 none and if I do with my finger over there 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.630
 it shows me it does not support days that are all 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.720
 the ones that I have so if they have 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.730
 luck in the list of the supported ones here 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.610
 they will look like the wheels touch them 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.680
 they put you scan they look for the password 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.290
 tells them the fai development password 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.350
 it's that easy to use the 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.020
 of web pro install dictionaries like this 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.290
 I hope you serve them well 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.560
 that in wifi network with read it very good use 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.580
 normal use and well you know if they liked it 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.570
