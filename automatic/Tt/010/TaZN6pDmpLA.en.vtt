 show you how to make such a planter 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:26.060
 let's get started 4 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:26.060

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:54.360
 such a gift from him is just 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:01:00.040

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.790
 it can develop this here is such a 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.790
 square 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:16.110
 war and arbitrarily well the main thing is not to 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:26.190
 too much and not too good 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:26.190
 press it down 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:12.520
 halibut here is such a pressure inside 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.520
 gon now and have to bend 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.490
 So 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:46.840
 Now we take the scissors and now it will be 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:03:24.260
 cut off cut off just madre do 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:03:30.220
 so here on all sides did us 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:33.220

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.220
 unfold 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.069
 a partridge doctor 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:27.970
 as we try to make a conclusion we press 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:27.970
 such a square so done now 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:39.550
 now we need to flip it so here 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.550
 center 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:05:14.730
 so here so here as I 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:32.179
 so while we got and so 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:41.509
 We add up the engine to turn over 

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:54.389
 We were not together and here's this band 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:59.759
 notch cut off 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:01.399
 and now it's exactly the same here 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:22.320
 strip 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:26.130
 and now this one neatly 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.130
 so now 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:32.169
