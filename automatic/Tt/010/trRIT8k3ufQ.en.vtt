00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.850
 the school bear is very present 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.010
 lately I have done it and I have 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.080
 suffered from that I will speak the god 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.180
 bullying or like some moms 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.430
 they say bullying roughly it 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.550
 deal with when they bother a lot 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.949
 person and lately it has been much sounded 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.079
 and in a moment I'll tell you why the boom 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.659
 of all this first we must clarify that 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.669
 it has always existed is when a little group 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:27.800
 of boys are girls 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.929
 bothering a boy or a girl or 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.899
 teenager because this does not discriminate 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.070
 ages I suffered bullying since I was 7 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.739
 years until as good more harassment up 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.350
 the 25 years more or less passable 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.500
 all possible supports and when it was 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.289
 teenage boy saddened me but 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.300
 fortunately they were only teasing or 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.960
 words they told me never came 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.420
 to the blows they already knew that I 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.629
 he accused them 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.909
 as the teacher said to the good 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.030
 let's say he never got to hit me 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:10.189
 but I held on to the nicknames until 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.500
 one day I'm a fugitive who died for 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.220
 At least I have an old face, not a 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.680
 13 years old and all in the health that you 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.200
 says you're 13 years old and it seems to be the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.299
 dad and so forever tumor was born 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.880
 the whole secondary they kept putting me 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.979
 to all but I also so to speak 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.229
 that was my method of defense or so 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.329
 least be even but I have to confess 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.429
 I did more bullying than I did 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.610
 they never did anything physical always in 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:42.170
 mocking plan and I regret it in some 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.170
 occasions just make it clear 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.369
 already the water that you are already smelling 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.920
 that you bug the goal bug 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.750
 that's not bullying but this is cool 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.220
 rose rose and jack ramsay hans nougat her 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.780
 rock of the year 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:09.329
 true with your rock that is already 7 psi the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.000
 gala that one thing is to make fun of some 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.739
 friend that you have in confidence and something else 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.930
 is to make fun of someone who is not 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.430
 agreement that you mock that person 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.310
 that is, there is no confidence what 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.739
 are you saying it affects you and what else 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.840
 do constancio towards the two or me 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.670
 mocked the people with whom he had 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.520
 trust and I returned it 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.340
 and it was like a game and also the other 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.680
 that for me if it was a good ball of me 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.140
 they mocked people of confidence and also I 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.280
 they did bullying people with whom they did not 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.100
 I had that confidence and it bothered me 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.780
 once clarified the point there are many 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.020
 people that says that has always 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.360
 There was an accompanying moment that is 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.640
 tax in my time we counted on 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.560
 that pizzi crying mls and in our 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.530
 times held us in our 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.450
 times there was no internet so the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.090
 that bothers in bullying with the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.430
 teasing extend over the schedule of 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.470
 classes because once leaving classes 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.750
 they can also bother you on the internet 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.180
 because now you can record the bullying 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.519
 even and you upload it to the internet and see it 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.620
 more friends from other schools of others 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.319
 states from other countries and so the one that 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.390
 annoying has more public now you can 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.489
 take a picture of someone who goes wrong 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.530
 or in a shameful moment you put a 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.630
 text and upload it to the internet now you can 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.950
 continue bullying from facebook there 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.950
 the seriousness 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.860
 although this did not exist before but there 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.980
 a very specific key to eradicate 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.129
 this problem do not be audience of 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.010
 bully all we have ever been 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.230
 victim of bullying and everyone ever 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.870
 we have done bullying and that has put 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.150
 in fairies think about 90% of the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.540
 cases of bullying do not happen one against 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.630
 one and that and when one makes fun of another 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.629
 almost always does it with an audience 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.819
 there are people who are out there and they have 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.920
 to wear the one that is making fun of the 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.739
 another person and besides this there are people 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.980
 that laughs at how they annoy the other but 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.049
 if nobody laughed at their nonsense or if 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.510
 no one supports him he would not continue doing it 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.000
 nothing else think about it that you have 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.760
 bothered someone you've ever 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.190
 done only you and that person or there 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.139
 public around who laugh at the 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.660
 nonsense you say or when you've seen 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.820
 that a person only upset 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.250
 another person without public and passes 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.890
 very little and the second way of 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.350
 eradicate it is that the brave is 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.780
 brave until the coward who eye 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.390
 I'm not talking about violence but 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.880
 many times we are bothered not 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.250
 we say nothing we feel sorry to tell the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.080
 Professor, it's a pity to tell the 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.690
 person who bothers us to stop it 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.090
 to do please we feel sorry to tell 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.580
 our parents are sorry to tell 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.170
 the parents of the person who bothers us 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.810
 if you are one of the people who suffer 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.030
 bullying I invite you to take that 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.680
 In the end it would be a pity if you continue 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.630
 silent and the people who do 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.820
 bullying hopefully they become aware of what 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.680
 what they are doing and that this 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.500
 moment of maturity that many people 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.660
 it has come to us from knowing that that is not 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.520
 well and leave other people that 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.740
 continue with your life in a way 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.400
 peaceful a hug and see you in the 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.400
 next video
