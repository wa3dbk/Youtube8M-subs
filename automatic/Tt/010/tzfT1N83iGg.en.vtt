00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Our lady's farm is 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.160
 sheep in the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.920
 confinement responsible for 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.429
 property has been in business for seven years. 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.540
 years, the industry is profitable and has 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.949
 benefits 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.720
 it is an activity that you can 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.680
 develop - in which even in small 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.359
 areas 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.310
 then it is an option for those who are walking 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.140
 for cane and was left with a 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.510
 farm or even for those who have 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 beef cattle and can work 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.439
 with these animals together in 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.680
 rolling hills of the south has about 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.219
 500 thousand head of sheep according to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.010
 10 properties 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.239
 and the state is in the eighth 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.250
 placing the national ranking of 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.010
 there are now only three refrigerators in the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.110
 slaughtered state 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.289
 however only two do the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.109
 procedure and still sporadically 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.989
 with this the producers need to send 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.340
 the animals to be slaughtered 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.470
 especially in SÃ£o Paulo and in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.610
 rondonÃ³polis no mato grosso 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.990
 last year 4568 sheep were 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.700
 slaughtered being 2,187 sent to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.720
 refrigerators here and 2,381 for others 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.280
 States 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.229
 one of the greatest difficulties 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.000
 producers of mato grosso do sul is the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.930
 shipment of these animals to the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.479
 refrigerators 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.350
 because to fill a truck are 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.020
 around 120 sheep and many 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.290
 times a producer alone can not 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.320
 add that cargo to slaughter 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.780
 to facilitate this logistics to famasul 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.479
 in partnership with iagro seprotur 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.670
 Ministry of Agriculture and the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.930
 producers and sectoral chamber of 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.850
 goats and sheep created the TV or 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.780
 resting property of sheep for 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.390
 slaughter 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.820
 the project works on our farm 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.280
 help lady here the producers 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.110
 can bring the amount of animals that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.840
 have for sale 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.090
 assembled are taken in the same truck 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.890
 for the refrigerator these animals receive 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.670
 an identification with stick marker 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.319
 by color 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.830
 then each producer was identified with 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.290
 a color 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.330
 it is much easier to market without 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.930
 depend on the intermediary program 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.900
 unprecedented in Brazil has existed for one year 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.620
 January to early May 2014 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.930
 600 animals were shipped here 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.920
 producers do not pay for leaving 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.500
 property 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.690
 then just divide the freight value the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.050
 truck driver and has some refrigerators 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.840
 who still catch the sheep in the place without 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.020
 cost as long as it has good 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.940
 amount or the program has 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.990
 relieved with the pocket of the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.850
 producers 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.730
 the producers were satisfied I am 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.620
 Sending your sheep is by means of 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.020
 to be beaten 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.240
 famasul veterinarian highlights 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.300
 even though the population also 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.910
 project because this way is easier 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.270
 shipment to the refrigerators and thus 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.060
 more and more the slaughter of sheep is made 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.550
 correctly, the producer earns the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.550
 because he will have 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.850
 animals on the same property 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.220
 that he has the truck fetched and with 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.709
 this reduces freight and especially those who 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.769
 is the consumer that will consume 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.080
 a meat that was slaughtered in a refrigerator 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.709
 with municipal or state inspection 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.570
 federal 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.209
 as they have animals of several 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.790
 monitoring the properties of IAGRO 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.100
 always need to be present at the moment 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.070
 shipment is combined with the 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.440
 responsible for the loss of the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.250
 veterinarian and the water with a 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.019
 week of shipment of the advance 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.150
 which will be the loading and unloading and 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.940
 shipment comes the official service he goes 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.370
 be supervising the documents and 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.890
 inspecting the animals in the fifth 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.410
 boarding the 120 or coming from three 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.700
 producers were taken to slaughter in 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.010
 rondonÃ³polis 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.200
 one more lead that contributes to the 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.520
 expansion of the bush south sheep industry 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.580
 grossense 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.580
