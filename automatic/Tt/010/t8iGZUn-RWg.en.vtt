00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.370
 d 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.530
 the cultivation of strawberry in the garden 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.600
 familiar as well as being very simple we 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.420
 allows to take advantage of small corners of the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.090
 orchard the most suitable date for your 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.430
 plantation is among the last of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.220
 March and during the month of April the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.919
 technique is exactly the same for 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.900
 two is valid for both strawberry and 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.720
 for the fresón well then we are going to 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.820
 get into the job as two or 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.620
 three years in the same place 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.810
 we choose any corner of the garden 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.539
 where they do not bother much if possible 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.430
 that for some time the semi shade as 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.260
 the full summer sun bothers them 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.750
 they quite want loose sandstone 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.430
 paid with the old dung and that I 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.920
 I mix it with topsoil 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.920
 the cultivation I do it in two ways 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.010
 different but always under plastic 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.320
 black fundamentally so that it does not 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.020
 stain with the earth and at the same time 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.000
 spatially of the risks to obtain the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.120
 plants we can make a nursery 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.060
 but for a small amount I think it's not worth 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.910
 the penalty and in the nursery they sell them now 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.780
 completely rooted and even some 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.409
 times with flower 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.880
 we chose a flat site to place the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.820
 versos we put the black plastic 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.970
 we make the holes I use a 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.540
 homemade gadget that as you see here in 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.540
 the images 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.000
 you can also make the opening 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.000
 making a cross with a scissor 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.780
 Well, once this is done we plant 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.600
 the strawberries and we give a good gray 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.000
 subsequently the Greek comes blanket or 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.130
 with hoses say that they like 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.700
 quite the water so we'll have to 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.480
 watering enough unless 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.220
 for the second crop 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.470
 I make a good horse 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.800
 at the top marked a small 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.800
 groove 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.820
 Y 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.820
 I plan the strawberries 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.470
 yes 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.760
 yes 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.689
 and discarded a good handful of humus 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.689
 earthworm above 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.340
 two 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.580
 then he placed the drip that is like 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.480
 let's water 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.020
 this system finally placed the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.270
 black plastic 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.150
 in this case I have opted for a mesh 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.700
 antihierba but come on it's practically 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.250
 the same and we already have planted in 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.910
 our strawberries 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.180
 good we continue with the cultivation our 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.640
 strawberries have done perfectly we see 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.640
 how are they developing they are casting 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.660
 flowers and the small ones are forming 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.870
 strawberries and finally our first 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.870
 strawberries 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.110
 all right 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.350
 and the harvest 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.810
 beautiful and tasty strawberries to make 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.310
 delicious desserts 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.640
 Oh 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.860
 not only do we like others 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.510
 beings that go crazy with this with 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.160
 this fruit on all snails 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.160
 we will be very attentive 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.240
 My way of capturing them is very simple and 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.390
 ecological 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.510
 I take some pots and some 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.630
 openings on the sides placed them 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.660
 upside down then the snails eat 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.870
 during the night and during the day can 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.720
 be seek shelters and then they 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.160
 enter in a pot through the opening 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.640
 and take refuge in its mystery 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.140
 and then I arrive in the morning and only 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.550
 I have to turn them around and 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.060
 pick them up when I have enough invited 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.610
 to a caracolada to my friends 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.000
 stewed with garlic oil are a 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.330
 true exquisite 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.760
 another predator are the woodlice that 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.730
 if we neglect we do not usually do much 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.460
 damage and let's not forget also the 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.460
 earwigs 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.460
 Y 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.520
 as for diseases they have 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.639
 some but they are not serious 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.379
 before the harvest arrives, only give 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.139
 two or three fumigadas with wing a 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.580
 ecological fungicide but from the 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.689
 moment when the first ones mature 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.779
 strawberries are over to his day 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:13.779
 i 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.500
 as previously named by the 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.419
 months of September and October we can 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.460
 reproduce our people at cost 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.970
 zero 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.520
 with a handy or we catch the stolons that 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.910
 They throw the plants and they have made in 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.910
 the earth 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.110
 and we plant them directly on the site 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.110
 that we have chosen 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.730
 as we see in the image they have already given 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:35.360
 fruit that is what we have had in the same 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:38.360
 year and all generations of strawberry so 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.400
 this way we will renew and if 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.140
 we want to increase our campuses 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.140
 Strawberry at minimum cost 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:20.039
 at 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:42.879
 to finish I repeat again that no 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.740
 let's forget that the strawberry needs watering 

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:47.289
 quite frequent you have to keep 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.689
 quite the humidity 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:52.149
 Well, that's all 

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:54.879
 if you already know if you liked it 

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:59.729
 explains aysén I like it and the same 

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:59.729
 to subscribe until next time
