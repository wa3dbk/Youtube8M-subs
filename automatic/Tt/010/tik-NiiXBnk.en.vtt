00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.050
 please tell me not 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.970
 and its lower part request costs county 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.150
 Maria there that you are not even scary 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.170
 singer's efforts in my 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.679
 and thickness 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.679
 officers 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.090
 for being recently moved all 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.220
 other places so there is nobody 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.490
 it remains to be led just what to do 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.790
 would sleep it very much by songs on 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.759
 watched hockey give a good mood 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:17.159
 and takes like 83 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.159
 what is a good mood 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.350
 and 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.869
 don't write that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.469
 write down such poems a secret I do not write 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.890
 poems 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:42.640
 rather i write them extremely rarely and micro 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.420
 a lot of poems about texts you how can 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.630
 for dearly the fact is we are 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.380
 the process is very difficult bisyulya 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.659
 and somehow 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.640
 define the creative process 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.770
 quite complicated practically 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.729
 it is impossible to explain I will not be able to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.729
 Unfortunately 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.330
 but 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.750
 yes and 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:21.430
 how do you recognize this gig with ease 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.590
 energy of such love blocks insane 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.590
 listen every day drown from watering 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.650
 we want and a very big pair died 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.810
 After all - my longtime fan is hysterical 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.180
 really went out a long time ago wanted 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.189
 we will fly and 8 to the fact that we are here we are 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.700
 We hope that to the end is very cool 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.700
 what energy 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.820
 he will 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.240
 but 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.540
 creative density 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.470
 possibly 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.860
 she will appear 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.860
 planers 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.350
 the thing is, you're changing so I 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.360
 can't talk about 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.360
 An upgrade will certainly happen 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.880
 how much will it be noticeable for 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:06.470
 fans I can not say but what 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.470
 he will happen it. 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:34.710
 it is legally necessary year of release 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.760
 gambit touring and it is quite possible that i 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.430
 I will go to study 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.980
 to one of the documentary masters 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.610
 movies and maybe later I will make a movie 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.830
 i don't work other musicians and 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:54.130

 unavailable 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.330
