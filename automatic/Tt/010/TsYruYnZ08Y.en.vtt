 [Music] 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.080
 look with what I found now 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.720
 pupils of the little school 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.300
 look what they play monopoly and send 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.670
 When you get the wrong number you go to 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.130
 prison but now it does not put you puts you 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.830
 that you are Gregorio saints as are the 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.960
 guys, how are you lying? 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:36.080
 Canada as they say beautiful hits 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.330
 while these regional presidents and 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.590
 I was going to put the police but it was better 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.000
 here cops but the guys copying 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.519
 I know who we have right now we have 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.470
 three very funny things angela 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.479
 school these fights that are in the 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.400
 I have to be with the rule and 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.920
 put rules or by your teacher the 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.720
 old rule are several things already 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.309
 that psychologist rule does not sometimes 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.830
 arranging like the tour at school 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.269
 that they understood well to see what was happening 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.409
 here what has happened the congress is 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.409
 all there is to punish them 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.720
 [Applause] 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.920
 [Music] 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.780
 stupid cupid presumptively does not have 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.780
 changes that you tell lies 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.180
 and it's very good 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.060
 this goes 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.209
 [Applause] 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.170

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.709
 [Music] 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.310
 with this little school because it has touched 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.490
 the reformatory practically inflamed 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.720
 cecilia chacÃ³n and ya 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.720
 Guevara said the messiah 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.390
 just quiet 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.180
 it's a circus entertaining the hemicycle 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.270
 look what happened 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.560
 a meeting of g 70 in bolivia and look 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.090
 the gifts that the government gave 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.040
 they went back to more the weird thing is that this 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.570
 gift go to account the hands 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.380
 they do not want for the right but for the 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.360
 left 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.160
 it's weirder to see you handed a 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.140
 written protest to the consulate of 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.450
 bolivia for the gift with which this 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.390
 The country has presented the attendees with 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.610
 summit of the g 77 more Chinese it's about 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.770
 this southern clock has the peculiarity 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.750
 that your needles are turned towards the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.700
 left to Bolivia considers it 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.220
 harmless and says that just 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.650
 represents that they are a southern nation and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.230
 not from the north that's why it records the time 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.050
 differently if you see it as a 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.480
 provocation not by how the needles rotate 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.920
 but because the body of the object is a 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.930
 Bolivian map that includes 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.050
 territory currently belonging to 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.239
 chile is so crazy that the clocks were 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.810
 officials like the left giral 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.810
 dawn 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.320
 and that clock is wrong to have because the 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.510
 clock is the sea on the coast that 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.780
 screamed Chile in the war but that already 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.690
 they lost because bolivia in 1904 signed 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.300
 a treaty whereby that day to chile 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.220
 that territory this is clear knowing 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.080
 Alaya and what you will say 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.640
 they sign a treaty nobody forced them to 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.530
 sign a treaty after the war to 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.990
 give up their coastline then leave 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.570
 home can not claim the exit 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.130
 to the sea because a Bolivian government 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.560
 he made the mistake of signing a treaty 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.989
 by which he resigned in charge of free 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.269
 free disposal because that is another what 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.769
 goleara Chilean stays at sea 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.480
 they give you all the facilities in 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.489
 Antofagasta and we have given 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.200
 all the facilities in ilo and you are going to 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.210
 see I loved again in thread and it's a field 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.830
 a vacuum I have not put a handle have not 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.210
 put a port have done nothing and what 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.740
 same in the zone of the Chileans by the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.640
 Chileans for the treaty are obliged to 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.050
 give non-sovereign exit 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.180
 then he does not understand he was coming back now 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.700
 come on let's see the spark that lights 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.320
 the first world war let's see the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.729
 attack has been 100 years this 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.930
 week let's see the attack on 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.630
 terrorists 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.979
 quickly look there is circulating is 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.229
 circulating the francisco principle 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.270
 fernando with his lady who opened the 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.820
 Prince who is is like the 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.759
 characters too and gets in by mistake 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.090
 against traffic but at the time 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:04.150
 they fall back and we're not going to take 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.699
 train is going to take breakfast because 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.580
 the attack had already failed 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.070
 at the beginning that movie to do 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.490
 he sees Francisco Fernando with his wife 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.250
 it kills kills macla 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.729
 and for two shots and the two shots were 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.990
 of a lethal nature they die 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.729
 main look is fame there is a 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.810
 famous historical photo that is equal 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.270
 the scenes the truth that the movie 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.750
 it's very very well done they stop it 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.759
 dies unchains all this as the 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.310
 fight the alliances the first war 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.020
 worldwide because of this man there was 10 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.310
 million dead yet in 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.259
 serbia is a hero I do not know as a 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.270
 terrorist can be a hero the orchard 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.620
 on Thursday he was going to be the next king and the 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.389
 true that he was a good guy even they 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.370
 was going to give a series of freedoms and 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.230
 things and humanity because he suffered all 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.210
 this catastrophe for this attack 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.060
 terrorist no violence never drives 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.270
 nothing good anymore we do not go goodbye to the 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.270
