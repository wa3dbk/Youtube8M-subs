00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.900 

talking<00:00:19.800> about<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> mendelssohn<00:00:20.490> skirt<00:00:20.699> so

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
talking about the mendelssohn skirt so

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.540 
talking about the mendelssohn skirt so
it<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.779> obviously<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.039> those<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.400> we

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
it is obviously one of those that we

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.599 
it is obviously one of those that we
have<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.050> lot<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.609> difficulty

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
have to do the have a lot of difficulty

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.970 
have to do the have a lot of difficulty
things<00:00:26.849> especially<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.230> lightness<00:00:28.890> of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
things especially the lightness of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.349 
things especially the lightness of
articulation<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.029> speed<00:00:30.269> of

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
articulation and the speed of

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.820 
articulation and the speed of
articulation<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.050> being<00:00:31.590> able<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
articulation and being able to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.180 
articulation and being able to
articulate<00:00:32.189> while<00:00:32.489> playing<00:00:32.700> softly<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:34.190> that

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
articulate while playing softly now that

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.080 
articulate while playing softly now that
also<00:00:35.579> gets<00:00:36.450> completely<00:00:38.000> enhanced<00:00:39.000> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
also gets completely enhanced that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.459 
also gets completely enhanced that
difficulty<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.140> an<00:00:40.260> instrument

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
difficulty if you have an instrument

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.709 
difficulty if you have an instrument
that<00:00:40.649> does<00:00:40.920> not<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.460> an<00:00:41.700> even<00:00:42.210> resistance

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that does not have an even resistance

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.380 
that does not have an even resistance
between<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.050> registers<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:43.700> that<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.879> why

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
between the registers now that is why

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.510 
between the registers now that is why
the<00:00:45.450> things<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.930> drove<00:00:46.289> more<00:00:46.500> crazy<00:00:46.920> when

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
the things that I drove more crazy when

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.250 
the things that I drove more crazy when
we<00:00:47.550> were<00:00:47.760> working<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:48.750> cleaner<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
we were working on the more cleaner to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
we were working on the more cleaner to
make<00:00:49.379> sure<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.100> play<00:00:50.329> seamlessly

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
make sure that we can play seamlessly

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.840 
make sure that we can play seamlessly
from<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.809> throat<00:00:52.050> notes<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.460> lung

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
from the throat notes to the lung

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
from the throat notes to the lung
Clarion<00:00:54.510> register<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> then<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.890> can

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
Clarion register so that then you can

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.100 
Clarion register so that then you can
match<00:00:56.520> note<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.609> match<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.780> only<00:01:03.960> in

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
match note so we match this not only in

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.320 
match note so we match this not only in
color<00:01:04.379> boarding<00:01:04.860> resistance<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.030> then

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
color boarding resistance so that then

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.520 
color boarding resistance so that then
you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.479> play<00:01:09.810> softly<00:01:15.020> okay<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
you can play softly okay which is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.899 
you can play softly okay which is
important<00:01:16.979> especially<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.790> play

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
important especially if you have to play

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.039 
important especially if you have to play
softer<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> therefore<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.420> other<00:01:24.600> thing<00:01:24.869> is

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
softer and therefore the other thing is

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.340 
softer and therefore the other thing is
to<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.860> quick<00:01:26.820> response<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.900> long

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to have the quick response in the long

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.380 
to have the quick response in the long
notes<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:29.340> hand<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.240> can

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
notes in the right hand so then you can

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:43.120 
notes in the right hand so then you can
go<00:01:40.640> practice<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:42.270> try<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> even<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:43.020> your

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
go practice to try to even out your

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.240 
go practice to try to even out your
registers<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.899> use<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> lot<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.409> fast<00:01:46.710> air<00:01:46.950> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
registers and use a lot of fast air and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.789 
registers and use a lot of fast air and
light<00:01:47.610> tongue<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.180> you'll<00:01:48.930> definitely<00:01:49.320> sound

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
light tongue and you'll definitely sound

00:01:49.799 --> 00:02:05.250 
light tongue and you'll definitely sound
much<00:01:49.920> better<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> MOBA

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.320
