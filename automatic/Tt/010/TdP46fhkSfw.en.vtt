00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
invisibility sphere which actually will

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.700 
invisibility sphere which actually will
help<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.689> bit<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> chain<00:01:10.320> Gunners

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.179 
help a little bit with the chain Gunners
these<00:01:11.640> guys<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:12.320> very<00:01:13.320> very<00:01:13.500> high<00:01:13.920> priority

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
these guys are very very high priority

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.390 
these guys are very very high priority
on<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:14.760> kill<00:01:15.000> lists<00:01:15.470> they<00:01:16.470> are<00:01:16.740> glass

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
on your kill lists they are glass

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.850 
on your kill lists they are glass
cannons<00:01:18.030> pretty<00:01:18.360> much<00:01:18.540> there's<00:01:18.960> two<00:01:19.680> new

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
cannons pretty much there's two new

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.899 
cannons pretty much there's two new
enemies<00:01:20.189> actually<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.700> could<00:01:20.820> be

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
enemies actually that could be

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.390 
enemies actually that could be
considered<00:01:21.240> glass<00:01:21.630> cannons<00:01:22.229> that's<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
considered glass cannons that's the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.160 
considered glass cannons that's the
first<00:01:23.670> one

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.899 

and<00:01:32.170> they<00:01:32.770> are<00:01:32.950> actually<00:01:33.159> a<00:01:33.430> little<00:01:33.700> bit

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
and they are actually a little bit

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.960 
and they are actually a little bit
tougher<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.330> kill<00:01:34.540> than<00:01:34.780> your<00:01:34.930> average<00:01:35.970> like

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
tougher to kill than your average like

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.510 
tougher to kill than your average like
human<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.960> sew<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.740> on<00:01:38.890> top<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.250> they

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
human to sew and on top of that they

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.609 
human to sew and on top of that they
don't<00:01:39.729> need<00:01:40.000> superhuman<00:01:40.840> vision<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.350> be<00:01:41.500> able

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
don't need superhuman vision to be able

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.480 
don't need superhuman vision to be able
to<00:01:41.799> hurt<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.869> look<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.290> blue<00:01:44.500> key<00:01:45.130> is

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
to hurt you and look the blue key is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.789 
to hurt you and look the blue key is
right<00:01:45.700> in<00:01:45.850> front<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.600> blue<00:01:46.840> door<00:01:47.110> how

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
right in front of the blue door how

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.719 
right in front of the blue door how
generous

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.570 

so<00:01:54.729> we're<00:01:54.940> gonna<00:01:55.090> clear<00:01:55.330> both<00:01:55.539> sides<00:01:55.899> of<00:01:56.170> it

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.430 

flip<00:02:00.580> that<00:02:00.759> switch<00:02:01.030> will<00:02:01.750> actually<00:02:02.259> raise

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
flip that switch will actually raise

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.899 
flip that switch will actually raise
that<00:02:02.710> little<00:02:02.979> ledge<00:02:03.159> over<00:02:03.369> there<00:02:03.640> as<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.880> can

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
that little ledge over there as you can

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.740 
that little ledge over there as you can
see<00:02:04.619> now<00:02:05.619> what<00:02:05.800> happens<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.130> do<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.399> other<00:02:06.550> one

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.449 

well<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.760> sella<00:02:13.030> porter<00:02:13.360> over<00:02:13.569> here<00:02:14.459> takes

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
well the sella porter over here takes

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.370 
well the sella porter over here takes
you<00:02:15.550> back<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:16.120> over<00:02:16.390> here<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.050> can<00:02:17.170> pick

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
you back just over here and you can pick

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.750 
you back just over here and you can pick
up<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.590> chain<00:02:17.800> gun<00:02:18.010> yay

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
up a chain gun yay

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.729 
up a chain gun yay
however<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.540> puts<00:02:19.750> us<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:19.989> position<00:02:20.440> where<00:02:20.620> we

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
however it puts us in position where we

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:27.030 
however it puts us in position where we
can<00:02:20.860> just<00:02:21.040> walk<00:02:21.250> straight<00:02:21.760> forward<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:26.680> is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
can just walk straight forward this is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.900 
can just walk straight forward this is
proof<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.680> chain<00:02:29.680> gun<00:02:29.980> are<00:02:30.610> not<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
proof that the chain gun are not the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.449 
proof that the chain gun are not the
chain<00:02:31.120> gun<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.360> super<00:02:31.660> shotgun<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
chain gun the super shotgun is just the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.250 
chain gun the super shotgun is just the
most<00:02:33.640> ridiculous<00:02:34.150> weapon<00:02:34.750> ever<00:02:34.959> made

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.280 

if<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.530> could<00:02:41.770> aim<00:02:45.270> now<00:02:46.270> imagine<00:02:46.900> if<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.080> were

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
if I could aim now imagine if this were

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.090 
if I could aim now imagine if this were
