00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
all right here we are crash mint stage

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.620 
all right here we are crash mint stage
and<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.380> mostly<00:00:10.740> ladders<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.670> up<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.330> all

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
and it's mostly ladders going up so all

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.279 
and it's mostly ladders going up so all
the<00:00:12.750> screens<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.620> up<00:00:14.780> words<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.199> I

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
the screens are going up words and I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.170 
the screens are going up words and I
recommend<00:00:16.529> using<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.890> metal<00:00:17.220> blades<00:00:17.430> because

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
recommend using the metal blades because

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.990 
recommend using the metal blades because
since<00:00:18.960> you're<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.170> up<00:00:19.350> all<00:00:19.470> these<00:00:19.590> ladders

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
since you're going up all these ladders

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400 
since you're going up all these ladders
the<00:00:21.000> metal<00:00:21.240> blades<00:00:21.390> shoot<00:00:21.689> upwards<00:00:22.109> shoot

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the metal blades shoot upwards shoot

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.820 
the metal blades shoot upwards shoot
diagonally<00:00:22.820> so<00:00:23.820> they've<00:00:24.810> become<00:00:24.990> very<00:00:25.170> useful

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
diagonally so they've become very useful

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.759 
diagonally so they've become very useful
in<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.039> stage<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.539> recommend<00:00:28.019> using<00:00:28.349> them

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
in this stage so I recommend using them

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.380

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.279 
the thing about this stage that's pretty
annoying<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.390> when<00:00:48.510> you're<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.660> ladders<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
annoying is when you're on ladders and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.619 
annoying is when you're on ladders and
if<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.649> hit<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.280> totally<00:00:51.030> fall<00:00:51.270> off<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
if you get hit you totally fall off the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.770 
if you get hit you totally fall off the
ladder<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.370> problem<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.059> in

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
ladder and I have problem with that in

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.680 
ladder and I have problem with that in
this<00:00:54.840> stage<00:00:55.350> later<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.539> in

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this stage later on it's kind of like in

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.970 
this stage later on it's kind of like in
the<00:00:57.780> Castlevania<00:00:58.350> series<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> get

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the Castlevania series when you get

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
harmed you will fly backwards it totally

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.070 
harmed you will fly backwards it totally
happens<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.190> Megaman<00:01:02.609> also<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.899> makes

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
happens in Megaman also it just makes

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.940 
happens in Megaman also it just makes
the<00:01:04.199> game<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:05.070> difficult<00:01:06.799> it's<00:01:07.799> just

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the game a lot more difficult it's just

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.039 
the game a lot more difficult it's just
something<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.280> NES<00:01:08.880> games<00:01:09.150> usually<00:01:09.510> had<00:01:09.750> in

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
something that NES games usually had in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.530 
something that NES games usually had in
the<00:01:10.619> 2d<00:01:10.920> platforming<00:01:11.580> where<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.180> hit<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the 2d platforming where you get hit you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.080 
the 2d platforming where you get hit you
would<00:01:12.659> fly<00:01:12.869> back<00:01:16.189> of<00:01:17.189> course<00:01:17.400> Mario<00:01:17.820> didn't

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
would fly back of course Mario didn't

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.429 
would fly back of course Mario didn't
have<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.810> when<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.960> were<00:01:19.110> Super

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
have that because when you were Super

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.289 
have that because when you were Super
Mario<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.979> would<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.250> shrink<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> size<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
Mario you would just shrink the size and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
Mario you would just shrink the size and
then<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.780> would<00:01:21.900> die<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> next<00:01:22.650> time<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.890> get

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
then you would die the next time you get

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.690 
then you would die the next time you get
hit<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:24.530> Castlevania<00:01:25.530> Megaman

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
hit so Castlevania Megaman

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.219 
hit so Castlevania Megaman
they<00:01:28.210> have<00:01:28.360> this<00:01:28.479> thing<00:01:28.689> where<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:28.930> get<00:01:29.020> hit

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
they have this thing where you get hit

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.319 
they have this thing where you get hit
you<00:01:29.439> have<00:01:29.500> fly<00:01:29.829> backwards<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.579> you're<00:01:31.119> most

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
you have fly backwards and you're most

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.969 
you have fly backwards and you're most
likely<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.780> get<00:01:31.990> harmed<00:01:32.229> again<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.439> it's<00:01:35.860> one

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
likely to get harmed again so it's one

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:36.810 
likely to get harmed again so it's one
of<00:01:36.039> those<00:01:36.100> things<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.369> made<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.640> games

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
of those things that made the games

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.740 
of those things that made the games
challenging

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
challenging

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.130 
challenging
back<00:01:38.439> in<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.649> 8-bit<00:01:38.979> era<00:01:39.570> here's<00:01:40.570> this<00:01:40.750> enemy

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
back in the 8-bit era here's this enemy

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.149 
back in the 8-bit era here's this enemy
again<00:01:41.409> pretty<00:01:42.100> lame<00:01:42.340> but<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:43.740> got<00:01:44.740> hit<00:01:44.890> by<00:01:44.920> him

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
should have went back to the metal plate

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.569 
should have went back to the metal plate
because<00:02:47.410> now<00:02:47.560> we<00:02:47.620> have<00:02:47.859> two<00:02:48.160> enemies

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
because now we have two enemies

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.430 
because now we have two enemies
attacking<00:02:49.030> at<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.480> same<00:02:49.660> time<00:02:49.930> at<00:02:50.139> the<00:02:50.230> bird

power-ups<00:04:17.260> when<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.530> defeat<00:04:17.799> them<00:04:17.979> so<00:04:19.979> they

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
power-ups when you defeat them so they

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.480 
power-ups when you defeat them so they
just<00:04:21.190> keep<00:04:21.310> responding<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.390> just<00:04:22.720> keep

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
just keep responding so just keep

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.219 
just keep responding so just keep
shooting<00:04:24.490> them<00:04:24.729> hoping<00:04:25.450> for<00:04:25.600> some<00:04:25.750> good<00:04:25.960> stuff

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
shooting them hoping for some good stuff

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.630 
shooting them hoping for some good stuff
one-up<00:04:27.120> energy<00:04:28.120> capsule<00:04:28.330> whatever<00:04:29.640> here

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
one-up energy capsule whatever here

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.040 
one-up energy capsule whatever here
right<00:04:30.760> now<00:04:30.880> looks<00:04:31.060> like<00:04:31.150> they<00:04:31.479> ran<00:04:31.840> out<00:04:32.020> of

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
right now looks like they ran out of

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:39.080 
right now looks like they ran out of
goodies<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:32.680> kind<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.610> over<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:35.280> nothing<00:04:36.600> and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
goodies so kind of over it nothing and

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.200 
goodies so kind of over it nothing and
alrighty<00:04:40.090> then<00:04:40.360> onto<00:04:41.169> crash<00:04:41.500> man<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:42.000> crash<00:04:43.000> man

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
alrighty then onto crash man a crash man

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.480 
alrighty then onto crash man a crash man
is<00:04:43.330> totally<00:04:43.660> weak<00:04:44.140> against<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.770> air<00:04:45.040> shooter

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
is totally weak against the air shooter

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.530 
is totally weak against the air shooter
so<00:04:46.200> equip<00:04:47.200> that<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:48.000> around<00:04:49.000> three<00:04:49.240> or<00:04:49.360> four

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
so equip that and around three or four

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.750 
so equip that and around three or four
hits<00:04:49.750> in<00:04:49.930> this<00:04:50.050> guy's<00:04:50.229> toast

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
hits in this guy's toast

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.470 
hits in this guy's toast
he<00:04:52.760> shoots<00:04:52.970> his<00:04:53.150> crash<00:04:53.390> bombs<00:04:55.240> they<00:04:56.240> kind<00:04:56.420> of

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
he shoots his crash bombs they kind of

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.090 
he shoots his crash bombs they kind of
stick<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.870> ground<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.380> explode<00:04:57.830> he'll

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
stick to the ground and explode he'll

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.160 
stick to the ground and explode he'll
just<00:04:58.250> jump<00:04:58.340> around<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:58.880> do<00:04:59.000> that<00:04:59.150> see<00:05:00.110> how

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
just jump around and do that see how

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.860 
just jump around and do that see how
much<00:05:00.230> energy<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.830> air<00:05:00.980> shooter<00:05:01.250> takes<00:05:01.460> away

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
much energy the air shooter takes away

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.900 
much energy the air shooter takes away
so<00:05:02.870> it's<00:05:03.020> best<00:05:03.230> to<00:05:03.440> defeat<00:05:04.040> air<00:05:04.310> man<00:05:04.340> before

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
so it's best to defeat air man before

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.490 
so it's best to defeat air man before
you<00:05:05.090> get<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.330> crash<00:05:05.570> man<00:05:08.050> just<00:05:09.050> like<00:05:09.170> that<00:05:09.350> he's

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
you get to crash man just like that he's

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:18.070 
you get to crash man just like that he's
done

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.850 

get<00:05:19.080> equipped<00:05:19.500> with<00:05:19.770> fresh<00:05:20.430> paw
