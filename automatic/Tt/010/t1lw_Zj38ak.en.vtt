00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.050
 Today's Special Feature on the Environmental Strategy of Car Maker Mazda 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.009
 is 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.289
 Development of environmentally friendly vehicles such as hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.289
 It is said to hold the key to survival in the automotive industry 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.649
 Under these circumstances, Mazda is a new model with significantly improved fuel efficiency than before 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.180
 We sold Axela from today 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.400
 With hybrid cars growing rapidly in recent years 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.370
 How is Masuda's environmental strategy going to change? 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.770
 Tamura reporter interviewed 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.770
 New Mazda Axela is born 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.880
 New model unveiled at the stadium where Hiroshima City was located 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.220
 There is 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.020
 Completely improved after six years 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.020
 The latest environmental technology was included 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 How does Mazda reduce the so-called tax rate in the US 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.740
 New stereo 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.740
 We want to be a trump card for business recovery 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.210
 About 300,000 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 Strong 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.340
 Mark this 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 It is about golf ball 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.610
 Special search 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.610
 It is assumed that there is a secondary income 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.289
 New Axela 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.709
 The biggest feature is the idling stop function 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.709
 is 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.760
 By stopping the engine automatically while stopping 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.890
 You can improve ms10% 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.789
 Time to restart the engine is 35 seconds closed 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.049
 Reduced to half of other manufacturers 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.049
 Vibration and sound have also been reduced 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.629
 When you turn right at an intersection, etc., dispatch is required 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.459
 Even if 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.459
 You don't have to burden the driver 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.299
 When the amount of revenge is made 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:36.789
 only 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.059
 Uncomfortable 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:42.579
 Let's destroy the array for a few minutes thoroughly 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.909
 Not really in addition to the largest effort among them 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.279
 Themed 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:50.809
 Especially in central Tokyo, effective fuel efficiency improvement can be mentioned 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:54.039
 I think that I would like to expand the concourse 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.629
 It is 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.629
 Further refinements were also opened 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.509
 Intake of air for cooling the engine part 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.509
 Tone 20% smaller than before 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.579
 Reduce resistance by not transferring wasteful air to the car 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.189
 I improved the fuel consumption 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.150
 The new Axela is not only good in fuel efficiency but also in driving performance 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.150
 I'm trying to grab the driver's heart 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.769
 The United States has the greatest attraction among them 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.419
 This is a model that has been further developed 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.639
 This also corresponds to the environment required from now on 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.269
 The two pillars are attached, and the person embodied in many is also wonderful 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.899
 But 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:45.059
 However 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.309
 Launching of low-cost hybrid cars that I love 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:50.669
 Is changing 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.669
 Part of domestic new car sales in April 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.639
 Insight 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:00.739
 last month 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.189
 May governor is Toyota's Prius 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.609
 The hybrid car maintained the top for 2 consecutive months 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.839
 Mazda's hybrid car combined with hydrogen engine 

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.569
 There is only a special type 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.900
 Selling leases for government offices and businesses is not cold 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:29.029
 For this reason, Mazda is in full swing to develop hybrid vehicles 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.669
 I'm turning 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:31.699
 In this month 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.699
 A specialized department was set up at the head office 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.190
 Mazda is 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.189
 At the beginning of the 2010s 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.340
 We are going to start mass production of hybrid vehicles 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.040
 Depending on market trends in the future, we may consider ahead of sales time 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.040
 I'm going to 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.069
 More than our expectations 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.919
 Made early 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.919
 It means that you have advanced 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.270
 Well honestly speaking to a pretty teacher 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.159
 I feel 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.550
 We at Starbucks have their own technology 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.550
 On the other hand, we are developing 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.759
 Just somehow 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.759
 I want to catch up in a short time 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.150
 We are 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.180
 I had a business plan 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.909
 s 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.439
 timing 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.589
 After all 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:28.129
 I must finally make it a little ahead 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.620
 The place where 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.020
 Oh, here and there a little 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.589
 As a way of thinking 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:38.589
 I think about bondage 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.849
 Tamura who worked on coverage works well 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.959
 The other three drums hybrid cars rapidly 

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:46.540
 Because we are extending the advance 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.790
 It also affects Mazda's environmental strategy. 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.270
 I agree 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.069
 Please look at here Enatsu 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:58.129
 In the long-term plan of technology development announced by Oto Matsuzawa 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.099
 Average fuel consumption of cars by 2015 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:07.069
 The goal is to improve 30% compared to 2008 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.250
 Mazda's first plan to achieve the existing gasoline company 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:13.580
 Advance the improvement 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.729
 After improving the fuel efficiency of the entire car, then 2 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.729
 We are aiming to develop hybrid vehicles in earnest 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.999
 But with Toyota and Honda 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:27.249
 Launched low-priced hybrid vehicles one after another 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:30.779
 And as Mazda is rapidly increasing sales, as Mazda 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.469
 It is in a situation where the development of hybrid vehicles can not but be 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:35.419
 Run 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.289
 From now on Mazda will develop hybrid dead 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.270
 What kind of problem is there 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.020
 LOL One of the big issues is 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.189
 It is development of a bench 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.719
 Light for hybrid vehicles powered by engine and motor 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:51.979
 Development of batteries with high output is considered to be the most important 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:56.020
 Many domestic automakers already 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.940
 Collaborating with leading electronics manufacturers to develop high-performance batteries 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.449
 I'm cutting 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:04.680
 Mazda is not working with any manufacturer so far 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.259
 It is not 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:10.249
 Matsuzaka It seems to be difficult to develop the battery alone 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.060
 To mass produce and sell hybrid vehicles 

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.069
 The possibility of receiving supply from the manufacturer is high 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:22.300
 Matsusaka in the midst of intense competition for development of single environmental technologies 

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:25.299
 The next strategy to launch is being watched 

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:29.819
 Kyoto city told Mr. Tamura about Mazda's environmental strategy 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:30.219
 Did
