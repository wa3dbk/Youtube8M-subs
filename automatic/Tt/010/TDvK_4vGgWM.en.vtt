 Marseille 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.660
 it's been a long time since I liked 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 African music and especially the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.520
 sound of cora but at the same time I 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.829
 really job i never thought in my 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.690
 life that I will play someday with a 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.690
 kora player this is a surprise 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.950
 I lived in a neighborhood where there was 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.190
 Senegalese Africans ways 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.040
 Maghrebian Italians of all this has 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.320
 does I have a fairly broad culture of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.260
 the friend of the particular echo music 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.300
 African people had relationships 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.020
 humans who the stones who really 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 market who walked right away 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.450
 between us and these greenhouses who did 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.460
 also that we have been able to evolve together with 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.270
 m with these projects it's not just 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.270
 that the trad music 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.060
 the sound of the kora inspired the title of 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.760
 the album collates the heart in spanish 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.370
 and these three there assuming to make a 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.220
 heart music everyone brings his 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.540
 influences and communicates with each other 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.520
 even allowing kaele improvisation 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.209
 who does something that makes me want 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.560
 to do something else so in order to play 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.340
 together to understand each other 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.340
 improvisation comes naturally 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.170
 it's true that in jazz there is 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.400
 a lot this opportunity to listen 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.739
 the other and respond to each other's 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.489
 kind of conversation constantly in 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.489

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.420

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.799
