00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.310
 which team to choose when playing 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.980
 online to little by 2015 hi to all and the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.630
 theme of the video this week i 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.160
 decided to make a video about 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.389
 teams tested in this ps 2015 and that's 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.730
 true actually I noticed they are 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.670
 so many that suddenly 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.769
 would be a little galley of really 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.090
 you the lists is then rather than 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.220
 you make a long speech based 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.640
 of each team with each diagram 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.560
 tactical I decided to provide you with a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.820
 video with images in which and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.370
 Well, I only played with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.760
 two-star teams 2 stars or 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 three stars so the osaka cerezo here 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.940
 against big teams to why 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.780
 simply to show you that he 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 is possible in pes to find his 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.289
 team 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.180
 not according to the statistics 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.219
 dariÃ©n roven or the speed of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.110
 cristiano ronaldo but really a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.109
 overall balance between the attacked and the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.520
 defense actually tried it depends on that 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.809
 really depends on enough teams 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.660
 rarely have I tried juventus 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.689
 turin if you want and I have not won 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.799
 a single match with the judge so I 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.570
 yet I can build 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.360
 actions but if there is any finishing 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.150
 either really be the defense the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.740
 placement of circles finally brief ago 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.110
 there is something wrong so 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.700
 rather than insisting with a team 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.509
 bayern style for example enormously 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.580
 players online 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.220
 so it's a shame because it 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.409
 really waste game potential of getting 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.509
 content to take the bayern of 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.420
 munich or the madrid real by knowing 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.470
 that we are not in fifa to say it is 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.990
 not the team that has the biggest 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.090
 stats who's going to win what is it and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.310
 I think this video is game 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.899
 I'm trying to prove to you how 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.789
 by taking small teams we are 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.950
 able to beat big teams 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.960
 I hope some players will hear 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.490
 the message so yes sure that's there at 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.109
 convent top right against ibrahimovic 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.240
 it's a little david against goliath 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.319
 I you rope it prevents that when 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.149
 you take small teams 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.219
 it takes you to anticipate 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.929
 actions it takes you to procrastinate and 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.759
 it mostly leads you to hit in 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.619
 manuals and to go into manual 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.950
 because if you only rely on 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.810
 the statistics of your players from 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.239
 capitani of cerezo osaka or yoshito 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.930
 okubo of frontal kawasaki and you go 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.730
 to have a surprise 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.980
 so it's pretty good I think 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.110
 before choosing your team online 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.470
 in pes 2015 to meet the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.030
 question 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.950
 I want to say already tried full de 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 full of simply equipped the game 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.910
 there are really a lot of training 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.860
 tested there are a lot of play styles and 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.349
 of players with their own player 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.780
 heidi to test and there are good 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.670
 surprises since I count I saw 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.709
 with his money and hiroshima for example 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.799
 there is the hoiss to taussat aulas ahead 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.209
 pass a little little Japanese striker 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.950
 until the super speed I stalled 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.639
 dribbling finally I still have not 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.620
 shifted with a shaarawy or cristiano 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.920
 what does it really depend on 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.480
 near the finning you have I know that 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.739
 can seem huge the guy says they 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.389
 get to dribble with sato and 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.709
 by cristiano ronaldo but trust me 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.099
 because when you play with a 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.299
 player who is slowly going to deceive you 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.190
 at the rhythm level your opponent 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.630
 while cristiano ronado we know very 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.160
 although it's an arrow and we know 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.810
 very well how to defend on him 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.720
 so I think to choose your 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.269
 team on pes 2015 try to find 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.069
 a team with a good balance I 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.410
 think my two stars 3 and wise as 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.120
 it seems really difficult to me 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.069
 maybe it's this tea but I think 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.829
 against a good player it seems to me 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.049
 ambitious by a team against 4 4 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.180
 stars sorry I think it's a good 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.069
 balance so I think the advice that 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.870
 I give you enough to choose a 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.819
 four-star team why because 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.340
 that you will not be tempted to chew in 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.049
 the ball of 2 to go straight ball 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.000
 at the foot or play only long 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.459
 balloons the you will be forced to shoot 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.380
 the best of your players on a game 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.599
 collective on manual passes and 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.780
 on manual shots that's so it's the 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.700
 advice that I give you 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.590
 a four-star team and train 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.050
 you with small teams for 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.300
 try to progress before choosing 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.490
 really your team with whom you 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.530
 go challenge everyone in first 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.360
 division in michael mode here I am you 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.530
 leave on this video and then my side 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.400
 I tell you next week if the 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.400
 do you wear him well?
