campaigns<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.670> my<00:00:17.760> opinion<00:00:18.180> these<00:00:18.960> mods<00:00:19.230> will

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
campaigns in my opinion these mods will

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.230 
campaigns in my opinion these mods will
only<00:00:19.590> improve<00:00:19.949> little<00:00:20.460> things<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> game

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
only improve little things in the game

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.060 
only improve little things in the game
and<00:00:21.480> won't<00:00:21.900> change<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> overall<00:00:22.710> experience

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and won't change the overall experience

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.490 
and won't change the overall experience
the<00:00:24.029> reason<00:00:24.390> why<00:00:24.510> our<00:00:24.539> must-haves<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.410> my

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the reason why our must-haves in my

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560 
the reason why our must-haves in my
opinion<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.310> they<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.730> fix<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.300> change

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
opinion is that they all fix or change

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.720 
opinion is that they all fix or change
something<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.260> neglected<00:00:28.890> weird<00:00:29.460> or

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
something that was neglected weird or

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.580 
something that was neglected weird or
simply<00:00:30.150> disappointing<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> beta<00:00:31.199> game<00:00:31.439> I

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
simply disappointing in the beta game I

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.010 
simply disappointing in the beta game I
see<00:00:32.279> no<00:00:32.460> reason<00:00:32.669> why<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.210> use<00:00:33.239> them<00:00:33.660> but

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
see no reason why not to use them but

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900 
see no reason why not to use them but
you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.260> obviously<00:00:34.410> decide<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.460> yourself

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
you can obviously decide for yourself

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
you can obviously decide for yourself
they're<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:36.989> individual<00:00:37.649> mods<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.160> can

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
stretches those levels you can zoom in

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.830 
stretches those levels you can zoom in
closer<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.700> can<00:03:28.820> also<00:03:28.970> zoom<00:03:29.090> out<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.510> lot

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
further than any base game this is just

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.540 
further than any base game this is just
great<00:03:32.900> overall<00:03:33.440> because<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.160> provide<00:03:34.489> a
