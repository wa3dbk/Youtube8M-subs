00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 the tournament was a nice tournament there 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.259
 final was not exciting there are 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.630
 there have been many controversies especially from 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.759
 part of both teams are there 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.360
 attacks on referees 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.210
 but the problem in my opinion was the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.189
 final match 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.350
 certainly the teams have adapted 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.960
 to the rules that are and are coming 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.710
 out an absolutely boring game 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.890
 too violent where the ball is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.630
 then the proposal disappeared from the long 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.870
 after having also heard the mayor 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.050
 matteo renzi who evidently after having 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.239
 talked to the guests of honor there were 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.480
 paolo bettini ct of the national team of 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.860
 sergio cycling parisse national of 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 rugby 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.800
 and then there was also ours I do n't know between 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.340
 quotation marks without quotation marks 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.390
 here the show was missed on Sunday 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 very 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.480
 then here is to change the rules and search 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
 to make the ball circulate more 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.380
 let me explain better in soccer facebook 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.350
 what when you laugh that the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.710
 back pass to the doorman did 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.049
 wasting time, however, were not one 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.159
 pearl of show it was decided to 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.460
 reach and avoid these these 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.110
 wasted time could be in the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.590
 historic football can be avoided for 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.770
 example that a kicker can hold the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.750
 handball over ten seconds 20 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.720
 thirty seconds what will be 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.759
 established my proposal was worth 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.909
 set up a commission made up of 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.590
 great champions and make football 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.149
 historical more fun and less and even though 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.280
 we want less violent is not possible 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.729
 that one takes the ball if he saw in 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.880
 hand is protected by a host of boxers 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.880
 and maybe of fighters it becomes a few 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.590
 little funny thing of little 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.450
 pleasant otherwise you risk doing 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.810
 percent 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.239
 when the game was very complicated and i 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.009
 Florentines in the end to let him die 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.009
 because they no longer enjoyed themselves
