an interesting question you know
something<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.350> kind<00:01:05.619> of<00:01:05.649> captures<00:01:06.009> your

something that kind of captures your

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.160 
something that kind of captures your
imagination<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:07.659> what<00:01:07.810> caught<00:01:08.020> my

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
imagination really what caught my

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.469 
imagination really what caught my
imagination<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.740> such<00:01:09.040> kind<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:09.970> cool<00:01:10.180> thing

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
imagination is such kind of cool thing

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.880 
imagination is such kind of cool thing
was<00:01:10.689> was<00:01:10.899> was<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.290> problem<00:01:11.500> of<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.680> monkey

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
was was was the problem of the monkey

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.130 
was was was the problem of the monkey
jection<00:01:12.100> reflex<00:01:12.580> there<00:01:13.270> just<00:01:13.450> seems<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.720> be<00:01:13.810> so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
jection reflex there just seems to be so

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.499 
jection reflex there just seems to be so
many<00:01:14.320> really<00:01:15.280> challenging<00:01:15.789> problems<00:01:16.180> that

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
many really challenging problems that

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.620 
many really challenging problems that
this<00:01:16.750> phenomena<00:01:17.640> revoked<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:19.119> firstly<00:01:19.450> in

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
this phenomena revoked and firstly in

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.719 
this phenomena revoked and firstly in
her<00:01:19.780> house<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.320> birth<00:01:20.500> generated<00:01:21.159> cell

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
her house the birth generated cell

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.310 
her house the birth generated cell
synchronized<00:01:22.299> and<00:01:22.570> what<00:01:22.750> was<00:01:22.899> this<00:01:23.020> a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
synchronized and what was this a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.710 
synchronized and what was this a
pulsatile<00:01:23.890> signal<00:01:24.460> mean<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.360> so<00:01:25.479> those<00:01:25.600> are

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
pulsatile signal mean and so those are

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.060 
pulsatile signal mean and so those are
the<00:01:25.750> questions<00:01:25.899> that<00:01:26.229> really<00:01:26.409> engage<00:01:26.770> me<00:01:26.979> of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
the questions that really engage me of

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.560 
the questions that really engage me of
that<00:01:27.159> stage<00:01:27.520> because<00:01:27.909> they<00:01:28.060> were<00:01:28.119> kind<00:01:28.479> of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
that stage because they were kind of

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.020 
that stage because they were kind of
questions<00:01:28.990> that<00:01:29.399> resonated<00:01:30.399> with<00:01:30.729> me<00:01:30.759> as<00:01:31.000> a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
questions that resonated with me as a

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.719 
questions that resonated with me as a
mathematician<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:31.869> some<00:01:32.110> ways<00:01:32.319> and<00:01:33.190> so<00:01:33.429> if

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
mathematician in some ways and so if

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.070 
mathematician in some ways and so if
there's<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.119> scene<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.390> kind<00:01:34.569> of<00:01:34.600> appropriate

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
there's a scene the kind of appropriate

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.180 
there's a scene the kind of appropriate
things<00:01:35.409> too<00:01:35.590> far

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.560 

priming<00:01:43.190> lobsters<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.820> salsa<00:01:44.240> are<00:01:44.420> we

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
priming lobsters and salsa are we

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.120 
priming lobsters and salsa are we
pushing<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.990> nature<00:01:45.290> back<00:01:45.440> in<00:01:45.560> two<00:01:45.710> thousand

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
pushing the nature back in two thousand

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.880 
pushing the nature back in two thousand
to<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:47.240> whole<00:01:47.450> motivation<00:01:48.290> for<00:01:48.470> looking<00:01:48.770> for

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
to the whole motivation for looking for

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.110 
to the whole motivation for looking for
that<00:01:48.979> prime<00:01:49.220> for<00:01:49.430> believing<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.000> was

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
that prime for believing that was

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.600 
that prime for believing that was
mechanism<00:01:50.660> like<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.229> had<00:01:51.410> to<00:01:51.590> exist<00:01:51.890> was

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
mechanism like that had to exist was

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.600 
mechanism like that had to exist was
because<00:01:53.320> we<00:01:54.320> actually<00:01:54.440> kind<00:01:54.830> of<00:01:54.890> knew<00:01:55.160> that<00:01:55.190> of

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
because we actually kind of knew that of

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.580 
because we actually kind of knew that of
mechanism<00:01:56.120> like<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.510> was<00:01:56.720> necessary<00:01:57.050> for

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
mechanism like that was necessary for

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.880 
mechanism like that was necessary for
our<00:01:58.400> model<00:01:59.150> to<00:01:59.300> work<00:01:59.330> to<00:02:00.229> produce<00:02:00.410> that<00:02:00.830> kind

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
our model to work to produce that kind

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.070 
our model to work to produce that kind
of<00:02:01.130> bursting<00:02:01.580> so<00:02:02.030> actually<00:02:02.510> it<00:02:02.570> was<00:02:02.660> a<00:02:02.720> model

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
of bursting so actually it was a model

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.810 
of bursting so actually it was a model
that<00:02:03.110> drove<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.830> experiments<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.400> let<00:02:04.700> us

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
that drove the experiments that let us

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.320 
that drove the experiments that let us
look<00:02:05.119> for<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.510> find<00:02:05.540> priming<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.700> oxytocin

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
look for and find priming the oxytocin

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.359

system<00:02:08.720> started<00:02:09.470> out<00:02:09.590> as<00:02:09.709> being<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:10.070> kind<00:02:10.250> of

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
system started out as being this kind of

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.940 
system started out as being this kind of
lovely<00:02:11.120> system<00:02:11.660> with<00:02:11.870> an<00:02:11.959> intriguing<00:02:12.350> problem

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
lovely system with an intriguing problem

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.650 
lovely system with an intriguing problem
and<00:02:13.250> it's<00:02:13.610> now<00:02:13.760> become<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.180> really
