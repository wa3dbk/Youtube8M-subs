we asked buddy the champion surfing dog
of<00:00:25.439> Ventura<00:00:25.980> California<00:00:26.689> step<00:00:27.689> 1<00:00:27.930> start<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
of Ventura California step 1 start to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.429 
of Ventura California step 1 start to
boogie<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:30.029> started<00:00:30.420> buddy<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> boogie

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
boogie so we started buddy on a boogie

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
boogie so we started buddy on a boogie
board<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.859> he<00:00:32.700> was<00:00:32.730> solo<00:00:33.180> surfing<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
board and he was solo surfing from the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.840 
board and he was solo surfing from the
boogie<00:00:34.079> board<00:00:34.350> he<00:00:34.980> attended<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> liked<00:00:35.700> it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
boogie board he attended to liked it

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.220 
boogie board he attended to liked it
because<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.360> smaller<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.140> he

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
because it was smaller and I think he

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.569 
because it was smaller and I think he
could<00:00:37.380> control<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
could control it

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.950 
could control it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
if you put a deck patch on there's still

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.319 
if you put a deck patch on there's still
real<00:00:49.289> hard

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
real hard

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.420

soft<00:00:51.329> rock<00:00:51.660> boards<00:00:52.140> work<00:00:52.920> better<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
soft rock boards work better for the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.430 
soft rock boards work better for the
dogs<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:53.969> grip<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.449> claws<00:00:54.780> into<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.289> and

dogs you can grip this claws into it and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
dogs you can grip this claws into it and
get<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.829> traction

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
get more traction

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
get more traction

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.460 
you can see quite a few clogged ribs
there<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.490> gives<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.790> better<00:01:15.000> traction

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
there so that gives a better traction
