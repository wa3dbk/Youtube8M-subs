the bridge Leslie are Meyer a nominee I
prefer<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.660> use<00:03:18.810> our<00:03:19.170> power<00:03:20.040> course<00:03:20.310> because

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
prefer to use our power course because

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.770 
prefer to use our power course because
the<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.519> virtual<00:03:24.180> version<00:03:24.780> sounds<00:03:25.519> much<00:03:26.519> better

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
the a virtual version sounds much better

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.530 
the a virtual version sounds much better
than<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:29.340> open-source<00:03:29.730> version<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:33.150> think

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
than the open-source version so I think

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.059 
than the open-source version so I think
you<00:03:33.900> can<00:03:34.049> figure<00:03:34.230> out<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.680> strumming<00:03:35.040> pattern

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
you can figure out the strumming pattern

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.150 
you can figure out the strumming pattern
on<00:03:35.579> your<00:03:35.790> own<00:03:35.940> but<00:03:36.810> I'm<00:03:36.930> gonna<00:03:37.169> put<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.799> in<00:03:37.919> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
on your own but I'm gonna put it in the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.159
