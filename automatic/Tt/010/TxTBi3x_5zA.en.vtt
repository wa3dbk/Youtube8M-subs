00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 Well, my first foray into the 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.100
 world of book blogging that is being 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.930
 the book learning because what I have 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.250
 understood is to place an order in amazon 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.469
 that you are very excited and teach 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.469
 everyone your books well yes 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.299
 last month I won a contest for 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.310
 twitter thanks to the business deal 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.990
 organized by hunter messes and drawn 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.840
 by dominoes that when I read my name 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.340
 between 3 to 5 although the prize 80 euros 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.169
 I create 80 euros and nothing else the first thing that 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.509
 I thought upon receiving the gift as well not 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.310
 I can buy a fifth again because 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.379
 16 and you hear but earlier this year my 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.360
 elbow made a small contact with the 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.129
 screen of my old kindle died a 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.080
 little and what happened that the gift voucher was 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.760
 of amazon.com and in Spain you can only 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.760
 buy kindle from amazon.es 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.780
 I know that that they do not let you buy 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.579
 a kindle for distribution rights 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.350
 of countries and this needs to be maintained 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.079
 US stock so we can not sell 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.910
 people who have amazon.es in Spain 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.619
 but I shit on its a total that I put on 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.450
 very angry and sad until my girlfriend 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.940
 he told me but you 're stupid you have 80 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.310
 euros in books exchangeable money 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.759
 for books thank you let's start with the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.369
 winstrol books by stephen king is the 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.409
 book 4.5 of the dark tower I do not know if what 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.210
 you know some but they are slightly fan 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.280
 of the saga of the dark tower from the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.660
 renting is what he considers his opera magna and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.369
 it seems to me like a book until chis 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.780
 fantasy in which painters come out 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 science fiction 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.350
 fucking stephen king I'm a bibliophile of 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.550
 those of I like the story I want 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.780
 read me the story I want to have it for 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.979
 I do not care if I have it in kindle or 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.420
 have it on paper but in books that 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.979
 I have to have on paper as the tower 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.539
 dark the books of terry pratchett or 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.610
 the trilogy of the killer of kings of 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.720
 patrick frankfurt anyway this book does not 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.160
 I had bought it until now because 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.869
 I have the slight fear that it is a 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.509
 little bit weezer drone glass and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.270
 talent in a fill there are 400 pages 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.039
 from when I was young the same is a saga 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 that I want to complete independently 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.189
 of the quality of this take this book 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.170
 meet things I like to me 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.759
 this format if I'm a super 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.470
 of the paperback books the books that 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.270
 they screw my wrist because I thought of 500 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.549
 kilos I'm looking at you and fear 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.220
 of a businessman I do not like them too much 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.569
 and this has a chachi format and has 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.679
 a very small text column 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.050
 because I do not know if you have noticed 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.060
 but it's like the second the way 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.830
 of brandon sanderson are very 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.390
 fan of brandon sanderson for his podcast 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.860
 right in excuse is and when it says the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.690
 appetite for free books and had to 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.190
 drop some of candance anderson like that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.930
 that caught me the way of kings the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.640
 first it is not the first that public 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.780
 but it is the one that made him famous most is 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.220
 a touch and go 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.380
 brandon sanderson I can not write 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.330
 Less than 250,000 words in a book 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.130
 peaks is brandon sanderson and this book 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
 It fulfills another thing that I like very much in 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.250
 a book I do not have an idea of what is going 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.049
 I only know that there are giant crustaceans and a 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.360
 world with a lot of water out of that is 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.500
 total and absolute surprise I want to 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.330
 read then is what for me 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.940
 constitutes the main course of my order 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.040
 of free books two theory books 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.959
 literary characters and view points and 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.360
 how to write science fiction and fantasy 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.739
 the two of orson scott card and that of the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.269
 ender game yes that which is 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.280
 terribly homophobic yes that that seems 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.900
 be asshole but despite all that 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.609
 is a great literary theorist and his 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.359
 books are taught in universities of 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.650
 USA 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.909
 so I really want to read it 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.739
 because I want to learn to write 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.810
 science fiction and fantasy better and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.579
 I want to perfect my characters and 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.079
 points of view because generally my 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.370
 descriptions about the characters are 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.750
 He was a man and he had a penis with only 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.189
 have a couple of ideas on how to be 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.200
 best writer for me now has been a 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.299
 very difficult purchase of typographical letters 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.680
 in style by robert brain you this 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.970
 book comes highly recommended by karen 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.560
 every time he recommends it as one of 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.299
 those books that you have to have about 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.040
 typography this is a facet of mine that 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.659
 many of you will not know in addition 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.920
 philologist I'm a little designer 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.659
 graphic because he did a course of 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.040
 layout and editorial production is 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.420
 basically done a middle grade in how 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.099
 bring a publisher so a book 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.230
 about typography is very very very 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.489
 important and since I finished my course 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.810
 I've been saying for two years that I want 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.670
 buy me books about graphic design 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.200
 I want to find books about design 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.090
 graphic and this is the first of a 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.349
 I hope it is a great collection and as not 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.700
 everything will be books I bought two 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.530
 comics the first 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.389
 delilah see that they have to have 500 man 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.129
 thanks 3-d letters for doing that not 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.810
 you see nothing this was originally a 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.609
 tony clark webcomic and online more or 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.170
 least I read 80% the book what happens 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.639
 that the format that I have does not like me in 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.669
 the page you have to do a lot of 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.450
 scroll and is complicated as load 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.920
 page 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.620
 pajÃ­n you are a person who reads very 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.700
 fast as well as soon as I've had 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.970
 the opportunity has bought it from me 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.980
 paper is very chic the color is very 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.380
 I really like the design of the 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.840
 characters and above all do one thing 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.550
 that I like in my fantasy books 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.930
 is relaxed to see is waiting 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.840
 races because people are chasing them and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.729
 swords and yebra and turns but they have the 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.410
 time to drink one and taste a cup 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.970
 of tea and look at the landscape that is the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.190
 difference for me between fantasy 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.930
 epic and an adventure book a book 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.610
 of adventures can be relaxes and the other 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.470
 comic that bought me is jazz bone 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.000
 month is a book that I consider that 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.650
 everyone must have read because 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.940
 it's a great story and it's the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.530
 Lord of the Rings' I've done with 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.120
 cute characters the theme is very 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.740
 serious for the characters are very cute 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.900
 and tola sneak there is a story 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.310
 super serious with super cute characters and 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.780
 as before being a writer to be 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.990
 blogger and of is the philologist I am a 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.280
 beautiful and selfless person it

 given a comic sack without fat 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.750
 and inside I was happy with 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.040

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.080

 my girlfriend I say money in europe this 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.879
 book will serve me a lot for 

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.409
 literary production because there is a 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.459
 mogollÃ³n of phrases made of mogollÃ³n 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.219
 of things that do not appear in the 

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:30.569
 dictionary open it and say pussy pussy to 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.459
 me since seen a movie that never 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.809
 I knew it was way fancy a pink fit 

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:34.979
 heap and these are all the books that 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:37.019
 they catch me during this wonderful 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.249
 wonderful month of December seriously 

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:39.719
 rain of books 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:41.429
 I'm happy for having so many books 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.959
 and this marks one of my courses 

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:44.669
 gender purposes I will devote 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.319
 every day for an hour to read 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.789
 all these books because it's one of those 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.409
 things literature serves me as 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.179
 evasion but I never find time to 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.619
 studying in addition will cost me a lot 

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:56.179
 get used again to read books 

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.179

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.319
 which does not dazzle me is wonderful and the 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.690

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:20.150
 my life apart from my girlfriend and my 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.919
