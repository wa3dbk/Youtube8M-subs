00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
can do next one just a bit of fun really

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.650 
can do next one just a bit of fun really
is<00:02:23.319> powder<00:02:23.769> now<00:02:24.519> powder<00:02:24.819> is<00:02:25.060> supposed<00:02:25.389> to<00:02:25.510> be<00:02:25.630> a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
is powder now powder is supposed to be a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.210 
is powder now powder is supposed to be a
physics<00:02:26.049> game<00:02:26.290> but<00:02:26.470> there<00:02:26.590> are<00:02:26.709> ways<00:02:26.889> to<00:02:26.920> make

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
physics game but there are ways to make

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.150 
physics game but there are ways to make
it<00:02:27.250> really<00:02:27.700> read<00:02:27.849> fun<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:29.019> this<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.829> just<00:02:29.919> go

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
good but yeah basically make a little

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.970 
good but yeah basically make a little
container<00:02:36.669> like<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.540> put<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.680> lava

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
container like that I put that a lava

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.199 
container like that I put that a lava
run<00:02:39.280> or<00:02:39.400> something<00:02:39.970> add<00:02:40.630> some<00:02:40.930> nitroglycerine

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
run or something add some nitroglycerine

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.059 
run or something add some nitroglycerine
boom<00:02:43.209> yeah<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.019> can<00:02:44.260> do<00:02:44.349> all<00:02:44.500> sorts<00:02:44.530> oh<00:02:44.950> then

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
boom yeah you can do all sorts oh then

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.520 
boom yeah you can do all sorts oh then
you<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.310> clone<00:02:45.639> the<00:02:45.849> fire<00:02:46.090> like<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.720> really

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
you can clone the fire like that really

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.110 
you can clone the fire like that really
really<00:02:47.650> good<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.310> would<00:02:48.730> definitely<00:02:49.030> recommend

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
really good I would definitely recommend

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.270 
really good I would definitely recommend
that

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
that

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.200 
that
my<00:02:52.110> my<00:02:53.110> next<00:02:53.470> one<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.890> Windows<00:02:54.310> Movie<00:02:54.490> Maker

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
my my next one is Windows Movie Maker

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.020 
my my next one is Windows Movie Maker
now<00:02:55.540> although<00:02:55.750> most<00:02:56.710> Windows<00:02:57.250> computers<00:02:57.790> have

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
now although most Windows computers have

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.330 
now although most Windows computers have
this<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.900> actually<00:02:59.320> compatible<00:02:59.620> with<00:03:00.010> Mac

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
this it is actually compatible with Mac

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.460 
this it is actually compatible with Mac
if<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:01.420> get<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.630> right<00:03:01.750> website<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.380> I'll

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
if you get the right website and I'll

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.830 
if you get the right website and I'll
post<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.920> website<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.760> comment<00:03:04.210> box

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840

so<00:03:05.500> yeah<00:03:05.710> that's<00:03:05.950> almost<00:03:06.250> essential<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> have

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
so yeah that's almost essential to have

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.370 
so yeah that's almost essential to have
because<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.240> Mac<00:03:07.480> one<00:03:07.750> which<00:03:07.990> i<00:03:08.110> think<00:03:08.170> is

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
because the Mac one which i think is

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.230 
because the Mac one which i think is
iDVD<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.130> also<00:03:09.760> anyway<00:03:09.970> light<00:03:10.120> it's

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
iDVD is also anyway light it's

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.290 
iDVD is also anyway light it's
completely<00:03:10.630> rubbish<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:12.430> my<00:03:12.670> next<00:03:12.880> one<00:03:13.060> which

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
completely rubbish but my next one which

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.390 
completely rubbish but my next one which
most<00:03:13.570> computers<00:03:14.170> have<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.709> some<00:03:15.010> form<00:03:15.310> of

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
most computers have in some form of

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.810 
most computers have in some form of
WordPad<00:03:16.060> now<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.750> like<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.470> because<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.700> is

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
WordPad now I like this because it is

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.820 
WordPad now I like this because it is
kind<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.330> notepad<00:03:19.870> but<00:03:20.410> not<00:03:20.740> as

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
kind of like notepad but not as

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.940 
kind of like notepad but not as
complicated<00:03:21.160> as<00:03:21.490> word<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.630> put<00:03:23.020> in<00:03:23.650> most

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
complicated as word so you put in most

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.430 
complicated as word so you put in most
of<00:03:24.100> my<00:03:24.130> tutorials<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.790> use<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:25.450> if<00:03:26.230> you've

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
of my tutorials I use this so if you've

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.990 
of my tutorials I use this so if you've
got<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.709> hunt<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.040> down<00:03:27.070> on<00:03:27.340> your<00:03:27.370> computer

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
got it hunt it down on your computer

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.540 
got it hunt it down on your computer
whatever<00:03:28.600> it's<00:03:28.930> really<00:03:29.350> really<00:03:29.590> good<00:03:29.770> and

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
whatever it's really really good and

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.310 
whatever it's really really good and
finally<00:03:31.000> snipping<00:03:31.480> tool<00:03:31.690> not<00:03:31.870> all<00:03:31.989> computers

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
finally snipping tool not all computers

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.600 
finally snipping tool not all computers
have<00:03:32.500> this<00:03:32.800> but<00:03:32.950> I'm<00:03:33.040> sure<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.310> can<00:03:33.430> download

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
have this but I'm sure you can download

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.810 
have this but I'm sure you can download
it<00:03:34.000> snipping<00:03:34.780> tool<00:03:34.989> lets<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.739> flip<00:03:36.280> things<00:03:36.550> so

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
it snipping tool lets you flip things so

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.600 
it snipping tool lets you flip things so
if<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.150> want<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.390> snip<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.810> there<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:39.100> saves<00:03:39.430> it

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
if I want to snip that there it saves it

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.180
