00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.609
 the nasa cassini space probe 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.359
 celebrated its tenth anniversary of its launch 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.539
 in a vision towards the Saturn planet 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.630
 with a developer on the ground being a career one of the most enigmatic figures of 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.720
 Solar system 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.169
 and affection 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.169
 a face as black as coal and another as white as snow 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.749
 It is strange decoration of the two sides of the japeto 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.370
 the different flyby by the Cassini probe on September 10 of 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.050
 2007 is possibly the key that explains 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.380
 because this saturn moon has a black hemisphere like coal and another 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.410
 White as snow 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.150
 it could be a thermal insemination process say of the 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.680
 critics 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.150
 the images recently provided by the cassini probe 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.700
 they showed how much the surface of tepito 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.230
 It is fascinating and villa as we can appreciate here 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.690
 However, NASA researchers were not satisfied with studying this 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.680
 small celestial port with respect to cinema 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.460
 they made observations in the infrared 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.610
 one of the probably most intriguing questions about her petro 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.710
 is the one that refers to the mechanism that has generated the mountain chain that runs 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.420
 along the equator and that earned him the name of the moon shell of 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.410
 nut 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.830
 the images show that this training is old because it is 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.390
 quite characterizes 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.820
 the structure seems solid although it is interrupted in some places 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.060
 what is enough to destroy the idea 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.250
 that that resource 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.250
 because I have to have collapsed on the moon
