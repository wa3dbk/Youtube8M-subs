00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.740
 Youtube welcome to this 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.179
 I will tutorial in this tutorial 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.099
 show you how the honors only 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.529
 can do that faster 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.720
 on the bottom left then strong on 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.329
 Control Panel now they go up 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.200
 system and security then on system 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:30.090
 and then advanced system settings 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.670
 Now click on these effects 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.470
 attitudes with them would have to now 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.820
 optimal settings automatically 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.890
 select stand 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.000
 I already have for the optimal 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.520
 adapted performance 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.370
 if you have that then click on it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.000
 take over now click again 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.120
 begin 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.610
 still needs control panel 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.300
 facilitated operation and then again 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.860
 center for easier operation 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.570
 what do you want down and go 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.160
 make tasks easier and easier 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.290
 skater down again and then 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.300
 Expired from the window facilitate there 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.690
 tick because we see them when 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.009
 we pull the box up then 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.740
 enlarged and that's what we want most of all 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.490
 to click back and then achieved 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.490
 take on 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.049
 so it starts against the even more starts in the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.330
 browse programs files against it 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:34.119
 the ms config and under at which they 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.460
 On start extended options with her 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.960
 have to queue now if they are in the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.310
 two have then click the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.380
 two years if that is not the case 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.640
 should then let the 1 represent 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.149
 to be ok at system startup 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.399
 things board with started if so 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.840
 which are like they do not need then 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.369
 remove the tick and become 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.670
 then take on and in this case 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.649
 I will not just start this now 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.679
 and if you have a laptop then go 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.569
 at the bottom of the battery gauge you enter 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:14.319
 right-click on it and then go on 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:15.370
 An energy option here if the me 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.989
 I have already now once 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.160
 made if you have more energy 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.200
 play show 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.670
 then come here as it says here 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.049
 only has the highest performance 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.400
 highly power were ever to 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.150
 that's why it's here with me now 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.340
 already there they are pressing 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.560
 power then just push away what 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.959
 Also very important is programs too 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.900
 uninstall 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.640
 Go to start below 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.209
 Control Panel uninstall programs 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.030
 and then they are all programs 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.310
 listed these installed when 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.810
 they do not find them here 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.609
 need more then click on one 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.629
 program on it and then they open 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.970
 the install 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.750
 In this case, I do not have any of the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.750
 to install 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.420
 so now right click on the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.139
 desktop and go to artwork 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.139
 properties 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.900
 expect an instant 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.140
 so i like you see i dont have any 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:25.170
 nvidia or ati i have an intel 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.170
 graphics media accelerator 4500mhd 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.470
 built-in chip set so then you go 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.520
 on 3-d and people who soon me with him 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.970
 be in the middle 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.950
 then you go on services like that 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.820
 apply exactly 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.069
 ok then you go to energy and then 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.600
 network operation so he just so between 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.090
 Battery life and maximum 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.090
 services between the two 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.860
 balanced is easier anyway 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.019
 If all cables always remember I 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.489
 maximum power click on 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.769
 make mains operation at the 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.660
 Battery operation for maximum performance 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:06.900
 click apply as far as I know 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.310
 there are still at a nvidia geforce 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.530
 if they have done that now 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.750
 you and and city ​​and give the rule 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.510
 and then board and then yes 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.090
 click so with him you have to now only 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.520
 45 stand five things then they open 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.729
 youtube then on control panel 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.039
 and then they go on mouse and then on 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.319
 moscow parties in berlin would have to now 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.280
 here the 400 stand out of the 400 make 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.280
 the zero 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.650
 so and now here's the last tip 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.750
 or rather brought 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.730
 I wanted to show you that because now 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:48.850
 a program called ccleaner and the 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:53.860
 ccleaner does not delete things 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.320
 needed and once the register 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.630
 like that means the pc is just like 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.380
 human brain he is writing 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.050
 error 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.720
 but before you goes out maybe 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.340
 yes on settings is allowed 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.330
 attitudes and then goes too 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.040
 sure delete slowly or very much 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.390
 nice but very complex 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.850
 overwrite 30 times 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.940
 I now do in this case by 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.470
 simply override and is normal 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.850
 So I'll just leave it again 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.850
 just to show you 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.890
 friendly states at extras you can 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.840
 also uninstall the programs 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:37.200
 the already installed on the computer 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.200
 I should start then once 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.730
 i have printed china because i print 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.419
 now I had no desire to analyze and 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.419
 then start 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.229
 tomatoes just added an instant 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.300
 I'm probably getting faster now 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:06:00.490
 with him a kb away I had just 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:01.830
 450 mb away and the register once 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.139
 Search from errors 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.030
 Framework is a driving error for me 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.760
 written errors were also fixed 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.550
 they want changes in you go 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.210
 sure no 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:18.729
 fix all selected errors yes 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.270
 close and then you can just do that 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:24.910
 Close completely and that was it then okay 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.770
 everything that one of me and I hope 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.889
 you liked it until the next one 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.889
 times
