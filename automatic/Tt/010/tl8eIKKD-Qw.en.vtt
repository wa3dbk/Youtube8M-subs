00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.699
 the long-haul grinding machine became lz gm 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.279
 to grind and polish 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.279
 and sheet metal and welded constructions 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.279
 developed 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.760
 the Shiite with a deep of one 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.610
 meter can default with a length 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.610
 of up to 3.8 meters 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.960
 Ãœberlingen and others but 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.710
 Of course, dimensions are also 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.710
 possible 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.460
 3 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.710
 through the optional speed control 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.480
 can the tape speed 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.040
 according to the application and to 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.140
 be adapted to processing materials 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.520
 this raises and lowers the grinding table 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.520
 done at two speeds 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.080
 in one embodiment, as a two- belt system 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.760
 the loop becomes schematic between 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.800
 band 1 and bank two back and forth 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.750
 the shift of the protective cover for 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.619
 manual grinding follows 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.619
 opposite 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.450
 via a quick change system 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.900
 various sanding school used 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.900
 become 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.350
 to choose between flat and roll 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.290
 shoes as well as different hard 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.050
 rubber compounds the harder the loop 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.190
 the more material becomes when sanding 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.190
 process removed 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.040
 through a second table level can the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.490
 maximum component height increased to 1200 mm 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.490
 become 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.980
 the band change takes place via a 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.900
 pneumatic clamping system and can by 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.380
 performed by a single employee 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.380
 become 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.660
 The track tension can be for every country 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.660
 can be set individually 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.480
 through the park at the back 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.600
 the machine can be either a second 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.700
 table or, as in this case, a rotating 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.030
 and swivel direction einlechselt 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.030
 become 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.199
 with the help of this turn and swing 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.330
 Bill can all sides of one 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:52.279
 welded construction with one 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.279
 be edited 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.419
 the operation of the table can do this 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.229
 via a second central service in 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.229
 direction 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.100
 so
