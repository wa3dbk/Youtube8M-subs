00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.850
 another that has been thrown out that does not lend is not because it has a 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.769
 uncomfortable that I do not use for anything else in Brazil besides the commendation 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.969
 played still with quality 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.620
 the garbage itself is wasted is what you will see now in the second 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.060
 series report 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.400
 the man who trash 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.570
 top 12 million people on the verge of hunger 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.650
 39 million pounds of food thrown out every year this is the 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.560
 brazil of waste 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.910
 the committee that goes to waste a good part could go to the birth of those who do not 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.110
 can pay for food 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.980
 sad game of appearances fruits and vegetables considered ugly for 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.720
 consumption 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.040
 should be reused 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.650
 and even when the food is spoiled 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.519
 his place is not trash 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:50.650
 but the earth 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.320
 where can you come back from a stunt double? 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.750
 the good news is that there are a lot of people worried about this 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.420
 maroca 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 a lightly cooked 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.750
 finely chopped onion 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.750
 good cool people 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.520
 the senator also chosen 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.120
 will be the basis of the lunch of more than 60 young people who 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.470
 work in this institution in the west zone of são paulo 4 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.099
 braga seventy companies send here paper already used 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.830
 and the young need a club 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.650
 make notebooks learn to work 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.420
 we used recyclable 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.100
 preparing teens comments work 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 and show them that everything that can be reused 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.870
 until the test 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.170
 how they stay the whole day here 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.170
 the institution offers lunch 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.150
 would not have the same flavors if it were not another recycling of food 100% 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.299
 of the fleet 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.759
 that we use here within the perimeter 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.159
 and 30% of vegetables 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.879
 and is a food for the paulista this afternoon 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.879
 which we have no prejudice and reserve 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.149
 does not have country even reason 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.599
 the food that goes to the treatment of these young people lost commercial value 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 but has great nutritional value 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.109
 are products like those stacked in the back of a supermarket 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.510
 could become another example of waste in Brazil 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.689
 but daniel's gang does not let that happen 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.729
 he talked to the worst 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.989
 sabah to take advantage of the fact that 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.129
 In contrast 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.750
 you make a fashion is nothing - bernardo a good 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.639
 everything to do with a magnitude of 9 4% 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.699
 is part of parliamentary life 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.879
 only here they knew how to take advantage of 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.899
 two hundred kilos our home mesh 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.339
 Why will not it give way? 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:11.989
 Vanessa said she's going to promise 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.259
 the rest of the bank 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.259
 this collection 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.260
 daniel works for the food bank 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.689
 another maid just for that 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.829
 pick up work in markets bakeries sacolões 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.649
 we collect around 40 tons monthly 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.569
 which feeds the 51 institutions is housing the end of 2006 63 people 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.119
 in large supermarket chains waste looks small 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:44.769
 but it only appears 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.110
 Everyday employees take off-the-shelf products with 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.969
 validity close to winning 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.170
 injured fruits and vegetables 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.479
 what are not looking good on the outside 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.019
 all day with the trash but in that supermarket 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.579
 the staff pays for themselves 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.910
 the food bank class guarantees 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.400
 if the food arrives large hostels institutions like that 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.260
 the miners want to leave the paper we make the bridge and not enough to where 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.379
 hawk, right 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.019
 who enters and who says that the agency has no experience whatsoever 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.019
 treatment of these foods 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:28.720
 in the gigantic supply center of são paulo every day sat on it 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:33.459
 of the finished products on the ground that someone planted someone can collapse 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.999
 they demanded land in fertilizer but will not feed anyone 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.169
 on the long path between pink and the table of Brazilians 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.770
 39 million pounds of food get lost every day 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.780
 looking at these remnants that arrive at ceagesp são paulo we think 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.999
 waste 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:05:00.199
 only that this composting center in Campinas is precisely an attempt to 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.509
 reduce losses here instead of eating trash it will come to the globe and can 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.339
 turn money into the pocket of entrepreneurs who start investing in the human being 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.069
 every day at least five trucks arrive 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.180
 1 debt that came from fruits and vegetables 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.180
 is collected in gutters 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.210
 little beet watermelon 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.629
 everything will be well taken advantage of 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.229
 but rather has to separate what is not organic material 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.650
 plastic packaging 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.229
 gradually the way 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.430
 the remains of food 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.659
 on large sailboats 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.990
 and then it starts with posting 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.620
 the matter is to understand composition 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.960
 who do the work are microorganisms bacteria that act on the fruits 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.089
 vegetables and veggies 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.010
 the man only helped a little 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.599
 with machines like this 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:00.889
 a feather 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.039
 will see a crunch of a branch of these fruits that arrived at losses that 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.900
 difficult to decompose when we have the 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.729
 microorganisms will attack but this fruit more accessed from the air has arrived 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.900
 for ten years this year had the idea of ​​renting this land 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.089
 to earn confident money on your team 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.119
 but it's not that complicated 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:29.899
 It is necessary to protect the soil, so the 'fruit juice does not reach rivers and 

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:31.699
 springs 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.110
 here also control the temperature that the ideas of the material 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.470
 so everything to ensure the quality of the air the bucks else get out of here 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:45.860
 the show are analyzed almost every day a small laboratory 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:48.869
 if the material is very right 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:51.710
 the required collected words together 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.270
 come back to keep the drive all the fans that were present 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:57.040
 not alone 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.230
 then turned a plant that plant to a fruit was not harnessed back 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.960
 for composting we will have in the final product the organic compound 100% 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.200
 of these properties the materials continue working during two months 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.009
 part of the material stays the same 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:18.199
 this seems like a lot of land simply 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:23.129
 but it is the result of 60 days of work earth has not here 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:24.559
 there are substances 

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:26.360
 how strong with potassium 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.770
 nitrogen that were present 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.490
 in fruits and vegetables 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.089
 they wanted to stop in the trash 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:35.990
 after composting all this turns the face of the goal and danny co 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.699
 and you're coming back to the ground 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.520
 helping to enrich 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.210
 Brazilian agriculture 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.690
 today we saw two good examples of how to transform into solution 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.860
 what is normally seen as a problem 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.180
 are simple ideas 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.610
 do not like it so much 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.879
 imagine what would happen if the whole country 

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:58.259
 take care of the trash like this
