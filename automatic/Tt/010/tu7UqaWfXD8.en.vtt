00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello today I'll show you one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.410
 color combination with talk and a 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.880
 pluck tone and as always you have to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.630
 Of course not the same colors 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.340
 use 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.530
 That's why I blind you 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.830
 always swatch it for a youtube look for 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.840
 I can start and I'll go first 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.939
 my foundation with the 'bafin' brasch 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.650
 from seven times on because I feel that 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.869
 I do not have that shade 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.460
 One hundred percent fits and therefore 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.910
 I'll knock it in my after that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.910
 a skin 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.500
 after that I want two concealer because 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.620
 I mix the two shades 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.090
 bin and cover with the 224 brush of mac 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 my dark circles and mine 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 Unfortunately, I have my skin blemishes 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.530
 not so much trouble with the latter 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.780
 how else and now it goes with the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.149
 eyes further I carry mine first 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.280
 eyeshadow base with the 217 er of 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.920
 sigma on the complete mobile lid 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.670
 up to the eyebrow and below 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.590
 on the eyelash wreath on now I hope with 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.420
 the account airbrush of real technics 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.280
 my favorite highlighter among the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.650
 eyebrow and also above the wan 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 Bone on I use therefore one 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.350
 fluffy brush and not my fingers 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.680
 order the centered after that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.330
 I poke with the brush from mac 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.330
 top on the movable lid 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.340
 I also sent the paint with it 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.420
 the top gets really intense too 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.520
 to the eyelid and on the eyebrows 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.009
 Bone comes a medium brown resp 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.000
 a tone of a nuance darker than 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.270
 my skin is 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.479
 I even use it for the 217 brush 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.549
 mac and I are wearing eyebrows on the outside 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.890
 Bone more color and look that 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.990
 the color is well blinded is a video 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.770
 about how you find yourself blinded 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.619
 the infobox 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.140
 now comes with a brush of 219 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.729
 seven plum tone on the outer third 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.920
 the eyelashes and also in the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.130
 So it really is 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.009
 lying v and I hope the color first 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.720
 so that she looks more intense 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.569
 I'll take care of the hard edges 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.430
 later I kind of dazzle the color 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.290
 also direction means of the song and then 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.730
 the color still comes in the outer two 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.290
 third of the lower lash line it 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.330
 means now I associate the outer ones 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.180
 edges of the purple tone with the smoker 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.650
 brush of essens that is now too 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.090
 easier because on the eyebrows 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.090
 bone is already an eyeshadow 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.720
 I needed eternity for that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.600
 and so that the edge was still soft 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.049
 after that I have the brush of mac 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.049
 took 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.870
 And here too I always blind from the outside 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.659
 inside because then I like that 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.400
 Gradient color make it better to paint 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.980
 I look at the upper waterline with one 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:10.950
 brush without names on and also gives 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:18.239
 it's an extra video fondant she me 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:20.010
 I wear a thin line now 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.049
 a dim pink 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.450
 highlighter in the eye in the angle 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:34.950
 I think that's pink and top very much 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:36.720
 harmonize beautifully with each other and afterwards 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.680
 I carry a broom kajal in the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.680
 waterline on 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.790
 and so the lidstick is not that hard 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:55.220
 I am allowed to work with a brush of 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.080
 mac the plum tone about it now 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.849
 bude I hear the leaf spoke of 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.849
 realtech nothing my face off 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.110
 and then I paint my eyebrows 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.390
 first with an eyeshadow and 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.130
 afterwards with a pencil and why me 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.550
 a pencil user you see in the 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.550
 infobox 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.669
 so that no eyebrows so on 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.260
 I would like to see them painted and 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.100
 then fix the little ones with one 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.100
 go eyebrows 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.919
 and now I noticed that me 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:40.990
 not even lashed my eyelashes 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:42.490
 I have and I do that now and 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.380
 My eyes are done 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.600
 somehow it does not look that way in that 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.800
 extremely difficult but that was it in 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.800
 really not really 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.530
 after that I was able to brush with the 138 brush 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.169
 mac my face and also something stronger 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.150
 as otherwise as the contouring goes exactly 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.150
 Do you see links in the infobox 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.520
 Now I'm wearing the rouge brush of 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.800
 for your beauty rouge on first on 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:24.430
 cheekbones and then I blind it 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.710
 direction apple cheeks off and so on 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.390
 the cheek red finds itself wearing 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.520
 I get a touch of the soot on the 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.780
 eyebrow bone looks on somehow 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.440
 a face through total 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.330
 Harmonic from brave can now too 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.820
 This eye make-up also has red lips 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.650
 wear but I'm not brave and rather 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.300
 Combine the make up with a delicate one 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.300
 rosewood pink do 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:58.729
 and the complete make-up is done 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.830
