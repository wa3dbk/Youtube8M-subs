 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.980
 let's make some tea pasta if not 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.679

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.679
 subscribe to the channel we started 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.130
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.939
 are 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.140
 half a cup of butter softened three 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.739
 quarts of wheat flour 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.100
 a spoonful of sugar glas one 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.920
 tablespoon cornmeal and 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.680
 teaspoon vanilla essence what 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.720
 first thing we're going to do is mix the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.720
 butter with icing sugar 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.989
 and let's mix it well 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:07.270
 and then we are going to sift 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.270
 cornstarch and flour 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.259
 and we will mix 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.880
 and finally we will take the essence of 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.880
 vanilla 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.700
 we already have as you can see the prepared dough 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.910
 so we're going to throw him in a sleeve 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.840
 pastry to put it on the plate as 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.580
 You see I have put a fluted mouthpiece 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.010
 but you can put it as the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.710
 that you have and if you can not simply 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.050
 Take some with a teaspoon 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.190
 piles and crush them with the spoon 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.750
 if you do not have hands 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:03.700
 and these pastas go very well if you have 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:07.530
 visit to have a coffee in the afternoon 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:13.310
 or for simply for a dessert 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.310
 They are so delicious throwing 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.750
 once we have preheated the oven 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.330
 we will put the pasta at 190 degrees 110 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.170
 We already have our delicious pasta 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.360
