00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
there was going to be different

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.259 
there was going to be different
for<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.909> part<00:03:46.180> for<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.629> guy<00:03:46.780> who<00:03:46.840> jumped<00:03:47.409> but

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
for the part for the guy who jumped but

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.910 
for the part for the guy who jumped but
you<00:03:49.269> know<00:03:49.359> eventually<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.290> worked<00:03:50.439> out<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.859> I

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
you know eventually it worked out and I

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.199 
you know eventually it worked out and I
think<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.189> they<00:03:51.370> made<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.700> right<00:03:51.909> call<00:03:52.150> and

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
think that they made the right call and

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.149 
think that they made the right call and
I<00:03:52.599> think<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:52.930> manufacturers<00:03:53.709> are<00:03:53.799> starting

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
I think the manufacturers are starting

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.270 
I think the manufacturers are starting
to<00:03:54.250> get<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.730> lot<00:03:55.239> more<00:03:55.480> interest<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.109> stuff<00:03:56.409> so

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
to get a lot more interest and stuff so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.660 
to get a lot more interest and stuff so
and<00:03:57.879> that's<00:03:58.030> another<00:03:58.469> series<00:03:59.469> that<00:03:59.680> you<00:04:00.489> never

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
and that's another series that you never

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.220 
and that's another series that you never
know<00:04:00.879> who<00:04:01.060> can<00:04:01.239> win<00:04:01.420> I<00:04:01.450> mean<00:04:01.599> they've<00:04:01.750> had<00:04:01.780> a

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
know who can win I mean they've had a

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.809 
know who can win I mean they've had a
couple<00:04:02.620> different<00:04:02.980> winners<00:04:03.220> already<00:04:03.430> this

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
couple different winners already this

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.420 
couple different winners already this
year<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.060> think<00:04:04.180> forward<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.739> you<00:04:06.340> know

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
year I think forward so you know

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.839 
year I think forward so you know
competition<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.659> really<00:04:07.750> tough<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.439> I<00:04:09.040> you

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
competition is really tough and I you

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.460 
competition is really tough and I you
know<00:04:09.970> last<00:04:10.209> weekend<00:04:10.540> was<00:04:10.659> my<00:04:10.750> favorite<00:04:11.170> track

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
know last weekend was my favorite track

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.259 
know last weekend was my favorite track
probably<00:04:12.010> which<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.579> kind<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.790> weird<00:04:12.970> rotor

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
probably which is kind of weird rotor

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.539 
probably which is kind of weird rotor
