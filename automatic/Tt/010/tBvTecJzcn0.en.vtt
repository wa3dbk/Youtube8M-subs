a new Congress to go completely around
it<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.710> things<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.460> lot<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.629> legal

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it and to do things that a lot of legal

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.689 
it and to do things that a lot of legal
debate<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.620> both<00:01:01.649> sides<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.309> whether<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.579> not

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
debate on both sides of whether or not

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.990 
debate on both sides of whether or not
he<00:01:02.850> has<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> power<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.700> but<00:01:05.700> what

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
he has the power to do that but what

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.630 
he has the power to do that but what
what<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.990> our<00:01:07.110> country<00:01:07.290> needs<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.520> be

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
what what our country needs now is to be

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
what what our country needs now is to be
pulled<00:01:08.909> together<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.510> divided<00:01:09.960> further<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
pulled together not divided further and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
pulled together not divided further and
I<00:01:11.070> think<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.450> terrible

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
I think it's I think it's a terrible

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.149 
I think it's I think it's a terrible
political<00:01:13.590> mistake<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.700> divide<00:01:15.090> us<00:01:15.299> now

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
political mistake to divide us now

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.219 
political mistake to divide us now
further<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.580> agree<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.540> need<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.840> solve<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
further I agree we need to solve the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.469 
further I agree we need to solve the
immigration<00:01:19.320> problem<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> think<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> way

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
immigration problem but I think the way

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.749 
immigration problem but I think the way
you<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.049> force<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.560> consensus<00:01:23.220> not

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you do that is force a consensus not

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.270 
you do that is force a consensus not
just<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.299> way<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> highway<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just my way or the highway and so the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.890 
just my way or the highway and so the
president<00:01:26.610> has<00:01:26.820> said<00:01:27.060> I've<00:01:27.270> given<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> enough

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
president has said I've given you enough

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.480 
president has said I've given you enough
time<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.530> waiting<00:01:28.860> anymore<00:01:29.070> i'm<00:01:29.310> going

time I'm not waiting anymore i'm going

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.010 
time I'm not waiting anymore i'm going
to<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.880> he's<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.540> challenged

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to do this he's going to get challenged

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
to do this he's going to get challenged
in<00:01:31.140> court<00:01:31.170> he's<00:01:31.829> probably<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> lose<00:01:32.579> in

in court he's probably going to lose in

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.160 
in court he's probably going to lose in
court<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> couple<00:01:34.079> of

the Constitution says and make law
anyway<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.810> instead<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.500> rule<00:02:10.709> of

law handling

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.910 
law handling
in<00:02:12.480> our<00:02:12.690> country<00:02:12.870> today<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:13.560> we're<00:02:13.740> starting

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
in our country today now we're starting

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
in our country today now we're starting
to<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.310> rule<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.520> rulers<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.210> that's<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to have the rule of rulers and that's a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.930 
to have the rule of rulers and that's a
total<00:02:16.380> antithesis<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:17.100> what<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.610> country

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
total antithesis to what this country

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.000 
total antithesis to what this country
was<00:02:17.970> founded<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.560> think<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:19.890> a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
was founded on and so I think it's a

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.540 
was founded on and so I think it's a
very<00:02:20.370> dangerous<00:02:20.820> move<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:22.170> us<00:02:22.250> both<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.400> terms

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
very dangerous move for us both in terms

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.300 
very dangerous move for us both in terms
of<00:02:23.730> civil<00:02:24.030> disobedience<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:25.350> think<00:02:26.130> it's<00:02:26.250> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
of civil disobedience I think it's a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.740 
of civil disobedience I think it's a
very<00:02:26.460> dangerous<00:02:26.760> move<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.420> terms<00:02:27.660> of

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
very dangerous move in terms of

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.510 
very dangerous move in terms of
confidence<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.500> future<00:02:28.860> our<00:02:29.160> country

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
confidence for the future our country

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.040 
confidence for the future our country
and<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.790> able<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.060> accomplish<00:02:30.390> other<00:02:30.720> things

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
and be able to accomplish other things

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.780 
and be able to accomplish other things
that<00:02:31.140> will<00:02:31.650> need<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.070> accomplished<00:02:32.640> over

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
that will need to be accomplished over

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.960 
that will need to be accomplished over
the<00:02:32.910> next<00:02:33.180> two<00:02:33.300> years<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.830> my<00:02:34.980> advice<00:02:35.100> they
