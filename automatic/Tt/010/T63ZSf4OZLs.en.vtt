with<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.779> think<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> trumpet<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.769> run

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
with the I think the trumpet is run

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.470 
with the I think the trumpet is run
paths<00:00:29.279> are<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> put<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> keyboard

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
paths are here and I put the keyboard

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
paths are here and I put the keyboard
over<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.779> cuz<00:00:30.900> honestly<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.650> don't<00:00:31.949> really<00:00:32.160> use

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
over it cuz honestly I don't really use

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
over it cuz honestly I don't really use

to the Minko as you can see us to uh add
this<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.469> box<00:00:52.710> 3<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.820> box<00:00:54.059> 3<00:00:55.789> that's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
this in box 3 I use it in box 3 that's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.670 
this in box 3 I use it in box 3 that's
basically<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.539> over<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> Mac<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
basically it over there is a Mac and

basically it over there is a Mac and
that's<00:00:59.579> my<00:00:59.760> little<00:00:59.910> Mac<00:01:00.239> station<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.140> not

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that's my little Mac station but I'm not

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.990 
that's my little Mac station but I'm not
really<00:01:01.559> using<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> record<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:02.820> now

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
really using that to record right now

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.149 
really using that to record right now
but<00:01:03.710> as<00:01:04.710> far<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.750> like<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.799> got

but as far as the me go I like it I got
a<00:01:08.189> couple<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.610> programs<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.659> use

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
a couple of programs on here I use

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.109 
a couple of programs on here I use
reason<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:10.860> right<00:01:11.010> now<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.939> I'm

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
reason but right now you can see I'm

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.580 
reason but right now you can see I'm
using<00:01:12.150> Reaper<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.460> have<00:01:14.460> actually<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> set<00:01:15.299> up

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
using Reaper I have actually a set up

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.770 
using Reaper I have actually a set up
let<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.619> show<00:01:16.710> you

let me show you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.170 
let me show you
Roger<00:01:18.890> MPC<00:01:19.890> rewire<00:01:20.509> basically<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.810> use<00:01:23.180> Reaper

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
Roger MPC rewire basically I use Reaper

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.810 
Roger MPC rewire basically I use Reaper
as<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> sound<00:01:25.049> module<00:01:25.619> will<00:01:25.890> Amigo<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> sound

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
as a sound module will Amigo as a sound

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.219 
as a sound module will Amigo as a sound
module<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.509> sequence<00:01:27.960> everything

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
module when I sequence everything

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.550 
module when I sequence everything
through<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:28.860> MPC<00:01:29.479> MPC<00:01:30.479> holds<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:31.020> my<00:01:31.049> drum

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
through my MPC MPC holds all my drum

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.999 
through my MPC MPC holds all my drum
kits<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.700> my<00:01:33.180> sounds<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:34.079> basically<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:34.979> my

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
kits all my sounds are basically all my

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
kits all my sounds are basically all my
drum<00:01:35.400> sounds<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.880> coming<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> MPC

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
drum sounds are coming out of the MPC

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.319 
drum sounds are coming out of the MPC
and<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.650> use<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.729> simps<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and I use all the the simps and the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.060 
and I use all the the simps and the
keyboards<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.990> stuff<00:01:40.110> from<00:01:40.380> over<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.009> if

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
keyboards and stuff from over here so if

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.940 
keyboards and stuff from over here so if
you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:42.509> reason<00:01:43.549> rewired<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
you can see I have reason rewired to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.980 
you can see I have reason rewired to
Reaper<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.820> way<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.329> use<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.630> sounds

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
Reaper so that way I can use the sounds

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
Reaper so that way I can use the sounds
and<00:01:49.140> Reaper<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> could<00:01:49.829> pull<00:01:50.009> up<00:01:50.040> things<00:01:50.399> like

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and Reaper I could pull up things like

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.609 
and Reaper I could pull up things like
that<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.180> purity<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:52.220> can<00:01:53.220> pull<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.060> length

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
that the purity I can pull up so length

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.810 
that the purity I can pull up so length
BAM<00:01:55.619> get<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.340> popping<00:01:56.869> but<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.079> also<00:01:58.820> pull

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
BAM get it popping but I can also pull

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.179 
BAM get it popping but I can also pull
up<00:01:59.939> stuff<00:02:00.299> from<00:02:00.840> reason<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.500> mean<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.799> matter<00:02:02.070> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
up stuff from reason I mean a matter of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770 
up stuff from reason I mean a matter of
fact<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.729> drag<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.360> here<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
fact I will just drag this up here to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.720 
fact I will just drag this up here to
the<00:02:03.899> top<00:02:04.170> watch<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:04.950> appears<00:02:05.579> BAM

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
the top watch it as it appears BAM

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.880 
the top watch it as it appears BAM
I<00:02:06.790> can<00:02:07.540> use<00:02:07.720> sounds<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.290> reason<00:02:08.680> so<00:02:08.710> I

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
I can use sounds and reason so I

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.990 
I can use sounds and reason so I
basically<00:02:09.370> I<00:02:09.490> got<00:02:09.640> admitted<00:02:10.090> all<00:02:10.210> together

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
basically I got admitted all together

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.280 
basically I got admitted all together
