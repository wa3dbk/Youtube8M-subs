if they try to lay get out of you can
just<00:05:15.580> like<00:05:15.730> um<00:05:16.090> go<00:05:16.720> black<00:05:16.960> on<00:05:17.200> if<00:05:17.380> they<00:05:17.470> use<00:05:17.770> it

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
just like um go black on if they use it

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.240 
just like um go black on if they use it
for<00:05:17.920> an<00:05:18.040> axiom<00:05:18.370> what<00:05:18.520> up<00:05:18.670> um<00:05:19.680> see<00:05:20.680> I<00:05:20.710> set<00:05:21.160> for

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
for an axiom what up um see I set for

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.710 
for an axiom what up um see I set for
the<00:05:21.370> traps<00:05:21.670> and<00:05:21.820> pretty<00:05:21.970> sure<00:05:22.060> there's<00:05:22.240> 11

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
the traps and pretty sure there's 11

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.610 
the traps and pretty sure there's 11
traps<00:05:22.990> too<00:05:23.470> ah<00:05:24.390> for<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.450> extra<00:05:25.720> deck<00:05:25.870> you<00:05:26.590> can

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
traps too ah for the extra deck you can

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.280 
traps too ah for the extra deck you can
include<00:05:27.220> more<00:05:27.610> or<00:05:28.150> less<00:05:28.330> of<00:05:28.510> studying<00:05:28.840> cards

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
include more or less of studying cards

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.560 
include more or less of studying cards
for<00:05:30.070> example<00:05:30.400> you<00:05:30.430> cannot<00:05:30.640> include<00:05:30.880> like<00:05:31.120> two

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
for example you cannot include like two

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.260 
for example you cannot include like two
excitons<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.170> 10<00:05:32.410> ones<00:05:32.590> because<00:05:32.890> this<00:05:33.010> deck

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
excitons to 10 ones because this deck

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.180 
excitons to 10 ones because this deck
relies<00:05:34.270> more<00:05:34.510> on<00:05:34.570> like<00:05:34.780> hands<00:05:35.350> you<00:05:35.590> there<00:05:36.070> is

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
relies more on like hands you there is

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.360 
relies more on like hands you there is
less<00:05:36.340> reliance<00:05:36.730> on<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:37.360> actual<00:05:37.780> extra<00:05:38.170> deck

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
less reliance on the actual extra deck

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.480 
less reliance on the actual extra deck
so<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.520> have<00:05:39.700> a<00:05:39.730> pretty<00:05:40.560> broad<00:05:41.560> extra<00:05:41.950> duct<00:05:42.130> to

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
so you have a pretty broad extra duct to

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.510 
so you have a pretty broad extra duct to
be<00:05:42.550> fair<00:05:42.760> and<00:05:43.390> I'm<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:44.080> played<00:05:44.290> too<00:05:44.680> tight<00:05:45.220> Kings

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
be fair and I'm I played too tight Kings

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.790 
be fair and I'm I played too tight Kings
parents<00:05:45.940> just<00:05:46.180> like<00:05:46.480> skill<00:05:46.870> drain<00:05:47.080> get<00:05:47.530> over

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
parents just like skill drain get over

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.010 
parents just like skill drain get over
