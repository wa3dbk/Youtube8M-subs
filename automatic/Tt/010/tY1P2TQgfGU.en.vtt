 keep at the dock but at the same time 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.530
 it's not that easy 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.710

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.020

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.930
 put in parentheses otherwise it works 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.320

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.030

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.030

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.320

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.690
