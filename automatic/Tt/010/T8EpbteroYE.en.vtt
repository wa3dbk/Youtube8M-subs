00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
messages like you know well my answer
really<00:01:27.509> would<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.900> been<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.380> little<00:01:28.799> bit<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
really would have been a little bit of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219 
really would have been a little bit of
this<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.759> kind<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.299> parts<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> both

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
this and that like kind of parts of both

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.280 
this and that like kind of parts of both
so<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.829> tried<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> keep<00:01:32.520> them<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:33.060> broad<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.140> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
so I tried to keep them as broad as I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.649 
so I tried to keep them as broad as I
could<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:34.890> many<00:01:35.159> people<00:01:35.540> you<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
could to get as many people you know I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.499 
could to get as many people you know I
can<00:01:36.810> only<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> many<00:01:38.369> categories<00:01:38.790> i<00:01:39.240> guess

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
can only have so many categories i guess

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.600 
can only have so many categories i guess
but<00:01:39.840> i<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> pretty<00:01:41.310> true

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
but i think this is a pretty true

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.520 
but i think this is a pretty true
representation<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> lot<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.990> us<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.290> try

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
representation that a lot of us do try

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.560 
representation that a lot of us do try
to<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.770> our<00:01:43.799> nails<00:01:44.100> ourselves<00:01:45.030> especially<00:01:45.240> if

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to do our nails ourselves especially if

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.120 
to do our nails ourselves especially if
you<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:45.930> take<00:01:46.079> an<00:01:46.229> interest<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.799> beauty

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you really take an interest in beauty

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
you really take an interest in beauty
maybe<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.090> type<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.299> thing<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.780> try<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
maybe it's a type of thing you try to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.999 
maybe it's a type of thing you try to
kind<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.439> master<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.899> anyway<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.799> kind<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
kind of master so anyway I just kind of

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
a decent amount to dry but I use my

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.930 
a decent amount to dry but I use my
Sally<00:03:27.780> Hansen<00:03:28.290> mega<00:03:28.530> shine<00:03:28.860> top<00:03:29.190> coat<00:03:29.519> over

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
the top and it really speeds it up even

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.220 
the top and it really speeds it up even
though<00:03:32.820> it's<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.239> like<00:03:33.450> most<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.140> way

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
though it's if it's like most of the way

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.569 
though it's if it's like most of the way
dry<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.829> wouldn't<00:03:35.100> want<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.400> maybe
