there's<00:02:14.480> material<00:02:14.989> ex-mistress<00:02:15.440> go<00:02:15.920> out<00:02:16.070> like

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
there's material ex-mistress go out like

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.160 
there's material ex-mistress go out like
oh<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.489> collect<00:02:16.850> certain<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.300> mushrooms<00:02:17.870> or

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
oh you collect certain on mushrooms or

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.900 
oh you collect certain on mushrooms or
stones<00:02:18.500> or<00:02:18.920> jewels<00:02:19.220> or<00:02:19.519> something<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:19.820> that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
stones or jewels or something like that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.390 
stones or jewels or something like that
the<00:02:20.269> environment<00:02:20.709> so<00:02:21.709> there's<00:02:21.860> more<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
the environment so there's more to the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.830 
the environment so there's more to the
game<00:02:22.550> then<00:02:22.940> just<00:02:23.150> probably<00:02:23.330> what<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.600> see<00:02:23.780> in

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
game then just probably what you see in

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.509 
game then just probably what you see in
the<00:02:23.959> demo<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:24.380> case<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.769> were<00:02:24.890> put<00:02:25.220> off<00:02:25.310> by<00:02:25.489> a

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
the demo in case you were put off by a

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.780 
the demo in case you were put off by a
demo<00:02:25.760> ourselves<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.950> graphics<00:02:28.220> presentation

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
demo ourselves the graphics presentation

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.360 
demo ourselves the graphics presentation
and<00:02:31.659> in<00:02:32.049> my<00:02:32.110> opinion<00:02:32.319> is<00:02:32.650> probably<00:02:32.950> one<00:02:33.099> of<00:02:33.129> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
and in my opinion is probably one of the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.569 
and in my opinion is probably one of the
best<00:02:33.579> graphical<00:02:34.560> presentations<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.219> wii

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
best graphical presentations in a wii

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.720 
best graphical presentations in a wii
game<00:02:37.500> not<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.530> best<00:02:38.980> probably<00:02:39.400> one<00:02:39.519> of<00:02:39.549> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
game not the best probably one of the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.270 
game not the best probably one of the
best<00:02:39.909> so<00:02:40.150> as<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.629> know<00:02:40.780> me<00:02:41.109> I'm<00:02:41.859> not<00:02:41.920> the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
best so as you know me I'm not the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.860 
best so as you know me I'm not the
graphics<00:02:42.760> person<00:02:42.969> I'm<00:02:43.299> not<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.659> one<00:02:43.780> that

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
graphics person I'm not the one that

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.509 
graphics person I'm not the one that
only<00:02:44.079> kids<00:02:44.409> about<00:02:44.560> graphics<00:02:45.010> if<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.340> game

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
only kids about graphics if the game

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.220 
only kids about graphics if the game
doesn't<00:02:45.549> meet<00:02:46.000> my<00:02:46.180> expectations<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.989> what<00:02:47.140> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
doesn't meet my expectations of what the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.500 
doesn't meet my expectations of what the
graphic<00:02:47.560> should<00:02:47.769> be<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.670> they<00:02:48.849> care<00:02:49.480> so

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
graphic should be and that they care so

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.809 
graphic should be and that they care so
much<00:02:49.720> about<00:02:49.900> them<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.310> don't<00:02:51.519> care<00:02:51.640> much

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
much about them that I don't care much

much about them that I don't care much
about<00:02:51.879> anything<00:02:52.209> else<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.689> the<00:02:52.750> game<00:02:53.129> besides

anyway but in the presentation it's not
realistic<00:03:14.829> style<00:03:15.159> was<00:03:15.430> not<00:03:15.579> occurred<00:03:15.909> to<00:03:16.090> me

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
realistic style was not occurred to me

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.879 
realistic style was not occurred to me
ish<00:03:16.299> animated<00:03:16.959> stories<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:17.769> like<00:03:17.859> a

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
ish animated stories and it's like a

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.789 
ish animated stories and it's like a
mixture<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.549> it<00:03:18.819> pretty<00:03:19.329> much<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:23.470> set<00:03:23.769> the

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
mixture of it pretty much it set the

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.699 
mixture of it pretty much it set the
time<00:03:24.280> mmmm<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.419> no<00:03:25.659> that<00:03:26.200> would<00:03:26.349> be<00:03:26.379> where

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
time mmmm a is no that would be where

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.259 
time mmmm a is no that would be where
monsters<00:03:26.980> roam<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.549> earth<00:03:27.579> or<00:03:27.879> anything<00:03:28.120> so

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
monsters roam the earth or anything so

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.819 
monsters roam the earth or anything so
it's<00:03:28.329> not<00:03:28.510> really<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.720> realistic<00:03:29.319> environment

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
it's not really a realistic environment

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.830 
it's not really a realistic environment
but<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.459> Arsenal<00:03:30.849> that's<00:03:31.030> presented<00:03:31.480> in

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
but the Arsenal that's presented in

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.179 
but the Arsenal that's presented in
actually<00:03:32.470> makes<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.829> look<00:03:32.950> like<00:03:33.099> a

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
actually makes it look like a

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.020 
actually makes it look like a
surrealistic<00:03:33.459> environment

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
surrealistic environment

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.720 
surrealistic environment

there's no voice of the overs in this

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.190 
there's no voice of the overs in this
game<00:03:43.560> at<00:03:43.680> all<00:03:43.800> pretty<00:03:44.280> much<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.780> characters

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
game at all pretty much the characters

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.810

have certain grunts and noises they make

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.190 
have certain grunts and noises they make
when<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.240> create<00:03:48.450> your<00:03:48.540> character<00:03:48.690> will<00:03:48.990> have

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
when you create your character will have

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.840

their male or female you choose from
certainly<00:03:51.270> list<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.740> basically<00:03:53.130> it's<00:03:53.310> like

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
certainly list and basically it's like

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.040 
certainly list and basically it's like
the<00:03:53.580> sounds<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.000> may<00:03:54.120> currently<00:03:54.240> attack<00:03:54.750> they

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
the sounds I may currently attack they

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.210 
the sounds I may currently attack they
get<00:03:55.260> back<00:03:55.560> they<00:03:55.770> die<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.250> whatnot<00:03:58.220> and

get back they die and whatnot and

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.010 
get back they die and whatnot and
basically<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.850> non-playable<00:04:00.390> character<00:04:00.870> is

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
basically the non-playable character is

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.690 
basically the non-playable character is
you<00:04:01.230> talk<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.740> during<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.010> story<00:04:02.280> will<00:04:02.520> ring

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
and then you go online pretty much just
