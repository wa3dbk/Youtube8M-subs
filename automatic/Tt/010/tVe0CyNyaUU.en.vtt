00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.460
 [Applause] 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.230
 we got a good performance pattern 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.049
 we put a strong rhythm we can do 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
 we create opportunities and we give 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.160
 another step in a major competition 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.660
 and made some changes until people 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.760
 it is not accustomed for example to take 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.220
 someone blue because it was made that kind 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.660
 to change the gym and eggs due to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.720
 yellow cards two cards 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
 yellows that had us preserves 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.769
 You can see once again today to force 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 of the net group because whoever enters gives account 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.040
 of the message we saw an example of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.370
 alecsandro who came in from nilmar 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.300
 and once again it is important to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.040
 they have this awareness to know 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.170
 that the importance of the group is not 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 individual that the engineer is a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.480
 group winner after recovery 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.190
 she comes to work with him that way 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.170
 that's what I value enough the group 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.239
 because I know that only in this way can 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.370
 win and now will have a good time 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.170
 now to recover who has a 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.660
 problem and also prepare the team for 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.430
 the rest of the competition is to make each 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.630
 best day possible seek to evolve 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.760
 grow more 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.369
 I know that some question 0 I want yes 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.040
 mainly because it has so much that I 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.790
 I see the tite and adriana I do not know if the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.830
 tite is you hear me know if they and 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.509
 I just wish I just wanted to talk to him. 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.540
 That's because that was because Tite 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.689
 All good people are listening to me, Tite. 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.030
 the tite is not listening total of r 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.100
 otitis I just want to highlight I do not want you 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.030
 lose more of the collective force and everything else 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.130
 but it is a detail of the game to him when the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.180
 people talk detail is something that is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.649
 little 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.140
 let's say in size but in 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.680
 intensity can be very large and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.890
 reference is precisely when bolivar 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.920
 made the goal and the whole group all 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.110
 players went to embrace Bolivia and there 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.659
 I see that there is much of what you have 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.000
 said when the book was criticized 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.640
 made a point of emphasizing what it was 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.020
 your determination to the player is not the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.550
 what was the work he came to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.940
 performing for the understanding of the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.360
 fan and it seems that this moment to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.420
 me 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.950
 At least I do not know if tone is 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.980
 overestimating overestimating this 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.650
 detail but for me this has a lot of 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.500
 which was always said per day in relation to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.840
 bolivia art in relation to the rogério 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.730
 in relation to the athlete who 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.520
 Sometimes he 's in the pass a good time. 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.320
 in relation to the guina of not having scored 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.140
 and then make the goal and the whole group 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.120
 solidarity with this knows if it comes from 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.510
 heart and it's no use asking the technician 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.280
 it 's no use talking to the director and the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.650
 group has to foster 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.530
 solidarity aspect and if this is the case when 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.660
 joy of a joy of all knowing 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.270
 who divides it loses together who wins 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.340
 together and that there are moments that someone 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.580
 will be highlighted and others and 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.680
 others is and that today was the book and in 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.110
 some sudden moment of understanding 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.989
 even by the system so others 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.940
 players go out and time will not go either 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.370
 able to organize a team if not 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 It's also time, it 's bolivia. 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.940
 dropping and is also growing in the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.090
 offensive aspect but the day like you 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.400
 said of the heart but part of the heart and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.560
 is the understanding of the players of that 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.630
 that was always your manifestation that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.700
 was not only a manifestation 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.820
 who would say another manifestation of 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.920
 heart also had certain and correct not 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.230
 I'm not going to run away because who has 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.890
 the command somehow he also he 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.110
 he presents examples and if that which 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.080
 something is set without an example 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.940
 or if you talk - but if you always stay 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.890
 so when you have a direction that has a 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.390
 example when you have a technician and a 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.330
 a commission that the team can pass the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.670
 example and it 's not only mine and if that 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.850
 I tell him, it 's the whole technical committee here. 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.900
 which brings this form of de de 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.019
 job 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.390
 the athlete sees and is able to 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.130
 to follow in this way that is 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.230
 how the management sees how we see it too 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.930
 You're sure to be here with me now. 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.739
 President fernando now new oak 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.940

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.650
 some stories the people who 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.440
 exalted the eternal president fernando 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.430

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.860
 obviously fernando 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.419
 Of course, we people who have gone through 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.240
 by the presidency of the club that works 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.620
 in the club is not to be recognized is very 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.440
 well it really is very good but I think the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.180
 more important at this moment is to think 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.940
 in what is happening national 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.680
 is having a great time in the management 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.770
 administrative management in the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.050
 Marketing management in football is not 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.430
 every game the fans get enchanted that good 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.919

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.460
 finally a hug to the colorados of the world 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.560

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.800
 how they are glued on the internet to 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.509
 watch the interviews and the and the post game 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.190

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.259
 we all color when we are 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.729

 another great win by thrashing 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.060
 but the inter which is forward to 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.949
 tendency is that it may face games 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.630
 even more difficult was signing a 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.820
 competition, as the cup of Brazil is 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.590
 prepared to fight for the title to us 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.720
 We're just thinking phase by stage. 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.699
 opponent opponent step by step 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.440
 obstacle right obstacle 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.570
 Whether we are prepared or not 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.310
 We're tracking. We're working until 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.599
 now all our challenges in the year 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.280
 were overcome 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.229
 we overcame the gaucho championship 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.610
 first phase to the second phase and we 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.710
 the title 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.180
 we had a stumble of rondonópolis but the 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.590
 time to recover 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.360
 we did well in the first match when the 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.800
 Guarani today went very well 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.409
 We're going, we 'll follow. 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.659
 working the phone in this way 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.919
 I now or 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.900
 Andrezinho spoke at the weekend. 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:14.110
 past the inter is with all the 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.370
 recipes inside the plate to make this 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.199
 Cake goes right 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.639
 The team is united is playing well has 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.250
 excellent physical trainers 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.470

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.110
 preparing the team for the player is 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.840
 Everything is going right there behind us. 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.770
 working we are trying to follow a 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.330
 planning to follow a route that was 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.900
 established in January there in bento 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.000
 gonçalves 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.680

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.940
 must're taking care always right at all 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.009
 At the moment things can get off the rail 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.970
 people have to be aware so that 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:44.979
 do not happen 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.400
 Congratulations Fernando, thank you a hug to 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.400
