00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:52.980 
had any lines and he only appears
briefly<00:01:51.819> but<00:01:52.329> he<00:01:52.539> does<00:01:52.689> serve<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.960> purpose

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
briefly but he does serve a purpose

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.999 
briefly but he does serve a purpose
because<00:01:53.409> he<00:01:53.590> combines<00:01:54.009> Jetfire<00:01:54.640> with<00:01:54.850> Optimus

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
because he combines Jetfire with Optimus

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.989 
because he combines Jetfire with Optimus
another<00:01:57.009> problem<00:01:57.399> I<00:01:57.460> had<00:01:57.639> is<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
another problem I had is that the

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.669 
another problem I had is that the
constructor<00:01:58.270> cons<00:01:58.749> are<00:01:59.020> still<00:01:59.380> walking

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
constructor cons are still walking

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.819 
constructor cons are still walking
around<00:01:59.979> after<00:02:01.139> Devastator<00:02:02.139> is<00:02:02.439> already

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
around after Devastator is already

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.059 
around after Devastator is already
merged<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.369> even<00:02:03.579> after<00:02:03.850> he's<00:02:03.969> defeated

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
merged and even after he's defeated

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.800 
merged and even after he's defeated
another<00:02:06.069> problem<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.490> that<00:02:06.549> rampage<00:02:07.359> was<00:02:07.569> red

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
another problem is that rampage was red

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.600 
another problem is that rampage was red
but<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.140> read<00:02:08.380> that<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.679> was<00:02:08.830> done<00:02:09.069> because<00:02:09.280> he

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
but I read that that was done because he

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.949 
but I read that that was done because he
was<00:02:09.729> fighting<00:02:09.880> bumblebee<00:02:10.450> who<00:02:10.630> was<00:02:10.780> also

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
was fighting bumblebee who was also

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.960 
was fighting bumblebee who was also
yellow<00:02:11.530> so<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.520> would<00:02:12.610> have<00:02:12.700> been<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.819> little
