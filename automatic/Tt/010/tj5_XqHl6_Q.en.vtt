that you have to plug this unit in in
order<00:03:30.720> for<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.930> software<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.410> work<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:32.280> if<00:03:32.370> you

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
order for the software to work so if you

order for the software to work so if you
expect<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.239> then<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.720> know<00:03:33.840> later<00:03:34.110> on<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.410> your

DJ<00:03:34.799> career<00:03:34.950> buy<00:03:35.250> something<00:03:35.640> better<00:03:35.820> and

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
DJ career buy something better and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.120 
DJ career buy something better and
continue<00:03:36.450> using<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.870> same<00:03:36.900> software<00:03:37.410> at<00:03:37.980> that

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
continue using the same software at that

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.020 
continue using the same software at that
point<00:03:38.370> enough<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.670> buy<00:03:38.820> it

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
point enough to buy it

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.970 
point enough to buy it
I<00:03:39.060> think<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.810> mappings<00:03:40.260> are<00:03:40.380> disabled<00:03:40.890> and

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
I think the mappings are disabled and

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.890 
I think the mappings are disabled and
that's<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.700> technical<00:03:41.970> reason<00:03:42.390> why<00:03:42.510> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
that's the technical reason why the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.750 
that's the technical reason why the
controllers<00:03:43.350> needed<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.830> don't<00:03:44.340> think<00:03:44.580> it's

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
controllers needed I don't think it's

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.490 
controllers needed I don't think it's
possible<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.209> change<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:46.019> way<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.320> software

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
possible to change the way the software

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.800 
possible to change the way the software
works<00:03:46.920> with<00:03:47.190> external<00:03:47.640> hardware<00:03:47.850> at<00:03:48.090> all<00:03:48.269> you

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
works with external hardware at all you

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.100 
works with external hardware at all you
know

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
know

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.960 
know
plug<00:03:49.860> this<00:03:49.980> in<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.400> will<00:03:50.489> work<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:50.700> like

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
plug this in and it will work just like

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.910 
plug this in and it will work just like
the<00:03:51.150> full-price<00:03:51.540> version<00:03:51.989> anything<00:03:52.500> else<00:03:52.680> you

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
the full-price version anything else you

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.920 
the full-price version anything else you
need<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.250> go<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.430> upgrade<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.760> but<00:03:54.480> like<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.750> say

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
need to go and upgrade it but like I say

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.240 
need to go and upgrade it but like I say
the<00:03:55.080> record<00:03:55.200> button<00:03:55.620> works<00:03:55.830> it's<00:03:56.070> so

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
the record button works it's so

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.650 
the record button works it's so
important<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.760> record<00:03:56.880> your<00:03:57.209> sets<00:03:57.480> when

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
important to record your sets when

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.640 
important to record your sets when
you're<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> DJ<00:03:58.110> especially<00:03:58.440> when<00:03:58.530> you're

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
you're a DJ especially when you're

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.690 
you're a DJ especially when you're
learning<00:03:58.799> it's<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.160> only<00:03:59.250> time<00:03:59.519> you're

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
learning it's the only time you're

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.640 
learning it's the only time you're
really<00:03:59.820> going<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.090> forget<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.870> DJ<00:04:01.230> side<00:04:01.500> of

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
really going to forget the DJ side of

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.740 
really going to forget the DJ side of
the<00:04:02.040> equation<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.489> become<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.209> audience<00:04:03.600> is

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
the equation and become the audience is

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.390 
the equation and become the audience is
listening<00:04:03.900> back<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.380> your<00:04:04.500> set<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.280> it's

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
listening back to your set so it's

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.800 
listening back to your set so it's
really<00:04:05.519> nice<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.760> see<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.090> on<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.360> bit<00:04:06.510> on<00:04:06.720> a

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
really nice to see that on a bit on a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.199 
really nice to see that on a bit on a
beginner<00:04:07.110> controller<00:04:07.730> apart<00:04:08.730> from<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.000> it's

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
beginner controller apart from that it's

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.580 
beginner controller apart from that it's
all<00:04:09.360> pretty<00:04:09.570> basic<00:04:09.810> it's<00:04:10.260> all<00:04:10.410> pretty

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
all pretty basic it's all pretty

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.140 
all pretty basic it's all pretty
standard<00:04:10.829> because<00:04:11.400> there's<00:04:11.610> not<00:04:11.820> many

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
standard because there's not many

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.410 
standard because there's not many
controls<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:13.049> know<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:14.000> looping<00:04:15.000> is

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
controls you know that the looping is

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.560 
controls you know that the looping is
limited<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.890> cues<00:04:17.579> there's<00:04:17.910> actually<00:04:18.150> six

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
limited the cues there's actually six

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.509 
limited the cues there's actually six

cubes per side which is quite generous

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.159 
cubes per side which is quite generous
but<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:20.729> can't<00:04:20.970> delete<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.479> cues<00:04:21.720> from<00:04:21.959> here

but you can't delete the cues from here
the<00:04:22.830> effects

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
the effects

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.670 
the effects
again<00:04:24.509> there's<00:04:24.720> more<00:04:24.990> controlling<00:04:25.620> the

again there's more controlling the

again there's more controlling the
software<00:04:26.070> than<00:04:26.250> there<00:04:26.370> is<00:04:26.400> on<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.669> hardware

enough<00:04:28.979> buttons<00:04:29.280> here<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.430> do<00:04:29.669> very<00:04:29.940> much

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
enough buttons here to do very much

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.170 
enough buttons here to do very much
another<00:04:31.350> thing<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.680> didn't<00:04:31.979> like<00:04:32.039> was<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.880> fact

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
another thing I didn't like was the fact

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.790 
another thing I didn't like was the fact
that<00:04:33.360> normally<00:04:33.870> on<00:04:33.990> jog<00:04:34.229> wheels<00:04:34.440> like<00:04:34.590> this

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
that normally on jog wheels like this

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.409 
that normally on jog wheels like this
the<00:04:35.009> metal<00:04:35.430> bit<00:04:35.550> lets<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:35.910> do<00:04:36.060> scratch

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
the metal bit lets you do scratch

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.210 
the metal bit lets you do scratch
motions<00:04:37.199> so<00:04:37.380> that's<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:37.710> holding<00:04:38.009> a<00:04:38.039> piece

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
motions so that's like holding a piece

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.499 
motions so that's like holding a piece
of<00:04:38.340> vinyl<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.789> know<00:04:38.940> you'll<00:04:39.120> get<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.270> scratch

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
of vinyl you know you'll get a scratch

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.570 
of vinyl you know you'll get a scratch
noise<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:40.500> other<00:04:40.530> side<00:04:40.919> lets<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.310> do<00:04:41.430> what's

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
noise the other side lets you do what's

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.580 
noise the other side lets you do what's
called<00:04:41.729> nudge<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.690> nudge<00:04:42.900> is<00:04:43.050> when<00:04:43.199> you<00:04:43.289> slow

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
called nudge and nudge is when you slow

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.340 
called nudge and nudge is when you slow
down<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.830> tune<00:04:44.759> very<00:04:45.030> slow<00:04:45.330> very<00:04:45.509> slightly<00:04:46.110> or

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
down a tune very slow very slightly or

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.800 
down a tune very slow very slightly or
speed<00:04:47.009> it<00:04:47.100> up<00:04:47.190> very<00:04:47.340> slightly<00:04:47.580> in<00:04:48.389> order<00:04:48.660> to

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
speed it up very slightly in order to

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.540 
speed it up very slightly in order to
keep<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.350> in<00:04:49.410> time<00:04:49.620> with<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.889> other<00:04:50.009> one<00:04:50.190> and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
keep it in time with the other one and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.830 
keep it in time with the other one and
normally<00:04:50.759> when<00:04:51.240> you're<00:04:51.389> in<00:04:51.509> what's<00:04:51.690> called

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
normally when you're in what's called

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.689 
normally when you're in what's called
scratch<00:04:52.169> mode<00:04:52.470> which<00:04:52.800> is<00:04:52.979> it's<00:04:53.370> always<00:04:53.490> on<00:04:53.669> a

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
scratch mode which is it's always on a

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.189 
scratch mode which is it's always on a
button<00:04:54.030> there's<00:04:54.419> a<00:04:54.479> scratch<00:04:54.720> button<00:04:55.020> there

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
button there's a scratch button there

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.870 
button there's a scratch button there
that's<00:04:55.860> what<00:04:56.039> you'll<00:04:56.160> get<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:56.639> will<00:04:56.789> be

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
that's what you'll get this will be

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.850 
that's what you'll get this will be
scratch<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.419> this<00:04:57.539> will<00:04:57.690> be<00:04:57.750> nudge<00:04:57.930> on<00:04:58.169> these

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
scratch and this will be nudge on these

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.860 
scratch and this will be nudge on these
when<00:04:59.639> you<00:04:59.699> put<00:04:59.849> into<00:05:00.000> scratch<00:05:00.270> mode<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.690> whole

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
when you put into scratch mode the whole

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.839 
when you put into scratch mode the whole
thing<00:05:01.199> you<00:05:01.680> scratch<00:05:02.009> so<00:05:02.280> even<00:05:02.490> if<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.639> go<00:05:02.729> like

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
thing you scratch so even if you go like

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.700 
thing you scratch so even if you go like
that<00:05:02.910> it'll<00:05:03.389> make<00:05:03.509> a<00:05:03.539> scratching<00:05:04.020> noise<00:05:04.139> you

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
that it'll make a scratching noise you

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.740 
that it'll make a scratching noise you
got<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:05.130> so<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:05.669> don't<00:05:05.910> get<00:05:06.060> that<00:05:06.210> nudge<00:05:06.449> you

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
got that so you don't get that nudge you

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.180 
got that so you don't get that nudge you
know<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:06.930> need<00:05:07.199> to<00:05:07.259> turn<00:05:07.410> scratch<00:05:07.740> off<00:05:07.979> and

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
know you need to turn scratch off and

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.159 
know you need to turn scratch off and
then<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.370> whole<00:05:08.520> thing<00:05:08.789> is<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.720> behavior

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
then the whole thing is that behavior

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.379 
then the whole thing is that behavior
disk<00:05:10.380> it's<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:10.919> small<00:05:11.250> thing<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.910> if<00:05:12.270> you've

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
disk it's a small thing and if you've

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.790 
disk it's a small thing and if you've
never<00:05:12.539> known<00:05:12.810> any<00:05:13.020> different<00:05:13.410> it<00:05:13.530> probably

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
never known any different it probably

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.050 
never known any different it probably
won't<00:05:13.979> bother<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:14.370> but<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.610> people<00:05:14.759> who<00:05:14.970> are

won't bother you but to people who are

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.210 
won't bother you but to people who are
used<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.990> way<00:05:16.110> mostly<00:05:16.560> jet<00:05:16.830> controllers

used to the way mostly jet controllers

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.990 
used to the way mostly jet controllers
work<00:05:17.400> it's<00:05:17.669> a<00:05:17.880> slightly<00:05:18.780> ugh<00:05:19.110> some

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
work it's a slightly ugh some

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
work it's a slightly ugh some
characteristic<00:05:21.000> of<00:05:21.090> it<00:05:21.240> let's<00:05:21.599> have<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.780> tiny

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
characteristic of it let's have a tiny

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.570 
characteristic of it let's have a tiny
look<00:05:22.320> of<00:05:22.530> what's<00:05:22.710> on<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.889> front<00:05:23.039> and<00:05:23.220> back<00:05:23.280> so

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
look of what's on the front and back so

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.790 
look of what's on the front and back so
on<00:05:23.699> the<00:05:23.759> front<00:05:23.970> here<00:05:24.199> there<00:05:25.199> is<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.410> microphone

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
on the front here there is a microphone

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.219 
on the front here there is a microphone
socket<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.849> microphone<00:05:27.360> just<00:05:27.630> goes<00:05:28.020> straight

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
socket the microphone just goes straight

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.600 
socket the microphone just goes straight
through<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.740> unit<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.099> straight<00:05:29.400> out<00:05:29.520> the

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
through the unit and straight out the

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.520 
through the unit and straight out the
back<00:05:29.729> there's<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.360> volume<00:05:30.599> control<00:05:30.690> there<00:05:31.080> it

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
back there's a volume control there it

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.379 
back there's a volume control there it
mixes<00:05:31.949> with<00:05:32.099> whatever<00:05:32.400> you<00:05:32.520> do<00:05:32.639> on<00:05:32.669> a<00:05:32.849> computer

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
mixes with whatever you do on a computer

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.689 
mixes with whatever you do on a computer
so<00:05:33.900> you<00:05:33.930> don't<00:05:34.409> see<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.800> microphone<00:05:35.220> input<00:05:35.400> on

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
so you don't see the microphone input on

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:37.250 
so you don't see the microphone input on
your<00:05:35.729> software<00:05:36.180> you<00:05:36.419> can't<00:05:36.599> put<00:05:36.750> effects<00:05:37.080> on

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
your software you can't put effects on

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.960 
your software you can't put effects on
it<00:05:37.380> you<00:05:37.470> can't<00:05:37.680> do<00:05:37.830> anything<00:05:38.099> fancy<00:05:38.490> with<00:05:38.849> it

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
it you can't do anything fancy with it

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.390 
it you can't do anything fancy with it
just<00:05:39.120> go<00:05:39.449> through<00:05:39.750> which<00:05:40.500> is<00:05:40.650> again<00:05:40.889> normal<00:05:41.310> at

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
just go through which is again normal at

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.800 
just go through which is again normal at
this<00:05:41.520> kind<00:05:41.729> of<00:05:41.789> price<00:05:41.909> point<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.510> there's<00:05:42.750> a

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
this kind of price point and there's a

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.330 
this kind of price point and there's a
headphone<00:05:43.139> socket<00:05:43.380> it's<00:05:43.620> only<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:44.099> little

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
headphone socket it's only the little

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.100 
headphone socket it's only the little
one<00:05:44.460> it's<00:05:44.610> only<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.880> eighth<00:05:45.060> inch<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.020> will

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
one it's only the eighth inch so it will

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.750 
one it's only the eighth inch so it will
only<00:05:46.229> fit<00:05:46.590> that<00:05:47.130> size<00:05:47.580> headphone<00:05:48.289> rather<00:05:49.289> than

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
only fit that size headphone rather than

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.830 
only fit that size headphone rather than
the<00:05:50.760> big<00:05:50.940> chunky<00:05:51.300> one<00:05:51.419> but<00:05:51.599> then<00:05:51.720> most

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
the big chunky one but then most

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.930 
the big chunky one but then most
headphones<00:05:52.110> nowadays<00:05:52.680> have<00:05:52.889> a<00:05:52.919> choice<00:05:53.190> it's

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
headphones nowadays have a choice it's

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.920 
headphones nowadays have a choice it's
not<00:05:54.120> really<00:05:54.330> a<00:05:54.360> deal<00:05:54.509> breaker

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
not really a deal breaker

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.570 
not really a deal breaker
and<00:05:55.530> then<00:05:55.710> there's<00:05:55.860> volume<00:05:56.130> controls<00:05:56.490> for

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
and then there's volume controls for

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.480 
and then there's volume controls for
both<00:05:56.849> on<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:57.780> back<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:58.259> think<00:05:58.889> I<00:05:59.130> might<00:05:59.280> shown

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
both on the back I think I might shown

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.740 
both on the back I think I might shown
you<00:05:59.550> this<00:05:59.669> earlier<00:05:59.970> I<00:06:00.000> can't<00:06:00.210> remember<00:06:00.389> there

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
you this earlier I can't remember there

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.730 
you this earlier I can't remember there
are<00:06:00.960> just<00:06:01.669> two<00:06:02.669> outputs<00:06:03.570> and<00:06:04.139> that's<00:06:04.289> it<00:06:04.500> so

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
are just two outputs and that's it so

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.520 
are just two outputs and that's it so
it's<00:06:04.860> as<00:06:05.009> basic<00:06:05.159> as<00:06:05.460> you<00:06:05.490> can<00:06:05.639> get<00:06:05.849> really<00:06:06.530> but

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
it's as basic as you can get really but

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.899 
it's as basic as you can get really but
because<00:06:07.800> those<00:06:07.919> job<00:06:08.159> was<00:06:08.340> a<00:06:08.370> good<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:08.699> because

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
because those job was a good and because

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.159 
because those job was a good and because
the<00:06:09.000> software<00:06:09.270> is<00:06:09.389> good<00:06:09.599> and<00:06:09.720> cuz<00:06:09.870> it<00:06:09.990> comes

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
the software is good and cuz it comes

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.600 
the software is good and cuz it comes
with<00:06:10.289> an<00:06:10.380> audio<00:06:10.530> interface<00:06:10.919> built-in<00:06:11.430> that

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
with an audio interface built-in that

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.839 
with an audio interface built-in that
gives<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:12.000> headphones<00:06:12.720> and<00:06:13.050> master<00:06:13.349> out<00:06:13.500> and

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
gives you headphones and master out and

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.420 
gives you headphones and master out and
because<00:06:14.849> it's<00:06:15.570> so<00:06:15.780> cheap<00:06:15.810> I<00:06:16.349> think<00:06:16.860> it's
