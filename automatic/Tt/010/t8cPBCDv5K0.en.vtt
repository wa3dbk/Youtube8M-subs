00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.510
 the whole in different corners too 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.440
 turn in bavaria in salzburg in 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.780
 South-Tirol 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.810
 these were different motives we 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.160
 has had to operate we need 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.740
 pull salzburg and maybe he has to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.689
 talking or massing in where we are 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.189
 Interior views have been built by 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.509
 Kramerladen and from the penne house and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.279
 Of course that was difficult then 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.909
 to merge that whole a blog 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.909
 results 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.210
 in the run up to others 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.190
 Western modern looked around 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.530
 see what the colleagues do and have 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.350
 then usually a very good balance 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.510
 found and yet its own endangered 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.510
 believes works well 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.060
 There are certain positions where people 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.700
 you may be up there you are there 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.310
 below and behind all the others please 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.820
 the machine will be on her 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.820
 security 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.479
 whether it's one or the other situation 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.250
 was it really that was somehow none 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.290
 built decoration but that one 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.270
 functioning wood giant and that is 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.740
 We have sent tree trunks under 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 and there was a point about it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.610
 wanted to reach 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 and fortunately did not put the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.060
 tree together so straight into this 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.030
 the direction has broken out 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.590
 daguerreotype camera was not in the book 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.670
 in the novel it was very restrained but 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.149
 was then easy to Mahler 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.649
 But where is the script writer that 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.069
 The photographically developed something 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.649
 makes us work much better too 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.510
 and these cameras are relative 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.980
 rare and actually made are the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.569
 are never in the movie serves as with 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.660
 This is actually one of our films 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.430
 small textbook for future slopes 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.790
 So this is made from the sketch of 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.620
 photos and what's next to your movie 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.690
 that historically and technically absolute 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.370
 correct and that is actually already 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.760
 Nice thing because there is no film 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.230
 I think the guy is as 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.720
 so this is for the main actor 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.959
 me is that one red is still open it is 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.959
 very nice
