00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.440
 all talk about each recipe is 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.690
 inspired a man in a man in a 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.220
 name in particular in a name martín 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.820
 it was a particular name of a recipe 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.710
 most famous of traditional code is the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.810
 version point out the strawberry version goes 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.330

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.280
 seeing in this way 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.140
 10 and then the whole parade comes there 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.930
 I change the ingredient and we're going to 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 add the ham that passes the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.330

 which is a way also to integrate 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.870
 protein and after that we go for 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.870
 much more flavors that we are going to have here 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.450

 chili cuaresmeño of the ies and while this 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.040
 It's a good time to get to know the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.800

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.870

 our recipe is so because we can 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.930
 have added nice plastic but 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.810
 in this way we decided to give it a 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.950
 different way of presenting it seems to you 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.540

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.820
 terrific and now another element 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.550
 important what I did previously 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.500
 It was also frying our piece of 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.780
 this way we add the bacon to 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.640

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.000
 the cream we also go for mayonnaise 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.310

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.800
 of nogada is like a non-high species 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.040
 that you can leave more because add 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.930
 a pinch of garlic powder that garlic in 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.760
 dust will allow me to give it another touch 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.610

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.970
 coriander of 10 add to our 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.380
 recipe and to give it a different tone 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.329
 enough is not vital since tablet or 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.190
 you expected it, that's why the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.510
 Nogada feels exactly but only 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.970
 in the nogada because we are adding 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.340

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.710
 shape will be a recipe with this touch and 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.620

 so let's have our list now 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.349

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.849
 until this we practically are 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.590
