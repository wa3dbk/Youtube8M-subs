00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello very good at 39 and we are in a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.049
 We are in the minicop and we are going to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 continue where we left it in the video 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.250
 previous and now I will tell you what has 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.170
 passed another typical anecdote of my 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.170
 videos and the shit of the emulator 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.119
 good to tell you what happened to me 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.380
 this video when I went to record 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.810
 it turns out that fado fraps good I decided 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.060
 record with the emulator but this always 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.280
 It gives me quite a problem with the subject of 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.140
 transfer pass so it gave me failure 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.870
 had to start the cup again 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.960
 whole ago the medal stamp 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.620
 mantaro and that's that what's that for 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 because he is wearing a beret 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.400
 karman from today to djs chapman der in 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.850
 session enters cabin let's do the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:02.520
 south let's finish this dj 30 due 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.930
 that is obviously faster than a 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.560
 Turtle tortoise is normal in all 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.180
 the world and start with 7 life very well 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.170
 very well 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.170
 now with surf 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.909
 and that's how a level 25 school 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.830
 You can with an under charme more 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.360
 risk too much and now I 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.360
 risked a lot to kill 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.690
 with this green touch pokemon you are not 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.840
 mine you are phosphorito had a night 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.840
 triumphal 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:45.130
 it has not been critical 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:50.910
 I did not stop like I do not know why because 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.910
 Friend 25 health points is very smart 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.370
 but I do not want you to kill me and you're going to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.790
 kill I want him to kill me passed massa me 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.790
 you are going to kill 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.970
 because it's faster than me 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.770
 because it already be written and super good 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.120
 because the other continues can not be the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.800
 South can not be psychic or what happens 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.390
 is that a little silly because it has 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:23.020
 pretty special or no no no no no no 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.790
 again the lost combat can be 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.740
 that can be so much will cost me this 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.850
 shit 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.850
 my mother 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.990
 another lost combat not 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.240
 do not 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.440
 this time left alone with one to see if a 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.190
 the third one is the winner because we 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.190
 we are not continuing 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.620
 fucking fat you 're going to perform 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.770
 better luck 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.860
 damn it may not be safe if 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.650
 coat 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.420
 There will be something going on to paralyze me 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.870
 I know to see what it takes now to see if 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.670
 we can put is that we are going 11 yes 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.950
 sir do not touch me do not touch me 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.210
 it seems to look like a puppet 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.160
 welcome by ropes help her 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.640
 ok well it is difficult what we are going to 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.220
 do now 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.220
 earthquake that is not critical by gods 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.470
 and it can not be can not be can not be 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.950
 Y 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.959
 squirt the state last damn 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.209
 old we have eaten three continuous 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.099
 connections let's see let's see if the 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.499
 nano and who he starts to be with 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.770
 we with ip con fi will see who we 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.020
 pulls out 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.730
 the charm under this double edge 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.920
 I guess yes faster even though he is 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:22.090
 39 fastest 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.030
 shit shit shit shit 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.810
 shit reflex to see if we hold the 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.060
 attack at least 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.340
 this is crap the truth is that not to 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.620
 critical blow over but what the fuck is 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.389
 this messing up these pokemon bring or 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.910
 is not even an attack let me access that is 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.280
 this 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.450
 what the fuck this shit happens here 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.910
 because I like in life could have 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.340
 done digging is not going to see me 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.230
 comes seismic movement ok ok if we go 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.640
 to die if we do not care if we go to 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.289
 be slower than any other pokemon 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.629
 what are you doing we are dead 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.550
 we are dead and nothing else we have 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.259
 killed one of the pokÃ©mon or laws has us 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.620
 We killed two this this will not 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.590
 make two dead 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.950
 for time speaks is faster than me if 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.770
 kind bye 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.630
 is worth with nothing else that I have left is 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.470
 critical all the time but what the fuck of 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.470
 luck comes not 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.960
 you are seeing my already desperate 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.289
 because this is to see it by the 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.289
 field 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.160
 because it would be enough to paralyze my fixed 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.630
 thunder but good as it is going to be a 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.240
 naturally I who took him five 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.580
 levels 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.940
 but five levels as it attacks one hour 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.750
 before me I at level 30 and the level 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.750
 25 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.969
 it's not that I do not believe that more or less 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:49.080
 bad it's not critical that weird mother of mine that 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:53.000
 Kills me in one fell swoop again 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.000
 I hate thunder waves 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.230
 this is not going to be shit because 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.550
 hold the special we have already lost 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.889
 again we have already lost again 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.560
 model 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.020
 my mother I shit on the wta and on the 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.669
 words and in the palaces and in the 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.219
 spoons with which they eat to eat 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.219
 a good piece of shit you 'll know 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.840
 applause not applause for this speech 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.840
 shitty 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.400
 what do I do in all gear and now that if 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.499
 I do not have to continue, I do not want to go back 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.499
 to start it is not fair 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.809
 because it has a lot of style 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.650
 and this is like as I lost another 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.840
 I appreciate how I work in this 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:55.539
 Really, I do not believe it, do not tell me 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.539
 I do not think so 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.789
 how am I going to kill that shit now with 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:04.419
 thunder wave if going to attack is attacker is 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.419
 that up picasso 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.100
 again the shit up the tournament 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.900
 I do not feel like fighting again 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.900
 had because I did not know 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.480
 and
