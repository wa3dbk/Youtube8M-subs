smartest thing in the world to me but
what<00:03:36.790> an<00:03:36.910> interesting<00:03:37.120> concept<00:03:37.570> I<00:03:38.290> mean<00:03:38.860> it's

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
what an interesting concept I mean it's

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.360 
what an interesting concept I mean it's
racist<00:03:40.329> isn't<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.320> because<00:03:41.860> obviously

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
racist isn't it because obviously

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.300 
racist isn't it because obviously
they're<00:03:43.209> supposed<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.780> be<00:03:43.900> black<00:03:44.140> or<00:03:44.470> maybe

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
they're supposed to be black or maybe

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.060 
they're supposed to be black or maybe
they're<00:03:45.579> just<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:46.049> take<00:03:47.049> on<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.440> particular

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
they're just a take on a particular

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.740 
they're just a take on a particular
subset<00:03:48.820> of<00:03:48.850> culture<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:50.049> has<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.340> past

subset of culture that has in the past
decade<00:03:52.750> or<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.049> r<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.650> enough<00:03:53.980> regardless<00:03:54.790> of

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
decade or so r is enough regardless of

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.449 
decade or so r is enough regardless of
race<00:03:55.120> as<00:03:55.390> i<00:03:55.570> said<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.560> majority<00:03:56.709> of<00:03:57.220> the

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
than going well this is a representative

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.270 
than going well this is a representative
culture<00:04:46.320> they<00:04:47.320> go<00:04:47.470> oh<00:04:47.680> this<00:04:48.130> is

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
culture they go oh this is

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.930 
culture they go oh this is
representation<00:04:48.699> of<00:04:49.090> race<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.860> still<00:04:51.610> can't

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
representation of race so I still can't

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.029 
representation of race so I still can't
get<00:04:52.060> my<00:04:52.120> head<00:04:52.389> around<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.690> idea<00:04:52.750> that<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.740> see

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
get my head around the idea that you see

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.100 
get my head around the idea that you see
