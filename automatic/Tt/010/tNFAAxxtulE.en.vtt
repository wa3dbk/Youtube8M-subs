00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
thread that you can see here now you may

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.929 
thread that you can see here now you may
be<00:00:27.900> wondering<00:00:28.320> why<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.590> using<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.250> J<00:00:29.670> hook

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
be wondering why I'm using the J hook

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.069 
be wondering why I'm using the J hook
buckle<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.489> standard<00:00:33.390> buckle<00:00:33.809> here

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
buckle and not this standard buckle here

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.590 
buckle and not this standard buckle here
now<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.800> reason<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.300> try<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
now the reason is is that if I try to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.250 
now the reason is is that if I try to
put<00:00:36.809> these<00:00:36.989> two<00:00:37.200> together<00:00:39.050> show<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.110> that

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
put these two together show you that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.000 
put these two together show you that
they<00:00:43.260> don't<00:00:43.440> line<00:00:43.800> up

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
they don't line up

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
they don't line up
so<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> can't<00:00:48.600> line

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
so if you can see that so I can't line

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.619 
so if you can see that so I can't line
these<00:00:49.020> two<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.520> plastic<00:00:50.820> pockets<00:00:51.480> in

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
these two up as this plastic pockets in

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.209 
these two up as this plastic pockets in
the<00:00:51.690> way<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.230> obviously<00:00:52.469> I'll<00:00:52.800> comp<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the way and obviously I'll comp at the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.830 
the way and obviously I'll comp at the
thumb<00:00:53.430> screw<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.210> whereas<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:56.570> use<00:00:57.570> this

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
thumb screw on it whereas if I use this

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
thumb screw on it whereas if I use this
the<00:00:58.350> J<00:00:58.739> hook<00:00:58.980> mount<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.550> put<00:00:59.579> them<00:00:59.789> together

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the J hook mount and put them together

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.430 
the J hook mount and put them together
as<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> top<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.350> they

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
as you can see at the top here they

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.080 
as you can see at the top here they
they're<00:01:01.770> very<00:01:01.920> similar<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.930> these<00:01:03.930> two<00:01:05.090> just

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
they're very similar and these two just

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.130 
they're very similar and these two just
put<00:01:06.299> them<00:01:06.420> together<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:08.960> if<00:01:09.960> you're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
put them together like that if you're

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.609 
put them together like that if you're
sure<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:12.260> they<00:01:13.260> line<00:01:13.439> up

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
sure you can see that they line up

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.320 
sure you can see that they line up
perfectly<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.670> put<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> thumb<00:01:15.090> screw

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
perfectly so I can put the thumb screw

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
perfectly so I can put the thumb screw
through<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.110> tighten<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:18.000> once

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
through this and tighten it up now once

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.910 
through this and tighten it up now once
you've<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.540> these<00:01:18.750> two<00:01:18.990> together<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.500> this

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you've put these two together like this

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.359 
you've put these two together like this
but<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.240> nut<00:01:21.810> back<00:01:22.110> into<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:22.710> side<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.040> this

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
but the nut back into one side of this

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
but the nut back into one side of this
and<00:01:23.670> now<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.900> problem<00:01:25.170> you're<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> find

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
long one on the short one they are not

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.390 
long one on the short one they are not
long<00:01:31.170> enough<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> get<00:01:31.740> through<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> nap

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
long enough to get through to the nap

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
long enough to get through to the nap
can<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.869> long<00:01:34.020> one

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
can you see that this is the long one

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.670 
can you see that this is the long one
and<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> short<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.960> now<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.380> need<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

do is separate the plastic part from the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.050 
do is separate the plastic part from the
metal<00:01:40.979> thread<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.460> I've<00:01:41.610> already<00:01:41.790> done<00:01:42.030> here

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
metal thread like I've already done here

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.109 
metal thread like I've already done here
now<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> need<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.710> take<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.369> shorter

now you need to do is take the shorter
plastic<00:01:45.960> part<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.530> put<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.610> longer

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
plastic part and put it on to the longer

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.300 
plastic part and put it on to the longer
thumb<00:01:48.240> screws<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.320> put<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
thumb screws for it like that put that

thumb screws for it like that put that
on<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.939> now<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.049> that

on there and now as you can see that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
on there and now as you can see that
will<00:01:52.530> go<00:01:52.680> all<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.860> way<00:01:52.890> through<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.820> it's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
will go all the way through but it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.330 
will go all the way through but it's
just<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.390> little<00:01:54.659> too<00:01:54.780> long<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.130> where

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
just a little too long now this is where
