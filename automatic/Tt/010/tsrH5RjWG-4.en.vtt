00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.125
 The raised raise is called that because we are going to lift a mesh that is below. 

00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:14.173
 Specifically, it is a mesh that is under the rank that we are doing. 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.098
 Remember that, it looks like nothing but it is important. 

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:24.941
 She can lean to the right or to the left. 

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:29.164
 I'm going to make one on the right that leans to the right, and one on the left that leans to the left, 

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:36.303
 2 meshes edge, that is to say we do not touch those 2 meshes, nor to those. 

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:41.635
 I'll do it at the beginning of rank, just after the first two stitches, 

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:44.060
 and at the end of rank, just before the last 2. 

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:47.882
 I do not touch the first 2 meshes. 

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.853
 Easy to remember: we make the increase that leans to the right with the right needle. 

00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:04.380
 We'll go get the mesh that is under the rank that we are doing. 

00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:10.517
 On the current rank the stitch is purple, the one just below is green. 

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:17.359
 I lift it by taking it from behind and I go back on the needle. 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.592
 And I knit it nominally. 

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.226
 I stop there because we can also do a second way: 

00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:32.557
 we can knit directly in, that is to say that I dive into the mesh, 

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:40.300
 Not below, otherwise it's a double stitch, but right next to it and I slip my needle in it. 

00:01:42.613 --> 00:01:46.033
 It is not always possible, and if it is possible it is good. 

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:49.050
 I knit it, and I continue. 

00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:57.905
 I go to the end of the row and I stop at 2 ends. 

00:02:00.437 --> 00:02:03.154
 I stop even there, because what is there a small important thing: 

00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:10.196
 I'm going to make the increase between this purple mesh and this one 

00:02:11.992 --> 00:02:16.417
 by going to lift the blue mesh. We do not lose sight of it. 

00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:22.956
 As she goes to the left, I do it with the left needle. 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.576
 First you have to knit that knit. 

00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:32.210
 I said I was going to lift the blue mesh, 

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:35.028
 and it's not exactly the one under the needle. 

00:02:35.793 --> 00:02:41.527
 The rank I'm doing: here (on the needle) and on that side, it is there (under the needle). 

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:48.069
 It is not finished, it is not because it is knitted (in part) that it is finished. 

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:52.294
 The mesh below is the blue mesh. 

00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:56.015
 You have to think that when you make a raised raise on the left, 

00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:02.153
 we go down one notch with respect to the needle. 

00:03:08.811 --> 00:03:17.057
 I dive in from behind, I go back, I knit by the back strand. 

00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:35.772
 If we look closely, we have along the increase of species of large features. 

00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:42.413
 We can compare with ... 

00:03:46.238 --> 00:03:50.161
 ... this is always 2 stitches away, 

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:55.087
 on the right by making a raised raise on the left but it pushes the meshes to the right, 

00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:03.439
 and inversely on the left a raise raised to the right which pushes the edge to the left. 

00:04:11.388 --> 00:04:16.619
 Right leans left, left leans right, 3 meshes edge this time. 

00:04:19.638 --> 00:04:22.052
 What I find more clear. 

00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:32.915
 This one is interesting: around 2 central meshes, marked here, 

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:44.683
 on the right, it leans to the left and pushes the links from right to right, 

00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:48.004
 on the left it leans to the right. 

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:52.336
 It's interesting because it gives the impression that there is in the middle 3 inverted stitches. 

00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:58.676
 When in fact not at all, I did not return anything. 

00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:08.634
 I do not really like the "right leans right, left leans left", 

00:05:09.138 --> 00:05:11.650
 it leaves me with an impression of confusion, 

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.075
 always around 2 central meshes, not marked but which are well there. 

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:26.044
 Around 3 center stitches, right leans right, left leans left. 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.883
 It's better. It still leaves me an impression of confusion, to see.
