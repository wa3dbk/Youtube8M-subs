00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.040
 the coin of god is back to it again and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.380
 what i want to say 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 today's map today's house 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.800
 sent denis lapitsky well i surely 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.609
 before it looked specifically what is it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.980
 Generally for the house he is a version he 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.710
 did not write i played on i trust the screen 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.800
 versions now 174 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.780
 well, just because something has darkened dramatically 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.910
 let's go to bed 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.079
 in one rain it will pass all very 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.620
 sad and well, uhty as fun 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:49.020
 it turned out actually i'm 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.170
 textures seemed horrified in general I donâ€™t 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.789
 I know guys like you, but not so much 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.309
 noteworthy this house first is 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.850
 like a two-story building it is very similar to 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.860
 know on such a kind of hotel in which 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.140
 just ordinary visitors who live 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.790
 take for themselves there I don't know how they are 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.530
 are called 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.720
 the most ordinary holiday homes here 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.119
 absolutely the same take houses only 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.850
 here still take here at the line still 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.830
 the second one does the same and it is very 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.250
 it looks like she's just such a decorative 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.000
 house 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.100
 inside it is not very extensive in principle 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.310
 Naturally can be done and wider 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.369
 but by the way mother is little light just here I am 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.409
 can't this same horror it and let me 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.960
 more light now i'm pouring lava here 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.230
 to have more light so no i 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.900
 I did something wrong now 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.550
 now we take it so sorry it 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.720
 me in to 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.300
 a little bit not calculated but for the win and 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.480
 more light became more light needed 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.600
 guys need more light oh well me 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.940
 like it here is real like here 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.670
 slept went went there I don't know what I was doing 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.460
 but this is a purely decorative house well 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 that he is too small in my opinion 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.460
 opinion though i think it would be outside 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.070
 he would no longer look so 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.200
 sorry to my great regret 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.600
 so for the appearance I will leave 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.870
 probably vosmerochku and do not talk 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.150
 Oh, this is a regular box. 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.240
 why it seems to me a little bit 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.150
 original compared to there I do not know with 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.520
 what is it you are not that original but me 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.460
 I really like it 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.770
 this is the form of the house but it is not for the game 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.070
 This is just where on the server such at home 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.660
 stick there I don't know i know what to eat 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.760
 some servers that sell at home 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.000
 as well they can do type 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.770
 hotels such mini or one person 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.959
 selling one house is not important in general 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.750
 also we look here and here 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.570
 firms here and gilts here have chickens 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.090
 here for them there is water there is weed that 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.310
 you can pinch and there is a pool chic 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.410
 let's go take yourself jump 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.700
 jump into this very pool chick and 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.310
 let's see what it is 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.050
 jump into the pool chick by the way i dont 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.410
 I know how you like sid card 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.800

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.540
 have vegetables masterfully imagine it 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.570

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.100

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.740
 I'll write you here what is the world 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.290
 because you never know who likes it 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.090
 what was generated here maybe i 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.640
 I will also use later 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.100

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.170

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.600
 if someone likes me personally I like 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.430
 the hills turned out very nicely here and 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.830
 near the jungle all very nicely give 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.400
 let's go in from see maybe there that 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.070
 that is, and such for us for me for you 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.440
 for us are made to see what 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.810
 man really tried so well all i 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.300
 see already with the man really tried not 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.480
 no portal is just an ordinary portal to hell 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.060
 nowhere leading though i remember alone 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.320
 the girl made a house in the portal 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.970
 quartz in my opinion what are you guys 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.480
 overall impression overall impression 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.240
 Likely on seven well honestly let's 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.470
 we will be on semerochku now of course but 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.989
 on put 20 but guys let's sort 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.790
 fair 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.280
 man tried man built 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.530
 a man spread a pig by the way most likely 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.500
 This card with the most common vanilla 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.740
 since here I was already in my pants 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.870
 that is, here in the armor I had a pickaxe 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.240
 have though maybe a question created 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.830
 impressions are likely to likely so 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.360
 that's the principle let's see 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.580
 that there are chests there is nothing there 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.980
 no, but usually the stoves are where he is 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.410
 simply created 4 that plays as if there 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.830
 water still care upstairs is we not seen 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.740
 well, let's see 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.220
 so there is nothing special about 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.730
 that's how you see here yes created 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.670
 impression of warmth lives well on the very 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.800
 I really do not know I like capaciously because 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.410
