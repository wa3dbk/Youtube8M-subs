00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
that's pretty much the whole video but

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749 
that's pretty much the whole video but
as<00:01:55.229> far<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.770> song<00:01:56.039> and<00:01:56.369> how<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> came

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
together I was expecting a little bit

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.770 
together I was expecting a little bit
more<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:59.369> because<00:01:59.520> her<00:01:59.759> last<00:02:00.090> videos<00:02:00.539> have

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
more just because her last videos have

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.340 
more just because her last videos have
been<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.429> artistic<00:02:02.429> and<00:02:02.789> cute<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.810> dance<00:02:04.020> feel

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
been so artistic and cute and dance feel

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.810

a<00:02:04.380> lot<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.740> people<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.070> been<00:02:05.220> saying<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
a lot of people have been saying that it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
a lot of people have been saying that it
was<00:02:05.939> similar<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.329> Beyonce's<00:02:06.990> countdown<00:02:07.590> video

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
was similar to Beyonce's countdown video

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.180 
was similar to Beyonce's countdown video
I<00:02:08.280> did<00:02:08.849> think<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.269> that<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.920> so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
I did think of that but they are so

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.920 
I did think of that but they are so
different<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.940> didn't<00:02:12.330> even<00:02:12.599> really

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930

think<00:02:12.959> about<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.620> until<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:14.160> end<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.640> I'm

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
think about it until the end and I'm

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.640 
think about it until the end and I'm
glad<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.630> didn't<00:02:16.049> it<00:02:16.140> didn't<00:02:16.410> give<00:02:16.500> me<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
glad that I didn't it didn't give me a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.530 
glad that I didn't it didn't give me a
lot<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.860> Beyonce<00:02:17.489> tease<00:02:17.760> they<00:02:18.120> are<00:02:18.269> totally
