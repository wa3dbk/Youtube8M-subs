00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.440 
because we're gonna be doing some
indirect<00:02:07.939> cooking

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
indirect cooking

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.309 
indirect cooking
the<00:02:08.569> grill<00:02:08.810> hot<00:02:09.289> charcoal<00:02:09.979> on<00:02:10.160> one<00:02:10.399> side<00:02:11.319> now

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
the grill hot charcoal on one side now

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.809 
the grill hot charcoal on one side now
again<00:02:12.680> why<00:02:12.980> are<00:02:13.010> we<00:02:13.220> doing<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.760> way

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
again why are we doing it this way

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.720 
again why are we doing it this way
because<00:02:14.780> chicken<00:02:15.319> wings<00:02:15.620> come<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.370> three

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
because chicken wings come in three

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.970 
because chicken wings come in three
segments<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.540> each<00:02:18.140> segment<00:02:18.410> cooks

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
segments and each segment cooks

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.220 
segments and each segment cooks
differently<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:20.300> all<00:02:20.480> know<00:02:20.690> about<00:02:20.840> that

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
differently you all know about that

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.619 
differently you all know about that
right<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:22.489> get<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.730> chicken<00:02:23.030> wing<00:02:23.300> cooked

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
right and to get a chicken wing cooked

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:24.130 
right and to get a chicken wing cooked
right

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
right

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.750 
right
it<00:02:24.410> means<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.769> almost<00:02:24.950> have<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.220> cook<00:02:25.489> each

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
it means you almost have to cook each

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.390 
it means you almost have to cook each
section<00:02:26.450> separately<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.980> get<00:02:28.160> around

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
section separately but you get around

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.030 
section separately but you get around
that<00:02:28.580> by<00:02:28.880> doing<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.300> this<00:02:29.480> way<00:02:30.010> when<00:02:31.010> I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
that by doing it this way when I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.949 
that by doing it this way when I
literally<00:02:31.550> trap<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.180> moisture<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.810> these

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
literally trap the moisture in these

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.020 
literally trap the moisture in these
wings<00:02:33.349> we're<00:02:34.340> going<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.519> run<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> low

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
wings we're going to run a low

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.890 
wings we're going to run a low
temperature<00:02:35.540> maybe<00:02:36.260> about<00:02:37.450> 275<00:02:38.450> degrees

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
temperature maybe about 275 degrees

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.740 
temperature maybe about 275 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:40.340> gonna<00:02:40.580> take<00:02:40.880> about<00:02:41.420> two

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
Fahrenheit it's gonna take about two

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.539 
Fahrenheit it's gonna take about two
