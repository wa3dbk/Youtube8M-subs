00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello everybody you need to hear from 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.630
 today I'm here so once again 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.750
 back on day 5 of pc on the floor for you guys 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.500
 but the way this is expensive is this way here 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.500
 basically modifies is the bmx bike zinha 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.250
 nor the bike so loved of him gta san 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.769
 Andreas 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.660
 finally it alters from the mega speed 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.420
 say so or change much 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.210
 speed of the bike is much faster and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.070
 everything can give me these mega leaps well 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.649
 little exciting to make a maneuver 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 cool started half so do not know 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.950
 do a lot of cool and itaú maneuver know 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 there understood 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.110
 but who knows, not even the people who stain and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.899
 maneuvers everything goes to make a video 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.450
 cool, that way, anyway, it's the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.020
 People change a file on their own 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.379
 game is not type paste an application and 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.050
 this is not so everything will in case change 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.780
 even with the open 41 program file 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.460
 play and gave a touch of it I replaced such and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.070
 obviously copies the files 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.979
 before doing this like I did here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.479
 I installed one that was there and it was expensive. 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.430
 because I am through to the cloud is not given to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.799
 realizing Gaddafi may be doing a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.470
 business that nobody here is this beast and you 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.850
 made to want to jump again but at last 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.970
 it worked out 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.049
 it worked out and it did not work, it's not a bug 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.240
 papier trim 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.610
 our weapon can not be training but 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.220
 finally give up crazy maneuver face 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 I TV is also that infinite life 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.930
 because I did not see it otherwise 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.729
 already because even when I fell such 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.740
 I 'm not in the mood for breaking my face. 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.560
 But anyway our wife is coming to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 People, then, oh, you even do cool maneuvers here. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.619

 It's cool here, why do not you think about it? 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.909

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.580
 around and the mega speed around 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.380
 things like that is leaving more realistic 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.720
 I do not know what I'm going to do. 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.440

 had these smaller houses and such and such 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.610
 You can show it better, these are good hills. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.380

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.850

 nowadays the latest reviews but 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.230
 Anyway, it 's a few years ago when I 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.780
 I really like the kind of championship. 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:55.520
 You know it still shows a nice kid but 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.370
 anyway it 's good here is in the world and frost and 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.440
 Strip said there what I want to call because 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.900

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.600

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.420
 little thing that I accelerate she goes with 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.540
 The woman knows she has our mother. 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.890

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.970

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.850
 The liraa is kind of the worst the hour of the game does not 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:27.080
 it seems like never and hands need like 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:33.530
 You know or record a video where it is not imf 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:36.830
 Do not look at the mission. 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.070

 motta is very high in morale and speaking me 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.280
 I like assisted and I do not know until 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:58.430
 that they define themselves faces and soon I heard myself 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.460
 He gave hard was it not but think well 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.890
 logo with these guys is that makes these 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.350
 bike and skateboarding maneuvers 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.900
 I think it's not very exciting and it's crazy. 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.390
 Ok let's have a jump here in the world. 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.790
 It's crazy to do that jump. 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.800
 including this one in the world is expensive and 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.660
 so fall because I'm very, very 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.070
 ability to video only face but 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.140
 This is what I do not want to extend. 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.390
 I really like this video because, right, I just want to 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.260
 show yourself is a little 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.760
 so the module 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.290
 but that's all I hope you have 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.480
 Did you like the video of that one? 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.300
 assessment also leaves a comment 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.500
 yes 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.000
 If you want I can make a video. 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.340
 showing the installation will have a 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.470
 a little different from other furniture 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.120
 who is leaving there for gta5 right? 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.220
 we really change the files of the 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.650
 game but anyway that's what lets 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.690
 evaluation there will be enrolled in the channel 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.180
 which always has modes here from gta 5 to 11 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:51.710
