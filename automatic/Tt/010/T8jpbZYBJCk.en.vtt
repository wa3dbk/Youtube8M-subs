00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.930
 moment that I saw that for me I do not understand that it would not stop when 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.170
 I wanted 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.930
 the despair was so much 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.550
 what I did I left in search of the drug there I started to think that it is there - 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.830
 They say there's no solution, it's just a lost case. I'm a lost case. 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.439
 so come on 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.640
 at the time of the beginning 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.780
 of self drugs after marijuana cigarette successively to your family 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.830
 has an important role for you either or has dragged 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.140
 this is another point 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.470
 who often even men played the canopy using their parents but in fact 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.720
 his parents until the time they formed in all this 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.840
 and you wanted 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.060
 who is alone whether or not it was true or not 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.980
 7 I wanted to pay to see what they said right. 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.560
 my mother 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.030
 My parents tired of alerting me 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.120
 about why I was running 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.460
 Terex saw that 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.390
 Luis himself commented Ana 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.170
 too much rain and do not want to see and when they saw it they tried to alert me 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.389
 and they will tell you that you did not want to give a workshop 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.760
 I worked 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.210
 so my family played an important role 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.390
 I believe in myself but they will believe 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.030
 they still believed that you could leave home 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.240
 will continue to have that I could leave this much that my mother came to 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.330
 seek help 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.490
 arrived for help in mutual aid groups 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.560
 then day dies of manager of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.650
 said that you do not even talk 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.090
 natalie 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.600
 a certain point I arrived and I told her 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 because she is attending these groups if she had no problem 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.070
 indicator 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.690
 You thought there was no problem and I thought there was no problem. 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.189
 it is the negation as it comments 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.359
 in this the denial is not only of the parents but that's it lucena until saying is that 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:44.579
 the disease actually 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.800
 she is a collective of the family as a whole 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.600
 is not restricted to the chemical dependent or is the whole family of s almost 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.520
 is not making use of the drug 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 as dependent chemical so sick is more than support is not the key 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.450
 because the patient himself in the submission and I think he 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.369
 has nothing to do with the list are cup 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.490
 the drama of the cause of this thousands know that it is coming the end of the well 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.249
 have so pulled 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.389
 is extremely complicated and often contribute to the team 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.409
 have families that still 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.489
 give money he got to a point where they start to demand they start a 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.269
 they start doing 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.649
 studies and 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.449
 increase manipulate 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:26.839
 have families 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.269
 that she continued 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.269
 Indian has families coming 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:37.059
 not expose the child does not see that he himself who favor the talat factory 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.869
 while France already spoke looking here 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.979
 a question that arose just days 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.909
 Your father and what are you going to look for? 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.980
 how open it tells that the child is dependent chemist 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.860
 recommend domains if exposed at the time of buying the drug he will buy himself 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.669
 drug and ask if you end up encouraging were to happen 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.669
 he is exposing himself exposes the eldest son is supposed 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.619
 it's not people usually say that it would not close 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.079
 the sisnema 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.589
 is the same disease is the same as sakhir accounts and for sure 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.169
 yes the attempt to control itself try can control each pending 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.909
 chemist has 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.099
 without regard to drug use 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.739
 and he ends up having it because otherwise I go as I'm going to buy drugs for him 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.860
 because we signed in house at home he protected the animals allows 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:27.769
 think 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.769
 we never lied that blood was next door 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.029
 a young couple from outside the house 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.289
 can consume what the father was against what the father was not 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.879
 with the father he will also buy will continue 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.189
 What does this country have to do? 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.419
 because it has reached this level it is opportune 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.419
 and hospitalization 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.679
 the hospitalization of the 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:02.499
 Do you believe that in some cases we 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:06.769
 but the only way to get the child out of the well and really 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:07.849
 class 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.150
 to taste 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.319
 force in many cases without 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.399
 that leaves the door 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.840
 by the very will of the chemical dependent 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.049
 It's as it is commented often it does not give time because so 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.240
 is the desperation is so great that it will try to consume more and more 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.460
 try to kill myself. 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.279
 And there's no way, so I'd rather die. 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:33.519
 in that continue on this level alas even so who the boy once to be 

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.519
 without intervention. 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.719
 a reporter from the agency heavy compulsory hospitalization 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.509
 for the person has no possibility of life this happens 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.389
 often with people who even got to lose everything really well 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.360
 It is on the street 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.300
 on account of drugs, it is only necessary to lose life in many cases. 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.559
 person only succeed 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.580
 a request for help but this is not always possible 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:04.159
 then the possibility of hospitalization may be made 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.819
 the worst in conditions to recover so and opted for absolutely everything 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.680
 did you know 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.990
 kind of a deal with the boys mário pt all the irish people she trusts in 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.470
 You, but do not make it ugly for you to see São Paulo and Rio. 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.580
 I have here today 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.809
 What do you do in the project? 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:25.139
 in an hour and 25 minutes 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.039
 the service must be said 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.939
 The port always has an excuse. 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.979
 always has since 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.069
 she lives 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.339
 with this delay 30 days south toffoli 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:40.239
 then you have to wait 30 days later when it arrives on the 40th day the norm 

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:44.029
 since last week on a drink an example is the question of Ceylon ia 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.029
 fall there always win your football 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.360
 and then we'll try something 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.330
 of the other trying another and always the denial as the cell commented them 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.070
 I do not want to take on one of the cases 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.289
 no after much talk after much 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.629
 there was awareness that 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.150
 I would accept an eternal 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.169
 only here in opera clinic 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.169
 walking clinic 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.430
 what works from 10am sometimes paulo 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.210
 it works who has a very clear conscience 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.759
 and who really is of initial rupture of 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.080
 the people who need your help and it will be important 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.770
 we did it voluntarily and want to do it 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.439
 but with awareness 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.339
 some cases most of the claim claim is that it will gain from 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:34.330
 Christmas 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
 at the time he was in need of luck 

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:42.439
 the artist was sure that it would not be because at all times that 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:47.219
 I would have been talking 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.159
 discovers that his children know 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.159
 election is a complicated thing you know 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.229
 Why you? 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.360
 first warnings thereafter of 3 three years after two three years 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.490
 I believe you have Alex 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.490
 for you to have the conscience 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.680
 I would say that he 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:13.889
 of the month in six months 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:15.749
 where the consciousness 

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:17.430
 in qualifying climates 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.449
 to be able to still 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.889
 I still denied until the moment I arrived I had already defined 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.949
 the initiative after we talked to the wife, we talked 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.119
 the shanghai expo 

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:35.800
 involves a girlfriend girlfriend as well which was not the first sign 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.919
 I was not dependent 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.919
 Then he also talked via ivelise 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.580
 and I'm the type of guy
