orbit around the Sun is an ellipse

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.210

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
basically that means an oval with a Sun

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.850 
basically that means an oval with a Sun

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.199 
offset from the center of the ellipse
does<00:03:55.860> this<00:03:56.010> mean<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.250> we<00:03:56.519> have<00:03:56.700> summer<00:03:57.000> when

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
does this mean that we have summer when

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.640 
does this mean that we have summer when
the<00:03:57.330> earth<00:03:57.450> is<00:03:57.660> closest<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.290> Sun<00:03:58.500> and

the earth is closest to the Sun and

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.500

winter when the earth is farthest from
the<00:04:00.660> Sun<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.920> surprising<00:04:02.489> fact<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
the Sun the surprising fact is that the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.180 
the Sun the surprising fact is that the

distance from the earth to the Sun has

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.800 
distance from the earth to the Sun has
absolutely<00:04:05.790> nothing<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.330> do<00:04:06.570> with<00:04:06.720> the

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
absolutely nothing to do with the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.170 
absolutely nothing to do with the
