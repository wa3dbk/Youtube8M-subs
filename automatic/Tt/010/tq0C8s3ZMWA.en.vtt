we've got the death card here but the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.719 
we've got the death card here but the
fun<00:01:04.080> thing<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.769> Tarot<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.489> it's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
fun thing about the Tarot is that it's

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.420 
fun thing about the Tarot is that it's
not<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.330> that's<00:01:07.260> scary<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
not and that's scary and it's not that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.250 
not and that's scary and it's not that
dramatic<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.390> people<00:01:09.600> who<00:01:09.930> aren't

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
dramatic and I think people who aren't

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.649 
dramatic and I think people who aren't
familiar<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.010> cards<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.939> often<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
familiar with the cards can often be a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.740 
familiar with the cards can often be a
little<00:01:12.900> bit<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.119> hesitant<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.299> some<00:01:15.659> of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
little bit and hesitant about some of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.609 
little bit and hesitant about some of
the<00:01:15.869> images<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.979> um<00:01:17.900> it<00:01:18.900> comes<00:01:19.170> from<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> lack

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the images but um it comes from a lack

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.249 
the images but um it comes from a lack
of<00:01:19.759> knowing<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.210> once<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.840> become
