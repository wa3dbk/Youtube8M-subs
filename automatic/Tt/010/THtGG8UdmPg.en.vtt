00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.120
 completely out you have to look at me 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.370
 am going to see today how i like this chai tea 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.560
 and not know other people 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.720
 wants you there is a seed 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.360
 a kind of tea and milk 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.030
 mixed say but it is already making parts 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.220
 you with the framework in an incredibly tasty them 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.390
 of the starbucks with the costa took of 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.460
 stores like that 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.260
 my homie version and a bit easier 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.410
 version he sometimes I can make different 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.789
 and maybe not so good but 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.010
 full of hope racing version is fine too 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.680
 doing is very easy to make i am 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.110
 very tasty themselves and store them 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.340
 to start right away for against ballin 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.770
 weak I use cardamom and as one 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.540
 that the Porsche artist looks like this 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:55.899
 kiko use cinnamon sticks or 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.899
 cinnamon powder clove and ginger powder 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.340
 I do everything in 7 so the tea 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.090
 with them cardamom with the clove with the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.090
 ginger 

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:08.630
 That gets a bit confused by you 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.789
 can try a little to your taste 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.259
 do take care of it, say 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.039
 the predominant is the must 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.039
 really be the most 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.910
 then you milk it in a glass 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.930
 and the very fastest way is in the 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.610
 to do microwave 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.220
 cooking but the microwave is just what 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.530
 faster until I made you do say 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.390
 you with the herbs and the t 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.310
 in your milking last few minutes 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.690
 so she can withdraw that I did 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.220
 can actually mix in a milk foam 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.720
 and with that ready but once 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.700
 under pressure if you do not froth 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.290
 just like me what you do the mixture that 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.510
 put a sign in a jar that is closed 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.070
 come from the sham jar or jar 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.900
 of pickle or something 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.570
 you don't completely fill it with it 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.110
 mixture and goes to a mix and pay attention 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.210
 but on 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.750
 now you just get a kind 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.850
 milk foam and then you get this real one 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.680
 super handy trick very funny 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.540
 it works very well large glass 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.190
