00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.190
 hello I am pulling one from you 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.870
 Volunteer I've lived recently 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.820
 posted on facebook that i just 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.750
 eat meat once a week White 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.980
 and once red meat eat that 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.480
 contribution to many people seen 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.099
 Many have been interested 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.500
 and many agreed 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.269
 In the end, of course, came in the course of 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.400
 Discussion is a little bit the question 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.840
 how do you then think your ace needs 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.190
 is it even possible that 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.780
 to cover protein requirements 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.140
 if you only go twice a week 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.280
 Meat is I find twice in the 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.350
 maybe to eat at all 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 not a few fans more than adequate 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.190
 is probably like that too 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.410
 the upper limit still to health 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.539
 Justify on two other days 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.399
 the week fish that means there are already 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.070
 four days a week during the week 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.050
 animal products it diemal quasi 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.530
 have lived and I think that is not 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.760
 just have little about the meat consumption 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.199
 I get my own opinion 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.940
 over time i used to have a lot 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.770
 ate a lot of meat which he often does 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.840
 been sick have my meat consumption 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.790
 I just presented with many 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.920
 people talked to doctors 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.600
 with nutritionists too 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.210
 had discussions and also a lot 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.920
 read about the meat consumption a whole 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.020
 important information is certainly that 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.030
 that the maximum amount of red 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.460
 Meat should be eaten per week 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.560
 Once that is, there is a study 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.720
 or several studies that very much 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.090
 have confirmed that red 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.380
 meat the consumption of red meat in 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.810
 the correlation to cancer development 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.000
 that means who is very red 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.390
 meat is just risked 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.009
 higher risk of getting cancer 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.979
 I design with light meat over pluto 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.689
 Chicken also think about pig 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.610
 I have essentially in my turkey 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.570
 and rice with osx video ever to 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.659
 best given 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.670
 as I said, turkeys and chicken 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.960
 We certainly do not have a good one 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.030
 quality in the conventional 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.100
 we have unbelievable animal husbandry too 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.020
 bad old conditions that is 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.579
 both the conditions and the animals 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.680
 be kept as well as the water 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.720
 will give what we take in the end 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 are just things that I'm crazy 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.330
 question 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.610
 I do not think you have that much 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.190
 eat meat there is just too much 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.370
 many too good foods too 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.170
 are very rich in protein 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.239
 and here it will be possible a little 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.560
 to eat meat and still your protein 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.540
 need to cover 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.680
 you have in this video I have mine 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.510
 I'll just stop you 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.950
 a little bit ahead of what the products are ten 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.510
 Products in this video would be too 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.790
 Of course, a second probably 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.790
 and give the third part is going on first 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.210
 the ice-bomb bad lean quark 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.040
 surely everyone has known about twelve 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.160
 grams of protein to 100 grams of the product 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.990
 a real ice bomb very healthy like that 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.610
 good as without fat and with little 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.650
 carbohydrates market is for 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.010
 Muscle building very essential and whole 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.010
 important 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.100
 masterfully of course nothing more than 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.950
 Free land eggs have about seven grams 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.290
 protein in the end in the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.760
 week 30 to 40 eggs and make me because 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.680
 Cholesterol does not worry at all 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.600
 I have a very recent blood picture of 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.610
 my cholesterol levels are in me 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.070
 optimum the thing that is somehow the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.860
 Cholesterol is getting worse 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.600
 the right of color as I said 30 to 40 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.670
 eggs in the week every egg has about 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.320
 seven grams of protein are excellent 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.360
 fatty acids and great vitamins and 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.070
 Minerals one of the most valuable 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.630
 products please always pay attention 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.470
 free range of bio afford 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.470
 can the headscarf bju 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.500
 Fish does not eat meat 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.689
 me and fish is one of the healthiest 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.769
 food and one of the deadliest 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.140
 foods 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.939
 I really enjoy eating for fun 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.329
 like to be in a salad and to love it too 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:50.189
 tuna to sandwich and so on 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.959
 100 grams do for schwaben 26 grams 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.569
 protein is natural tuna 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.670
 a real ice bomb on top of that 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.359
 low in fat and contains virtually none 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.760
 carbohydrates 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.180
 ie tuna is sort of a 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.180
 sms 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.440
 a very high quality herbal 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.510
 Protein source are the flax seeds 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.790
 Flaxseed contains just about all 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.430
 vitamins really great fatty and just 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.200
 to 25 grams of protein to 100 grams of 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.930
 Products that are the suffering seeds 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.930
 a natural plant of a bomb 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.910
 mozzarella a cheese that is very rich in protein 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.220
 we have 19 grams of protein on 100 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.440
 gram of the product a really small one 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.570
 Ice Bomb tastes great in salad 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.680
 it tastes really good 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.350
 can also be a bit different 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.270
 that is called mozzarella is in 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.250
 enjoying a variety of forms is very 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.960
 healthy very little 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.200
 carbohydrates little fat many class 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.200
 Thing 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.400
 the protein rich scarce 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.439
 In the evening, peanuts will be here 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.069
 over 25 grams of protein to 100 grams 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.960
 contain 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.759
 that is, peanuts are not only very 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.740
 salam have rich in healthy fatty acids 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.740
 also in very high protein content 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.300
 the master of pop classics are 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.130
 certainly the oatmeal oatmeal 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.380
 are, of course, first of all 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.460
 carbohydrate sources but it will be easy 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.980
 too often underestimated 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.440
 They are also very rich in protein 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.450
 here have 13 grams of protein to 100 grams 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.250
 that is the oatmeal they have 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.200
 nor a natural one of salary 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.580
 higher is known as communities and 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.290
 therefore of course first and foremost 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.520
 carbohydrates source in second line 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.520
 but it could also be a great one 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.100
 Legumes and especially the 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.120
 Children living are also rich in protein 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.620
 It is hard to believe 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.300
 we have nine grams of protein here 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.460
 contain it means this dose contains 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.680
 already over 20 grams are protein 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.509
 Of course delicious are also very 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.060
 healthy have a lot of vitamins down 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.830
 For me, a row is also born 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.039
 Great great plant world 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.039
 again 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.480
 I can barely keep my fingers off you 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.940
 they are just incredibly tasty and 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.520
 incredibly rich and 100 grams of almonds 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.810
 contain over 19 grams of protein which are 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.580
 simply delicious that can be so 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.960
 various processes best 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.730
 I still enjoy yogurt 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.650
 or just in the evening on the couch 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.680
 contain many great fatty acids though 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.490
 just a proper portion mansen 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.490
 the inhibited at all 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.350
 last but not least, protein powder 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.240
 protein powders are one 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.950
 dietary supplements and how that 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.660
 name already says they are ours 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.190
 supplement normal diet 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.740
 They are an excellent possibility 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.580
 just to get his ios needed 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.620
 there is no food whatsoever 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.840
 the same high protein content has 100 grams 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.300
 this powder cent hold 85 percent 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.250
 pure white if we do that of course 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.350
 convert to the single protein 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.810
 is everything fine but probably the 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.740
 it's the cheapest way to be there 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.870
 need to cover 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.060
 Of course, only atkinson should 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.010
 be successful it was in the first 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.560
 part ten great products that 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.360
 are suitable for the protein requirement too 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.070
 come and it was only the first part 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.900
 the second unlikely third follows 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.090
 At the same time, you will still have everything 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.560
 gradually see here on youtube 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.390
 I would be happy if you could find me here 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.610
 subscribe to me here and a positive one 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.900
 Become a rating and become a facebook fan 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.030
 you will become everything new 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.650
 everything currently so hungary it 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.030
 heard it was so far from 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.030
 many greetings to you
