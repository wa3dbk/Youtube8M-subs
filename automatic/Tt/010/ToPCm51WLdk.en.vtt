00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.250
 video I'll tell you how to weave here 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.849
 such small tomatoes tomatoes 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.900
 cherry slingshot with rezinochek 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:21.710
 and so it went 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:24.829
 [music] 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.189
 plaiting like these tomatoes are not 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.800
 will need 8 red rubber bands and 3 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.320
 green gum 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.590
 slingshot hook 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.980
 take our slingshot take one 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:44.200
 red gum twist in one turn 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:49.840
 on the right column here and put it down 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.640
 we have to wear 4 of these rezinochek 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.550
 [music] 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.460
 the second gum we dress in one turn 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:03.750
 let down 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.339
 3 rezinochka down and 4 rezinochka 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.759
 So 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.759
 but theme 4 gum will dress in two columns 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.380
 [music] 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.420
 and with the hook we will remove all of our 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.340
 red rezinochki right column 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.710
 which we screwed up eight 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.970
 at the middle we remove it is possible to rise to 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.970
 rezinochek throw off 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.810
 [music] 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.390
 I can't capture everything 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.130
 can be cut 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.430
 [music] 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.579
 how we got rid of then we take the green 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.960
 gum 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.880
 put on 2 poles and fold 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 red rezinochki followed by a column and 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.770
 red rezinochki from the right column 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:59.280
 then 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.280
 green rezinochki remove the hook 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.890
 now we 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.209
 do a loop we mean 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.860
 to the left which is our rezinochka we and 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.160
 stretching through here through this 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.470
 rubber band so the inside and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.310
 tighten the loop 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.310
 and then using the hook 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.790
 Here we will hook here under the green 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.110
 gum girl which we did 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.540
 take 2 green rezinochki and stretch and 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.740
 them through this our little eye so not up 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.950
 end so in the middle 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:45.120
 and to get and with scissors we 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.120
 cut off the tips 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.230
 from this side and from this side here 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.910
 look how interesting we are 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.430
 turned out tomato can move away 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.989
 Punches tomato points set different 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.990
 parties so they are more natural 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.550
 looked 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.280
