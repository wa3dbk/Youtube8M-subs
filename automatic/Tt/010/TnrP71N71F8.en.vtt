00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello friends in this second tutorial of 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:09.990
 the tablet and huawei 101 we are going to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.660
 explain something a little more elementary what 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.750
 first they are the external part of the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.160
 tablet is already basically aware of 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.160
 a power button yes 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.130
 let's generate the ignition is pretty 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.739
 slow is on unleash lenses do not 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.169
 worry comes with a control of 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:33.469
 volume here went back up volume 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.540
 down your digital camera and here the part 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.850
 of the ports if he handles some ports 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.430
 the first port you see is here 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.290
 the audio port 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.290
 3.5 jack connector then any 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.350
 kind of hands-free serves you the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 microusb connector that is to say any 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.920
 any brand's charger is already spoken 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.110
 of wine there is if any works and 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.589
 manages port hdmi this port that 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.450
 handles hm says the pussycat from mini 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.960
 hdmi 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.390
 that is what this table shows in its 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.090
 outside I tell you it's a bit slow 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.810
 at the beginning and let's start what is 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.820
 the torn one yes 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.000
 to be able to say do all the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.640
 configuration of the operating system and 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.369
 everything in this expected or paused the video 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.110
 to continue we give Vicente 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.050
 again we go back to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.080
 after this long and eternal start 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.450
 we realize this table already has 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.640
 connection there they realize they say that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.770
 the sim card was well put that 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.380
 first we have to verify and 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.810
 let's go first to the start part if in 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.050
 the beginning part we go to each Spanish 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.290
 Latin America 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.680
 and he gave me to say no 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.200
 where it says google configuration the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.869
 let's say now no 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.630
 next we go location in this 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.729
 date here does not open and I can not 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.320
 leave blank there is no need if 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.990
 they want they can place it with their name 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.090
 and we also give you here in services of 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.970
 google of next masters an arrow 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.819
 list appears complete configuration 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.730
 we give you here the close button 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.720
 Now we close we will see here a 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.790
 to accept 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.080
 and we go to the button to car menu 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.710
 Applications 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.710
 here 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.480
 for now 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.100
 is more characterized let's give it other 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.240
 features that this tablet itself 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:44.390
 that manages internal improvement itself to 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.160
 use net is how you see it here from 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.550
 4.6 gigabytes is enough memory 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.710
 big yes it's pretty big 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.880
 also handle what is a memory 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.850
 ram free soap to use almost 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.580
 500 m 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.890
 502 feels from a team what 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.080
 that brings free to use is a 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.360
 tablet well quite complete 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.890
 that's the characteristics of this 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.980
 tablet in the third video we're going to 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.290
 verify what is configuration of 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.380
 how can we put the tablet a bit more 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.870
 quick how can we work that of a 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.489
 much more effective way 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.540
 and then to be attentive to 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.540
 next video thanks
