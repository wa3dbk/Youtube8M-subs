00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
we're coming up to a 16 inch incline

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.490 
we're coming up to a 16 inch incline
we're<00:00:13.920> going<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.099> walk<00:00:14.340> over<00:00:14.549> this

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
come in at about a fifteen degree angle

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.029 
come in at about a fifteen degree angle
go<00:00:24.009> ahead<00:00:24.279> one<00:00:24.490> tire<00:00:24.789> is<00:00:25.119> any<00:00:25.329> touching<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
go ahead one tire is any touching the

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.549 
go ahead one tire is any touching the
obstacle

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.169 

okay<00:00:35.559> now<00:00:35.769> we're<00:00:35.859> going<00:00:35.949> to<00:00:36.010> go<00:00:36.159> this<00:00:36.969> is<00:00:37.149> a

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
okay now we're going to go this is a

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.279 
okay now we're going to go this is a
nice<00:00:37.420> deep<00:00:37.809> driveway<00:00:39.539> more<00:00:40.539> steep<00:00:40.780> than<00:00:40.809> usual

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
nice deep driveway more steep than usual

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.360 
nice deep driveway more steep than usual
so<00:00:41.379> we're<00:00:41.500> going<00:00:41.589> to<00:00:41.649> go<00:00:41.800> over<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.010> top<00:00:42.219> of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
so we're going to go over the top of

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.740 
so we're going to go over the top of
this<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.710> incline<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:46.269> this<00:00:46.390> is<00:00:46.510> where<00:00:46.629> the

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
this this incline and this is where the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.569 
this this incline and this is where the
break<00:00:46.960> over<00:00:47.140> angle<00:00:47.409> comes<00:00:47.679> in<00:00:47.829> handy<00:00:48.100> when<00:00:48.460> you

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
break over angle comes in handy when you

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.369 
break over angle comes in handy when you
can<00:00:48.729> break<00:00:49.030> over<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:49.390> top<00:00:49.690> of<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:50.019> of<00:00:50.260> the

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
can break over the top of the of the

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.469 
can break over the top of the of the
hill<00:00:50.589> here<00:00:50.799> and<00:00:51.010> not<00:00:51.609> bottom<00:00:52.059> out<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:52.359> get

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
hill here and not bottom out and get

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.959 
hill here and not bottom out and get
caught<00:00:52.839> up<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.949> we<00:00:54.070> go<00:00:54.159> it's<00:00:54.369> just<00:00:54.519> like<00:00:54.670> a

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
caught up here we go it's just like a

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.070 
caught up here we go it's just like a
ride<00:00:55.299> at<00:00:55.479> Disney<00:00:55.719> World

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
ride at Disney World

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.780 
ride at Disney World
and<00:00:57.500> here's<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.830> Borrego<00:00:58.070> raiga<00:00:58.400> where<00:00:58.610> most

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
and here's the Borrego raiga where most

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.820 
and here's the Borrego raiga where most
hot<00:00:59.000> cars<00:00:59.270> get<00:00:59.480> hung<00:00:59.630> up<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.020> right<00:01:00.620> there

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
hot cars get hung up and right there

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.470 
hot cars get hung up and right there
when<00:01:01.040> you<00:01:01.130> come<00:01:01.310> down<00:01:02.920> as<00:01:03.920> we<00:01:04.220> descend<00:01:05.210> down

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
when you come down as we descend down

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.880 
when you come down as we descend down
here<00:01:05.810> we<00:01:06.230> have<00:01:06.350> electronic<00:01:06.830> Park<00:01:07.640> Assist<00:01:08.890> and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
here we have electronic Park Assist and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.510 
here we have electronic Park Assist and
this<00:01:10.430> is<00:01:10.610> again<00:01:11.620> most<00:01:12.620> vehicles<00:01:13.160> right<00:01:13.310> here

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
this is again most vehicles right here

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.460 
this is again most vehicles right here
will<00:01:13.700> bottom<00:01:13.880> out<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.420> get<00:01:14.570> stuck

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.890 

so<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.220> angle<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.180> clearance<00:01:20.510> angle<00:01:20.780> is

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
so the angle of the clearance angle is

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.530 
so the angle of the clearance angle is
really<00:01:21.140> canvas<00:01:21.800> a<00:01:21.950> lot<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.370> SUVs<00:01:22.820> are<00:01:23.030> known<00:01:23.240> to

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
really canvas a lot of SUVs are known to

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.170 
really canvas a lot of SUVs are known to
do<00:01:24.080> their<00:01:24.230> little<00:01:24.410> tip<00:01:24.740> now<00:01:25.730> if<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:25.910> look<00:01:26.090> at

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
do their little tip now if you look at

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.450 
do their little tip now if you look at
this<00:01:26.270> angle<00:01:26.690> here<00:01:26.870> I<00:01:27.410> think<00:01:27.740> it's<00:01:27.860> like<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.010> 35

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
this angle here I think it's like a 35

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.179 
this angle here I think it's like a 35
to<00:01:28.610> 40<00:01:28.880> degree<00:01:29.150> grade<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:31.490> we're<00:01:31.640> gonna

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
to 40 degree grade and we're gonna

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.929 
to 40 degree grade and we're gonna
we're<00:01:33.640> gonna<00:01:34.950> follow<00:01:35.950> through<00:01:36.219> this<00:01:36.399> nice<00:01:36.759> and

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
we're gonna follow through this nice and

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.090 
we're gonna follow through this nice and
easy

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.820 

without<00:01:41.100> tip<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
without tip it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.870 
without tip it
I<00:01:43.600> call<00:01:44.600> this<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.900> teeter-totter<00:01:45.640> our<00:01:46.640> front
