as<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:44.680> nice<00:00:45.100> touch<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.579> it<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.739> bag<00:00:49.230> thing

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
as a nice touch to it in the bag thing

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.200

that shows are pretty good but it's like

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.119 
that shows are pretty good but it's like
a<00:00:52.329> reflective<00:00:52.960> converter<00:00:53.469> I<00:00:53.530> guess<00:00:53.769> its<00:00:53.949> life

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
a reflective converter I guess its life

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.799 
a reflective converter I guess its life
for<00:00:54.399> when<00:00:54.579> you<00:00:54.699> go<00:00:54.789> on<00:00:54.910> bike<00:00:55.090> rides<00:00:55.120> so<00:00:55.719> if
