00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello I am the planet to do and I hope 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.000
 dispel some myths about roulette 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.960
 and accelerate some truths about the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.059
 same 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.309
 before I start, please, please 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.170
 watch the full video before commenting 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 and that those who come to insult and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.520
 I will limit myself to deleting their 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.109
 comments 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.210
 returning to ours the roulette is the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.369
 gambling par excellence in all 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.109
 parts of the world many are the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.420
 stories that tell how they won 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.519
 mountains of money as well as those 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.439
 they lost everything in a spin of the drum 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.840
 this brings us to the indefectible 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.739
 question is it possible to make money on 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.870
 the roulette the answer is a resounding yes 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.120
 I will explain this for my examples I will use 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.289
 always the French roulette model that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.420
 contains 37 numbers from 0 to 36 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.460
 Roulette due to the presence of zero 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.010
 it is said to be mathematically 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.649
 armored since the house only pays you 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.280
 as if there were 36 numbers when in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.739
 actually there are 37 that little 2% that 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.660
 means zero assures you that with the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.270
 time everyone who is 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.440
 playing will lose something or all your money 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.600
 This means 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.850
 during each spin of the roulette the house 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.800
 maintains a small advantage but that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.580
 with the passage of time it demonstrates what 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.160
 evident 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.110
 the casino laugh at last this happens if 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.840
 we simply perform 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.170
 random bets that is to say play as 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.440
 95% of the people do so 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.270
 they end up losing now I want to explain 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.690
 how it is done in order to defeat the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.240
 roulette 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.640
 defeat when I say I do not mean to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 earn tons of money but to go out 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.620
 at least unharmed after each session 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.750
 as I said before the percentages 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.940
 they always play against us but there 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.310
 ways to reduce the casino's advantage 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.890
 at this point three come into play 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.979
 important variables the first and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.020
 perhaps the most important is the time not 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.600
 It matters what number you bet on 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.540
 some time will have to leave either in 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.240
 the second roll as in number 150 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.640
 the second variable is like some 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.010
 players call it the attack area 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.390
 with this they refer to the amount of 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.480
 numbers to which they are 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.190
 betting and finally the third are 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.920
 the progressions with this 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.680
 that at certain times the amount of 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.840
 chips that I'm betting varies in 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.330
 summary if you want to defeat the casino 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.060
 you need to plan the use of these 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.830
 three fundamental variables exist 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.690
 hundreds of systems that propose 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.420
 different relationships between these 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.280
 some more effective factors than others 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.860
 or that allow higher or lower 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.870
 gains before continuing I want 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.210
 leave something very clear and remember 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.190
 this whenever they go to a casino the 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.740
 risk is proportional to the profit 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.110
 This means that the more I 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.990
 risk or less chances 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.150
 the house has to win more pay me another 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.160
 very important thing that should never be 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.070
 to forget is that there is no system of 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.930
 perfect bets if they listened well not 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.170
 there is a system that ensures us a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.120
 100% that we will win, as I said before 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.820
 with the existence of zero the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.100
 mathematics are going against us still 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.200
 although we always have the disadvantage 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.180
 you have to know how to win in the averages with 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.950
 this I mean that over time 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.080
 necessary that it can be a lot or a little 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.670
 depending on the system we will obtain a 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.890
 margin of gain 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.540
 I reiterate in roulette just luck you 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.239
 can make a millionaire but the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.770
 strategy will give you profits every 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.170
 sell them the idea of â€‹â€‹becoming 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.000
 millionaire with a system or some form 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.030
 to win ten thousand dollars in an hour 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.160
 is lying to them before they finish 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.400
 this video I would like to comment on the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.530
 most known system the martingale this one 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.720
 supposedly miraculous system that 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.350
 based on betting a unit on a chance 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.930
 simple either red black major minor or 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.580
 odd pair and in each error duplicate the 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.410
 amount of the bet until achieving the 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.660
 right that we will leave 1 record of 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.600
 profit after recovering all of the above 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.370
 within the betting systems all 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.290
 those who use such a progression 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.120
 strong as it is to go doubled every time 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.720
 that you lose you end up in failure 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.459
 because it is very simple after a 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.330
 medium or long series without achieving 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.580
 hits 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.169
 the bet becomes stratospheric with 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.959
 what in the end after a few shots 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.359
 failed you end up betting 400 chips 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.970
 in a single shot this is not a way 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.190
 smart to bet on this many 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.720
 martingale advocates will say that it is 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.450
 difficult to give a streak 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.510
 let's say nine shots where we do not hit 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.390
 being that we are betting with 50% 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.570
 of chances to win let's analyze this with 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.900
 50% is actually less than 0 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.630
 but let's assume it's 50% if we fail 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.030
 eight times we come to the ninth shot 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.510
 we'll have to bet two to the eighth what 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.250
 which is equivalent to 256 chips there 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.950
 watch how the bet turns 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.110
 Excessive after few failures but still 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.600
 well I have not proven how likely it is 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.970
 that this happens in the description of 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.640
 video I've left an excell file 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.230
 this file is so to speak a 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.060
 roulette throw analyzer 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.700
 it simply generates random numbers 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.040
 between 0 and 36 and analyze the 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.980
 results returning to what dozen 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.780
 column and color belongs there may 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.940
 observe how the results of the 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.610
 simple chances are usually grouped into 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.710
 called bunches let's say we use 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.590
 the martingale and we are betting on 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.510
 red after a short time is likely 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.700
 find a cluster that contains 9 or 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.200
 even more blacks followed with which 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.140
 we stay in banking 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.500
 use the analyzer or create one of you 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.570
 then draw your conclusions finally 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.610
 I leave the link in the description of 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.370
 a page where they are constantly 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.430
 climbing systems for the roulette I add 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.410
 that I'm not the creator of that page without 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.360
 nothing more to say and thank them for 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.360
 watch the video up here I say goodbye
