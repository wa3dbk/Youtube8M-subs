00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and that was bugging me but I ran up a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.200 
and that was bugging me but I ran up a
bit<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.890> found<00:00:41.070> out<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.489> put<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.059> and
