00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:11.700
 44 beautiful for all of you this was retro 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.280
 flash 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.619
 I am pomace but this is not the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.640
 usual shooter that I recommend in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.380
 in my retro flashes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.529
 in fact this is a triptych of games 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.320
 in one only a collection that includes 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.750
 midnight serious wonders and don't pooley 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 the latter is a puzzle game a little 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.050
 debt in the sense squeezes the eye a little 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.059
 a bomber but we have to push the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.890
 blocks inside the box for 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.340
 being able to kill the enemies we find 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 within the beautiful level but to the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.210
 long maybe us a little bit me 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.710
 honestly I enjoy it enough if 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.550
 you have the chance maybe do some 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.770
 game 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.200
 nothing that the real pearl is share 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.789
 yacht and midnight wonders two chapters 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.020
 that share the same protagonists 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.850
 two silva that in mean that good wonders 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.739
 different bands towards and does not feel like it 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.989
 pronounce forgive me guys I'm a little 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.510
 ignorant on these things must 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 recover a magic glider precisely 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.659
 serious than from the name to the second chapter 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.119
 the first is obviously a platform a 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.729
 very simple horizontal scrolling 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.610
 in the mechanics because it reminds us a little 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.360
 also ghost'n goblins or if you lose 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.920
 the armor you can find in a 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 coffer a little further the variety of 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.350
 weapons is huge that changes substantially 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.579
 even a little style of play though not 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.130
 the difficulty in fact enough 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.659
 simple as we said before the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.540
 second serious instead becomes a 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.680
 horizontal scrolling shooter 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.079
 in fact with our glider we should 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.850
 pass along a series of levels up 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.390
 to arrive at gaia a kind of monster 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.490
 in the shape of a world map like I have it 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.350
 interpreted so I was little forgive 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.140
 less and less I've always imagined 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.170
 I have always associated with that however a 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.329
 unlike the first is fucking 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.670
 difficult i swear i but midnight 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.100
 wonders I finished it a few times 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 because you are a pipe you who follow the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.560
 channel you know i'm not a hardcore 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.560
 gamer who takes 20 years to finish 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.120
 I never finished cherie oct 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.980
 not even with the emulator when ivy the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.020
 endless ces claire I had before it 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.709
 I gave up was really fucking 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.599
 difficult and a pity because it 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.430
 style that also recalled those of 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.440
 midnight wonders indeed shared 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.610
 the same graphic appearance as well as the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.489
 same characters emphasized the whole 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.700
 journey through the levels you passed 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.160
 from a slightly steampunk style ah not 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.260
 I know something that seemed almost surreal 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.049
 very very nice until you get to the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.140
 graphics that to the style of the end bosses 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.970
 level that really did envy to 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.130
 lots of titles from that time 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.480
 unfortunately this game is little known 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.580
 and that's why I wanted to make a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.080
 retro flash I recommend in fact of 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.790
 recover it if you get the chance 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.500
 through the mam and we also have 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.630
 channel tutorial if you want to go to it 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.390
 see or even better if you have the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.950
 possibility recover it for saturn saw 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.459
 or playstation you won't regret it 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.930
 really guys nothing what can i do 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.489
 say sign up for the first channel on 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.900

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.910
 facebook and enable notifications 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.950
 visit bay shops and I know maybe 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.160
 watch out for the Pepsi back flash 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.840
 man that although it may seem a bit one 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.850
 cagata is actually a great game 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.620
 so maybe give him a chance 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.459
