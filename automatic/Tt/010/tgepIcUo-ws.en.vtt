00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
they shouldn't have lots of these

they shouldn't have lots of these
non-shooting<00:00:39.360> back<00:00:39.690> bulbs<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.230> when<00:00:40.710> all<00:00:40.860> you

you're supposed to divide cymbidiums up

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.250 
you're supposed to divide cymbidiums up
but<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.329> pretty<00:00:57.840> straightforward

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
