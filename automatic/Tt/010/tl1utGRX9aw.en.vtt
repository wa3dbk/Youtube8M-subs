now<00:00:03.360> there<00:00:03.540> are<00:00:03.600> times<00:00:03.810> when<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.320> want<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.950> do

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
now there are times when you want to do

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.209 
now there are times when you want to do
a<00:00:05.880> little<00:00:06.120> bit<00:00:06.300> more<00:00:06.480> organic<00:00:06.990> modeling<00:00:07.740> to

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:08.219 
a little bit more organic modeling to

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:09.860 
a little bit more organic modeling to
your<00:00:08.490> polygonal<00:00:08.940> object<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.570> those<00:00:09.690> are

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
your polygonal object and those are

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.660 
your polygonal object and those are
times<00:00:10.049> when<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.410> want<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.710> use<00:00:11.099> soft

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
times when you want to use soft

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.450 
times when you want to use soft
selection<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.990> let's<00:00:13.200> go<00:00:13.320> ahead<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.860> make<00:00:14.400> a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
selection so let's go ahead and make a

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.910 
selection so let's go ahead and make a
sphere<00:00:14.639> our<00:00:15.300> best<00:00:15.780> friend<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.470> sphere

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
sphere our best friend here the sphere

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.890 
sphere our best friend here the sphere
and<00:00:17.099> let's<00:00:17.759> go<00:00:17.849> ahead<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.060> shade<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.599> and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
and let's go ahead and shade that and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.779 
and let's go ahead and shade that and
let's<00:00:19.350> go<00:00:19.500> ahead<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:19.949> right-click<00:00:20.580> over

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
let's go ahead and just right-click over

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.170 
let's go ahead and just right-click over
it<00:00:21.029> go<00:00:21.930> into<00:00:22.230> vertex<00:00:22.680> mode<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.699> select<00:00:24.060> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
it go into vertex mode and just select a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.090 
it go into vertex mode and just select a
kind<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.570> random<00:00:24.990> arrangement<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.830> vertices

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
kind of a random arrangement of vertices

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.370 
kind of a random arrangement of vertices
towards<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> top<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.930> let's<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.199> go

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
towards the top here and let's just go

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.620 
towards the top here and let's just go
ahead<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.859> move<00:00:29.130> those<00:00:29.519> now<00:00:30.210> you'll<00:00:30.390> notice

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
ahead and move those now you'll notice

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.900 
ahead and move those now you'll notice
if<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.109> move<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.800> they're<00:00:32.309> not<00:00:32.460> selected

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
if I move these and they're not selected

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.119 
if I move these and they're not selected
radially<00:00:33.629> or<00:00:33.809> linearly<00:00:34.410> you're<00:00:34.769> going<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
radially or linearly you're going to

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.740 
radially or linearly you're going to
start<00:00:35.339> to<00:00:35.430> get<00:00:35.519> kind<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.059> these<00:00:36.210> creases

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
start to get kind of all these creases

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
start to get kind of all these creases
in<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.290> kind<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.559> crunchiness<00:00:38.159> and<00:00:38.519> it's<00:00:39.150> not

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
in this kind of crunchiness and it's not

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.789 
in this kind of crunchiness and it's not
really<00:00:39.479> going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.780> look<00:00:40.199> right<00:00:40.530> because

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:40.799 
really going to look right because

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.170 
really going to look right because
you're<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.339> these<00:00:41.580> kind<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.850> sharp

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you're going to have these kind of sharp

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.689 
you're going to have these kind of sharp
edges<00:00:42.449> and<00:00:42.900> that's<00:00:43.589> what<00:00:44.129> happens<00:00:44.580> with

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
edges and that's what happens with

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.700 
edges and that's what happens with
political<00:00:45.210> modeling<00:00:45.600> when<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.260> select

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
political modeling when you just select

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.460 
political modeling when you just select
individual<00:00:47.489> components<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.930> move<00:00:49.199> them

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
individual components and you move them

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.439 
individual components and you move them
around<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:50.190> I'm<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.210> ahead<00:00:51.269> and

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
around now I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
around now I'm going to go ahead and
undo<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.559> let's<00:00:53.339> go<00:00:53.460> ahead<00:00:53.580> over<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.119> our

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
undo this and let's go ahead over to our

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.170 
undo this and let's go ahead over to our
move<00:00:54.659> tool<00:00:55.019> and<00:00:55.320> I'm<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.339> double<00:00:56.879> click

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
move tool and I'm going to double click

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.229 
move tool and I'm going to double click
on<00:00:57.330> this<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.799> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.979> bring<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.549> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
on this and it's going to bring up the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
on this and it's going to bring up the
tool<00:01:00.510> settings<00:01:00.839> now<00:01:01.170> another<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.769> get<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
tool settings now another way to get to

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
tool settings now another way to get to
this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.549> go<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.729> the<00:01:02.850> top<00:01:03.089> right<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.780> hit

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this is to go to the top right and hit

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.050 
this is to go to the top right and hit
this<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.440> wrench<00:01:05.070> icon<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.820> won't

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
this little wrench icon and that won't

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.260 
this little wrench icon and that won't
go<00:01:06.240> ahead<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.750> bring<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.680> same<00:01:08.250> menu<00:01:08.609> now

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
go ahead and bring up that same menu now

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.690 
go ahead and bring up that same menu now
these<00:01:09.479> are<00:01:09.659> our<00:01:09.810> move<00:01:10.200> tool<00:01:10.590> settings<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.340> if

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
these are our move tool settings and if

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
these are our move tool settings and if
we<00:01:11.820> go<00:01:12.060> down<00:01:12.329> here<00:01:13.259> you'll<00:01:13.710> notice<00:01:14.039> there's<00:01:14.219> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
we go down here you'll notice there's a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.060 
we go down here you'll notice there's a
rollout<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.119> called<00:01:15.450> soft<00:01:15.869> selection<00:01:16.380> now

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
rollout here called soft selection now

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.289 
rollout here called soft selection now
what<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.490> does<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:18.179> it<00:01:18.659> enables<00:01:18.990> me<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:20.299> fall

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
what this does is it enables me to fall

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.260 
what this does is it enables me to fall
off<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.469> selection<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.429> and<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.820> notice<00:01:24.119> when

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
off the selection so and you notice when

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.810 
off the selection so and you notice when
I<00:01:24.299> click<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.899> on<00:01:25.170> all<00:01:25.590> sudden<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.429> kind<00:01:26.700> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I click this on all sudden this kind of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.349 
I click this on all sudden this kind of
fall-off<00:01:27.240> comes<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.859> sphere<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.179> now

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
fall-off comes up on this sphere so now

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.090 
fall-off comes up on this sphere so now
when<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> move<00:01:31.640> my<00:01:32.640> vertices<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.530> actually

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
when I move my vertices it's actually

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.880 
when I move my vertices it's actually
kind<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.149> falling<00:01:36.509> off<00:01:36.749> towards<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.560> end<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
kind of falling off towards the end of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
kind of falling off towards the end of
the<00:01:38.009> sphere<00:01:38.219> so<00:01:38.249> now<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.700> getting<00:01:38.969> a<00:01:39.030> much

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the sphere so now I'm getting a much

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.980 
the sphere so now I'm getting a much
more<00:01:39.689> organic<00:01:40.520> deformation<00:01:41.689> now<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.749> can

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
more organic deformation now you can

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.230 
more organic deformation now you can
determine<00:01:43.439> how<00:01:43.649> much<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.429> a<00:01:44.490> fall-off<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.030> get

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
determine how much of a fall-off you get

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.080 
determine how much of a fall-off you get
by<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.079> working<00:01:47.069> with<00:01:47.249> this<00:01:47.520> fall-off

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
by just working with this fall-off

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.849 
by just working with this fall-off
radius<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.719> if<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.960> small<00:01:49.259> you'll<00:01:49.560> just

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
radius here if it's small you'll just

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.370 
radius here if it's small you'll just
deal<00:01:50.069> with<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.609> a<00:01:50.729> small<00:01:51.060> area<00:01:51.359> and<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
deal with just a small area and you can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.249 
deal with just a small area and you can
also<00:01:52.560> make<00:01:53.219> it<00:01:53.249> large<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.450> deal<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:54.990> almost

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
also make it large and deal with almost

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.190 
also make it large and deal with almost
the<00:01:55.439> whole<00:01:55.590> sphere<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> let's<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:57.960> ahead<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the whole sphere so let's go ahead and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.749 
the whole sphere so let's go ahead and
dial<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.560> down<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> little<00:01:59.130> bit<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.579> can

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
dial this down a little bit so we can

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.239 
dial this down a little bit so we can
play<00:02:00.389> with<00:02:00.539> it<00:02:00.749> and<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.740> also<00:02:01.889> have<00:02:02.100> what's

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
play with it and we also have what's

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:05.209 
play with it and we also have what's
called<00:02:02.429> interpolation<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.859> we<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.100> do

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
called interpolation so what we can do

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.830 
called interpolation so what we can do
is<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.490> actually<00:02:05.819> play<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.450> this

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
is we can actually play with this

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.370 
is we can actually play with this
fall-off<00:02:07.619> curve<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:08.729> determine<00:02:09.210> exactly<00:02:09.450> how

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
fall-off curve to determine exactly how

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.190 
fall-off curve to determine exactly how
it<00:02:10.860> falls<00:02:11.670> off<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.330> now<00:02:12.480> we've<00:02:12.629> got<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> very

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it falls off right now we've got a very

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.949 
it falls off right now we've got a very
smooth<00:02:13.830> fall-off<00:02:14.400> curve<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:15.209> we<00:02:15.450> also<00:02:15.599> have

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
smooth fall-off curve but we also have

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:16.430 
smooth fall-off curve but we also have
these

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
these

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.640 
these
pre-set<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.280> click<00:02:17.760> on<00:02:17.970> these<00:02:18.180> and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
pre-set so I can click on these and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.290 
pre-set so I can click on these and
change<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.070> way<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:21.570> fall-off<00:02:21.870> happens

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
change the way that the fall-off happens

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.240 
change the way that the fall-off happens
so<00:02:24.300> each<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.900> these<00:02:25.140> has<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.770> very

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
so each one of these has a very

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.740 
so each one of these has a very
different<00:02:26.640> effect<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.480> kind<00:02:27.720> of

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
different effect like this one kind of

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.840 
different effect like this one kind of
has<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.170> double<00:02:28.590> bump<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.160> middle<00:02:29.430> so

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
has like a double bump in the middle so

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.850 
has like a double bump in the middle so
it's<00:02:30.000> actually<00:02:30.330> kind<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.630> doing<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.500> and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
it's actually kind of doing this and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.460 
it's actually kind of doing this and
this<00:02:31.950> one<00:02:32.160> here<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.580> kind<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.910> little

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
this one here is like kind of a little

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.870 
this one here is like kind of a little
different<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.920> each<00:02:35.130> one<00:02:35.340> may<00:02:35.640> or<00:02:35.730> may<00:02:35.850> not

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
different so each one may or may not

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.280 
different so each one may or may not
work<00:02:36.240> for<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.570> this<00:02:36.750> one's<00:02:36.930> kind<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
work for you this one's kind of a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.980 
work for you this one's kind of a
stair-step<00:02:37.650> effect<00:02:38.130> again<00:02:38.850> each<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.570> very

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
stair-step effect again each one is very

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.270 
stair-step effect again each one is very
very<00:02:40.290> different<00:02:40.590> I'm<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.070> back<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
very different I'm going to go back to

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.150 
very different I'm going to go back to
the<00:02:41.790> initial<00:02:42.270> preset<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.800> want<00:02:44.010> you

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
the initial preset and if you want you

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.880 
the initial preset and if you want you
can<00:02:44.310> also<00:02:44.460> make<00:02:45.000> your<00:02:45.210> own<00:02:45.530> preset<00:02:46.530> as<00:02:46.680> well

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
can also make your own preset as well

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.010 
can also make your own preset as well
all<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.220> have<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.550> do<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.910> just<00:02:48.120> left-click<00:02:48.660> on

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
all you have to do is just left-click on

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.350 
all you have to do is just left-click on
this<00:02:49.200> curve<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:50.370> can<00:02:50.700> change<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.210> to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
this curve and you can change it to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.660 
this curve and you can change it to
whatever<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.900> want<00:02:52.220> move<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.340> up<00:02:53.460> or<00:02:53.610> down

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
whatever you want move it up or down

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.870 
whatever you want move it up or down
left<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.630> right<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.260> also<00:02:55.380> add<00:02:55.710> more<00:02:56.100> if<00:02:56.400> I

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
left to right I can also add more if I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.760 
left to right I can also add more if I
want<00:02:57.180> if<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.840> want<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.080> get<00:02:58.170> rid<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.380> these<00:02:58.500> all

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
want if we want to get rid of these all

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.170 
want if we want to get rid of these all
you<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.160> do<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.400> hit<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.730> little<00:02:59.880> X

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
you have to do is hit that little X

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.160 
you have to do is hit that little X
right<00:03:01.050> there<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.620> they<00:03:02.370> go<00:03:02.550> away<00:03:02.960> now<00:03:03.960> in

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
right there and they go away now in

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.560 
right there and they go away now in
addition<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.740> this<00:03:05.070> we<00:03:05.640> also<00:03:05.850> have<00:03:06.270> what's

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
addition to this we also have what's

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.140 
addition to this we also have what's
called<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.020> fall-off<00:03:07.230> color<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.970> is

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
called the fall-off color and this is

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.170 
called the fall-off color and this is
basically<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:10.320> feedback<00:03:11.100> color<00:03:11.580> so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
basically is just a feedback color so

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.810 
basically is just a feedback color so
typically<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.780> goes<00:03:12.810> from<00:03:13.290> yellow<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:14.010> red<00:03:14.280> to

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
typically it goes from yellow to red to

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.480 
typically it goes from yellow to red to
black<00:03:15.090> which<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.110> fine<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.710> I<00:03:16.800> typically<00:03:17.220> just

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
black which is fine and I typically just

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.310 
black which is fine and I typically just
leave<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.820> at<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> default<00:03:18.210> but<00:03:18.990> if<00:03:19.020> for<00:03:19.260> some

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
leave it at the default but if for some

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.979 
leave it at the default but if for some
reason<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.220> don't<00:03:20.400> want<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.760> use<00:03:20.940> red<00:03:21.239> if<00:03:21.840> it

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
reason you don't want to use red if it

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.420 
reason you don't want to use red if it
maybe<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.290> conflicting<00:03:22.800> with<00:03:22.920> your<00:03:23.040> model<00:03:23.340> or

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
maybe is conflicting with your model or

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.260 
maybe is conflicting with your model or
something<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:23.850> that

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
something like that

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.240 
something like that
you<00:03:24.510> can<00:03:24.690> change<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.110> color<00:03:25.350> very<00:03:25.680> easily<00:03:26.100> all

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
you can change the color very easily all

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.710 
you can change the color very easily all
you<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.610> do<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.790> select<00:03:26.970> one<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.480> these

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
you have to do is select one of these

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.470 
you have to do is select one of these
and<00:03:28.140> just<00:03:28.890> click<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.520> color<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.239> color

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
and just click on the color and a color

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.420 
and just click on the color and a color
picker<00:03:30.750> comes<00:03:31.080> up<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.800> can<00:03:31.950> basically

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
picker comes up and you can basically

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.640 
picker comes up and you can basically
choose<00:03:32.970> whatever<00:03:33.239> color<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.930> want<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.260> now<00:03:34.380> it

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
choose whatever color you want so now it

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.360 
choose whatever color you want so now it
goes<00:03:34.800> from<00:03:35.000> cyan<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.959> red<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.709> I'm<00:03:38.100> just<00:03:38.220> going

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
goes from cyan to red and I'm just going

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.740 
goes from cyan to red and I'm just going
to<00:03:38.400> go<00:03:38.550> ahead<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.760> put<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:38.940> back<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.540> yellow

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
to go ahead and put that back to yellow

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.410 
to go ahead and put that back to yellow
just<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.230> put<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.470> back<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.800> default<00:03:41.420> now

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
just to put it back to default now

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.900 
just to put it back to default now
another<00:03:42.690> thing<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.020> can<00:03:43.290> do<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.709> change<00:03:44.640> the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
another thing you can do is change the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.990 
another thing you can do is change the
way<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.690> we<00:03:46.080> fall<00:03:46.739> off<00:03:46.769> by<00:03:47.340> doing<00:03:47.400> what's

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
way that we fall off by doing what's

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.120 
way that we fall off by doing what's
called<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.360> fall-off<00:03:48.630> mode<00:03:49.170> now<00:03:49.739> there<00:03:49.950> are

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
called the fall-off mode now there are

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.860 
called the fall-off mode now there are
four<00:03:50.430> different<00:03:50.459> fall-off<00:03:51.269> modes<00:03:51.540> one<00:03:51.840> is

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
four different fall-off modes one is

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.350 
four different fall-off modes one is
called<00:03:52.200> volume<00:03:52.470> which<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.250> default<00:03:53.430> now

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
called volume which is the default now

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.820 
called volume which is the default now
this<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.690> actually<00:03:54.840> just<00:03:55.230> determines<00:03:55.739> a

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
this is actually just determines a

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.250 
this is actually just determines a
volume<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.820> fall-off<00:03:57.269> so<00:03:57.570> basically<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.230> just

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
volume of fall-off so basically it just

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.699 
volume of fall-off so basically it just
kind<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.010> creates<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.670> circle<00:04:00.300> around<00:04:00.870> whatever

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
kind of creates a circle around whatever

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.170 
kind of creates a circle around whatever
it<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.850> select<00:04:04.280> surface<00:04:05.280> walks

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
it is that you select surface walks

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.020 
it is that you select surface walks
along<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.110> actual<00:04:07.290> surface<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.580> object

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
along the actual surface of the object

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.449 
along the actual surface of the object
so<00:04:09.090> for<00:04:09.269> example<00:04:09.600> if<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.780> had<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.930> teapot<00:04:10.560> with

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
so for example if you had a teapot with

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.090 
so for example if you had a teapot with
a<00:04:11.489> spout<00:04:11.970> going<00:04:12.450> out<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:13.170> would<00:04:13.530> actually<00:04:13.709> have

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
a spout going out it would actually have

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.400 
a spout going out it would actually have
to<00:04:14.310> go<00:04:14.670> along<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.330> surface<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.930> order<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.200> get

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
to go along the surface in order to get

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.170 
to go along the surface in order to get
to<00:04:16.440> those<00:04:16.709> vertices<00:04:17.100> sometimes<00:04:17.910> that's<00:04:18.090> a

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
to those vertices sometimes that's a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.120 
to those vertices sometimes that's a
little<00:04:18.209> bit<00:04:18.540> more<00:04:18.660> handy<00:04:19.109> now<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.709> one<00:04:19.919> I

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
little bit more handy now the one I

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.610 
little bit more handy now the one I
really<00:04:20.459> like<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:20.880> called<00:04:21.120> global<00:04:21.959> now<00:04:22.410> this

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
really like is called global now this

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.350 
really like is called global now this
works<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:23.010> little<00:04:23.220> bit<00:04:23.490> differently<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.120> I'm

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
works a little bit differently so I'm

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.060 
works a little bit differently so I'm
actually<00:04:24.510> going<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.810> have<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.050> model<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.500> second

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
actually going to have to model a second

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.529 
actually going to have to model a second
object<00:04:26.250> here<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:26.789> I'm<00:04:26.880> going<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.030> go<00:04:27.120> back<00:04:27.300> into

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
object here so I'm going to go back into

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.140 
object here so I'm going to go back into
object<00:04:28.020> mode<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.950> I'm<00:04:29.700> going<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:29.910> go<00:04:30.030> ahead

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
object mode and I'm going to go ahead

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.590 
object mode and I'm going to go ahead
and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
and

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.290 
and
this<00:04:30.870> sphere<00:04:31.260> up<00:04:31.440> above<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:32.310> grid<00:04:32.640> here<00:04:32.670> and

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
this sphere up above this grid here and

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.790 
this sphere up above this grid here and
I'm<00:04:33.900> going<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.080> go<00:04:34.200> ahead<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.560> select

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
I'm going to go ahead and select

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.520 
I'm going to go ahead and select
polygonal<00:04:35.610> plain<00:04:36.120> now<00:04:36.840> go<00:04:37.020> ahead<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.200> draw<00:04:37.500> a

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
polygonal plain now go ahead and draw a

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.100 
polygonal plain now go ahead and draw a
plane<00:04:37.890> on<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.280> surface<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:38.970> again<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:39.810> want<00:04:40.080> to

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
plane on the surface and again I want to

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.660 
plane on the surface and again I want to
give<00:04:40.230> a<00:04:40.260> little<00:04:40.620> bit<00:04:40.740> of<00:04:40.860> detail<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:41.460> I'm<00:04:41.550> going

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
give a little bit of detail so I'm going

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.030 
give a little bit of detail so I'm going
to<00:04:41.700> go<00:04:41.820> into<00:04:42.060> inputs<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:42.990> four<00:04:43.740> subdivisions

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
to go into inputs and four subdivisions

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.130 
to go into inputs and four subdivisions
for<00:04:44.670> width<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.000> height<00:04:45.270> let's<00:04:45.600> go<00:04:45.750> ahead<00:04:45.870> and

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
for width and height let's go ahead and

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.080 
for width and height let's go ahead and
just<00:04:46.260> type<00:04:46.500> in<00:04:46.650> eight<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.160> I've<00:04:47.250> got<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.610> little

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
just type in eight so I've got a little

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.310 
just type in eight so I've got a little
bit<00:04:48.240> more<00:04:48.290> detail<00:04:49.290> here<00:04:49.590> on<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:50.450> plane<00:04:51.450> so

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
bit more detail here on this plane so

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.410 
bit more detail here on this plane so
now<00:04:52.440> I've<00:04:52.620> got<00:04:52.800> two<00:04:53.040> objects<00:04:53.520> I've<00:04:53.610> got<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
now I've got two objects I've got the

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.440 
now I've got two objects I've got the
actual<00:04:54.780> sphere<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.640> the<00:04:56.640> plane<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.180> notice

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
actual sphere and the plane and notice

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.390 
actual sphere and the plane and notice
how<00:04:57.600> now<00:04:57.780> when<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:58.050> select<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.680> sphere<00:04:59.160> it's

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
how now when I select the sphere it's

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.700 
how now when I select the sphere it's
actually<00:05:00.210> affecting<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.080> plane<00:05:01.350> that's

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
actually affecting the plane that's

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.670 
actually affecting the plane that's
because<00:05:01.980> I<00:05:02.010> have<00:05:02.310> global<00:05:03.090> turned<00:05:03.540> on<00:05:03.840> if<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.500> go

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
because I have global turned on if I go

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.480 
because I have global turned on if I go
back<00:05:04.920> to<00:05:04.950> volume<00:05:05.640> it's<00:05:05.910> just<00:05:06.450> going<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.690> affect

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
back to volume it's just going to affect

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.330 
back to volume it's just going to affect
the<00:05:08.490> volume<00:05:08.970> within<00:05:09.420> the<00:05:09.900> sphere<00:05:10.320> if<00:05:10.500> I<00:05:11.100> go<00:05:11.280> to

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
the volume within the sphere if I go to

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.790 
the volume within the sphere if I go to
surface<00:05:12.270> again<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.990> goes<00:05:13.080> along<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.590> surface

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
surface again it goes along the surface

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.640 
surface again it goes along the surface
if<00:05:14.160> I<00:05:14.280> go<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.460> global<00:05:14.880> it<00:05:15.390> actually<00:05:16.170> affects

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
if I go to global it actually affects

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.100 
if I go to global it actually affects
separate<00:05:17.520> objects<00:05:17.910> that<00:05:18.090> are<00:05:18.240> nearby<00:05:18.480> so<00:05:18.690> for

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
separate objects that are nearby so for

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.020 
separate objects that are nearby so for
example<00:05:19.440> if<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.620> select<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.790> vertices

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
example if I select it just the vertices

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.360 
example if I select it just the vertices
on<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.360> bottom<00:05:21.870> you'll<00:05:22.350> notice<00:05:22.470> it<00:05:22.890> now<00:05:22.920> it's

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
on the bottom you'll notice it now it's

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.190 
on the bottom you'll notice it now it's
kind<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.670> jumping<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.420> gap<00:05:24.690> to<00:05:25.560> this

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
kind of jumping the gap to this

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.310 
kind of jumping the gap to this
particular<00:05:28.220> plane<00:05:29.220> so<00:05:29.940> I<00:05:29.970> can<00:05:30.180> actually<00:05:30.390> move

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
particular plane so I can actually move

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.230 
particular plane so I can actually move
these<00:05:31.590> vertices<00:05:31.920> and<00:05:32.280> actually<00:05:32.610> have<00:05:33.030> the

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
these vertices and actually have the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.570 
these vertices and actually have the
plane<00:05:33.600> follow<00:05:34.080> along<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:34.890> is<00:05:35.040> really<00:05:35.340> cool

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
plane follow along this is really cool

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.600 
plane follow along this is really cool
and<00:05:36.420> even<00:05:36.570> if<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:36.930> go<00:05:37.050> into<00:05:37.200> object<00:05:37.740> mode<00:05:37.800> I<00:05:38.250> can

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
and even if I go into object mode I can

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.060 
and even if I go into object mode I can
actually<00:05:39.000> use<00:05:39.420> this<00:05:39.720> almost<00:05:40.470> as<00:05:40.650> kind<00:05:40.920> of<00:05:40.980> like

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
actually use this almost as kind of like

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.630 
actually use this almost as kind of like
a<00:05:41.100> magnet<00:05:41.790> way<00:05:42.060> to<00:05:42.810> manipulate<00:05:43.590> that<00:05:44.130> surface

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
a magnet way to manipulate that surface

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.660 
a magnet way to manipulate that surface
so<00:05:44.760> I<00:05:44.820> think<00:05:44.910> that's<00:05:45.210> actually<00:05:45.630> pretty<00:05:45.870> cool

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
so I think that's actually pretty cool

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.740 
so I think that's actually pretty cool
I'm<00:05:47.670> going<00:05:47.820> to<00:05:47.880> go<00:05:47.940> back<00:05:48.120> into<00:05:48.300> object<00:05:48.690> mode

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
I'm going to go back into object mode

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.560 
I'm going to go back into object mode
and<00:05:49.080> delete<00:05:49.440> this<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:50.270> I'm<00:05:51.270> going<00:05:51.390> to<00:05:51.420> put

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
and delete this and I'm going to put

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.420 
and delete this and I'm going to put
myself<00:05:51.690> back<00:05:52.170> to<00:05:52.470> volume<00:05:52.770> mode<00:05:53.070> in<00:05:53.160> fact<00:05:53.310> I'm

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
myself back to volume mode in fact I'm

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.130 
myself back to volume mode in fact I'm
going<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.640> take<00:05:53.820> off<00:05:54.030> soft<00:05:54.360> select<00:05:54.750> here<00:05:55.020> and

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
going to take off soft select here and

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.720 
going to take off soft select here and
I'm<00:05:55.530> going<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.680> show<00:05:55.800> you<00:05:55.830> one<00:05:56.130> more<00:05:56.160> thing<00:05:56.370> and

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
I'm going to show you one more thing and

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.460 
I'm going to show you one more thing and
that's<00:05:56.790> called<00:05:57.150> reflection<00:05:57.780> settings<00:05:58.170> now

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
that's called reflection settings now

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.470 
that's called reflection settings now
with<00:05:58.710> any<00:05:58.980> object<00:05:59.520> you<00:05:59.550> can<00:05:59.730> also<00:05:59.880> do<00:06:00.240> what's

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
with any object you can also do what's

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.210 
with any object you can also do what's
called<00:06:00.660> reflections<00:06:01.380> so<00:06:01.500> if<00:06:01.620> you<00:06:01.740> want<00:06:01.950> to<00:06:02.040> do

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
called reflections so if you want to do

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.760 
called reflections so if you want to do
symmetrical<00:06:03.210> modeling<00:06:03.720> you<00:06:04.170> can<00:06:04.200> do<00:06:04.470> it<00:06:04.590> so

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
symmetrical modeling you can do it so

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.230 
symmetrical modeling you can do it so
I'm<00:06:04.890> going<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.100> go<00:06:05.190> ahead<00:06:05.280> back<00:06:05.550> into<00:06:05.880> vertex

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
I'm going to go ahead back into vertex

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.870 
I'm going to go ahead back into vertex
mode<00:06:06.420> select<00:06:07.320> some<00:06:07.500> vertices<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:08.280> now<00:06:08.670> when<00:06:08.850> I

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
mode select some vertices and now when I

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.090 
mode select some vertices and now when I
turn<00:06:09.210> on<00:06:09.240> reflection<00:06:10.110> notice<00:06:10.860> how<00:06:11.040> the

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
turn on reflection notice how the

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.480 
turn on reflection notice how the
vertices<00:06:11.580> on<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.000> opposite<00:06:12.750> side<00:06:13.050> show<00:06:14.040> up<00:06:14.250> so

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
vertices on the opposite side show up so

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.950 
vertices on the opposite side show up so
now<00:06:14.670> I<00:06:14.940> can<00:06:15.420> model<00:06:15.840> symmetrically<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:16.920> I<00:06:17.670> can

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
now I can model symmetrically and I can

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.230 
now I can model symmetrically and I can
reflect<00:06:18.960> this<00:06:19.110> around<00:06:19.470> any<00:06:19.710> axis<00:06:20.340> that<00:06:20.640> I<00:06:20.700> want

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
reflect this around any axis that I want

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.670 
reflect this around any axis that I want
so<00:06:21.420> if<00:06:21.510> I<00:06:21.570> want<00:06:21.750> to<00:06:21.810> reflect<00:06:22.050> around<00:06:22.320> the<00:06:22.530> y

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
so if I want to reflect around the y

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.760 
so if I want to reflect around the y
axis<00:06:23.250> the<00:06:23.460> z<00:06:23.880> axis<00:06:24.630> in<00:06:24.840> this<00:06:24.960> particular<00:06:25.560> case

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
axis the z axis in this particular case

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.310 
axis the z axis in this particular case
we<00:06:26.370> want<00:06:26.550> to<00:06:26.610> reflect<00:06:26.880> along<00:06:27.420> X<00:06:27.690> which<00:06:28.050> you<00:06:28.200> can

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
we want to reflect along X which you can

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.580 
we want to reflect along X which you can
see<00:06:28.530> is<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:29.130> right<00:06:29.490> left<00:06:29.760> axis<00:06:30.270> here<00:06:30.660> we<00:06:31.410> can

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
see is the right left axis here we can

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
see is the right left axis here we can
do<00:06:31.740> that<00:06:31.920> and<00:06:32.250> we<00:06:32.790> can<00:06:32.940> also<00:06:34.370> do<00:06:35.370> that<00:06:35.550> with

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
do that and we can also do that with

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.560 
do that and we can also do that with
soft<00:06:36.180> select<00:06:36.600> to<00:06:37.320> actually<00:06:37.740> do<00:06:38.310> both<00:06:39.030> so<00:06:39.330> I<00:06:39.360> can

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
soft select to actually do both so I can

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.450 
soft select to actually do both so I can
actually<00:06:39.720> do<00:06:39.990> reflective<00:06:40.590> modeling<00:06:41.040> with

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
actually do reflective modeling with

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.300 
actually do reflective modeling with
soft<00:06:41.760> select<00:06:42.120> to<00:06:42.510> get<00:06:42.660> very<00:06:43.110> organic<00:06:43.710> modeling

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
soft select to get very organic modeling

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.830 
soft select to get very organic modeling
and<00:06:44.400> make<00:06:44.790> it<00:06:44.910> symmetrical<00:06:45.420> so<00:06:45.630> if<00:06:45.720> you're

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
and make it symmetrical so if you're

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.330 
and make it symmetrical so if you're
modeling<00:06:46.139> a<00:06:46.290> character<00:06:46.770> or<00:06:46.860> something

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
modeling a character or something

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.950 
modeling a character or something
and<00:06:47.430> you<00:06:47.820> want<00:06:47.970> to<00:06:48.030> work<00:06:48.240> on<00:06:48.389> the<00:06:48.540> left<00:06:48.720> side

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
and you want to work on the left side

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.170 
and you want to work on the left side
you<00:06:49.500> can<00:06:49.680> also<00:06:49.860> have<00:06:50.160> the<00:06:50.280> right<00:06:50.460> side<00:06:50.700> follow

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
you can also have the right side follow

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.550 
you can also have the right side follow
along<00:06:52.280> so<00:06:53.280> those<00:06:53.520> are<00:06:53.669> some<00:06:53.790> of<00:06:53.850> the<00:06:53.940> basics<00:06:54.419> of

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
along so those are some of the basics of

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.530 
along so those are some of the basics of
soft<00:06:55.560> select<00:06:55.919> which<00:06:56.100> really<00:06:56.520> works<00:06:56.850> well<00:06:57.240> for

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540 
soft select which really works well for

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.570 
soft select which really works well for
organic<00:06:58.470> modeling<00:06:58.889> and<00:06:59.010> I'm<00:06:59.100> sure<00:06:59.280> you'll<00:06:59.460> be

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
organic modeling and I'm sure you'll be

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.220 
organic modeling and I'm sure you'll be
using<00:06:59.790> a<00:06:59.970> lot<00:07:00.000> of<00:07:00.150> these<00:07:00.389> techniques<00:07:00.810> as<00:07:01.080> you

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
using a lot of these techniques as you

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.379 
using a lot of these techniques as you
build<00:07:01.470> things<00:07:01.650> like<00:07:01.950> characters<00:07:02.610> and<00:07:02.880> other

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
build things like characters and other

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.830 
build things like characters and other
organic<00:07:04.050> objects
