00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello today i will show how 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.330
 cook homemade caramel for 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.120
 this we need a tablespoon 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.450
 sugar capacity which you can flush 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.160
 I took sugar for this Turk 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.160
 Wet the container before washing. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.970
 pour 3 spoons of sugar 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.040
 Shuffle before drowning 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.440
 cook then where are we going for not 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.989
 do i take this parchment for 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.250
 baking and cut out of here 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:55.449
 a piece of 50 by 50 centimeters also 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:01:13.320
 put it on a big plate of grub 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:13.320
 and put our feed on fire 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.550
 we must wait until it is a little bit 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:36.050
 melt it stirring 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:39.950
 fire all the time 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.150
 average if you cook and at the same time 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.930
 don't add a little water there well i 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:52.240
 for this you just wet the Turk then you 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.240
 it will turn out burnt cruz caramel 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:07.640
 here is our caramel practically yours 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:09.590
 melted the edges pour out here caramel i 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.380
 already were but just if I shot in 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.380
 this time, she would quickly freeze as 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.510
 caramel freezes for 30 seconds 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.600
 so if you start preparing 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.370
 on a plate and pergamum for baking and after 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.400
 how to melt the koran 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.850
 you will get something frozen 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.090
 turkey 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.370
 you just have to throw this three away 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.060
 days wait two minutes while she 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.060
 will harden 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.040
 see that your hair did not get there 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.690
 and it will be hairy to the frame instead 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.020
 to start just you can go there 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.090
 drip a tablespoon of juice then 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.430
 caramel will turn out with taste for example 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.000
 apple 3 high select 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.280
 if you are afraid 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.140
 and on which super prepared that 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.120
 never feed relate not 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.100
 worry just fill it up 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.550
 edges 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.920
 sugar melts very quickly when extremely 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.920
 stuck on is easily different from paper 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.099
 can it also 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.069
 mother and get candy and maybe you 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.750
 rule or while cooking on 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.420
 some stick then you also 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.160
 all chupa chups which by the way does not contain 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.160
 dyes and additives 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.680
 the main thing is not to burn yourself like I just 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.680
