00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
and the craft for us because we really

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.899 
and the craft for us because we really
wanted<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:10.989> make<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.319> life<00:04:11.530> but<00:04:11.889> they<00:04:12.730> are

tough<00:04:13.180> weekend<00:04:13.720> as<00:04:13.930> we<00:04:14.530> had<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.680> 30<00:04:14.950> mile<00:04:15.129> an

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
tough weekend as we had a 30 mile an

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.640 
tough weekend as we had a 30 mile an
hour<00:04:15.280> tailwind<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.870> think<00:04:17.349> we<00:04:17.470> had<00:04:17.620> a

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
hour tailwind and I think we had a

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.439 
hour tailwind and I think we had a
little<00:04:17.799> bit<00:04:18.009> too<00:04:18.190> much<00:04:18.400> knows<00:04:18.729> weight<00:04:19.030> on<00:04:19.239> it

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
little bit too much knows weight on it

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.589 
little bit too much knows weight on it
and<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:20.049> clap<00:04:20.289> the<00:04:20.650> craft<00:04:20.919> glue<00:04:21.430> very<00:04:21.820> well<00:04:22.120> it

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
and the clap the craft glue very well it

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.140 
and the clap the craft glue very well it
just<00:04:22.660> flew<00:04:23.020> straight<00:04:23.289> down<00:04:23.620> so<00:04:24.099> i<00:04:24.370> think<00:04:24.849> we

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
just flew straight down so i think we

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.909 
just flew straight down so i think we
had<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.539> we<00:04:25.930> set<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.289> record<00:04:26.440> for<00:04:26.650> the

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
had the we set the record for the

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.529 
had the we set the record for the
shortest<00:04:27.310> flight<00:04:27.669> i<00:04:27.789> think<00:04:28.120> we<00:04:28.210> went<00:04:28.360> about

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
shortest flight i think we went about

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.490 
shortest flight i think we went about
eight<00:04:28.780> feet<00:04:29.110> so<00:04:29.470> uh<00:04:29.520> there's<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.610> lot<00:04:30.789> of<00:04:30.820> fun

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
eight feet so uh there's a lot of fun

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.020 
eight feet so uh there's a lot of fun
hopefully<00:04:32.500> we'll<00:04:33.130> get<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.310> do<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.639> again<00:04:33.699> in

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
hopefully we'll get to do it again in

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.870 
hopefully we'll get to do it again in
one<00:04:34.270> day<00:04:34.509> but<00:04:35.320> maybe<00:04:35.949> one<00:04:36.280> of<00:04:36.310> these<00:04:36.460> days<00:04:36.520> I'm
