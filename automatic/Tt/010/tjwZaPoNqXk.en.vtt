00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.059
 hi to all and nice big gamer is to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.370
 orders today of what's going to be 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.170
 a tiny video destiny you do not 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.060
 dreams not that it's been a long time since 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 I had that I had not proposed 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.279
 on my channel and we are on the pvp on 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.769
 the multiplayer simply with 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.260
 clips recover with weapons exo dems 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.369
 and exotic that anyway it's 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.170
 the icebreaker that I have in hand the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.059
 particularity of this slate carried out the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.500
 unlock by having a number of 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.620
 strange pieces i do not know if you can the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.969
 loot going we will say on wood on 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.010
 the different raids etc 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.420
 raoult in possible missions in 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.980
 cooperation I have no idea 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 personally I bought it I think about 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.239
 little this strange piece at the time the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 icebreaker a sniper who's charging and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.260
 which one shot almost all have in 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.370
 multiplayer as long as you're aiming the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.520
 upper body we are not here to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.449
 talk about weapons in few to destine 1 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.260
 frankly that they are really 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.879
 interesting 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.430
 there are a lot of weapons there are not bad 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.280
 of interesting mechanisms r it's a 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.110
 style of play that suits me well because 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.890
 that anyone does not frighten you on his 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.350
 fps legs 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.840
 Speaking of that I'll go quickly 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.890
 announce anyway the games that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.170
 I am waiting and who will arrive 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.270
 soon on my youtube channel but 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.430
 first of all I wanted to approach a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.869
 little subject my evolution actually 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.720
 very empty or super short 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.790
 honestly it is simple this year you 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.310
 I noticed they're still coding 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.479
 of the fifa battlefield will be very 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.060
 soon hard and do not worry 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.159
 not for that of the top 10 and that's the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.509
 trick is to diversify even more and 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.820
 I take a crazy pleasure because I 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.920
 really gosh me ok there are a lot of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.930
 people who prefer me exclusively 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.320
 on the fps where the top 10 where fifa 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.119
 etc. 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.380
 but you have to understand one thing 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.520
 people is that as a measure of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.930
 I swear to you 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.659
 you too are going to want to test 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.430
 a lot of games to have fun and it's 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.320
 to me personally I have evolved I am 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.490
 feel good in the games I play 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.040
 otherwise I will not propose any 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.159
 content I do not force myself to do so 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.640
 avoided uh you for example who you are 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.650
 subscriber to my let's play on destiny or 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.410
 following the videos that I proposed on 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.780
 destiny or even on prague on call of 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.550
 duty black ops 2 and it's telling me 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.709
 all the time do this and that's it 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.000
 no I do not work like that I'm 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.040
 repeats quite often but it's because 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.630
 that I receive so often 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.030
 comments from people who tell me 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.040
 yeah did videos on if I love this 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.720
 game is all about me that you like this 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.110
 game so much better took me to the tibet super 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.180
 large 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.130
 there are plenty of other people who 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.870
 only one game and so on 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.880
 it's not my style my style it's 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.200
 discover there also novelties sometimes 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.790
 I have phases of gaming cider 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.140
 decades I can play for two 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.060
 month non-stop after I want completely 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.170
 the drop knows not to say so far as 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.220
 it's a bad game certainly not 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.550
 that is to say you go to something 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.200
 else 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.290
 there are novelties there is new 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.000
 style there are other pleasures it takes 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.280
 not that you cloister yourself only on one 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.230
 only style of play you can have fun on 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.030
 a lot of others I swear it's 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.470
 true but it's you who do not dare or 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.300
 well if you do not necessarily have the means I 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.320
 fully understand without that it 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.330
 are a lot of young people watching 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.010
 videos and that's fine but 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.660
 does not force you to fall youtuber 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.130
 between guillaume and making videos 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.019
 about the game you play because 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.940
 it's really very childish and grows up a 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.090
 little is a little more mature montpetit 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.410
 plump of a word I say I'm trying to you 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.420
 after I say my little plump love 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.799
 Anyway I can not say bullshit 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.079
 you noticed them now my soul 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.670
 secondary is nerves and second 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.500
 gameplay part you will see once 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.060
 that I will drop that I will be in mode 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.829
 shock and the match over decades 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.940
 exactly matches the same team 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.549
 deathmatch for those who would know 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.280
 not the name of the game modes I would be 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.440
 went pidaf it's a legendary weapon and 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.700
 which is ok extremely good I you the 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.900
 promise the team are not 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.100
 exceptional I realized a lot 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.390
 better but that's what I had under the 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.920
 hand and I wanted to offer you 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.019
 of sneg because they are dead ends 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.600
 which is that they are very little played on the 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.310
 pvp fps in general in 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.560

 games that are extremely interesting 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.870
 surprises and games that are not 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.540

 videos in the good playlist everything is 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.750
 well organized but I do not want 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.250
 to wait every two days

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.800
 which happens following the dlc of far cry 4 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.270
 possibly a lot of epic moment 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.310
 on many other games etc 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.810

 these are videos that ask me a 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.639
 little more work compared to 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.680
