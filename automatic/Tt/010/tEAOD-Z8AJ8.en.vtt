pull it flat with that as well I'm

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.310 
pull it flat with that as well I'm
taking<00:00:20.610> the<00:00:20.640> center<00:00:20.940> of<00:00:21.090> safety<00:00:21.480> pin<00:00:21.690> out<00:00:21.870> and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
taking the center of safety pin out and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.320 
taking the center of safety pin out and
I've<00:00:22.770> also<00:00:22.950> brought<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.490> both<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:23.970> threads

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I've also brought my both of my threads

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.360 
I've also brought my both of my threads
up<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> top<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.290> I<00:00:25.440> can<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:26.190> where

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
up to the top so that I can see where

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.540 
up to the top so that I can see where
they<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.520> and<00:00:26.940> then<00:00:27.800> clip<00:00:28.800> them<00:00:28.980> easier

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
they are and then clip them easier

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.040 
they are and then clip them easier
instead<00:00:29.790> of<00:00:29.910> having<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.270> clip<00:00:30.480> from<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.780> front

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
instead of having to clip from the front

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.150 
instead of having to clip from the front
and<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> back<00:00:32.690> and<00:00:33.690> make<00:00:33.870> sure<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.410> have

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.959 
and the back and make sure that I have
everything<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.760> flat<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.920> I<00:00:37.920> start<00:00:38.730> my

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
everything out flat and I start my

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.490 
everything out flat and I start my
sewing<00:00:39.179> machine

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.849 

meandering

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.489 

see<00:00:52.160> I<00:00:52.190> have<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:52.519> gentle<00:00:53.480> rocking<00:00:53.719> motion<00:00:54.289> going

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
see I have a gentle rocking motion going

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.420 
see I have a gentle rocking motion going
I'm<00:00:54.769> not<00:00:54.890> going<00:00:55.159> too<00:00:55.339> fast

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.970 

Oh

Oh

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.610 
Oh
and<00:01:00.220> then<00:01:00.670> also<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.090> make<00:01:01.390> sure<00:01:01.720> that

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
and then also I make sure that

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.330 
and then also I make sure that
I'm<00:01:04.000> moving<00:01:05.000> my<00:01:05.650> piece<00:01:06.650> my<00:01:07.190> place<00:01:07.460> man

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
I'm moving my piece my place man

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.330

yeah

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
yeah

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.680 
yeah
regular<00:01:10.759> pace<00:01:11.030> that's<00:01:11.570> how<00:01:11.810> you

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
regular pace that's how you

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.300 
regular pace that's how you
you<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> even<00:01:13.710> stitches

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
you have to even stitches

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.180 
you have to even stitches
and<00:01:15.729> that<00:01:15.940> doesn't<00:01:16.119> come<00:01:16.510> right<00:01:16.900> away<00:01:17.290> -<00:01:17.470> it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
and that doesn't come right away - it

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:36.220 
and that doesn't come right away - it
takes<00:01:18.460> some<00:01:18.700> practice

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.470 

I<00:01:36.320> get<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:36.950> us<00:01:37.100> sake<00:01:37.400> a<00:01:37.670> place<00:01:37.970> where<00:01:38.210> safety

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
I get to us sake a place where safety

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.600 
I get to us sake a place where safety
finish<00:01:39.050> I<00:01:39.320> just<00:01:39.590> stop<00:01:39.890> with<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.700> kneel<00:01:41.030> down

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
finish I just stop with the kneel down

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.010 
finish I just stop with the kneel down
get<00:01:43.610> out

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.249 

and<00:01:50.560> continue<00:01:51.280> on<00:01:51.460> making<00:01:52.360> sure<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.930> my

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
and continue on making sure that my

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.749 
and continue on making sure that my
machine's<00:01:53.649> going<00:01:53.920> forward

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.850 

this<00:01:59.479> powder<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.049> just<00:02:00.200> make<00:02:00.409> it<00:02:00.439> up<00:02:00.649> as<00:02:00.799> you

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
this powder you just make it up as you

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.570 
this powder you just make it up as you
go

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.570 

the<00:02:05.580> space<00:02:05.910> is<00:02:06.180> evenly<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:08.280> also

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
the space is evenly and also

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.530 
the space is evenly and also
I<00:02:10.610> try<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.240> make<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.480> point

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
I try to make a point

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.900 
I try to make a point
of<00:02:13.019> going<00:02:13.790> over<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.299> scenes

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
of going over the scenes

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.190 
of going over the scenes
that<00:02:17.360> locks<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.960> down

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
that locks and down

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.790 
that locks and down
a<00:02:20.230> lot<00:02:20.650> longer<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.220> can<00:02:21.489> take<00:02:22.349> all<00:02:23.349> kinds<00:02:23.739> of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
a lot longer and can take all kinds of

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.820 
a lot longer and can take all kinds of
where<00:02:24.010> we

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
where we

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.850 
where we
where<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> scenes<00:02:26.460> are

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.250 

you<00:02:31.370> can<00:02:31.580> see<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.590 

too<00:02:34.530> tight<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:36.769> stitches<00:02:37.769> aren't<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.849> close

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.560 

so<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:42.990> just<00:02:43.200> meandering<00:02:44.240> if<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.420> want

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
so this is just meandering if you want

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.070 
so this is just meandering if you want
to<00:02:45.660> do<00:02:45.930> I'm<00:02:46.080> really<00:02:46.230> trite<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.510> make<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.660> very

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
to do I'm really trite and make it very

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.750 
to do I'm really trite and make it very
dense<00:02:49.380> hoping<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.190> when<00:02:50.370> he<00:02:50.460> comes

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.160 

takes<00:02:53.940> practice<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.810> would<00:02:54.959> suggest

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
takes practice and I would suggest

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.650 
takes practice and I would suggest
practicing<00:02:55.800> with

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
practicing with

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
practicing with
just<00:02:58.170> making<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.740> piece<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.240> the<00:03:00.240> material

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.500 

practicing<00:03:05.840> once<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:07.110> know<00:03:07.290> cow

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
practicing once you know cow

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.390 
practicing once you know cow
shuttle<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.379> your<00:03:10.560> machine<00:03:10.680> comfortably

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.610 

that's<00:03:16.400> all
