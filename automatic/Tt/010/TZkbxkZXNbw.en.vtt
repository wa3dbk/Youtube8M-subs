00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
in see there's the plane see now with

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.770 
in see there's the plane see now with
this<00:00:39.989> new<00:00:40.050> good<00:00:40.440> kamla<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.390> don't<00:00:42.390> wanna<00:00:42.540> have

this new good kamla I don't wanna have
to<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.430> statistics<00:00:44.430> picture<00:00:48.860> there's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to do this statistics picture there's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.000 
to do this statistics picture there's
all<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> physics<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.239> globe<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.809> woods<00:00:52.550> focus

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
all the physics the globe of woods focus

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.099 
all the physics the globe of woods focus
so<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.840> point

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
okay so then we have the actual plane

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.219 
okay so then we have the actual plane
now<00:01:16.510> let<00:01:16.780> me<00:01:16.810> just<00:01:16.900> keep<00:01:17.380> my<00:01:17.530> camera<00:01:17.920> also

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
where the focus that we have the plane

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.320 
where the focus that we have the plane
as<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.619> can<00:01:23.770> see<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.220> pretty<00:01:24.520> nice
