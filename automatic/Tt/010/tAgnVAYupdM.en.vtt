00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.020 
through again all k movements 2 to 3 6
12<00:02:54.909> to<00:02:55.209> 15<00:02:55.599> repetitions<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:57.400> swap<00:02:57.609> it<00:02:57.760> over<00:02:57.849> do

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
12 to 15 repetitions we swap it over do

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.960 
12 to 15 repetitions we swap it over do
the<00:02:58.060> other<00:02:58.299> side<00:03:00.450> then<00:03:01.450> we<00:03:01.540> can<00:03:01.689> work<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the other side then we can work the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.379 
the other side then we can work the
abductor<00:03:03.970> muscle<00:03:04.299> then<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:06.790> basically<00:03:07.239> just

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
abductor muscle then it's basically just

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.229 
abductor muscle then it's basically just
raising<00:03:08.260> out<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.530> side<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.150> an

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
raising out the side this is an

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.970 
raising out the side this is an
effectiveness<00:03:13.750> as<00:03:14.049> squats<00:03:14.530> but<00:03:14.769> what<00:03:14.889> it

effectiveness as squats but what it

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.039 
effectiveness as squats but what it
basically<00:03:15.129> does<00:03:15.519> do<00:03:15.939> is<00:03:16.209> helps<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.810> strengthen

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
basically does do is helps to strengthen

if<00:03:31.050> we<00:03:31.170> do<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> problem<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.830> can<00:03:31.950> also<00:03:32.070> get<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
if we do a problem you can also get the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:41.860 
if we do a problem you can also get the
app<00:03:33.240> that<00:03:33.570> adapter<00:03:34.500> muscle
