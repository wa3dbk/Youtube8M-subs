00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
metal it count looks like this galaxy

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.209 
metal it count looks like this galaxy
alpha<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.540> still<00:00:33.750> looks<00:00:33.960> premium<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:35.070> also

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
alpha but still looks premium it also

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.139 
alpha but still looks premium it also
looks<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
looks like it's going to have a

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.990 
looks like it's going to have a
fingerprint<00:00:36.809> reader<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.670> button

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
fingerprint reader there on the button

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
fingerprint reader there on the button
because<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.870> looks<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
because it looks like it's going down a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.180 
because it looks like it's going down a
little<00:00:41.640> bit<00:00:42.200> hopefully<00:00:43.200> also<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.620> will<00:00:43.890> be

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
little bit hopefully also it will be

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
little bit hopefully also it will be
waterproof<00:00:44.940> without<00:00:45.510> any<00:00:45.899> flap<00:00:46.260> same<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
waterproof without any flap same as the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.619 
waterproof without any flap same as the
galaxy<00:00:47.039> s5<00:00:47.610> mini<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:48.180> I'm<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.570> sure

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
galaxy s5 mini but I'm really not sure

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
galaxy s5 mini but I'm really not sure
about<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:50.160> would<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.309> really

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
about that but that would be really

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.770 
about that but that would be really
really<00:00:50.910> nice<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.969> also<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.629> some

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
really nice so we can also see here some

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
really nice so we can also see here some
other<00:00:54.960> pictures<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> back<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
other pictures here on the back and I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.510 
other pictures here on the back and I
guess<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.570> looks<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.140> lot<00:00:58.320> more<00:00:58.379> premium<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.399> can

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
guess a looks a lot more premium you can

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.819 
guess a looks a lot more premium you can
also<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.390> see<00:01:00.690> X<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.469> kind<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.649> heart

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
also see you can see X and kind of heart

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.219 
also see you can see X and kind of heart
rate<00:01:01.980> sensor<00:01:02.160> there<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.640> well<00:01:03.110> remember<00:01:04.110> also

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
rate sensor there as well remember also

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.740 
rate sensor there as well remember also
this<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.680> use<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.949> fakes<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.519> whatever<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
this could use be fakes or whatever you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.850 
this could use be fakes or whatever you
can<00:01:06.900> still<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.290> course<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.740> S

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
can still see of course we have the S

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.340 
can still see of course we have the S
Pen<00:01:08.159> also<00:01:08.549> pyramid<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> 5.7<00:01:09.900> inch<00:01:09.960> display

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
Pen also pyramid see a 5.7 inch display

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.730 
Pen also pyramid see a 5.7 inch display
it<00:01:10.950> seems<00:01:11.460> which<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> same<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.439> are

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it seems which is the same as we are

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.999 
it seems which is the same as we are
having<00:01:14.520> right<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:16.380> also<00:01:16.530> looks<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
having right now it also looks like it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.600 
having right now it also looks like it
has<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> cool<00:01:17.520> design<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> back<00:01:19.610> which

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
has a cool design here on the back which

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.830 
has a cool design here on the back which
I<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.000> enjoy<00:01:22.549> also<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.939> camera<00:01:24.330> part

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I do enjoy also I like the camera part

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.359 
I do enjoy also I like the camera part
I'm<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.530> sure<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> back

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
I'm really not sure if I like the back

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.039 
I'm really not sure if I like the back
though<00:01:26.640> too<00:01:27.060> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> letter<00:01:27.570> back<00:01:27.810> or

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
though too kind of letter back or

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.660 
though too kind of letter back or
something<00:01:30.049> but<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> looks<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.130> could<00:01:32.640> be

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
something but it looks like it could be

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.210 
something but it looks like it could be
a<00:01:32.820> definitely<00:01:33.540> design<00:01:34.020> update<00:01:34.560> even<00:01:34.920> compared

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
a definitely design update even compared

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.999 
a definitely design update even compared
to<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> s5<00:01:35.759> galaxy<00:01:36.750> s5<00:01:37.020> seems<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.799> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to the s5 galaxy s5 seems like this is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
to the s5 galaxy s5 seems like this is
going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.670> more<00:01:38.700> premium<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.780> is

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
going to be way more premium if this is

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.260 
going to be way more premium if this is
the<00:01:40.020> real<00:01:40.320> deal<00:01:40.610> which<00:01:41.610> could<00:01:41.640> definitely<00:01:42.060> be

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the real deal which could definitely be

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.090 
the real deal which could definitely be
exciting<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.140> also<00:01:43.290> seems<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.860> might

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
exciting it also seems like we might

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.690 
exciting it also seems like we might
have<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.310> picture<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.420> retail<00:01:46.350> box<00:01:46.700> of

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
have a picture here of the retail box of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.670 
have a picture here of the retail box of
the<00:01:47.939> device<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:51.240> saying<00:01:51.479> 15<00:01:52.079> September

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the device so it is saying 15 September

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.830 
the device so it is saying 15 September
so<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.549> might<00:01:53.759> actually<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> date<00:01:54.540> when
