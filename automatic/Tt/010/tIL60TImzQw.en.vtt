could that way save some charms but I

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.980 
could that way save some charms but I
did<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.860> through<00:01:53.189> summoning<00:01:53.729> all<00:01:53.990> together

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
did go through summoning all together

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.800 
did go through summoning all together
from<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> start<00:01:55.439> i<00:01:55.890> think<00:01:56.100> i<00:01:56.189> started<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.810> 52

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
from the start i think i started with 52

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.940 
from the start i think i started with 52
summoning<00:01:58.320> maybe<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.799> then<00:01:59.670> ended<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:00.950> 61

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
summoning maybe and then ended with 61

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.219 
summoning maybe and then ended with 61
or<00:02:02.070> 62<00:02:02.460> summoning<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> got<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:03.840> her<00:02:03.960> can't

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
or 62 summoning so I got it up her can't

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.479 
or 62 summoning so I got it up her can't
wait<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.890> 67<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:06.180> 66<00:02:06.689> 67<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.649> 68<00:02:08.099> I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
wait to get to that 67 or 66 67 and 68 I

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.190 
wait to get to that 67 or 66 67 and 68 I
think<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.599> way<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.899> make<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
think it is that way I can make the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.160
