the<00:01:16.560> outfit<00:01:16.830> lightweight<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.729> good

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the outfit lightweight so that's a good

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.670 
the outfit lightweight so that's a good
start

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
start

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.800 
start
the<00:01:20.189> only<00:01:20.340> thing<00:01:20.549> obviously<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.630> how

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the only thing obviously you can see how

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
the only thing obviously you can see how
thin<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.430> swords<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:24.830> if<00:01:25.830> you've<00:01:25.979> got<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.460> bit

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
thin the swords are if you've got a bit

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.920 
thin the swords are if you've got a bit
wider<00:01:27.570> feet<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> might<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> problem<00:01:28.500> but

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
wider feet it might be a problem but

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.340 
wider feet it might be a problem but
obviously<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:32.420> think<00:01:33.420> it'd<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.600> too<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
obviously I think it'd be too much of a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:45.730 
obviously I think it'd be too much of a
problem<00:01:38.030> obviously<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:41.600> inside

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.600

it's on your butt other guessing that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.630 
it's on your butt other guessing that

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
means golden dream I'm not expert in

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
means golden dream I'm not expert in
Portuguese<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.140> guess

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
Portuguese but you know that's I guess

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:06.760 
Portuguese but you know that's I guess
not<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.740> ever<00:01:56.009> known<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.640> input<00:01:57.079> yeah<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:59.780> see

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.020 

yeah<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.920> said<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> thought<00:02:08.729> I'd<00:02:08.849> treat

myself but my birthday on the 11th
yesterday

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
yesterday

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.000 
yesterday
and<00:02:11.950> mine<00:02:12.790> aren't<00:02:12.969> perches<00:02:13.420> these<00:02:13.659> so<00:02:14.439> for<00:02:14.890> the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
and mine aren't perches these so for the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.289 
and mine aren't perches these so for the
one-day<00:02:15.310> delivery<00:02:15.549> that's<00:02:15.819> pretty<00:02:16.030> good<00:02:16.180> by

one-day delivery that's pretty good by

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.360 
one-day delivery that's pretty good by
night<00:02:16.569> I<00:02:16.870> think<00:02:17.379> this<00:02:17.859> would<00:02:17.980> be<00:02:18.010> one<00:02:18.219> of<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
night I think this would be one of the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.520 
night I think this would be one of the
first<00:02:18.579> videos<00:02:18.969> to<00:02:19.209> go<00:02:19.930> out<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.290> Lhasa
