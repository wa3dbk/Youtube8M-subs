really know much about him at all so I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
really know much about him at all so I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
thought why don't I'll call him Tootsie

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.969 
thought why don't I'll call him Tootsie
because<00:01:09.570> he<00:01:09.659> looks<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.080> Tutsi<00:01:10.439> girl<00:01:10.770> he's

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
because he looks like a Tutsi girl he's

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
because he looks like a Tutsi girl he's
brown<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.700> long<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.330> his<00:01:12.720> shape<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.110> his

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
brown and long like his shape of his

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.840 
brown and long like his shape of his
body<00:01:13.260> looks<00:01:13.770> exactly<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.400> tootsie<00:01:14.820> roll

body looks exactly like a tootsie roll

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
body looks exactly like a tootsie roll
so<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> started<00:01:15.720> calling<00:01:15.900> him<00:01:16.110> Tootsie<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.260 
that sounds the same to him
but<00:01:43.290> isn't<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.740> us<00:01:44.220> Hogan<00:01:44.700> sounds<00:01:45.030> exactly

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
but isn't to us Hogan sounds exactly

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.300 
but isn't to us Hogan sounds exactly
like<00:01:45.479> Logan<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.259> he<00:01:46.380> responds<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.130> he

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
like Logan and he responds to that he

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.800 
like Logan and he responds to that he
thing<00:01:47.520> he<00:01:47.640> knows<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.090> his<00:01:48.329> name<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
thing he knows that that's his name and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
thing he knows that that's his name and
I<00:01:48.869> thought<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.439> would<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.649> perfect<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.280> call

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
I thought it would be perfect to call

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.060 
I thought it would be perfect to call
him<00:01:50.640> Hogan<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:52.049> two<00:01:52.229> reasons<00:01:52.259> Hulk

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
him Hogan because for two reasons Hulk

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.100 
him Hogan because for two reasons Hulk
Hogan<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.240> big<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.600> muscular<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
Hogan is really big and muscular and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
Hogan is really big and muscular and
he's<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.770> little<00:01:56.159> shrimp<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.820> I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
he's just like a little shrimp so I

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.190 
he's just like a little shrimp so I
thought<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.240> would<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.360> really<00:01:57.450> cute<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
thought that would be really cute and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.760 
thought that would be really cute and
also<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:58.920> he<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.460> wiener<00:01:59.880> dog<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
also because he is a wiener dog and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.889 
also because he is a wiener dog and
Hogan<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.340> short<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.670> hoagie<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
Hogan can be short for hoagie and a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.200 
Hogan can be short for hoagie and a
hoagie<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.829> hot<00:02:05.100> dog<00:02:05.280> basically<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.149> I
