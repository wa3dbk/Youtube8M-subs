00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
now here I flipped a shotgun normal

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.010 
now here I flipped a shotgun normal
hoping<00:01:27.170> that<00:01:27.320> he<00:01:27.409> would<00:01:27.560> bite<00:01:27.740> on<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.960> on<00:01:29.960> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
hoping that he would bite on the on the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.810 
hoping that he would bite on the on the
screen<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:30.530> I<00:01:30.680> did<00:01:30.920> run<00:01:31.130> thinking<00:01:31.579> that<00:01:31.700> that

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
screen that I did run thinking that that

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.130 
screen that I did run thinking that that
would<00:01:31.939> be<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.420> would<00:01:32.570> attack<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.960> right

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
would be it so I would attack the right

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.710 
would be it so I would attack the right
side<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.560> field<00:01:33.829> boom<00:01:34.520> Reginald<00:01:35.390> tuddy

ran the cover for got the pic so that

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.670 
ran the cover for got the pic so that
was<00:03:33.470> big<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:33.769> we're<00:03:34.100> up<00:03:34.190> 14<00:03:34.670> nothing<00:03:35.000> with<00:03:35.180> ball

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
was big so we're up 14 nothing with ball

was big so we're up 14 nothing with ball
so<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.709> normally<00:03:37.549> would<00:03:37.700> clock<00:03:37.970> here<00:03:38.420> this

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
so I normally would clock here this

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.180 
so I normally would clock here this
would<00:03:38.959> be<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.110> situation<00:03:39.290> where<00:03:39.680> i<00:03:39.709> clawed<00:03:39.980> try

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
would be a situation where i clawed try

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.530 
would be a situation where i clawed try
