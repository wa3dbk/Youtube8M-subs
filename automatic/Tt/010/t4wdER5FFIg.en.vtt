you get your character rough drafts off
that's<00:01:15.729> when<00:01:15.880> I<00:01:15.940> go<00:01:16.210> ahead<00:01:16.479> in<00:01:16.630> i'll<00:01:16.869> choose

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
that's when I go ahead in i'll choose

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.590 
that's when I go ahead in i'll choose
which<00:01:17.799> characters<00:01:18.280> i<00:01:18.430> like<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:19.299> don't<00:01:19.540> like

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
which characters i like and don't like

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.070 
which characters i like and don't like
and<00:01:19.990> i'll<00:01:20.350> bring<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.649> to<00:01:20.950> see<00:01:21.880> narratives<00:01:22.420> what

and i'll bring it to see narratives what
not<00:01:23.290> don't<00:01:24.130> make<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.369> final<00:01:24.729> decision<00:01:24.759> on<00:01:25.330> who

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
not don't make the final decision on who

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.620 
not don't make the final decision on who
we<00:01:26.200> actually<00:01:26.380> want<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:26.830> put<00:01:26.950> in<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.100> gameplay

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
we actually want to put in the gameplay

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.520 
we actually want to put in the gameplay
and<00:01:28.630> then<00:01:28.869> once<00:01:29.799> we<00:01:29.979> chosen<00:01:30.369> our<00:01:30.789> characters

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and then once we chosen our characters

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.219 
and then once we chosen our characters
it's<00:01:32.530> hard<00:01:32.800> to<00:01:32.860> get<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.130> meat<00:01:34.200> stand<00:01:35.940> a<00:01:37.080> lot<00:01:38.080> of

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
it's hard to get a meat stand a lot of

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.710 
it's hard to get a meat stand a lot of
the<00:01:38.380> images<00:01:38.830> once<00:01:39.159> their<00:01:39.399> skin<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.030> they're

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
the images once their skin and they're

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.880 
the images once their skin and they're
really<00:01:40.960> dirty<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:42.990> their<00:01:43.990> scan<00:01:44.289> will<00:01:44.530> pick<00:01:44.710> up

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
really dirty so their scan will pick up

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.040 
really dirty so their scan will pick up
a<00:01:45.009> whole<00:01:45.159> bunch<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.610> dirt<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.210> debris<00:01:46.720> off

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
a whole bunch of the dirt and debris off

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.520 
a whole bunch of the dirt and debris off
of<00:01:47.110> years<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:47.979> had<00:01:48.670> pretty<00:01:49.060> much<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.229> what<00:01:50.470> I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
of years it had pretty much so what I

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.600 
of years it had pretty much so what I
was<00:01:50.590> doing<00:01:51.069> alternating<00:01:51.429> to<00:01:51.909> illustrator<00:01:52.420> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
was doing alternating to illustrator and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:04.830 
was doing alternating to illustrator and
