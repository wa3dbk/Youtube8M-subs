00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.060
 well, it's not everyone knows 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.470
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.720
 we end up at kraft could we 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.090
 echo tutorial in which you learn to 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.330
 create a vehicle a little bit of 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.430
 his daughters a truck firefighters 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.630
 so that changes a little bit of my 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.039
 usual tutors on the side I told myself 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.610
 why not change a little bit 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.140
 do no harm 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.130
 and since many other groups 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.150
 had asked to make vehicles 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.100
 I thought it would be nice to 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.679
 start so to do that we're going 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.839
 directly attacked the bottom of the vehicle 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.280
 the basics why then can the 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.420
 goes slowly little by little we are not 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.159
 at renault but briefly worry 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.170
 not so to do this we will start 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:45.699
 with the tires so the two letters 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.530
 black with buttons so that's it 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.120
 starts with two blocks the hall next 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.710
 of them who in fact will be the tires that 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.359
 will be located at the rear of the vehicle 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.949
 you let hint pass between the two 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.359
 then leave you 3 10 passes and then 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.440
 you ask another one and you make the 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.089
 same thing symmetrically from 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.819
 the other side since another truck will be 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.619
 3 of width and it will be 11 in 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:04.239
 length then you will have 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.840
 vehicle and so you put the bottom of the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.850
 bodywork so hold 2 a behind the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.020
 last wheel you fill in between 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.910
 wheels and you put two back to the front 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.810
 then we complete like these and 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.950
 you do something else 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.700
 since obviously the vehicle will be 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.900
 symmetrical we are not young 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.360
 hesitate between Chinese and Portuguese goal 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.000
 I did not know which was said worse ben 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.380
 now listen we'll go to the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.270
 red terracotta since obviously a 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.420
 fire truck is necessarily 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.130
 red we first make a pretty f 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.630
 so the f how do you see it you 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.920
 you turn your head to the right of your 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.390
 screen and do not take the screen it 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.950
 was not facing you a yeah 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.340
 okay so next you'll come 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.600
 like this you go up again your 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.490
 watch out I'm doing little nonsense 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.280
 here you go on like this so the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.890
 lotus bubble f1 utac are on the sides 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.120
 blain plastered you leave a space 2 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.200
 you go up a little column clue 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.090
 goes from 2 you put a little 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.620
 globe column this if you do the same 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.240
 thing two sides again and we 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.340
 fills with the back of our truck 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.790
 like that now drummer of the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.560
 vehicle 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.790
 we complete the soil with small nodal 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.550
 effective then actually the 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.590
 complete hop this and now we're going 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.269
 complete interior by filling in with 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.469
 red so again the same 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.340
 material previously used is to 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.440
 say red clay so clay 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.819
 so here is the arna the base of other beautiful 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.310
 trucks we can confirm tomorrow for 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.290
 just leave 3 2 places now that 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.180
 this is made of stone slabs you 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.010
 go to the sides of your wheels then 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.340
 just forget to put the buttons on 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.290
 on the wheels here you go on 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.180
 the side of the waters you have laid so a 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.440
 slab above the previous one and on 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.510
 the wheel like these wanted it's at 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.250
 padua blacks and we share space 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.890
 then on this column of agreement so 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.780
 the road free road feria we redo the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.670
 same thing here we eat two bombs 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.549
 of two and one poses and now you 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.280
 go ahead with your slab up 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.910
 the front of the vehicle to the top 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.819
 as this is access to both 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.410
 baby vehicles here you do not put anything 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.420
 leave you open and there you have built 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.220
 something that is 2.2 to fine 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.769
 now we will equip ourselves with quartz 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.000
 then you can take the quartz that 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.620
 you can take blocks to do 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.150
 the most realistic on the blog to close 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.099
 knowing that the most recent quartet like 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.230
 block is prettier and more aesthetic 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.329
 I prefer quartz blocks unless 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.200
 obviously you play with a pack of 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.579
 textures a little particular that 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.859
 obviously take a little bit more hands 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.269
 your other do so now you 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.350
 will use that for the ladder you 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.870
 go forward to the front of the vehicle 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.420
 like this with your quartz block 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.340
 here is now above this blog of 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.410
 corner that will pose the scales poses some 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.780
 traditional rails that is to say the rail 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.319
 normal or then the trigger rail for 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.319
 a being 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.579
 we will say in color reminder always 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.480
 noises on there to be a little 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.220
 little still in reality 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.870
 so we were the broken down rail as 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.090
 these and we put it here good at the 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.040
 perfect in front of you on raising your 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.380
 first slab and now we're going 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.810
 take the windows so we take a 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.940
 glass and we take a window so 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.880
 will invite the break to the back for 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.560
 so do the driver's life here 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.750
 at the tech coupe of the big windows of 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.040
 big worm and on the sides we ask 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.519
 two on the glass for fa 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.950
 wing mirror 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.319
 it's pretty rare until then I think and 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.120
 it's pretty pretty now decoration 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.060
 take the ladders to get me here 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.889
 and here it is another one the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.310
 windows and after you leave dr claude 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.810
 empty 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.729
 the second place here is leave you 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.739
 we fill three years go here you 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.850
 explain after why are you done 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.470
 things from other sides 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.780
 here's the gift how's that 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.640
 having the mouth it like that but 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.390
 not because it's me who do 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.530
 now let's go to the art of 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.390
 vehicle so to do that we're going 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.680
 take hooks if I have to you 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.270
 you in the earlier version produce 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.370
 levers off the hook by placing them at 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.780
 above and now we have more or less 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.030
 I do not know if you see me I see him 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.740
 we see the spears a center so that 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.270
 it is standing in fact bottom the end of 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.440
 fire hoses and that's it 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.540
 imagine pretty hard because I did not 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.190
 failed to find a compromise 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.170
 among all the blogs that there was for 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.210
 to actually make the barrel in which one 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.500
 roll up these famous spear I can you 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.760
 propose a small idea admits of 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.720
 learn it give up the stairs or 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.940
 brick c and c is it red 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.470
 who has evolved placed like this is pim 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.420
 so personally it can do it 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.400
 but after the bri who ranked 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.780
 red it does not go too much so I 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.980
 go ladders to do kind 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.930
 now we've hooked up a bit 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.060
 zigzag this is good imagination 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.740
 have a lot of imagination but that's the 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.720
 do it here and finally to finish the 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.910
 repeaters we're going to put tac tac tac 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.370
 like these have a gap of 3 for 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.460
 do our beautiful on the paper 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.750
 that's wonderful 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.430
 here and I forgot two things 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.070
 in the decoration the iron bars 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.420
 to make the little niche of the famous 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.220
 foot to save them other little ones 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.810
 cats that get stuck in our art 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.040
 since in a Paris city where there is 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.660
 never had a fire at last blow is 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.920
 maybe better of course but my friend 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.900
 placement for our dear friends the 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.250
 firefighters and that's it and well no there so 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.140
 behind aubin cops for our famous 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.860
 license plate so higgs help 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.450
 I do not know what we are going to put 470 wd 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.070
 here we invented a plaque I know 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.400
 not what it means but it's okay 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.900
 do it 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.430
 and there before bah listen it's just 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.450
 for him a little we will be in map for 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.190
 they can talk pretty olufade 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.900
 mouth we may be able to do two 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.580
 eyes with our little little things there 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.290
 like that poof money headlights but 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.100
 unfortunately it does not sit down 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.050
 for lighthouses you can maybe 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.670
 do this little decoration taking 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.190
 the frames and lay them underneath 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.870
 does that do it yes sir that 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.590
 can do it by maybe being in 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:15.800
 a little yellow light as 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.400
 example the sunflower and there it can do 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.290
 lights on 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.480
 yes that can do it little trick that 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.160
 I propose you who is not very I 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.900
 do not approve but who can do it 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.730
 so the clothes are listening and we're done 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.810
 all had echo I hope he will have you 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.060
 more so if that's the case do not hesitate to 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.650
 leave a live it's always a pleasure 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.900
 do not hesitate to beta 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.100
