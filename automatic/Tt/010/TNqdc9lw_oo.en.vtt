in its Reuben patter which is rather
unique<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.830> is<00:04:01.860> basically<00:04:02.790> because

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
unique to it and it is basically because

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:13.789 
unique to it and it is basically because
of<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.630> shape<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.019> performance<00:04:04.739> tip<00:04:12.799> so

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
of the shape of the performance tip so

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.740 
of the shape of the performance tip so
overall<00:04:14.280> don't<00:04:14.730> Bowl<00:04:15.090> while<00:04:15.959> not<00:04:16.400> quote<00:04:17.750> while

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
overall don't Bowl while not quote while

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.570 
overall don't Bowl while not quote while
not<00:04:19.650> quite<00:04:20.040> as<00:04:20.370> good<00:04:20.760> as<00:04:21.290> rock<00:04:22.290> Leone<00:04:24.350> but

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
not quite as good as rock Leone but

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.810 
not quite as good as rock Leone but
certainly<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.960> does<00:04:28.260> perform<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:29.550> just

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
certainly it does perform you just

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.110 
certainly it does perform you just
perform<00:04:30.150> better<00:04:30.389> than<00:04:30.600> storm<00:04:30.930> Pegasus

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
perform better than storm Pegasus

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.540 
perform better than storm Pegasus
here's<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.300> nice<00:04:33.770> mediator<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.919> kind<00:04:35.460> of

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
here's a nice mediator a kind of

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.750 
here's a nice mediator a kind of
in-between<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:36.570> those<00:04:36.840> two<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.760> it's

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
in-between to those two and it's

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.090 
in-between to those two and it's
definitely<00:04:39.180> one<00:04:39.690> that<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:39.930> can<00:04:40.260> recommend

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
definitely one that I can recommend

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.650 
definitely one that I can recommend
I<00:04:42.860> mean<00:04:43.860> maybe<00:04:44.010> as<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.220> second<00:04:44.639> beyblade<00:04:45.000> not<00:04:45.300> it

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
I mean maybe as a second beyblade not it

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.490 
I mean maybe as a second beyblade not it
could<00:04:46.110> be<00:04:46.380> good<00:04:46.560> first<00:04:47.630> you<00:04:48.630> know<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.900> depends
