crud<00:02:42.239> symptoms<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.510> are<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.989> starts<00:02:44.320> easy

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
crud symptoms of this are it starts easy

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.440 
crud symptoms of this are it starts easy
when<00:02:44.799> it's<00:02:44.920> cold<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.489> doesn't<00:02:46.060> want<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.239> start

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
when it's cold it doesn't want to start

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.170 
when it's cold it doesn't want to start
when<00:02:46.600> it's<00:02:46.720> hot<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.560> gets<00:02:47.980> really<00:02:48.250> smoky<00:02:48.820> it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
when it's hot it gets really smoky it

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.110 
when it's hot it gets really smoky it
gets<00:02:49.390> really<00:02:49.660> quiet<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.920> certainly<00:02:51.640> loses

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
gets really quiet and it certainly loses

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.150 
gets really quiet and it certainly loses
its<00:02:52.330> high<00:02:52.510> speed<00:02:52.840> power<00:02:53.110> has<00:02:53.500> half<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.950> power

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
its high speed power has half the power

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.259 
its high speed power has half the power
and<00:02:54.489> high<00:02:55.420> fuel<00:02:55.750> consumption<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.970> there's

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
and high fuel consumption and so there's

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.229 
and high fuel consumption and so there's
you<00:02:59.019> know<00:02:59.049> there's<00:02:59.410> your<00:02:59.680> biggest<00:02:59.950> tip<00:03:01.620> next

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
look all the way down in there and you

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.030 
look all the way down in there and you

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
and little sticks in there because it

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.839 
and little sticks in there because it
