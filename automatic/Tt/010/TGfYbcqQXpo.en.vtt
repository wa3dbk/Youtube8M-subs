00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
shoulder up to the racket a slightly

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.939 
shoulder up to the racket a slightly
different<00:00:32.759> angle<00:00:33.000> again<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.900> we're<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.649> quite

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
different angle again so we're not quite

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.150 
different angle again so we're not quite
aligned<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.520> towards<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> ball<00:00:36.180> which<00:00:36.840> is

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
aligned up towards the ball which is

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.709 
aligned up towards the ball which is
something<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.250> pretty<00:00:38.610> common<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.300> you

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
something that's pretty common and you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.090 
something that's pretty common and you
need<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> extend<00:00:40.230> out<00:00:40.469> towards<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> ball<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
need to extend out towards the ball a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.590 
need to extend out towards the ball a
little<00:00:41.250> bit<00:00:41.460> more<00:00:41.670> you're<00:00:42.149> tossing<00:00:42.359> out

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
little bit more you're tossing out

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.029 
little bit more you're tossing out
pretty<00:00:42.840> well<00:00:42.930> into<00:00:43.289> the<00:00:43.379> court<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:43.770> we've<00:00:43.859> got

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
pretty well into the court but we've got

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.650 
pretty well into the court but we've got
to<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.219> your<00:00:44.399> body<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:45.120> towards<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to get your body out there towards the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
to get your body out there towards the
ball<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> little<00:00:46.079> bit<00:00:46.289> better<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.430> look

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
ball a little bit better and if we look

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.500 
ball a little bit better and if we look
back<00:00:48.449> at<00:00:48.660> Jason<00:00:49.109> again<00:00:49.969> we'll<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.329> he's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
back at Jason again we'll see that he's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.250 
back at Jason again we'll see that he's
got<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:52.910> pretty<00:00:53.910> straight<00:00:54.449> line<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.109> his

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
got a pretty straight line up to his

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.369 
got a pretty straight line up to his
shoulders<00:00:56.149> we<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.719> pretty<00:00:57.870> much<00:00:57.960> call<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
shoulders we can pretty much call that a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.259 
shoulders we can pretty much call that a
straight<00:00:58.649> line<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.210> then<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:02.269> racket

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
straight line and then up to the racket

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.280 
straight line and then up to the racket
we've<00:01:03.390> got<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.839> bit<00:01:04.050> slightly

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
we've got a little bit slightly

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.590 
we've got a little bit slightly
different<00:01:04.739> angle<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.309> very<00:01:05.489> much<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.120> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
different angle but not very much and so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.030 
different angle but not very much and so
Jason<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:06.990> pretty<00:01:07.230> straight<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.740> from<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
Jason is pretty straight here from the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.070 
Jason is pretty straight here from the
tip<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.790> from<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.300> back<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.780> his<00:01:09.870> feet

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
tip from the from the back of his feet

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.930 
tip from the from the back of his feet
all<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> way<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.040> racket<00:01:11.520> he's<00:01:11.760> got

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
all the way up to the racket he's got

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.660 
all the way up to the racket he's got
only<00:01:12.180> got<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.720> slight<00:01:13.140> angle<00:01:13.440> there<00:01:13.920> between

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
only got one slight angle there between

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.610 
only got one slight angle there between
the<00:01:15.000> two<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.600> he's<00:01:15.780> using<00:01:16.170> his<00:01:16.260> body<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
the two and so he's using his body and

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.440 
the two and so he's using his body and
extending<00:01:17.070> out<00:01:17.190> towards<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> ball<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.060> little

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
off the ground now you're making contact

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.960 
off the ground now you're making contact
and<00:03:27.470> your<00:03:28.470> body<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.769> already<00:03:29.040> falling<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.819> so

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
and your body is already falling and so

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.819 
and your body is already falling and so
you're<00:03:30.120> touching<00:03:30.630> down<00:03:30.810> much<00:03:31.200> earlier<00:03:31.769> than

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
you're touching down much earlier than

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.949 
you're touching down much earlier than
Jason<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.209> want<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.599> work<00:03:33.780> on

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
longer so that when you do push up

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.530 
longer so that when you do push up
you're<00:03:38.010> really<00:03:38.579> using<00:03:38.700> your<00:03:38.940> legs<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.359> launch
