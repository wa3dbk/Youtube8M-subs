 adreno 332 gb of ram 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.149
 are 16 gb for storage but only 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.250
 a little more than 10 giga are free 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.229
 for the user and can not expand 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.880
 with the memory card it has 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.899
 support network 4g wifi bluetooth dna nfc 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.539

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.200
 there is no way out of me but the connector 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:26.740
 micro-usb has mhl to lg technology 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.229
 informs that it will receive update 4.4 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.909
 of android and with all that the performance 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.130
 it's expected 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.469
 applications open and run without 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.109
 problems as usual we left 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.999
 for games and games worked 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.310
 the appliance warmed up a little 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:45.749
 during matches but nothing that does not 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.749
 happen with other models 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.130
 already the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.500
 we did the tests with the benchmarks that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.280
 confirmed the good performance of g2 in 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.490
 and reached 31 1,340 points in the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.680
 quadrant were 19 thousand and 77 points in the 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.820
 nea mark 1 and mark 2 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.390
 it reached the 58.3 mark of 58.4 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.350
 frames per second 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:53.070
 the lcd screen of 2 is 5.2 inches with 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.040
 full hd resolution and 424 points per 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.900
 inch hd and ps plus technology 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.840
 generates very vivid images 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.970
 already the glass is protected by the gorilla 2 the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.280
 installed player plays several 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.140
 formats of audio and video files and 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.880
 still comes with fm radio 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.280
 an interesting feature the nokia is a 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.410
 just tap the screen twice to 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.900
 Why do not you turn it off and thanks to the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.210
 sensors until it never turns off while 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.550
 you're looking at it's function 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.350
 smart video pause display 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.950
 video when you are not looking at the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.410
 screen 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.900
 but you want to know the truth, the more it disturbs 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.300
 of what helps the virtual keyboard has a 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.700
 good size and when used horizontally 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.100
 still can be divided g2 still 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.720
 has a guest mode where the user 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.510
 choose which programs will be 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.520
 available and set a second password 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.620
 screen unlock or headset 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.310
 it is comfortable it has great quality of 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.350
 audio 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.320
 already the loudspeaker of the device produces a 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.050
 loud sound but with distortions and g2 still 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.150
 has some features that are reminiscent of 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.010
 infrared sensors so he 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.680
 works like a remote control 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.140
 just set up promote your tv 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.340
 another feature or slide that allows two 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.680
 applications while on-screen 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.680
 the g2 camera has a 3 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.410
 megapixels and has great images 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.020
 videos are recorded in full HD with 30 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.510
 or 60 frames per second the camera still 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.359
 Optical stabilizer with camera 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.120
 2.1 megapixels and also 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.580
 make video 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.850
 in full hd you can use both cameras 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.550
 at the same time 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.639
 the lg 2 has a battery of three thousand 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.630
 million perez and in our pattern she 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.699
 held up well 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.919
 we take the appliance out of the socket at ten 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:42.419
 midnight and eight in the evening and still 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.850
 had 45% load 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.389
 the lg g two to a cell with great 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.820
 her great performance and great camera but 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.490
 which is new even in the position other 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.330
 buttons because it is a high-end 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.550
 performance 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.889
 we miss card slot 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.470
 memory and attention to smart video 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.210
 which pauses display when we are not 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.800
 looking at the screen is not there so 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.289
