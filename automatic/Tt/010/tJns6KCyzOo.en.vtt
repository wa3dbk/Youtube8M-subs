00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
what I said and what you know I know

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.640 
what I said and what you know I know
we've<00:02:33.120> done<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> gazillion<00:02:33.720> videos<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.470> was

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
we've done a gazillion videos but I was

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.290 
we've done a gazillion videos but I was
saying<00:02:34.860> how<00:02:34.950> Josh<00:02:35.280> McDowell<00:02:35.730> he's<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> guy<00:02:36.270> that

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.690 
saying how Josh McDowell he's a guy that
I<00:02:36.750> think<00:02:37.350> he<00:02:37.470> was<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.620> little<00:02:37.709> overrated<00:02:38.250> simply

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
I think he was a little overrated simply

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.690 
I think he was a little overrated simply
because<00:02:39.030> he<00:02:39.180> outplayed<00:02:40.040> he<00:02:41.040> was<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> best

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
because he outplayed he was the best

playing on the road for the first time
all<00:03:24.360> year<00:03:24.390> but<00:03:24.630> they're<00:03:24.780> playing<00:03:24.989> a

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
all year but they're playing a

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
time all year this this does seem like a

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.350 
time all year this this does seem like a
case<00:03:29.280> where<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.549> Sharps<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> squares

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
case where the Sharps and the squares

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.670 
case where the Sharps and the squares
are<00:03:30.480> going<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.660> be<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.930> same<00:03:31.110> side<00:03:31.350> so<00:03:31.590> we

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
are going to be on the same side so we

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.530 
are going to be on the same side so we
agree<00:03:31.980> all<00:03:32.400> right<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:32.700> then<00:03:32.820> why<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:33.269> line

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
agree all right so then why is this line

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.660 
agree all right so then why is this line
where<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.440> mean<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.769> this<00:03:34.920> Jude<00:03:35.340> Vegas

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
like I don't know seven and a half let's

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.910 
like I don't know seven and a half let's
say<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.870> that's<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.680> misconception

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
say now that that that's a misconception

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.520 
say now that that that's a misconception
I<00:03:47.579> think<00:03:47.820> every<00:03:48.269> single<00:03:48.660> oddsmaker<00:03:49.140> will<00:03:49.320> tell

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
I think every single oddsmaker will tell

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.160 
I think every single oddsmaker will tell
you<00:03:49.680> they<00:03:49.890> don't<00:03:50.040> set<00:03:50.519> traps<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.299> reality<00:03:51.930> you

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
you they don't set traps in reality you

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.440 
you they don't set traps in reality you
know<00:03:52.200> six<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.829> half<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:53.220> not<00:03:53.579> exactly<00:03:54.360> a

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
know six and a half is not exactly a

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.420 
know six and a half is not exactly a
small<00:03:54.840> point<00:03:55.110> spread<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.980> pretty

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
small point spread so it is a pretty

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.850 
small point spread so it is a pretty
large<00:03:56.670> point<00:03:57.150> spread<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.690> Tampa<00:03:58.560> Bay<00:03:58.590> for

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
large point spread and Tampa Bay for

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.220 
large point spread and Tampa Bay for
those<00:03:58.980> people<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.489> like<00:03:59.910> defensive<00:04:00.750> dogs<00:04:00.989> I

week playing a heck of a defense and and
there's<00:04:24.210> no<00:04:24.330> question<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:25.099> the<00:04:26.099> Falcons

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
there's no question that the Falcons

there's no question that the Falcons
often

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
often

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.480 
often
of<00:04:27.460> line<00:04:27.730> has<00:04:28.270> plenty<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.810> holes<00:04:29.020> in<00:04:29.290> it<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:29.680> as

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
of line has plenty of holes in it so as

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.189 
of line has plenty of holes in it so as
far<00:04:30.699> as<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.940> line<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.240> scrimmage<00:04:31.330> Tampa's

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
far as the line of scrimmage Tampa's

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.110 
far as the line of scrimmage Tampa's
defensive<00:04:32.800> line<00:04:32.949> even<00:04:33.130> with<00:04:33.400> their<00:04:33.520> injuries

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
defensive line even with their injuries

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.610 
defensive line even with their injuries
and<00:04:34.330> will<00:04:34.419> be<00:04:34.540> checking<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:35.020> injuries<00:04:35.380> before

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
and will be checking the injuries before

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.730 
and will be checking the injuries before
game<00:04:36.070> time<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:37.120> still<00:04:37.330> tampa<00:04:37.960> does<00:04:38.169> match<00:04:38.470> up

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
game time but still tampa does match up

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.200 
game time but still tampa does match up
well<00:04:38.949> on<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.190> defensive<00:04:39.729> side<00:04:39.790> of<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.120> ball

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
well on the defensive side of the ball

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.480 
well on the defensive side of the ball
so<00:04:40.510> it's<00:04:40.660> not<00:04:40.780> like<00:04:40.990> this<00:04:41.139> has<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.620> 30-point

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
so it's not like this has a 30-point

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.490 
so it's not like this has a 30-point
route<00:04:42.880> written<00:04:43.240> all<00:04:43.330> over<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.780> but<00:04:43.930> still<00:04:44.229> all

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
route written all over it but still all

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.620
