00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.720 
shirt that covers that so that's why I'm
water<00:05:33.350> mostly<00:05:33.710> men's<00:05:34.010> clothes<00:05:34.340> because

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
water mostly men's clothes because

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.780 
water mostly men's clothes because
they're<00:05:34.910> made<00:05:35.120> longer<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:36.310> it

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
they're made longer and it

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.520 
they're made longer and it
I<00:05:37.960> always<00:05:38.960> rolled<00:05:39.860> my<00:05:40.310> shoulders<00:05:40.670> forward

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
I always rolled my shoulders forward

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.140 
I always rolled my shoulders forward
because<00:05:42.530> I<00:05:42.830> wanted<00:05:43.160> my<00:05:43.250> shirt<00:05:43.520> to<00:05:43.700> hang<00:05:43.850> lower

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
because I wanted my shirt to hang lower

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.140 
because I wanted my shirt to hang lower
so<00:05:44.480> cover<00:05:44.870> my<00:05:45.080> stomach<00:05:45.440> so<00:05:46.070> between<00:05:46.400> all<00:05:46.790> of

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
so cover my stomach so between all of

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.130 
so cover my stomach so between all of
those<00:05:47.300> things<00:05:47.690> over<00:05:48.320> 20<00:05:48.860> plus<00:05:49.040> years<00:05:49.490> I<00:05:50.140> have

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
those things over 20 plus years I have

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.050 
those things over 20 plus years I have
the<00:05:51.500> worst<00:05:51.710> posture<00:05:53.680> so<00:05:54.680> I've<00:05:55.250> been<00:05:55.430> trying<00:05:55.790> to

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
the worst posture so I've been trying to

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.580 
the worst posture so I've been trying to
become<00:05:56.510> more<00:05:56.540> aware<00:05:56.930> of<00:05:56.960> it<00:05:57.170> and<00:05:57.320> it's<00:05:57.440> really

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
become more aware of it and it's really

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.800 
become more aware of it and it's really
hard<00:05:57.890> in<00:05:58.040> the<00:05:58.160> swimsuit<00:05:58.400> because<00:05:58.970> it's<00:05:59.510> got

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
hard in the swimsuit because it's got

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.810 
hard in the swimsuit because it's got
the<00:06:00.050> tie<00:06:00.230> like<00:06:00.650> around<00:06:00.860> my<00:06:01.010> neck<00:06:01.280> so<00:06:01.520> it<00:06:01.610> just

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
the tie like around my neck so it just

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.230 
the tie like around my neck so it just
kind<00:06:02.030> of<00:06:02.150> pulls<00:06:03.110> me<00:06:03.290> forward<00:06:03.500> like<00:06:03.920> that<00:06:03.950> so<00:06:04.850> I

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
kind of pulls me forward like that so I

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.660 
kind of pulls me forward like that so I
mean<00:06:05.660> it's<00:06:05.930> comfortable<00:06:06.380> I<00:06:06.620> love<00:06:06.890> it<00:06:07.040> I<00:06:07.220> feel<00:06:07.460> a
