at that brushed brushed aluminum I'm not

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.660 
at that brushed brushed aluminum I'm not
sure<00:02:48.230> if<00:02:48.350> it's<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.620> lumen<00:02:48.890> enough<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.430> may<00:02:49.610> be

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
sure if it's a lumen enough it may be

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.630 
sure if it's a lumen enough it may be
still<00:02:50.030> I'm<00:02:50.209> probably<00:02:50.510> sure<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:50.930> deal<00:02:51.640> it's
