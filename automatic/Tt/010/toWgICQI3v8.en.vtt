00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.980
 a cardenio shoe factory born in 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.930
 1968 from my father precisely who is the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.250
 founder 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.010
 initially the main product was 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.750
 the moccasin including the product a 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.120
 man then we later poured into the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.170
 produced by women 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.759
 gardenia shoes are 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.000
 characterized by the comfort of dining 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.619
 obviously the Italian style to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 Italian fashion 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.450
 Another key feature of the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.020
 customization of all accessories 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.630
 so sardegna personalizes any 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.240
 footwear places and makes a lot 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.880
 flexible choice for the customer 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.880
 of the materials and precisely of the Azzurri 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:50.110
 the Tuscan characterizes precisely the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.970
 beauty in that work in 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.210
 Tuscan territory or between Pisa and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.450
 florence where the company is located 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.060
 anyway leads to see the beautiful every 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.229
 day to be attracted to landscapes 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.530
 art and history and therefore licato per entire 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.539
 very much the very identity of the brand la 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.850
 tradition the Tuscan tradition 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.270
 plus very much in footwear 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.270
 strong 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.080
 footwear in Tuscany and so on 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.080
 a product 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.250
 of strength of industrial production 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.260
 tuscany where we also have the other 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.260
 most of the Italian tanneries 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.870
 in fact also this network that is created 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.090
 then between tanneries and shoe factories 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.770
 accessorists fail them or facilitate them 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.180
 just 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.180
 the search for memo accessories e 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.180
 personalism 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:03:00.580
 to summarize garden styles in four 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.270
 groups for this season one is the led 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.050
 the punks he focuses on 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.120
 mainly on a very wood style 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.709
 so very feminine 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.890
 very glamorous punk elegans where indeed 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.180
 even the studs are never too much e 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.260
 they merge with elegance in fact 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.810
 subway so much more 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.260
 fashion oriented 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.400
 the second group is articulated instead 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.560
 around the deco bar for which it draws a 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.870
 the vintage is reminiscent of the Parisian cities 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.700
 uenos aires that still have some 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.920
 colors sounds and precisely the colors that 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.010
 are very reminiscent of this collection are i 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.769
 autumn colors so those that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.690
 remember the wine from burgundy to blue and 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.329
 also of the earth like all reds 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.450
 Tuscan reds here is also a 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:09.239
 very strong call to the Tuscan 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.239
 the company is therefore a vintage 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.239
 a very feminine style that recalls 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.239
 also curves 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.410
 milk precisely 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.150
 the third group that remains for us 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.640
 precisely a fundamental group to a 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.210
 group that instead recalls sport 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.670
 metropolitan for which a bourgeoisie 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.570
 underground where the cuts are 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:42.550
 net also very clean and almost 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.860
 architectural arches the fourth group 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.140
 instead it is the opulence group 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.620
 we called it of the same lance 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:55.630
 remember the gothic recalls the baroque e 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.930
 therefore you carve lace and decorations here too 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.050
 between and a lot from our Tuscan in 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.530
 as Florence remembers the lace of 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:10.830
 florence and all the features that it is 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.830
 precisely this city ​​contains everything 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.310
 we are waiting for you on our website 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.100
 which tender is not displayed for 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.560
 the note the collections 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.380
 small part certainly not much 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.790
 characteristic and also where it comes from 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:35.260
 exposed the history and the origin of the 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.260
 our shoe factory
