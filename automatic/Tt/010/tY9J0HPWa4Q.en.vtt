as some of you may know probably not my
newer<00:00:13.200> viewers<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:13.769> most<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.280> probably

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
newer viewers but most of you probably

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.970 
newer viewers but most of you probably
know<00:00:14.700> one<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:15.719> favorite<00:00:16.049> troops<00:00:16.290> probably

know one of my favorite troops probably
not<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:17.310> favorite<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.180> my<00:00:18.270> favorite

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
not my favorite but one of my favorite

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.960 
not my favorite but one of my favorite
troops<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.989> the<00:00:19.230> Valkyrie<00:00:19.970> specifically

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
troops is the Valkyrie specifically

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.880 
troops is the Valkyrie specifically
because<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.480> Valkyrie<00:00:21.840> attacks<00:00:22.200> unlike<00:00:22.680> any

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
because the Valkyrie attacks unlike any

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.040 
because the Valkyrie attacks unlike any
other<00:00:23.099> troop<00:00:23.399> it<00:00:23.610> has<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> splash<00:00:24.509> attack<00:00:24.689> but

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
other troop it has a splash attack but

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.540 
other troop it has a splash attack but
it<00:00:25.140> actually<00:00:25.259> moves<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.950> between<00:00:26.399> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
it actually moves in between the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.700 
it actually moves in between the
buildings<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> use<00:00:27.270> it<00:00:27.450> splash<00:00:27.689> attack<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.649> I

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
buildings to use it splash attack and I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.100 
buildings to use it splash attack and I
think<00:00:28.770> that's<00:00:28.950> very<00:00:29.160> useful<00:00:29.610> on<00:00:30.090> certain<00:00:30.899> base

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
think that's very useful on certain base

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.690 
think that's very useful on certain base
designs<00:00:31.529> then<00:00:31.739> it<00:00:31.829> actually<00:00:31.980> works<00:00:32.340> very<00:00:32.460> well

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
designs then it actually works very well

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.139 
designs then it actually works very well
even<00:00:33.510> without<00:00:34.170> things<00:00:34.679> like<00:00:34.949> golems<00:00:35.579> pack<00:00:35.910> up

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
even without things like golems pack up

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.360 
even without things like golems pack up
whatever<00:00:36.449> the<00:00:37.320> Valkyries<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.949> work<00:00:38.100> well<00:00:38.340> on

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
whatever the Valkyries can work well on

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.869 
whatever the Valkyries can work well on
their<00:00:38.640> own<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.769> guy<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.160> he's

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
their own so this guy right here he's

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.700 
their own so this guy right here he's
got<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.089> decently<00:00:42.600> upgraded<00:00:43.050> base<00:00:43.199> some<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
got a decently upgraded base some of the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.319 
got a decently upgraded base some of the
stuff<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.039> max<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.519> most<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.030> almost

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
stuff is max and most of it is almost

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.139 
stuff is max and most of it is almost

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
though it doesn't do that much damage it

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.539

splashed all of them several times and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.980 
splashed all of them several times and
that's<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.000> lot<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> damage<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.719> they're<00:01:27.869> all

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that's a lot of damage when they're all

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.990 
that's a lot of damage when they're all
standing<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.439> top<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.649> each<00:01:28.860> other<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.759> my

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
the Town Hall is almost the only thing
there<00:01:33.899> it's<00:01:34.469> just<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.799> little<00:01:35.009> Teslin<00:01:35.399> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
there it's just that little Teslin the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.340 
there it's just that little Teslin the
way<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.149> on<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.659> town<00:01:36.930> hall<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
way and it's on to the town hall for the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
way and it's on to the town hall for the
archer<00:01:37.649> queen<00:01:37.829> she's<00:01:38.670> able<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.149> take<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> out<00:01:39.479> I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
archer queen she's able to take it out I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.149 
archer queen she's able to take it out I
probably<00:01:39.840> didn't<00:01:40.170> need<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.469> use<00:01:40.500> her<00:01:40.740> ability

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
probably didn't need to use her ability

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
probably didn't need to use her ability
or<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.369> range<00:01:41.700> fell<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> take<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.990> just

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
or the range fell to take it but I just

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.569 
or the range fell to take it but I just
did<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.439> speed<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> little

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
did that to speed it up and get a little

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.209 
did that to speed it up and get a little
bit<00:01:44.670> more<00:01:44.789> percentage<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.799> now<00:01:46.799> I'm<00:01:47.100> just

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
bit more percentage and now I'm just

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.889 
bit more percentage and now I'm just
going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> see<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:47.759> much<00:01:48.119> percentage<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.750> can

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
going to see how much percentage I can

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.779 
going to see how much percentage I can
get<00:01:49.020> obviously<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> can't<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> three-star

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
get obviously I can't get a three-star

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.880 
get obviously I can't get a three-star
let's<00:01:51.539> see<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:52.109> up<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.320> about<00:01:52.350> sixty

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
let's see if I can get up to about sixty

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830 
let's see if I can get up to about sixty
percent<00:01:53.039> my<00:01:53.759> Queens<00:01:54.030> taken<00:01:54.359> all<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.689> hits

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
percent my Queens taken all the hits

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.539 
percent my Queens taken all the hits
right<00:01:55.049> now<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.320> she<00:01:55.530> does<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.280> anything

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
right now and she does not have anything

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.389 
right now and she does not have anything
to<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.229> gonna<00:01:58.469> get<00:01:58.679> sixty<00:01:58.979> percent<00:01:59.100> i

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
to do so I'm gonna get sixty percent i

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.919 
to do so I'm gonna get sixty percent i
got<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.609> sixty<00:01:59.939> percent<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.479> i<00:02:00.570> got<00:02:00.689> 12

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
got that sixty percent and i got 12

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.260 
got that sixty percent and i got 12
trophies<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:02.070> next<00:02:02.460> guy<00:02:02.609> has<00:02:02.789> a<00:02:02.850> weaker<00:02:03.149> base

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
trophies this next guy has a weaker base

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
trophies this next guy has a weaker base
so<00:02:03.450> i<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.600> hoping<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.140> three-star<00:02:04.619> i<00:02:04.799> want

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.849 
to try and get a little extra percentage
so<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.780> could<00:03:07.079> have<00:03:07.169> gotten<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.469> little<00:03:07.500> bit<00:03:07.769> of

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
so I could have gotten a little bit of

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.349 
so I could have gotten a little bit of
dark<00:03:08.040> elixir<00:03:08.280> maybe<00:03:08.669> but<00:03:08.969> that's<00:03:09.150> about<00:03:09.299> it

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
dark elixir maybe but that's about it

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.449 
dark elixir maybe but that's about it
400<00:03:10.109> dark<00:03:10.260> woods<00:03:10.469> is<00:03:10.620> all<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.799> missed<00:03:11.010> out<00:03:11.129> on<00:03:11.159> by

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
400 dark woods is all I missed out on by

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.929 
400 dark woods is all I missed out on by

not using my ability this next guy is a
very<00:03:15.540> very<00:03:16.139> very<00:03:16.379> very<00:03:17.510> common<00:03:18.510> base<00:03:18.870> design<00:03:19.199> I

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
very very very very common base design I

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.250 
very very very very common base design I
see<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.799> all<00:03:19.979> the<00:03:20.099> time<00:03:20.519> now<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.150> see<00:03:21.449> it<00:03:21.569> like

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
see this all the time now I see it like

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.110 
see this all the time now I see it like
every<00:03:22.590> other<00:03:22.709> next<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.310> see<00:03:23.459> almost<00:03:23.729> every

next I see this design which is very

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.039 
next I see this design which is very
common<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.699> one<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.329> most<00:03:30.479> common<00:03:30.870> base

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
battery spreading out a little bit

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.990 
battery spreading out a little bit

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
staying a little bit fanned out because

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.190 
staying a little bit fanned out because
there<00:05:18.120> aren't<00:05:18.300> really<00:05:18.420> big<00:05:18.720> clumps<00:05:19.110> of

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
buildings there just in a line here so I

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.700 
buildings there just in a line here so I
can<00:05:21.210> get<00:05:21.360> two<00:05:21.540> buildings<00:05:21.960> at<00:05:22.050> once<00:05:22.260> instead<00:05:22.530> of

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
can get two buildings at once instead of

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.290 
can get two buildings at once instead of
three<00:05:22.920> or<00:05:23.040> four<00:05:23.280> so<00:05:23.760> I<00:05:23.790> want<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.000> spread<00:05:24.180> them

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
three or four so I want to spread them

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.970 
three or four so I want to spread them
out<00:05:24.330> as<00:05:24.450> much<00:05:24.570> as<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:24.810> can<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.170> had<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.650> worry<00:05:25.890> a

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980

maybe<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:03.960> barbarian<00:06:04.350> to<00:06:04.440> take<00:06:04.560> it<00:06:04.650> out<00:06:04.740> if<00:06:04.860> he

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890
