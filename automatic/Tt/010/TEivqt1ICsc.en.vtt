00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
well we wanted to go into the Northeast

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.540 
well we wanted to go into the Northeast
because<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.199> had<00:01:01.289> replenishment<00:01:02.010> there<00:01:02.250> from

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
because we had replenishment there from

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
because we had replenishment there from
the<00:01:02.670> other<00:01:02.820> day<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.690> only<00:01:03.870> problem<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.350> it's

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the other day the only problem was it's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.859 
the other day the only problem was it's
deep<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.189> zdi<00:01:05.580> territory<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.510> were<00:01:06.630> getting

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
deep in zdi territory we were getting

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.500 
deep in zdi territory we were getting
upwards<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.470> 25<00:01:08.280> zombies<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.119> squares

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
upwards of 25 zombies in some squares

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
upwards of 25 zombies in some squares
there<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.920> had<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.520> figure<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> way<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
there so we had to figure out a way to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.630 
there so we had to figure out a way to
go<00:01:12.720> there<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.229> scavenge<00:01:14.070> otherwise<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
go there and scavenge otherwise the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
go there and scavenge otherwise the
whole<00:01:14.670> day<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> waste<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.439> decided

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
whole day would be a waste so we decided

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.370 
whole day would be a waste so we decided
to<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.150> say<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> hell<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.080> CDI

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to do was to say to hell with the CDI

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.649 
to do was to say to hell with the CDI
and<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:19.950> went<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.880> had<00:01:21.030> our<00:01:21.060> plumbing<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and we went in we had our plumbing and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.840 
and we went in we had our plumbing and
we<00:01:21.720> started<00:01:22.080> killing<00:01:22.530> zombies<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.549> here's<00:01:23.790> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
we started killing zombies so here's a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.480 
we started killing zombies so here's a
zone<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.390> outside<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.930> town<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> I'm<00:01:25.590> armed

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
zone right outside of town and I'm armed

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.730 
zone right outside of town and I'm armed
to<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.670> teeth<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:27.000> water<00:01:27.960> pistols<00:01:28.200> there

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
to the teeth with water pistols there

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.609 
to the teeth with water pistols there
this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> before<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:31.049> here's<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
this is the before and now here's the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
this is the before and now here's the
after<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.670> hindsight<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.119> wish<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.450> would

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
after and in hindsight I wish I would

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840 
after and in hindsight I wish I would
have<00:01:33.600> showed<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.079> zone<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.770> had<00:01:34.920> 25

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
have showed you the zone that had 25

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.020 
have showed you the zone that had 25
zombies<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.920> today<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.579> only

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
zombies on it and today I think I only

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.990 
zombies on it and today I think I only
traveled<00:01:39.540> about<00:01:39.780> three<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.439> four<00:01:40.770> zones<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.939> I

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
traveled about three or four zones but I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.999 
traveled about three or four zones but I
racked<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.450> over<00:01:42.600> 50<00:01:43.140> zombie<00:01:43.530> kills<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
racked up over 50 zombie kills for the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.130 
racked up over 50 zombie kills for the
day<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.280> that'll<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.270> great<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.659> some<00:01:45.810> zombie

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
day so that'll be great for some zombie

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200 
day so that'll be great for some zombie
killin<00:01:46.439> distinctions<00:01:47.009> here's<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> path<00:01:47.970> we

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
killin distinctions here's the path we

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.899 
killin distinctions here's the path we
cleared<00:01:48.570> through<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> CDI<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.610> should

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
cleared through the CDI there it should

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
cleared through the CDI there it should
be<00:01:50.939> enough<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.270> trigger<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.689> global<00:01:52.079> respawn

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
be enough to trigger a global respawn

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560 
be enough to trigger a global respawn
and<00:01:52.890> I've<00:01:53.130> never<00:01:53.280> seen<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.759> those<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and I've never seen one of those in the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.289 
and I've never seen one of those in the
game<00:01:54.750> before<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.439> Allah<00:01:56.310> finally<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.149> some

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
game before so Allah finally have some

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.730 
game before so Allah finally have some
first-hand<00:01:57.600> experience<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.380> we'll<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.619> what

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
first-hand experience and we'll see what

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
first-hand experience and we'll see what
that<00:01:58.860> looks<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.969> next<00:02:00.210> day<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that looks like the next day for the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080 
that looks like the next day for the
upgrade<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.710> had<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.040> skip<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.460> water<00:02:02.640> turrets

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
upgrade we had to skip the water turrets

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.399 
upgrade we had to skip the water turrets
and<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> pump<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.200> we're

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
and go with the pump because we're

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.679 
and go with the pump because we're
desperately<00:02:04.920> running<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.460> water<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.540> can

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
desperately running out of water you can

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.930 
desperately running out of water you can
see<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.350> only<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.890> one<00:02:08.220> ration<00:02:09.060> left

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
see here we only have one ration left

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.070 
see here we only have one ration left
we're<00:02:10.940> going<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.150> need<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.480> water<00:02:11.630> if<00:02:11.810> we<00:02:11.900> want

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
we're going to need the water if we want

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.500 
we're going to need the water if we want
to<00:02:12.140> survive<00:02:12.290> any<00:02:12.680> more<00:02:12.920> days<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:13.880> decided

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
to survive any more days so we decided

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.130 
to survive any more days so we decided
to<00:02:14.660> do<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.959> instead<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:17.510> know<00:02:17.660> for<00:02:17.990> go

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
to do that instead and you know for go

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.530 
to do that instead and you know for go
upgrading<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.860> water<00:02:19.040> turrets<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:20.300> see

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
upgrading the water turrets you can see

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.730 
upgrading the water turrets you can see
that<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.920> attack<00:02:22.220> today<00:02:22.430> was<00:02:22.760> maxing<00:02:23.540> out<00:02:23.660> at

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
that the attack today was maxing out at

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.370 
that the attack today was maxing out at
3362<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:25.490> one<00:02:25.640> tomorrow<00:02:25.940> maxes<00:02:26.330> out<00:02:26.420> at<00:02:26.480> 3800

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
3362 the one tomorrow maxes out at 3800

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.290 
3362 the one tomorrow maxes out at 3800
though<00:02:27.560> that's<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.459> little<00:02:28.700> bit<00:02:28.820> in<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.030> if<00:02:29.150> you

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
though that's a little bit in the if you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.670 
though that's a little bit in the if you
range<00:02:29.510> it's<00:02:29.750> going<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:29.990> be<00:02:30.080> really<00:02:30.380> tough<00:02:30.620> for

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
range it's going to be really tough for

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.890 
range it's going to be really tough for
us<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.160> above<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.459> we've<00:02:31.910> exhausted<00:02:32.570> all

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
us to get above that we've exhausted all

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.320 
us to get above that we've exhausted all
of<00:02:32.959> our<00:02:33.170> matches<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:33.980> we<00:02:34.820> probably<00:02:35.030> won't<00:02:35.209> be

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
of our matches so we probably won't be

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.520 
of our matches so we probably won't be
able<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.540> get<00:02:35.600> all<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.810> way<00:02:35.989> up<00:02:36.020> there<00:02:36.320> and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
able to get all the way up there and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.280 
able to get all the way up there and
we're<00:02:37.400> going<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.850> rely<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.290> getting

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
we're going to have to rely on getting

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.370 
we're going to have to rely on getting
an<00:02:39.860> attack<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> lower<00:02:40.670> end<00:02:40.760> there<00:02:41.150> and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
an attack on the lower end there and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.830 
an attack on the lower end there and
hopefully<00:02:42.380> having<00:02:43.130> enough<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:44.270> know<00:02:44.390> zombies

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
hopefully having enough you know zombies

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.510 
hopefully having enough you know zombies
distributed<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.770> we<00:02:45.920> don't<00:02:46.040> have<00:02:46.190> anyone

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
distributed that we don't have anyone

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.699 
distributed that we don't have anyone
die<00:02:46.700> from<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.150> but<00:02:47.690> I'm<00:02:48.019> thinking<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.620> at

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
die from it but I'm thinking that at

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.920 
die from it but I'm thinking that at
least<00:02:48.860> most<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:50.000> us<00:02:50.150> will<00:02:50.360> be<00:02:50.420> able<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.780> live

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
least most of us will be able to live

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.110 
least most of us will be able to live
through<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:52.160> that's<00:02:52.370> we<00:02:52.489> have<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.820> look

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
through that so that's we have to look

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.449 
through that so that's we have to look
forward<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.570> on<00:02:53.600> day<00:02:53.900> 26<00:02:54.410> i'm<00:02:55.130> going<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> show

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
water from the well because we upgraded

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.250 
water from the well because we upgraded
the<00:03:17.810> pump<00:03:18.110> so<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.530> took<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.829> out<00:03:18.950> automatically

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
that respawn because the West used to

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.830 
that respawn because the West used to
previously<00:03:33.170> be<00:03:33.410> free<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.070> let's<00:03:34.579> take<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.790> look
