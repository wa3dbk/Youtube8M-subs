first year i think if you got a guy that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.319 
first year i think if you got a guy that
you<00:02:51.709> think<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.220> your<00:02:52.250> franchise<00:02:52.819> player<00:02:52.849> you

let him go um you know Russell Wilson

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.050 
let him go um you know Russell Wilson
had<00:02:56.299> a<00:02:56.329> good<00:02:56.900> deal<00:02:57.049> of<00:02:57.079> success<00:02:57.370> rg3<00:02:58.370> Peyton

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
had a good deal of success rg3 Peyton

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.599 
had a good deal of success rg3 Peyton
Manning<00:02:59.450> you<00:03:00.410> know<00:03:00.530> they<00:03:00.799> were<00:03:00.859> six<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.400> ten

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
Manning you know they were six and ten

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.420 
Manning you know they were six and ten
and<00:03:01.910> or<00:03:02.629> three<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.140> 13<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.590> guess<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.160> he<00:03:04.220> threw

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
and or three and 13 I guess and he threw

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.339 
and or three and 13 I guess and he threw
a<00:03:04.459> ton<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.730> interceptions<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:05.720> he<00:03:05.840> learned<00:03:06.079> a

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
a ton of interceptions but he learned a

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.589 
a ton of interceptions but he learned a
lot<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.670> only<00:03:07.790> way<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.030> get<00:03:08.239> better<00:03:08.420> is

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
lot and the only way you get better is

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.380 
lot and the only way you get better is
by<00:03:08.780> playing<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.190> hopefully<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.940> play

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
by playing and and hopefully you play

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.699 
by playing and and hopefully you play
and<00:03:11.810> if<00:03:11.959> you've<00:03:12.109> got<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.500> type<00:03:12.680> of

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
and if you've got that type of

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.190 
and if you've got that type of
confidence<00:03:13.340> where<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.910> few<00:03:14.299> losses<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.959> few

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
confidence where a few losses and few

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.690 
confidence where a few losses and few
interceptions<00:03:15.859> aren't<00:03:16.069> going<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.250> bother<00:03:16.430> you

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
interceptions aren't going to bother you

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.089 
interceptions aren't going to bother you
then<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.239> think<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.900> plan<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.500> they<00:03:18.560> grow<00:03:18.799> from

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
then I think you plan and they grow from

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.970 
then I think you plan and they grow from
that<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.549> there<00:03:20.359> anything<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:21.109> good<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.769> good

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
that is there anything that good it good

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.470 
that is there anything that good it good
that<00:03:22.010> comes<00:03:22.310> out<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:22.760> by<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:22.910> watching

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
that be in that position can you benefit

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.680 
that be in that position can you benefit

you<00:03:42.260> i<00:03:42.319> think<00:03:42.859> steve<00:03:43.069> mcnair<00:03:43.489> went<00:03:43.760> through

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
you i think steve mcnair went through

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.569 
you i think steve mcnair went through
that<00:03:44.090> he<00:03:44.329> watched<00:03:44.599> and<00:03:44.930> waited<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:46.099> team<00:03:46.370> got

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
that he watched and waited the team got

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.490 
that he watched and waited the team got
better<00:03:46.639> when<00:03:47.299> he<00:03:47.480> took<00:03:47.690> over<00:03:47.870> they<00:03:48.169> were<00:03:48.230> ready

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
better when he took over they were ready

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.770 
better when he took over they were ready
to<00:03:48.590> fly<00:03:48.889> as<00:03:49.160> well<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.940> it<00:03:50.030> was<00:03:50.389> worked<00:03:50.660> out

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
to fly as well and it was worked out

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.909 
to fly as well and it was worked out
great<00:03:51.019> um<00:03:51.829> you<00:03:52.519> know<00:03:52.609> Aaron<00:03:52.910> Rodgers<00:03:53.359> watched

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
great um you know Aaron Rodgers watched

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.369 
great um you know Aaron Rodgers watched
and<00:03:54.919> probably<00:03:55.340> takes<00:03:55.669> a<00:03:55.849> little<00:03:55.970> bit<00:03:56.239> but<00:03:57.169> when

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
and probably takes a little bit but when

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.830 
and probably takes a little bit but when
he<00:03:57.560> was<00:03:57.739> ready<00:03:57.919> to<00:03:58.040> step<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:58.639> um<00:03:58.910> they<00:03:59.629> had<00:03:59.810> a

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
he was ready to step in um they had a

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.170 
he was ready to step in um they had a
good<00:04:00.079> team<00:04:00.349> going<00:04:00.620> he<00:04:01.040> knew<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.459> offense<00:04:01.970> and

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
good team going he knew the offense and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.080 
good team going he knew the offense and
he<00:04:02.269> was<00:04:02.720> he<00:04:03.169> was<00:04:03.319> ready<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.620> go<00:04:03.859> so<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.639> can

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
he was he was ready to go so it can

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.300 
he was he was ready to go so it can
happen<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:05.599> just<00:04:05.780> think<00:04:06.230> probably<00:04:06.739> you<00:04:07.099> get

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
happen I just think probably you get

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.460 
happen I just think probably you get
more<00:04:07.489> out<00:04:07.609> of<00:04:07.639> playing<00:04:08.000> than<00:04:08.269> watching<00:04:08.750> he's

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
more out of playing than watching he's

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.780 
more out of playing than watching he's

everybody's<00:05:08.450> saying<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:09.020> they<00:05:09.290> probably

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
everybody's saying and they probably

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.450

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
we have to find out if Trent can do it

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.280 
we have to find out if Trent can do it
for<00:05:28.010> so<00:05:28.340> he<00:05:28.610> was<00:05:28.790> going<00:05:29.030> going<00:05:29.390> to<00:05:29.420> play<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:30.080> we

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
established then you become like

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.420 
established then you become like
everyone<00:05:36.350> else<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.860> is<00:05:37.010> an<00:05:37.160> open

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
everyone else and it is an open

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.070 
everyone else and it is an open
competition<00:05:37.640> but<00:05:38.240> we<00:05:38.390> did<00:05:38.600> say<00:05:38.840> for<00:05:39.050> that

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
competition but we did say for that

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.720 
competition but we did say for that
first<00:05:39.380> year<00:05:39.740> you<00:05:39.920> know<00:05:40.010> trapped<00:05:40.430> with<00:05:40.580> the

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
first year you know trapped with the

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.700 
first year you know trapped with the
starter<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.330> sometimes<00:05:42.169> you<00:05:42.320> have<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.560> do

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
starter and sometimes you have to do

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.760 
starter and sometimes you have to do
that<00:05:42.890> see<00:05:43.520> I<00:05:43.550> would<00:05:43.880> I<00:05:44.150> just<00:05:44.750> believe<00:05:45.110> Vic<00:05:45.560> is<00:05:45.740> a

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
that see I would I just believe Vic is a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.409 
that see I would I just believe Vic is a
better<00:05:46.070> quarterback<00:05:46.460> at<00:05:46.940> least<00:05:47.120> right<00:05:47.390> now

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
better quarterback at least right now

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.159 
better quarterback at least right now
for<00:05:47.960> this<00:05:48.080> team<00:05:48.410> but<00:05:49.390> well<00:05:50.390> if<00:05:50.630> it<00:05:50.750> turns<00:05:50.960> out

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
for this team but well if it turns out

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.200 
for this team but well if it turns out
that<00:05:51.230> way<00:05:51.620> and<00:05:51.860> they<00:05:52.250> knew<00:05:52.430> that<00:05:52.610> and<00:05:52.850> finding

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
that way and they knew that and finding

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.940 
that way and they knew that and finding
Michael<00:05:53.570> Vick<00:05:53.720> and<00:05:53.930> I<00:05:54.320> think<00:05:54.560> that's<00:05:54.740> one<00:05:54.919> of

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
Michael Vick and I think that's one of

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.010 
Michael Vick and I think that's one of
the<00:05:55.040> things<00:05:55.100> John<00:05:55.550> Idzik<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.240> Rex<00:05:56.480> Ryan<00:05:56.750> had

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
the things John Idzik and Rex Ryan had

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.370 
the things John Idzik and Rex Ryan had
to<00:05:57.050> deal<00:05:57.350> with<00:05:57.620> if<00:05:58.250> I<00:05:58.460> do<00:05:58.520> want<00:05:59.090> Geno<00:05:59.870> Smith<00:06:00.169> to

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
to deal with if I do want Geno Smith to

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.100 
to deal with if I do want Geno Smith to
be<00:06:00.410> the<00:06:00.680> quarterback<00:06:01.390> then<00:06:02.390> I<00:06:02.660> don't<00:06:02.990> know

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
be the quarterback then I don't know

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.950 
be the quarterback then I don't know
that<00:06:03.290> I<00:06:03.320> signed<00:06:03.830> michael<00:06:04.190> vick<00:06:04.520> unless<00:06:05.330> i<00:06:05.510> want

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
that I signed michael vick unless i want

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.720 
that I signed michael vick unless i want
to<00:06:06.020> have<00:06:06.140> an<00:06:06.230> open<00:06:06.350> competition<00:06:06.740> and<00:06:07.310> I<00:06:07.400> think

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
to have an open competition and I think

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.300 
to have an open competition and I think
that's<00:06:07.880> what<00:06:08.060> they<00:06:08.180> did<00:06:08.860> who's<00:06:09.860> more<00:06:10.100> likely

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
that's what they did who's more likely

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.480 
that's what they did who's more likely
to<00:06:10.550> start<00:06:10.850> the<00:06:11.480> sooner<00:06:12.440> Michael<00:06:13.100> Vick<00:06:13.310> or

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
to start the sooner Michael Vick or

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.800 
to start the sooner Michael Vick or
Johnny<00:06:13.700> Manziel<00:06:14.120> uh<00:06:15.730> i<00:06:16.730> would<00:06:16.970> say<00:06:17.180> Manziel<00:06:17.780> i

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
Johnny Manziel uh i would say Manziel i

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.680 
Johnny Manziel uh i would say Manziel i
think<00:06:18.380> though<00:06:18.530> half<00:06:19.040> they'll<00:06:19.820> have<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.060> riot<00:06:20.419> in
