hardtop convertibles and you're kind of
going<00:03:05.569> the<00:03:06.020> other<00:03:06.050> way<00:03:06.230> why<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.950> ragtop<00:03:07.520> versus

well<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.140> packaging<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.740> so<00:03:09.770> much<00:03:10.130> better<00:03:10.400> and

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
well the packaging is so much better and

to<00:03:10.760> be<00:03:10.850> honest<00:03:11.060> you'll<00:03:11.270> see<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.660> the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
to be honest you'll see that the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.390 
to be honest you'll see that the
industry<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.290> progressively<00:03:12.860> moving<00:03:13.160> away

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
industry is progressively moving away

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.970 
industry is progressively moving away
from<00:03:14.120> those<00:03:14.300> hard<00:03:14.990> tops<00:03:15.319> as<00:03:15.530> well<00:03:15.770> they

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
from those hard tops as well they

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.520 
from those hard tops as well they
created<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.000> lot<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.180> issues<00:03:17.360> in<00:03:18.020> terms<00:03:18.290> of

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
created a lot of issues in terms of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.100 
created a lot of issues in terms of
packaging<00:03:19.270> rigidity<00:03:20.270> what<00:03:20.660> we<00:03:20.750> can<00:03:20.930> get<00:03:21.050> with

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
packaging rigidity what we can get with

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.260 
packaging rigidity what we can get with
this<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:21.980> torsional<00:03:22.220> rigidity<00:03:22.640> in<00:03:23.150> the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
this is is the torsional rigidity in the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.030 
this is is the torsional rigidity in the
vehicle<00:03:23.690> which<00:03:23.780> gives<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.319> that<00:03:24.440> great<00:03:24.800> ride

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
vehicle which gives you that great ride

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.040 
vehicle which gives you that great ride
that<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.280> talked<00:03:25.550> about<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.360> packaging<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.020> a

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
that I talked about the packaging is a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.020 
that I talked about the packaging is a
lot<00:03:27.260> smaller<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:27.950> get<00:03:28.100> great<00:03:28.280> trunk<00:03:28.730> space

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
lot smaller so you get great trunk space

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.330 
lot smaller so you get great trunk space
so<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.510> really<00:03:29.780> is<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.260> ground<00:03:30.739> sore<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:31.310> the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
so it really is a ground sore in the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.860 
so it really is a ground sore in the
truest<00:03:31.700> sense<00:03:31.880> of<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.090> word<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:32.540> can<00:03:32.690> fit

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
truest sense of the word you can fit

selling<00:03:47.269> convertible<00:03:47.660> in<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.780> States<00:03:48.050> I

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
selling convertible in the States I

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.990 
selling convertible in the States I
think<00:03:48.319> it's<00:03:48.410> all<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.769> over<00:03:48.980> 13,000<00:03:49.730> meters

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
think it's all just over 13,000 meters

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.729 
think it's all just over 13,000 meters
what<00:03:50.390> do<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.540> think<00:03:50.720> this<00:03:50.810> will<00:03:50.930> fall<00:03:51.170> we're

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
what do you think this will fall we're

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:52.990 
what do you think this will fall we're
looking<00:03:52.040> at<00:03:52.160> probably<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.550> little<00:03:52.670> bit<00:03:52.850> less

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
looking at probably a little bit less

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.590 
looking at probably a little bit less
than<00:03:53.209> that

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
than that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.030

this<00:03:53.780> segment<00:03:53.989> is<00:03:54.260> of<00:03:54.410> only<00:03:54.530> about<00:03:54.830> one

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
this segment is of only about one

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.220 
this segment is of only about one
percent<00:03:55.069> of<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.610> US<00:03:55.910> market<00:03:56.239> but<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:56.930> think<00:03:57.140> the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
percent of the US market but I think the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.199
