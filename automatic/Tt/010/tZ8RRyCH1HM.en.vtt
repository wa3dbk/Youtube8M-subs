this is a game review test drive

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.089 
this is a game review test drive
off-road<00:00:05.580> wide<00:00:06.150> open<00:00:07.099> for<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.870> original<00:00:09.870> Xbox

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.390 

now<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.130> really<00:00:14.790> think<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.269> game<00:00:15.770> was<00:00:16.770> nothing

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
now I really think this game was nothing

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:29.060 
now I really think this game was nothing
that<00:00:18.800> complicated<00:00:26.240> that<00:00:27.240> better<00:00:28.109> vibe<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
that complicated that better vibe to the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.810 
that complicated that better vibe to the
game<00:00:29.810> but<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.080> said<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:32.219> think<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.700> was<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
game but I said I really think it was a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
game but I said I really think it was a
good<00:00:33.030> name<00:00:33.239> there<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.200> big<00:00:34.649> game<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.010> my

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
good name there was a big game in my

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:47.209 
good name there was a big game in my
childhood<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:36.149> play<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.050> game<00:00:45.860> 10<00:00:46.860> years

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
childhood just play this game 10 years

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.770 
childhood just play this game 10 years
later<00:00:49.550> now<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:52.460> think<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.670> vehicles<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.600> this

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
later now I think the vehicles in this

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.529 
later now I think the vehicles in this
for<00:00:55.020> free<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.420> vehicles<00:00:57.960> themselves<00:00:59.539> how

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
for free the vehicles themselves how

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.529 
for free the vehicles themselves how
they<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.899> awesome<00:01:01.109> off-road<00:01:01.980> movie<00:01:02.539> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
they have awesome off-road movie that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.440 
they have awesome off-road movie that
just<00:01:03.899> struck<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> kid

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
just struck me I was a kid

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.890 
just struck me I was a kid
big<00:01:07.409> crops<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> gameplay<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.119> very<00:01:12.360> good

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
big crops and the gameplay is very good

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.920 
big crops and the gameplay is very good
I<00:01:13.700> think<00:01:14.700> they<00:01:14.850> made<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> little<00:01:15.420> too<00:01:15.720> easy

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
I think they made a little too easy

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.539 
I think they made a little too easy
that's<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.100> me<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:19.009> played<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.310> since

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that's just me because played this since

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.560 
that's just me because played this since
I<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.000> kid<00:01:21.380> no<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.409> seemed<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.280> easy<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
I was a kid no one seemed all easy but I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.130 
I was a kid no one seemed all easy but I
really<00:01:25.290> think<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.650> very<00:01:25.799> game

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.840 

I<00:01:32.700> think<00:01:33.700> those<00:01:33.880> are<00:01:34.090> my<00:01:34.270> favorite<00:01:34.720> time<00:01:34.900> okay

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
I think those are my favorite time okay

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.890 
I think those are my favorite time okay
but<00:01:36.850> I'll<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:37.600> um<00:01:38.080> show<00:01:39.010> you<00:01:39.070> old<00:01:39.310> gameplay

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
but I'll just um show you old gameplay

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.440 
but I'll just um show you old gameplay
of<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.100> looked<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:44.970> nothing<00:01:45.970> special

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
of what it looked like nothing special

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.710 
of what it looked like nothing special
but<00:01:47.050> it<00:01:47.200> was<00:01:47.350> pretty<00:01:47.979> good<00:01:48.070> game<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:49.030> don't

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
but it was pretty good game I don't

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.920
