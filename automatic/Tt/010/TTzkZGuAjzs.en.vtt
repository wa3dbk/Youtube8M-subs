00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110

think i'm on a roll the reason I I mean
and<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> reason<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.070> haven't<00:01:26.310> been<00:01:26.549> doing<00:01:26.850> not

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and the reason I haven't been doing not

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.469 
and the reason I haven't been doing not
as<00:01:27.360> much<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:27.600> videos<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:30.270> not

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
as much as videos is one I'm it's not

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
as much as videos is one I'm it's not
that<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.689> don't<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.049> time<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.490> need

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that I don't have time it's just I need

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
that I don't have time it's just I need
to<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:32.970> other<00:01:33.180> stuff<00:01:33.509> even<00:01:33.960> though<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> don't

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
to do other stuff even though I don't

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.800 
to do other stuff even though I don't
sometimes<00:01:35.220> patting<00:01:35.820> me<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.270> other<00:01:36.420> stuff

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
sometimes patting me to do other stuff

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.830 
sometimes patting me to do other stuff
the<00:01:37.290> second<00:01:38.189> reason<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.210> any

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the second reason is I don't have any

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.389 
the second reason is I don't have any
good<00:01:40.110> ideas<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:42.409> can<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.770> anything<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
good ideas I know I can do anything I

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.910 
good ideas I know I can do anything I
can<00:01:44.579> display<00:01:44.790> anything<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> find<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
can display anything but I find that

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.820 
can display anything but I find that
really<00:01:47.369> boring<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:49.880> don't<00:01:50.880> feel<00:01:51.210> it

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
really boring and I don't feel it

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.950 
really boring and I don't feel it
but<00:01:53.010> I<00:01:53.280> actually<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.910> some<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.690> good

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
but I actually have some really good

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.680 
but I actually have some really good
