technically less when you're supposed to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.730 
technically less when you're supposed to
get<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:46.430> actually<00:00:48.199> caught<00:00:49.199> this

center stars because the captured

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.490 
center stars because the captured
footage<00:01:02.120> ended<00:01:02.540> up<00:01:03.790> getting<00:01:04.790> screwed<00:01:05.500> we

the bee suit and it gets said more
annoying<00:01:20.300> since<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.900> entire<00:01:21.830> stage

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
annoying since the entire stage

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.160 
annoying since the entire stage
basically<00:01:22.910> there's<00:01:23.090> water<00:01:23.330> except<00:01:23.780> for<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.020> few

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.520 

and<00:01:44.690> here<00:01:45.690> on<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.870> platform<00:01:46.080> is<00:01:46.350> little

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and here on this platform is little

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.740 
and here on this platform is little
penguin<00:01:46.770> Kali<00:01:46.950> has<00:01:47.100> something<00:01:47.430> worthwhile<00:01:47.750> to

here this little pink guy on the left

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.530 
here this little pink guy on the left
side<00:02:01.290> that's<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.250> floating<00:02:02.640> monster<00:02:03.060> bits

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
side that's a floating monster bits

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.790 
side that's a floating monster bits
those<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.350> hungry<00:02:05.130> Lumas<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.710> well<00:02:07.710> I'll

the<00:02:09.720> idea<00:02:10.020> here<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.760> catch<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> two<00:02:12.090> stars

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
the idea here is to catch the two stars

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.690 
the idea here is to catch the two stars
before<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.230> fly<00:02:13.470> too<00:02:13.530> far<00:02:13.980> because<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.340> will

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
before you fly too far because you will

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.310 
before you fly too far because you will
you<00:02:14.940> will<00:02:15.120> die<00:02:15.390> if<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.690> don't<00:02:15.810> get<00:02:15.960> those<00:02:16.080> blue

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
you will die if you don't get those blue

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.520 
you will die if you don't get those blue
stars<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.840> nice<00:02:21.990> team<00:02:22.170> shot<00:02:22.350> you

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.360 
back
onto<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.940> platform<00:02:25.200> but<00:02:26.200> anyway<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:26.830> say<00:02:27.130> me

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
onto the platform but anyway as I say me

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.700 
onto the platform but anyway as I say me
the<00:02:28.150> peak<00:02:28.360> guy<00:02:28.510> with<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.840> star<00:02:29.260> bitch<00:02:29.440> he's<00:02:29.680> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
bunch of star bits and if you do he'll

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.410 
bunch of star bits and if you do he'll
turn<00:02:35.290> into<00:02:35.590> some<00:02:36.190> kind<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.430> transportations

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
turn into some kind of transportations

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.110

shoot you off on to a secret star for

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.870 
shoot you off on to a secret star for
the<00:02:43.240> stage<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.890> completely<00:02:45.340> bypass<00:02:45.700> it

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
the stage is completely bypass it

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.070 
the stage is completely bypass it
because<00:02:46.120> that's<00:02:46.270> not<00:02:46.390> what<00:02:46.570> I'm<00:02:46.660> doing<00:02:46.930> I'll

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
because that's not what I'm doing I'll

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.040 
because that's not what I'm doing I'll
probably<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.760> one<00:02:49.030> voice<00:02:49.210> but<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.690> want<00:02:49.990> to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
probably do that one voice but I want to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:03:03.100 
probably do that one voice but I want to
finish<00:02:50.770> this<00:02:51.010> one
