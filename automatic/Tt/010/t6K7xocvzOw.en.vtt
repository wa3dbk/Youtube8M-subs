00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
with the end portal and that struck me

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
as odd so I went ahead and did a little

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.209 
as odd so I went ahead and did a little
more<00:01:53.579> exploring<00:01:54.290> see<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.680> water<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.100> that

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
as you can see it would take a quite a

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.860 
as you can see it would take a quite a
bit<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.830> swim<00:03:31.070> but<00:03:31.850> we<00:03:32.090> are<00:03:32.270> approaching<00:03:32.570> our

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
teardrop final which is what I've dubbed

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.640 
teardrop final which is what I've dubbed
it<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:03.380> humbly<00:05:04.250> myself<00:05:04.840> just<00:05:05.840> around<00:05:06.320> the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
it so humbly myself just around the

it so humbly myself just around the
Riverbend<00:05:07.070> or<00:05:07.390> not<00:05:08.390> necessarily<00:05:08.810> river<00:05:08.990> but

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
Riverbend or not necessarily river but

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.130 
Riverbend or not necessarily river but
the<00:05:10.220> final<00:05:10.669> real<00:05:10.940> highlight<00:05:11.330> of<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:11.600> seed<00:05:11.900> and

the final real highlight of the seed and

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.720 
the final real highlight of the seed and
it<00:05:12.530> was<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.919> one<00:05:13.040> that<00:05:13.280> caught<00:05:13.430> me<00:05:13.580> off<00:05:13.610> guard

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730
