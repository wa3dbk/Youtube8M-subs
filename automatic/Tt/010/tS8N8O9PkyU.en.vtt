00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
going to pick it up but I decided to get

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.650 
going to pick it up but I decided to get
it<00:00:17.850> today<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.270> Monday<00:00:19.730> that<00:00:20.730> being<00:00:21.000> said<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.510> lot

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
it today on Monday that being said a lot

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.450 
it today on Monday that being said a lot
of<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.020> probably<00:00:22.170> played<00:00:22.560> many<00:00:23.039> hours

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
of you have probably played many hours

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.670 
of you have probably played many hours
into<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> game<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.410> doesn't<00:00:25.560> really

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
into the game so it doesn't really

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.189 
into the game so it doesn't really
require<00:00:25.920> too<00:00:26.430> much<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.789> an<00:00:26.910> explanation<00:00:27.210> it's

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
require too much of an explanation it's

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.439 
require too much of an explanation it's
for<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.680> player<00:00:28.980> 8<00:00:29.250> megabytes<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.060> save<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
for one player 8 megabytes to save the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.520 
for one player 8 megabytes to save the
game<00:00:30.630> up<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.230> 1080p<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.920> resolution<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
game up to 1080p and resolution and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
game up to 1080p and resolution and
there<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.620> game<00:00:34.800> content<00:00:35.280> download<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.000> guess

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
there is game content download I guess

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.410 
there is game content download I guess
there's<00:00:37.200> downloadable<00:00:37.649> content<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.640> I've

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
there's downloadable content so I've

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.639 
there's downloadable content so I've
never<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.870> played<00:00:40.020> any<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> other

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
never really played any of the other

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.970 
never really played any of the other

let's open it up so there's no
background<00:01:42.570> art<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.530> u.s.<00:01:43.890> there<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
background art and the u.s. there is

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.230 
background art and the u.s. there is
that<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.759> looks<00:01:45.090> pretty<00:01:45.299> nice<00:01:50.149> there's<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that this looks pretty nice there's a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
that this looks pretty nice there's a
map<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.899> guess<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.939> made<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:56.119> pretty

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
map I guess and it's made out of pretty

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.030 
map I guess and it's made out of pretty
hard<00:01:57.420> material<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.439> i<00:01:58.500> don't<00:01:58.710> know<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:58.979> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
hard material so i don't know if this is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.399 
hard material so i don't know if this is
in<00:01:59.310> all<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> regular<00:01:59.909> games<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.420> not<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:01.320> it

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
in all the regular games or not but it

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.980 
in all the regular games or not but it
feels<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.829> very<00:02:02.070> hard<00:02:02.430> cardboard

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:17.010 

okay<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.490> this<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.820> pretty<00:02:16.030> cool<00:02:16.150> but<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.870> be

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
okay so this is pretty cool but to be

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.400 
okay so this is pretty cool but to be
honest<00:02:17.850> unless<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.000> really<00:02:19.270> like<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.690> game<00:02:19.930> I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
honest unless I really like the game I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.410 
honest unless I really like the game I
don't<00:02:20.950> see<00:02:21.220> myself<00:02:21.370> opening<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.209> up<00:02:22.420> so

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
don't see myself opening this up so

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.420 
don't see myself opening this up so
might<00:02:25.420> sound<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.810> bit<00:02:25.840> bored<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.250> only

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
might sound a bit bored but the only

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.220 
might sound a bit bored but the only
reason<00:02:27.550> where<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.030> really<00:02:28.390> got<00:02:28.570> this<00:02:28.600> game<00:02:28.990> is

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
reason where I really got this game is

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.180 
reason where I really got this game is
