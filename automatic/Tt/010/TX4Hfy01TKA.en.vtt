00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.930
 welcome bodybuilding lovers 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.360
 in this issue we will look at 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.130
 one very interesting training system 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.590
 called max out 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.660
 or maximum about world training or 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.050
 maximum super intense trainer 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.780
 the author of the system gender is well known 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.809
 journalist athlete researcher scientist 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 and businessman the head of the company 6 sport 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.170
 science 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.449
 It is believed that exactly the sex of the delay is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 whey protein maker like 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.339
 product in the sports nutrition market to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.899
 his merit is also credited with the discovery 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.239
 The beneficial effect of ephedrine for 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.949
 athletes not to mention some 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.079
 individual sports nutrition products 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.960
 on which he worked within 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.699
 ice tee companies 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.620
 his training system at the Max type 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.570
 implies a 12 week training 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.370
 course 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.170
 published in a special copyright 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.630
 edition of more than 300 pages 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.570
 we will try to briefly convey to you 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.400
 basic principles of the system for those who 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.110
 will want to try to train by 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.120
 of this system we strongly 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.040
 recommend downloading the original image 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.080
 Books do not use exclusively 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.220
 what scrapbooks and main ideas 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.230
 So go tell me the techniques max 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.510
 leave we will on the basis of answers to 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.780
 questions that will surely arise 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.960
 you 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.090
 for whom the author is designed 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.540
 recommends this system to everyone without 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.980
 exceptions for both men and women 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.850
 wanting to gain or lose weight 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.410
 as well as to keep fit 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.920
 It is designed more for natural 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.830
 training 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.830
 but this is personally our opinion of myself 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.229
 represents system max go away 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.030
 Paul Deley positions its system as 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.420
 full training course 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.450
 consisting of 12 weeks it is really 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.179
 so attention is paid to every little thing 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.220
 in addition to the usual for us power schemes and 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.440
 workouts much attention is paid 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.020
 mental development detailed analysis 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.660
 certain foods and exercises 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.650
 also sports nutrition and discussion 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.470
 common mistakes 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.080
 as well as solid theoretical baggage 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.610
 knowledge of human physiology that will 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.239
 especially useful for beginners 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.750
 the system itself is described in stages from the beginning 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.610
 that is, 1 week to the end of 12 weeks and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 important in this system is high 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.990
 intensity that is hard work on 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.920
 throughout the workout which 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.440
 Lasts up to 40 minutes at the heart of the system 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.720
 The following principles lie first 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.170
 train only one or two groups 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.360
 muscles for one workout a day 2 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.120
 do 4 to 6 reps per set 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.050
 3 on one muscle group do from 6 to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.560
 maximum of 9 approaches 4 between approaches 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.050
 rest two or three minutes each 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.840
 training should last 30 or 40 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.260
 minutes every muscle group train 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.239
 once every 5 or 7 days after eight or 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.180
 ten week training cycle 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.010
 stay for one week at the very 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.350
 to start training for 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.720
 this knowledge system of basic principles 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.989
 not enough as stated earlier 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.300
 the system consists of many parts 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.530
 mandatory to comply 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.370
 analyze the basic principles on which 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.250
 the author especially pays attention to the norm 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.440
 considered a 30 minute workout can 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.549
 train for up to 40 minutes but better 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.250
 less than more 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:51.459
 such a small workout time due 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.530
 so that the first other save 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.140
 maximum training motivation 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.110
 the second maximizes hormonal peaks 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.350
 the third is reduced risk 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.370
 overtraining 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.900
 and one is better he explains it not only 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.549
 so that we need to create 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.970
 maximum intensity for 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.060
 certain time is more important to keep 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.160
 psychologically 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.920
 and and physical configure on the same group 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.260
 muscle focusing on one muscle 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.709
 group you achieve greater muscle 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.090
 cuts more fiber overload 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.790
 one hundred percent psychological control and 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.150
 100% intensity boost 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.520
 your height that is this total 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.250
 approaches to any exercise for one 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.750
 muscle groups for example if you have three 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.460
 different exercises on the chest 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.710
 the number of approaches in each of these 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.650
 exercise should not exceed 2-3 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.660
 approach this allows the muscles to be in 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.639
 working tone throughout 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.510
 workout 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:51.010
 4 or 6 repetitions depends on the exercise. 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.889
 it is also important to choose the right weight 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.200
 so that 4 or 6 repetitions come so 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.270
 called positive failure when 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.710
 next repetition and possible without 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.440
 forcing or assisting mate 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.169
 in the process of so-called vesa growth 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.770
 must constantly grow but pick up so 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.900
 for 46 repetitions, the author categorically 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.630
 against seeking approaches or approaches 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.130
 muscle movement no height with such 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.289
 tricks can not be 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.390
 lactic acid excretion 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.970
 training kills all efficiency 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.640
 the norm is two three minutes is the amount 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.230
 time allows you to recover 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.330
 intracellular energy stores and wash 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.730
 any lactic acid residues that 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.630
 left over from the previous color allows 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.150
 restore 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.680
 anaerobic capacity is very important 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.050
 recover fully before 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.300
 performing the next approach because 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.460
 what's your ability to hold muscle up 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.510
 maximum overwork directly 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.040
 will affect muscular growth itself 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.440
 the selected full time is required for 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.360
 correct recovery time on 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.210
 restoration is chosen according to 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.000
 load in the process of training weekly 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.070
 a breather gives your body the opportunity 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.540
 recover and grow 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.520
 figuratively speaking it is yours 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.190
 reward eight or ten 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.330
 weeks of hard training 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.670
 eat well and for this period 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.910
 your muscles will come very good 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.910
 anabolic state is all that 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.280
 concerns the basic principles of the system 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.960
 nutrition plays an important role 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.610
 The power schemes described are accurate. 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.639
 calculations of carbohydrates and proteins and fats 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.039
 as well as recommendations for supplements in the book 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.469
 There are a lot of pages for food 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:37.930
 there is even a table with energy 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:39.699
 value of important products 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.669
 it’s better to be yourself 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:45.039
 opening a book the same applies to 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.270
 exercise review so as not to break 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.889
 copyright 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.080
 we will not post links for 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:52.449
 downloading a book to find it will not be 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.289
 work on the Internet even in Russian 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:58.479
 on this perhaps all put huskies if 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:02.099
 you liked the release of sharing with friends 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:02.099
