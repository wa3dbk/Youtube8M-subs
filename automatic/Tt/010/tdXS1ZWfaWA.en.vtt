00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
three in ableton I will be also using

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.760 
three in ableton I will be also using
turning<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.960> allowing<00:01:21.960> attacking<00:01:22.439> purple

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
turning and allowing attacking purple

considered<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.920> dock<00:01:29.159> which<00:01:29.430> means<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.000> will

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
considered a dock which means it will

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.899 
considered a dock which means it will
only<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:31.020> cast<00:01:32.009> once<00:01:32.490> per<00:01:32.880> mob<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> my

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
only be cast once per mob and and my

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
only be cast once per mob and and my
third<00:01:36.119> attack<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.659> actually<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> damage<00:01:37.619> over

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
third attack is actually a damage over

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.789 
third attack is actually a damage over
time<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.570> why<00:01:39.689> i'll<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.900> using<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.439> that

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
time so that's why i'll be using on that

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
time so that's why i'll be using on that
character<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> over<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> right
