00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.190
 mr johannes here from news.de and us 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.260
 are at the computex 2013 in taipei and 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.430
 look at us at the asus stand 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.800
 new beautiful castle t300 to a notebook 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.279
 with removable tablet we have so 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.450
 here 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.960
 if we look at the tablet first 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.390
 a 13.3 inch tablet with a resolution 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.259
 from full hd 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.000
 Of course we have touch here 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.500
 is not going to have any other way here 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.180
 a windows button this little 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.520
 physically but a touch button 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.440
 You might be bothered because then you come 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.850
 perhaps we'll see about it 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.300
 The display has a 27p webcam 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.980
 and 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.180
 as you can see here we have too 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.800
 once again a full hd camera with the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.239
 you can record full hd videos 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.670
 Let's take a look at this from here 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.320
 side we have here on the left side 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.610
 once out of six hdmi port around the whole 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.070
 then a beamer or a television 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.619
 This can be connected to an audio 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.020
 port and a usb 2.0 ports around 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.100
 for example, a usb stick or a 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.350
 hard disk to connect 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.619
 Here we have only the loud press and 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.700
 below just the docking port around the then 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.159
 to connect to the base station 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.110
 are now briefly to the side of the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.979
 keyboard dock itself has here how to 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.630
 Can see a chiclet keyboard like that 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.179
 not lit as you can see here 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.850
 we have the touchpad with integrated 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.860
 mouse buttons and what I like very well 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.630
 Like the whole is metals therefrom 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.880
 feels very good 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.670
 also learn here at the side 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.750
 once a micro usb port around the whole 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.399

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.619
 and here is the spanier 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.740
 There, the talent is simply used 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.080
 and then can be just as a notebook 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.770
 just use the tab 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.060
 be inserted into the notebook and 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.090
 already it is a full-fledged notebook 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.149

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.440
