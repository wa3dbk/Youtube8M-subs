00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 you have always moved away from those things 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 however, you have always been undecided, so the rain finally caught us 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 the umbrellas went flying by the wind 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 we did not receive a good job, so you said a step adalante 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 you have always hated those things 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 no matter how far they were 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 you tried to put your effort 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 the reason why `` is there any way? '' is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 that you were enormously lost and it was painful 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 that's why, I want you to use my voice, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 for people who can not understand it 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 It hurts my ears, it's a horrible voice. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 that's why I am telling you, 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 that without doubt will be your power. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 that's why I try to sing it to you 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 That's right, yours, your only words. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 I will spell them and align 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I'm going to shout those words (thoughts) 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 I will paint the ideal 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.500
 that thought of anyone I will take it away 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.000
 a voice in the trash is resonating, 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 that clumsily connects the truth. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 surrounded by looks, that voice is screaming. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 some day you will be popular, 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Many people will recognize you, and I will feel proud 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 but one day you changed. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 I was cold as well as alone. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Hey, I'm more than the voice of a machine 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 I have confidence in myself 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 but you could not contain 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 I hated you 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 There is someone behind you who says: 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 `` The fox uses the power of the tiger '' you should be crying in solitude. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Can you hear this voice? 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 That words makes it disappear. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 I know the truth, 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 whose kindness is ruined 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 a voice in the trash is singing, 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 not for anybody else, if not for you 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 in the distance it is being shattered 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 I do not think the thousands of words of those two people matter. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 but I do not think I can think of anything more than that. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 because I understand everything. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 `` Yes, I'm sure this is a dream I'll never wake up but I'll find you in the dream 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 still in the trash is showing a face full of happiness 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 he is calling you but he can not move anymore 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 I hoped that in the end, you would scream 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 but it's a lie, a lie, it's me who screams 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 I feel important. I'm just in the trash and I can not save myself 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 the thoughts are tears 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 that drip down my cheeks moistening 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 at that time the world 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 it changes enormously and immediately its color 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 pain and joy, 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 people know all about those things 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 in this world the word becomes songs, 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 and again I run for you 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 that voice, has a new meaning 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Now, memories resonate.
