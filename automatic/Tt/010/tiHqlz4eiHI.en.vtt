00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.840 

you

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.040 

okay<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:34.880> just<00:01:34.970> got<00:01:35.300> back<00:01:35.510> home<00:01:35.570> and

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
okay I just got back home and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.740 
okay I just got back home and
unfortunately<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.890> didn't<00:01:37.280> pass<00:01:37.490> my<00:01:37.850> module

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
unfortunately I didn't pass my module

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.100 
unfortunately I didn't pass my module
one<00:01:38.980> but<00:01:39.980> it's<00:01:40.340> it's<00:01:40.790> all<00:01:41.630> good<00:01:41.810> really

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
one but it's it's all good really

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.960 
one but it's it's all good really
because<00:01:42.410> I<00:01:42.680> did<00:01:43.160> all<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.490> minus<00:01:43.760> vias

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
because I did all the minus vias

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.990 
because I did all the minus vias
perfectly<00:01:45.130> with<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.250> exception<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.820> the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
perfectly with the exception of the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.110 
perfectly with the exception of the
speed<00:01:47.300> through<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.780> speed<00:01:48.050> traps<00:01:48.940> which<00:01:49.940> is

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
speed through the speed traps which is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.360 
speed through the speed traps which is
really<00:01:50.390> frustrating<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:51.110> think<00:01:51.500> because<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.950> was

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
really frustrating I think because I was

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.770 
really frustrating I think because I was
in<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.690> two<00:01:53.690> kilometers<00:01:54.470> an<00:01:54.740> hour<00:01:55.210> under<00:01:56.210> of

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
in the two kilometers an hour under of

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.670 
in the two kilometers an hour under of
what<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.080> should<00:01:57.110> be<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.950> did<00:01:58.400> 48<00:01:58.730> kph<00:01:59.540> for<00:02:00.530> my

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
what it should be so I did 48 kph for my

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.300 
what it should be so I did 48 kph for my
swerve<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.760> I<00:02:02.450> was<00:02:02.570> actually<00:02:02.660> dead<00:02:02.930> on<00:02:03.110> for<00:02:04.040> my

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
swerve and I was actually dead on for my

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.730 
swerve and I was actually dead on for my
emergency<00:02:04.550> stop<00:02:05.000> at<00:02:05.210> 51<00:02:05.870> kph<00:02:06.790> so<00:02:07.790> it's<00:02:08.740> feeling

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
emergency stop at 51 kph so it's feeling

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.260 
emergency stop at 51 kph so it's feeling
pretty<00:02:09.770> positive<00:02:10.040> because<00:02:10.460> all<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
pretty positive because all the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.250 
pretty positive because all the
maneuvers<00:02:11.570> like<00:02:11.600> tuning<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.080> road

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
maneuvers like tuning the road

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.380 
maneuvers like tuning the road
figure-of-eight<00:02:13.190> swerve<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:15.700> slalom<00:02:16.700> went

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
figure-of-eight swerve and slalom went

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.630 
figure-of-eight swerve and slalom went
really<00:02:17.540> well<00:02:17.660> I've<00:02:18.590> got<00:02:18.740> three<00:02:19.010> minors<00:02:19.460> and

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
really well I've got three minors and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.630 
really well I've got three minors and
total<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.510> course<00:02:20.890> they're<00:02:21.890> not<00:02:22.250> up<00:02:22.490> to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
total and of course they're not up to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.080 
total and of course they're not up to
speed<00:02:22.760> on<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.050> match<00:02:24.200> on<00:02:24.380> maneuvers

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
speed on one of the match on maneuvers

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.390 
speed on one of the match on maneuvers
although<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.210> is<00:02:26.330> frustrating<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.500> can<00:02:28.220> take

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
although it is frustrating I can take

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.520 
although it is frustrating I can take
positive<00:02:28.850> things<00:02:29.060> away<00:02:29.300> from<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.230> I'm<00:02:30.350> just

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
positive things away from it so I'm just

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.930 
positive things away from it so I'm just
going<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.740> book<00:02:31.100> another<00:02:31.220> one<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.610> get<00:02:31.730> back

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
going to book another one and get back

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.870 
going to book another one and get back
write<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.810> back<00:02:32.960> in<00:02:33.110> there<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:34.310> hopefully<00:02:34.430> I

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
write it back in there so hopefully I

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.850 
write it back in there so hopefully I
won't<00:02:35.360> be<00:02:35.480> too<00:02:35.780> long<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.320> get<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.800> I

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
won't be too long so I get that and I

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.100 
won't be too long so I get that and I
can<00:02:37.010> move<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.370> my<00:02:37.460> mitral<00:02:37.670> tea<00:02:38.020> but<00:02:39.020> yeah

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
can move on to my mitral tea but yeah

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.440
