00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.610
 but until my training ended and 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.780
 will be after the training reception 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.890
 food is tilapia fillets and some green 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.400
 vegetables with 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.859
 post-workout beans like 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.000
 don't always eat oak meal plus 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.740
 now already 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 quite late evening therefore 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.780
 carbohydrates we do not accept forks 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.360
 with vegetables and tell about 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.280
 workout today workout 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:46.110
 dedicated was shoulder width helps 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.480
 make the shoulders ball-shaped solves 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.949
 the problem does not give 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.829
 almost all exercises were targeted 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.120
 on the middle bunch 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.219
 first exercise level of how I 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.820
 stretched his arms made dumbbells in 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.360
 parties 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.540
 one approach 100 reps to table 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.560
 reiteration 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:14.630
 had it been a buzz come out and burned 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.820
 but I kept doing that way I 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.370
 caught the maximum amount of blood 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.340
 prominent muscle flips and all subsequent 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.500
 exercise I already felt very well 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.200
 muscle and because there is a blood joint 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.260
 softened it was comfortable enough to do 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.420
 and there were pleasant sensations following mine 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.759
 exercise was dumbbell traction 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.880
 dumbbells to the chin but up to the chin and 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.270
 did not reach accented on average 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.890
 bundle 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.360
 in this exercise trapezium still works 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.610
 try to trapeze as much as possible 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.390
 isolate who does it get 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.240
 someone does not work you need to study the case 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.869
 I didn't just wear super not even 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.300
 super set drop light shed weight 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.160
 I got 4 drops of 10 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.190
 repetitions 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.790
 I made four such approaches after 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.600
 this one fell swoop down 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.269
 dumbbell this exercise I like those 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.730
 that I can concentrate on each 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.120
 of the parties since I have one country 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.150
 slightly weaker other due to injuries and 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.430
 I recommend to include in your workout 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.290
 always one way 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.340
 either by hand one at 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.810
 in order to smooth and symmetry if 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.689
 she is there 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.569
 as a rule, 90 percent have some 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:46.430
 part of the body is stronger or weaker if larger 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.200
 the other helps him get hurt 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.989
 training ie one-sided did 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.599
 one hand made 2 and on the lagging hand 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.269
 I usually finish off a couple of several 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.000
 reps to create a tad 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:02.560
 a little more stress than on that hand 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.810
 which blue I did for 15 reps 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:12.310
 4 approaches after that I made a mafia 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.019
 over the head with dumbbells full amplitude 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.750
 here it was already included well 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.870
 enough trapezoid and middle bunch over 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.930
 the entire length of the exercise worked quite 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.230
 did the old long forgotten in times 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.139
 Arnold it performed but periodically I 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.030
 I recommend to include your split 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.840
 training program to 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.109
 shock 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.599
 and create some kind of new stress get 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.970
 new sensations 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.150
 try try i did 4 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.790
 approaches for 15 reps weight here should 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.190
 to be insignificant in order not to 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.479
 injured and technically correct 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.260
 do the exercises further I did the bench press 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:59.520
 in the simulator we press in the simulator because 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.860
 slightly unusual angle of inclination and 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.570
 sensations in the simulator were it was new 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.670
 I repeat again I love stress 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.950
 New constantly if I see in the hall 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.400
 some kind of simulators that even earlier 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.840
 she didn't use me always the moment 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.550
 catch and do this exercise drop set 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.620
 made friend color was double total 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.069
 once krasava weight and continued to do 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.979
 then reading triple do triple 3 3 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:34.879
 fold dumps put on here already worked up 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.360
 failure and at the end of the workout 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.810
 when the shoulders were already tired 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.780
 practical fan 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:46.930
 I made traction with a gentle block 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:51.580
 craving for chin but where did the average 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:55.990
 bundle and trapezius muscle made 4 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.810
 Approach 15-20 reps on this 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.470
 my training is over 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.990
 all exercises were aimed at 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.810
 visual 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.310
 deltoid extension and made them 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.370
 spherical so that shoulders like 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:17.100
 extra heads were 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.280
 If your children are lagging behind, I recommend 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.740
 you do a separate workout del plus 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.640
 include some bundles with others 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.070
 muscle groups 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.800
 front beam can be turned on with chest 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.140
 back beam can be turned on with back 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.880
 the middle beam can still be made 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.310
 additionally when leg training is in progress 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.570
 thus affecting the delta 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.700
 will be high and it will be specialization 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.330
 on improving the proportion and your external 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.580
