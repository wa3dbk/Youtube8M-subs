00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.150
 Welcome backstage 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.150
 the first fc kaiserslautern meeting 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.859
 against fortuna düsseldorf 1 to 1 endstand 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.410
 and we have a fresh shower 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.930
 Sebastian Jacob and our guest from the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.689
 club lounge florian graves from the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.720
 westerwald beautiful day florian that you 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.520
 sebastian is an intense game with us 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.130
 the düsseldorfer have us alive 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.020
 really hard and therefore one 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.860
 chance the game almost for yourself 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.649
 decided 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 how did you experience so yes düsseldorf 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.950
 has ordered defensively very very 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.420
 stood staggered by what has 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.309
 especially in the first pass very 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.809
 hard for us to get through 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.309
 even though I think we are over 90 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.559
 minutes were the better team and 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 clearly have determined the game yes then 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.280
 luckily we still have it to 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.600
 saved with a point and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.399
 it would almost be the second goal 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.320
 but i like the point 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.270
 we can live 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 why was it that you were despite this 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.500
 superiority also the trainer 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.840
 once again has painted out too little 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.180
 handy in front of the goalkeeper too few chances 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.040
 he played it is natural 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.770
 hard so I think the necessary 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.350
 consequence in the very last part 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.000
 maybe something was missing and it is not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.380
 simply if there are many behind 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.340
 stand and have opponents too 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.200
 ordered to stand 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.299
 and then it may not be that way 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.189
 Good comes through and yes then we have 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.509
 just got a gate and as I said 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.119
 then be able to equalize 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 Luckily, describe yours to us 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.689
 Impressions if you are so slow now 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.310
 surely more and more responsibility 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.759
 takes over again today 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.970
 been 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.590
 What does that mean for you, yes, that's what it was 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.820
 my home debut here now i have yes 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.560
 already twice played away but 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.520
 here on the local betzenberg the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.590
 is something special 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.119
 So if you see what wall here 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.439
 stands and how the fans are on 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.329
 lash and support 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.649
 there is also much easier grad 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.799
 if you then comes in in such a game 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.439
 which was very intense 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.719
 ask our guest florian how are you 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.060
 you came to the fca what is going on here 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.590
 on the bed so the cards I have 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.940
 Got a present today with mine 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.129
 two sons for the first time here on 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.050
 Betzenberg and I have to say so now 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.000
 a madness 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.280
 Unfortunately, the result was not quite so 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.930
 optimal for the fck but overall 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.610
 It was a great trip and as 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.670
 football expert you have certainly synonymous 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.780
 the right analysis ready for the game 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.750
 yes i believe in the first half 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.750
 had the fck little pitch and in the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.640
 second half then you get the point 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.890
 properly earned right then earns 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.140
 to conclude, still apt analysis 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.520
 sebastian can also give up 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.320
 In any case, we have morals again 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.910
 proved after the goal 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.930
 You have to come back first 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.490
 and I think we'll be fine 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.020
 Pity that has more to do with it 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.610
 we have not only jumped out 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.010
 lost two points but two 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.480
 player also due to injury you know 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.380
 a little bit more how are you guys? 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.000
 you can talk to them 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.200
 alex ring I have just been 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.300
 he apparently has a say 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.040
 something on the inner band was so exactly 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.900
 now predicts nothing and 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.000
 Kerim is apparently in the hospital 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.920
 something on the ankle but more accurate knows 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.960
 I do not even have a room in that room 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.220
 repetition on television but so out 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.750
 as if it had a bad blow down there 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.310
 Of course we both press 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.470
 the thumb that they will soon be back 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.080
 But now it is called without them 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.300
 two creative minds in the next 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.170
 play or the next games now on 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.730
 tuesday pokalfight cup on the night 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.320
 betzenberg how much you rejoice 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.830
 on it and what can we for players 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.230
 waiting 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.730
 So I'm really looking forward to it 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.350
 a pity that with alex to 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.160
 kerim two very important players too 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.900
 fail for us 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.180
 but we just have to do that now 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.870
 take it as it comes and try that too 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.550
 compensate 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.660
 markus bald yes then again 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.330
 It will probably be on again 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.190
 the six act and we are happy 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.050
 I think it's all huge, of course 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.090
 something special everyone's hiding cup play 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.340
 Floodlight game and of course we want 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.440
 a round progress the betze rock 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.820
 the betze is young wild and rebellious 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.480
 you are also part of the new philosophy 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.640
 just 21 years old for two years 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.989
 now here at the betze active in front of it 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.160
 saarland which is not necessarily 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.170
 wrong is we have a few 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.680
 sizes from that but already at the fck 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.700
 experienced what is your way for the fc 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.230
 kaiserslautern what are you 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.060
 what do you imagine 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.150
 even with a view to a contract yet 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.860
 until 2017. I now have two runs yes 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.239
 years here at the amateurs played on 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.950
 Of course, that's not easy at the beginning 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.590
 from youth to men's area too 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.690
 but I changed everything 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.040
 given everything and now it's just with 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.750
 all come so far as the profi 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.560
 and that's just me 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.360
 very happy 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.520
 I just want everything for it now 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.110
 give and always on and on 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.270
 hope that I stay pretty 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.010
 many minutes of war and then in the 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.270
 of course, for the next two years 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.560
 want to attack and then maybe 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.060
 to become a musician and someday 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.270
 course with the fca ascend 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.000
 by florian because they ask this 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.500
 young wild ones too with the yes 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.120
 sports director markus schupp such a 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.460
 some were also summoned 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.370
 new player of philosophy boy 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.110
 players from their own squad 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.190
 zoom pull 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.890
 do you feel then also difference to the 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.960
 previous season yes so the identity 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.610
 I think it is much bigger at the club 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.170
 young players just when you leave the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.990
 own youth come and total 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.770
 I think that just fit that 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.450
 fck has this saying rebellious 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.640
 and combative so i would be mine 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.740
 happy if not several young players 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.660
 the fck also in the bundesliga be 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.280
 But we will all be here next year 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.200
 you have a question before florian 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.940
 maybe to the sebastian so I am 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.470
 now a bit overwhelmed knows too 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.810
 not really what I should ask 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.450
 but in view of Tuesday wishes 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.550
 Of course I give the team all the best 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:40.610
 well then again the word for the 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.050
 sebastian what do you think is in there like that 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.450
 the league that is really very very 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.710
 someday the tableau looks at who 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.970
 there are some teams that 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.870
 actually the jump upwards 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.180
 can create 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.200
 what makes the fck compared to the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.570
 other teams especially 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.280
 dangerous especially strong yes it is 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.530
 So I was able to sell properly 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.860
 no team and is a very close 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.570
 play all games and above 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.480
 Many teams here with 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.590
 play and tell we just have to 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.380
 Look that we are here on the betzenberg 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.000
 in on our fortress that we are there 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.600
 just stay and stay here as possible 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.240
 four points 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.980
 and yes, always one point 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.990
 take with you in any case and then 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.210
 we'll see how far it goes 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.800
 Yesterday on the nose gets angry 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.750
 at home 2 5 against the previous one 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.360
 Last frankfurt is an advantage 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.790
 or disadvantage for Tuesday what to expect 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.620
 you play for it, of course we have too 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.880
 What again do well but we have 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.350
 that as well we have the first game 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.320
 went lost 2 21 it was 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.300
 also very unhappy but i think 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.920
 both teams will also try 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.140
 it's going to be intense, too 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.180
 certainly a hot dance so you 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.680
 Yes, I personally wish you much 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.020
 success of the team of course straight 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.370
 on the Tuesday evening to get ahead 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.960
 that is for a club like that 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.270
 Fck always good under it 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.130
 to get ahead and florian you and 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.930
 your boys good home in the 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.970
 westerwald all the best and also for you
