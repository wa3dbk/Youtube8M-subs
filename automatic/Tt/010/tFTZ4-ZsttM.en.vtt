through my buttercream so to get your
darkest<00:00:47.550> color<00:00:47.910> you're<00:00:48.899> probably<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
darkest color you're probably going to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.430

have<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.039> add<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:51.090> than<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.329> toothpick<00:00:52.199> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
have to add more than one toothpick of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.029 
have to add more than one toothpick of
color<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:54.170> don't<00:00:55.170> feel<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.860> get

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
color so don't feel like you have to get

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.849 
color so don't feel like you have to get
it<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.850> shot<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.750> when<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.620> add

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it all in one shot and when you add

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.830 
it all in one shot and when you add
additional<00:00:59.640> icing<00:00:59.969> color<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.539> instance

additional icing color like for instance

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.439 
additional icing color like for instance
that<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.500> too<00:01:01.739> light<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:03.059> darkest

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.679 
that is just too light to be my darkest
color<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> add<00:01:05.040> more<00:01:05.369> icing<00:01:05.909> color<00:01:06.150> I'm
