00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.799
 I test today the duel Gata 510 Mio Pop we would be too much more it was from 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.389
 outside is inside look 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.369
 So first of all the name was 3-inch touchscreen and then it has it 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.759
 me only one button on the front so you have no button to call 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.359
 accept and hang up that's what makes the SAS market here so theirs here 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.059
 to change its works according to where you are currently menu or 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.990
 IMAP somebody is calling or not 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.200
 then official one side 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 the USB port 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 the grandma has the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.440
 Volume box 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.670
 and still redeem Hermann so that you can sing on them firmly 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 here you can see the depth of 3 megapixel camera 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 then to announce the above to have to accept a century tax 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.210
 and one side each we have the camera pomace 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 but this route also has another meaning 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.300
 so if I held my performances 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.420
 That's how I get my favorites and I can be here too 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.640
 in order to be able to keep working at work and out of the field 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.270
 communication 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.260
 entertainment 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.530
 equipment 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.110
 and settings percent 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.539
 McLaren needs my favorites 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.470
 Of course, adding to smoky can add 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.360
 however to hear 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 must be very practical 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.890
 now at charming but first cannes the state skyline 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 Well, you know that in a similar way, for example from Melchior Arena 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 beautiful 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.600
 but all this surface and these phones are different 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.069
 since I have time to time with the protection of minors 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.710
 if i get here and stickers i still get my bar 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.100
 and you can order around here 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.780
 simply certain things 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.860
 others can look like that 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.970
 Retract doors then disappear the sample should not 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.350
 disappear 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.360
 exactly here can scroll through the alley and may have different 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.549
 stuff 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:10.819
 go out 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.239
 Mertes be there to make it work I must know everyone knows steps to 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.169
 align so if I choose 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.519
 Schlittler then give percent if 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.519
 im always a box like that 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.339
 arranged to count on the hack go 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.539
 then learn 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.829
 I can not edit Erhard further 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.909
 it has to get on it 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.389
 and lorries look and it gets hold accordingly larger 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.869
 also here with sign 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.869
 So that's percent of the ACE Starz Queen 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:45.209
 There are changes here Likes cholera meet 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.110
 At Werner Ehlers you can give yourself a little 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.810
 but crime scenes lives 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.999
 you can get out of his contacts 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.309
 but to assign Tareq and then becomes 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.089
 to be informed at all and thus has his 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.749
 with her point of view about what his friends are doing 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.839
 just then you can also order here 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.979
 after the adjustment 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.119
 as to 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:16.069
 choose a picture to be deliberately reset or not 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.949
 the course and so on 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.579
 So that's the one I had was mainly a nice gimmick 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.859
 but also be very practical 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.439
 and then, last but not least, we have Kiel's percentage 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.379
 Site just to set up a fun 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.349
 I can do it well there 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.049
 People percent to 10 significantly exceeded if I want them 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:39.829
 so 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.700
 Percent are placed above and then if I click on it then I can 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:44.569
 just 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.569
 this particular one 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.599
 always human that you add contact book 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:55.439
 and anyone can call with he has quasi-click per cent 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.069
 or send an SMS 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.069
 dapd keylock is very fast here Rantzau otherwise I have the round 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.100
 still around 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.419
 Miller Kastner's families I can make a phone call 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.339
 make 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:10.019
 then learn 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.379
 I have someone address book 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.970
 Here I have news around 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.459
 what you news then 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.549
 and 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.800
 Here I come to the main menu and that's what you really just so 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.919
 Bad from Marinetti I can tell anyone 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.509
 Landscape view me and 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.240
 But then just have Keck ins percent that is a document to him 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.449
 so I see new ones in each row 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.029
 Clair is in the gate 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:40.669
 what's behind it 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.289
 see through the investigation file 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.479
 which especially so far as percent above all 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.479
 So now I'll go into the news 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.300
 and you would have written a message 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.840
 We see PAP fair here 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.680
 get in the normal hit wave towards the keyboard 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.050
 Here I can with a click click t9 on and off 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:05.979
 basically just around 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.469
 on release 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.649
 I also get from the Cops Green to a Thief ActionScript way 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:13.979
 how strong that is not set 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.789
 I can also give myself a wife and around as the collars even more than at 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:18.900
 every time 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.900
 Touching around that there is not a 20-meter renunciation of the throne as well 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.129
 Percent in turn wants to see the Viennese 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.119
 something of course also works is that the neck we hold and then 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:34.119
 I have a virtual qwerty keyboard here 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.500
 if I go over it on top you can also use the input method here 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.500
 Keypad handwriting manuscripts would be field 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.460
 Children's gymnastics Cranes Add a phrase Copy Paste Design 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.460
 to save 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.460
 and font size 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.029
 and I have to say that's just how Hayek is actually doing quite well 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:08.459
 It is of course in the fall that you always have to remember that you had 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:09.400
 him 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.430
 Percent to 9-4 degrees otherwise the Blackhawks around it is only off if 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.169
 Getting him right mobile software was steep then a bit 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.650
 can feel where you are on the keyboard percent and that 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.439
 Of course it also makes typing easier 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:27.219
 who will get used to cancer a Screencast more 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.039
 will come along well with it 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.370
 and I think that is good with this phone already good because you just the 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:34.159
 2 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.789
 yes and display options so has a larger buttons 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.530
 Companies with t9 and all the smaller cash registers in landscape mode 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:44.650
 Businessman as qwerty keyboard 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.270
 "All this is possible with the mobile phone 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.389
 quite good
