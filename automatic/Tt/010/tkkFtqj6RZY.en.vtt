00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
or the apartment looking out through the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.479 
or the apartment looking out through the
sliding<00:00:36.239> glass<00:00:36.630> door<00:00:37.070> all<00:00:38.070> you're<00:00:38.309> really

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
sliding glass door all you're really

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.190 
sliding glass door all you're really
looking<00:00:38.579> at<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> wall<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.719> can't<00:00:39.960> really

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
looking at is a wall you can't really

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380 
looking at is a wall you can't really
see<00:00:40.530> any<00:00:40.829> further<00:00:41.129> than<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.760> can't<00:00:42.180> see

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
see any further than that you can't see

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
see any further than that you can't see
a<00:00:42.420> view<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.079> any<00:00:43.200> description<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:46.140> is

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
a view of any description and this is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.119 
a view of any description and this is
fairly<00:00:46.950> typical<00:00:47.930> partly<00:00:48.930> because<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:50.100> don't

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
fairly typical partly because they don't

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.279 
fairly typical partly because they don't
want<00:00:50.520> other<00:00:50.700> people<00:00:50.789> looking<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.110> there's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
want other people looking in so there's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
want other people looking in so there's
a<00:00:52.350> good<00:00:52.500> example<00:00:52.590> there<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.180> solid

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
a good example there so it's a solid

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.260 
a good example there so it's a solid
wall<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.500> people<00:00:55.860> can't<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
wall so that people can't see in the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.779 
wall so that people can't see in the
sliding<00:00:57.719> doors<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.789> also<00:01:00.059> because

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
sliding doors there and also because

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.240 
sliding doors there and also because
people<00:01:02.789> don't<00:01:03.719> usually<00:01:04.110> lounge<00:01:05.040> around

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
people don't usually lounge around

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
people don't usually lounge around
outside<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.780> Japan<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.670> sit<00:01:08.880> around<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
outside in Japan so just sit around on a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.080 
outside in Japan so just sit around on a
balcony<00:01:09.540> reading<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> newspaper<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> scene

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
balcony reading the newspaper is a scene

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
balcony reading the newspaper is a scene
that<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.600> unlikely<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.229> would<00:01:13.350> ever<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that it's unlikely you would ever see in

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.800 
that it's unlikely you would ever see in
Japan<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.450> something<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
Japan it's just not something that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.289 
Japan it's just not something that
people<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.729> only<00:01:17.939> thing<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
people do the only thing that the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.179 
people do the only thing that the
balcony<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.720> usually<00:01:19.110> used<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.799> hanging

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
balcony is usually used for is hanging

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.690 
balcony is usually used for is hanging
out<00:01:20.280> washing<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.920> actually<00:01:23.280> not

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
out washing so this is actually not

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.249 
out washing so this is actually not
really<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.000> balcony<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> old<00:01:25.020> style

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
really a balcony this is the old style

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.160 
really a balcony this is the old style
building<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> that's<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.790> railing<00:01:27.689> that's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
building and that's a railing that's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719 
building and that's a railing that's
there<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> stop<00:01:28.680> people<00:01:28.890> falling<00:01:29.520> out<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
windows because the windows are actually

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.520 
windows because the windows are actually
