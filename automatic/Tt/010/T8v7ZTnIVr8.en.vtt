00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.440
 privacy settings for photos 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.030
 that you want to delete but 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.430
 only the view of some people 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.580
 on my facebook profile in my feed 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.850
 of actuality I will be able to modify or 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.680
 delete a particular publication 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.449

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.690
 My journal 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.460
 or then definitely delete it a 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.670
