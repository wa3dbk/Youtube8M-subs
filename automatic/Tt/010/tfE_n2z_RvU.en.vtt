00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.689
 very much how would you look for this memory 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.479

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.070
 quietly walk them more precisely their just 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.750
 don't walk let them go they run and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.869
 very comfortable place to live 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.990

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.590
 azerote 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.560

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.600
 you are known by jaime to research azerot 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.259
 what journey for full guard 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.460
 more archive 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.409
 the fact is that I was very many 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.049
 places for example i really like grants 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.079
 from there I brought this beautiful 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.540
 there were other interesting foreheads 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.460
 places eg brief balloons or a poster 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.880
 Lorana but of course most of all I 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.159
 love 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.079
 places where I can bring outlandish 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.860
 animals like this 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.540
 Experiment 12 for I got practically 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.590
 and save ultra xeon and it was 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.689
 funny enough which cafe and which ones 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.299
 lighting it has rides 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.070
 I have a large number of animals 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.290
 I collect them but I certainly am any 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.569
 big guys first of all for example 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.720
 here is this mammoth or looks like 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.270
 very chopper or lord of the ravens common 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.340
 Mounts beautiful much really 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.319
 fascinating to collect I cite with 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.480
 different parts of the world put my worth 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.650
 Gilneas and honestly there not soon 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.300
 there will be no place at all 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.510
 and many screw trolls truehd and shamans 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.580
 And the soldiers why their is hunter 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.160
 when I was a very small trawl 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.590
 fine my first toys were bow so 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.750
 It happened that many guys loved 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.660
 running around with swords at that time I was engaged 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.989
 so that he raised his dog and shot from 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.720
 Luke 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.900
 probably since childhood climb this love for 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.390
 arms and I decided to become a hunter and not 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.410
 someone else seemed to me that approach 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.470
 not like what i like and 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.810
 really so I do not regret freedom 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.670
 thanks for your answers as far as I know 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.370
 your bifini doesn't end 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.360
 research you are also 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.519
 brave fighter arena battlefield now 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.739
 not anymore but there were times when 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.010
 guys from my guild actively 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.000
 participated in the battle with the alliance and 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.670
 compete with the horde in arenas but 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.099
 now i'm too old for that yes and 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.989
 accuracy is no longer the same in general 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:26.129
 we are not going to do time we were once 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.739
 I would rather like a famous fighter 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.420
 find out more of yours or if i have them 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.730
 there were a few but probably the most important 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.849
 of them were guild vatniki to level 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.459
 we did a lot of interesting things in this world 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.159
 but mostly of course they fought with the alliance 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.680
 most different places and in different locations 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.230
 it was a very interesting experience but 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.480
 now it's already 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.610
 affairs of bygone days more than me 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.280
 you are interested 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.560
 which hook to catch carps in the pond 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.780
 near my house 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.620
 since you take or your military 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.480
 career what are you doing besides 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.739
 Lavrik Karpov I continue to travel 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.720
 around the world riding soap on dragons but 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.150
 to be honest I do it less often yet 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.829
 less sometimes i still do some 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.040
 visit interesting places and 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.539
 I try to talk about it 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.799
 representatives of the muzzle well, and the alliance is sometimes 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:24.500
 also sees their entries so it turns out and 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.440
 the last question for the program today 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.639
 to panda 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.840
 Oh 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.840

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.310
