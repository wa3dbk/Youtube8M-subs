00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.580
 for 1.7 point 2 but they have already been counted 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.259
 the version and good looking by 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.840
 mini craft eo and I'm quite time 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.000
 looking for it and I did not find it so I've 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.949
 had to search for several blogs and 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.900
 many other places so I os 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.510
 I would appreciate it very much if I could and if the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.010
 description the video or the corner of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.010
 facts that appears next to the video 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.800
 Well, here to subscribe to my channel 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.469
 because good is good for me and also not 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.559
 is that they star hernia but since 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.750
 you liked it and such and it has been served 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.390
 well help me help me keep doing 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.290
 more things 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.510
 all right 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.080
 of course we have to download the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.850
 wing draft that I created does nothing of the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 created me so for that my own 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 you see here I have this is the windows 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.360
 when we will open the wing that lays 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.580
 a download link in the description and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.650
 sounds 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.020
 they appear up to their files on 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.850
 code is chicken core and I do not have a 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.110
 hit ems is pretty always what there is 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.780
 what to do with this we go to our 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.270
 minecraft beta folder percent 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.350
 we will enter a folder of mods there 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.110
 have him 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.430
 jorge 1.7 points installed leave the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.680
 inning in the description for people 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.720
 that does not know how to install it, let's 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.509
 stop and now I have the saler but not 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.990
 influences for nothing so I take and I put 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.810
 these files this would already be for a 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.659
 side now let's continue 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.119
 with the part that would be the gameplay like that 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 that we see shortly because everything 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.500
 cut because with this recorder I do not 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.090
 let's graduate to the bar or record the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.060
 minecraft goodbye 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.250
 we are back as you can see now 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.989
 it does not look like the forge five modes 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.310
 praiseworthy five most active 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.930
 now it looks like the possible four 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.360
 monster to ten and five four modes 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.550
 assets because I have as I said before 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.570
 I have him 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.570
 the one that I have 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.200
 that sensitivity I have the knowledge 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.560
 vocento is the same it seems to me like one more 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.870
 I'm not too sure I never tried for 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.209
 who wants to have that d'elx I'll tell you 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.530
 I can teach in a quiet video that 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.530
 I have one I already have one 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.990
 in a player for my rural house 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.490
 my rural house 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.560
 and we're going to see that he had action 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.560
 lately it made much later 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.570
 so good my little house 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.420
 and now is the moment of truth 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.730
 the name works or does not work well 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.240
 first I will go to my house as 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.240
 I said before 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.439
 Where is 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.670
 of years that we move 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.670
 in this site 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.490
 and me who is out there 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.610
 one turn 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.770
 hello this kind of here is 500 thousand 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.140
 horses and then those that I would all with 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.590
 Lava I am very sadistic and could survive 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.819
 with some 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.909
 and then there is 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.010
 there it is there it is beautiful and in my case 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.590
 is beautiful 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.930
 well I've realized things are 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.510
 much more beautiful like the ones to the s 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.380
 you have to see it in the margin that it will return 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.090
 now 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.260
 where are you going to see a pretty macaw like 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.909
 what you have here 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.909
 this is pure and crystal clear water 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:14.880
 ok it works or it does not work 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.400
 ask for me what 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.380
 has worked because if we go to the side 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.440
 today we are going to survival we will appear 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.860
 everything that very simple law I have 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.719
 all 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.039
 these are the seven pages that have 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:30.569
 to come predefined from minecraft to 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.370
 1.7 point 4 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.800
 but not 1.7 point of esperÃ³n 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.569
 but possibly if you put some way 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.020
 many more were raised 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.300
 a few altar 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.259
 I 'm going to check, I'll tell you what's 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.009
 working because I'm catching 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.009
 things from here 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.490
 now 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.510
 they do not weigh 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.080
 how strange they are 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.520
 I do not have to put 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.000
 I do not know how the accounts are made 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.940
 Some 50 fraternities 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.840
 well that tells us how to make a truth 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.840
 the judges 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.009
 I can say is that it is 1.7 points could 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.130
 go to the new fish so it's 1.7 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.130
 points 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.550
 and that of which there is not much that has 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.890
 taught by here 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.980
 the graf all have taught us everything 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.960
 we're on the air do not forget the 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.310
 stairs everything practically teaches 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.470
 all the characters that there are of the 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.140
 blocks that can be grown there are blocks 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.770
 for example as spammers that do not 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.940
 can cross the stone mosses to 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.920
 obsidian that is not left 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.980
 it is impossible you are chats and fire 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.090
 neither can you grow 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.090
 you need to catch it 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.510
 we want all 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.350
 and how many gorditas 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.660
 well this is all for today I hope 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.710

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.710
 fucking books 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.590
 let's see at the time what 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.750
 that's because it can be badly made of this 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.630
 there is now yes 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:31.000
