this Tom after this Tom I just move over
here<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.980> exactly<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.610> same<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
here it's exactly the same the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.930 
here it's exactly the same the
circumference<00:02:26.270> where<00:02:27.270> I'm<00:02:27.390> playing<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.820> know

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
circumference where I'm playing you know

circumference where I'm playing you know
the<00:02:30.209> ride<00:02:30.390> cymbal<00:02:30.780> sounds<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> same<00:02:31.290> here<00:02:31.680> as

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
the ride cymbal sounds the same here as

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.310 
the ride cymbal sounds the same here as
it<00:02:32.310> does<00:02:32.580> right<00:02:32.610> there<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.660> I'll<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:33.959> go<00:02:34.140> like

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
it does right there so I'll just go like

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:46.970 
it does right there so I'll just go like
this<00:02:43.459> okay<00:02:44.489> again<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.989> hi-hat<00:02:46.470> does<00:02:46.800> not

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
this okay again this hi-hat does not

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.759 
this okay again this hi-hat does not
overlap<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.580> ride<00:02:48.060> cymbal<00:02:48.540> more<00:02:48.810> than<00:02:49.140> where

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
overlap the ride cymbal more than where

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.670 
overlap the ride cymbal more than where
I<00:02:49.800> need<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.280> play<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.989> there's<00:02:55.200> nothing<00:02:55.560> in

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
I need to play it so there's nothing in

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.270 
I need to play it so there's nothing in
my<00:02:55.830> way

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
my way

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.259 
my way
but<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.760> high<00:02:56.970> hats<00:02:57.209> they're<00:02:57.630> just<00:02:58.200> like<00:02:58.350> this

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
but the high hats they're just like this

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.110 
but the high hats they're just like this
this<00:03:00.269> China<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.440> overlapping<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.550> hi-hat<00:03:02.850> but

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
this China is overlapping the hi-hat but

20 piece kit so my rules are comfort
first<00:06:48.100> musicality<00:06:49.100> a<00:06:49.340> close<00:06:49.910> second<00:06:50.480> but

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
first musicality a close second but

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.660 
first musicality a close second but
without<00:06:51.350> comfort<00:06:51.680> it's<00:06:52.100> hard<00:06:52.340> to<00:06:52.460> play

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
without comfort it's hard to play

without comfort it's hard to play
musically<00:06:53.240> and<00:06:53.860> third<00:06:55.300> don't<00:06:56.300> compromise

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
musically and third don't compromise

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
extra piece if you get another symbol

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.410 
extra piece if you get another symbol
then<00:07:06.650> find<00:07:07.070> a<00:07:07.220> good<00:07:07.400> place<00:07:07.670> for<00:07:07.940> it<00:07:08.000> and<00:07:08.120> if<00:07:08.300> you

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.000 
have to move a couple of other things
around<00:07:10.310> then<00:07:11.030> do<00:07:11.360> that<00:07:11.570> but<00:07:12.350> don't<00:07:12.500> just<00:07:12.710> shove

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
around then do that but don't just shove

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.310 
around then do that but don't just shove
it<00:07:13.160> where<00:07:13.340> it'll<00:07:13.820> look<00:07:13.970> cool<00:07:14.210> here<00:07:14.570> and<00:07:14.720> then

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320 
it where it'll look cool here and then

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.990 
it where it'll look cool here and then
you<00:07:15.470> find<00:07:15.740> out<00:07:15.950> you<00:07:16.010> can't<00:07:16.340> hit<00:07:16.460> this<00:07:16.670> splash

you add pieces to your kit and don't

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.530 
you add pieces to your kit and don't
sacrifice<00:07:30.580> musicality<00:07:31.580> or<00:07:32.060> comfort<00:07:33.100> for

looking cool being cool being flashy

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.580

adding<00:07:40.790> more<00:07:41.060> and<00:07:41.180> more<00:07:41.390> crap<00:07:41.660> to<00:07:41.870> your<00:07:41.990> kit<00:07:42.230> to

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:42.590 
adding more and more crap to your kit to

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.200 
adding more and more crap to your kit to
say<00:07:42.830> hey<00:07:43.010> I'm<00:07:43.190> rich<00:07:43.840> you<00:07:44.840> know<00:07:44.960> whatever

say hey I'm rich you know whatever
so<00:07:47.990> those<00:07:48.199> are<00:07:48.350> basically<00:07:49.039> my<00:07:49.539> ideas<00:07:50.539> on<00:07:50.810> how

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 
so those are basically my ideas on how

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.950 
so those are basically my ideas on how
to<00:07:50.990> organize<00:07:51.139> a<00:07:51.560> kit<00:07:51.860> and<00:07:51.979> I<00:07:52.340> hope<00:07:52.780> that<00:07:53.780> that

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960
