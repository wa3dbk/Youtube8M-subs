happy are you with your performances so

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.990 
happy are you with your performances so
far<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:15.139> think<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.949> expected<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.430> pass<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.850> from

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
far I think we expected to pass on from

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.620 
far I think we expected to pass on from
the<00:00:18.150> group<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.900> did<00:00:19.080> but<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:20.330> think<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.449> can

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the group as we did but I think we can

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.140 
the group as we did but I think we can
expect<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.289> beat<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.769> old<00:00:23.160> virus<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:23.789> well

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
expect you to beat the old virus as well

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.250 
expect you to beat the old virus as well
I<00:00:24.560> wouldn't<00:00:25.560> say<00:00:25.680> expected<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.750> we<00:00:27.750> could<00:00:27.990> lose

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I wouldn't say expected I we could lose

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.370 
I wouldn't say expected I we could lose
but<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.160> think<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:30.420> percent<00:00:30.900> for

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
but I think we have more percent for

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.600 
but I think we have more percent for
sentence<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.550> chance<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.180> winning

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
sentence in the like chance and winning

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.330 
sentence in the like chance and winning
but<00:00:35.809> they<00:00:36.809> got<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.170> broodmother<00:00:37.739> saw<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
but they got that broodmother saw the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.260 
but they got that broodmother saw the
game<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.760> guess<00:00:39.000> yeah<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.230> really<00:00:41.270> destroyed

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
