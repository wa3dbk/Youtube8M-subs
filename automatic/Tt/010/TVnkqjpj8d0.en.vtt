Brady oh let's see tell you I wasn't
feeling<00:00:09.179> really<00:00:09.570> good<00:00:09.809> for<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> while<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.590> he

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
feeling really good for a while so he

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.250 
feeling really good for a while so he
wasn't<00:00:11.099> getting<00:00:11.490> too<00:00:11.849> much<00:00:12.030> done<00:00:14.809> but<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
wasn't getting too much done but the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.230 
wasn't getting too much done but the
exciting<00:00:17.039> thing<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.930> we<00:00:18.930> got<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.500> three<00:00:20.240> tapes

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
exciting thing is we got the three tapes

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.269 
exciting thing is we got the three tapes
from<00:00:21.689> Arnold<00:00:22.230> drummer<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.890> watched<00:00:23.820> them<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
from Arnold drummer and watched them and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.189 
from Arnold drummer and watched them and
thought<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.789> were<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.449> silly<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.170> not

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
thought we were really silly for not

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.679 
thought we were really silly for not
having<00:00:28.890> purchased<00:00:29.400> them<00:00:29.849> when<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
having purchased them when we got the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.160 
having purchased them when we got the
paper<00:00:31.080> bill<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:33.180> has<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.809> lot<00:00:34.140> of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
paper bill because it just has a lot of

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.250 
paper bill because it just has a lot of
these<00:00:34.649> ideas<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> techniques<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
these ideas and techniques and and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.280 
these ideas and techniques and and
everything<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:39.230> when<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.350> were<00:00:40.500> watching<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
everything and when we were watching it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
everything and when we were watching it
he'd<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.530> earrings<00:00:44.040> them<00:00:44.280> dry<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> lot<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.120> time

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
he'd I earrings them dry a lot of time

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.750 
he'd I earrings them dry a lot of time
but<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> does<00:00:45.989> take<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> long<00:00:46.649> time<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.399> iron

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
but it does take a long time to iron

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.139 
but it does take a long time to iron
them<00:00:48.000> dry<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.690> guess<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.399> extreme<00:00:50.399> curling

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
them dry and I guess the extreme curling

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.779 
them dry and I guess the extreme curling
and<00:00:51.329> flipping<00:00:51.780> back<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.110> forth<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.860> normal

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and flipping back and forth is normal

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.990 
and flipping back and forth is normal
because<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.270> got<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.870> him<00:00:55.050> doing<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:59.000> we

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
because I got to see him doing that we

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
because I got to see him doing that we
decided<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:01.280> we're<00:01:02.280> moving<00:01:03.530> are<00:01:04.530> removed

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
decided that we're moving are removed

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.170 
decided that we're moving are removed
all<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> paper<00:01:06.650> making<00:01:07.650> supplies<00:01:08.310> over<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
all the paper making supplies over to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.109 
all the paper making supplies over to
leah's<00:01:09.540> house<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.830> their<00:01:11.189> place<00:01:11.760> they

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
leah's house because at their place they

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.649 
leah's house because at their place they
have<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:13.080> more<00:01:13.260> room<00:01:14.869> than<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:17.659> in

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
have a lot more room than I do here in

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.780 
have a lot more room than I do here in
the<00:01:18.810> Arnold<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.409> know<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.799> can't<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the Arnold you know I can't do this and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.450 
the Arnold you know I can't do this and
think<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.390> same<00:01:21.540> time<00:01:23.210> in<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:25.020> tapes<00:01:25.460> he

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
think at the same time in the tapes he

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.910 
think at the same time in the tapes he
just<00:01:26.850> has<00:01:27.180> things<00:01:27.509> set<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.200> table<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
just has things set out on a table and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
just has things set out on a table and
has<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.509> pan<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
has the you know pan there with the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
has the you know pan there with the
water<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> he<00:01:32.340> has<00:01:32.460> much<00:01:32.759> more<00:01:32.790> room<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.750> do

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
water and he has much more room to do

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.890 
water and he has much more room to do
the<00:01:34.200> different<00:01:34.380> techniques<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.159> stuff<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.900> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the different techniques and stuff and I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.130 
the different techniques and stuff and I
just<00:01:37.140> I'm<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.369> far<00:01:38.610> away<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.420> sink<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
just I'm so far away from a sink and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.280 
just I'm so far away from a sink and
stuff<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.210> can't<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:42.869> carry<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
stuff here and I can't really carry the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.100 
stuff here and I can't really carry the
buckets<00:01:43.829> around<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.700> my<00:01:44.790> bad<00:01:44.970> arm<00:01:45.119> so

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
buckets around because of my bad arm so

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
buckets around because of my bad arm so
anyway<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:47.520> decided<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.149> move<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.649> all<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
anyway we decided to move on all of it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.490 
anyway we decided to move on all of it
boxes<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.770> dead<00:01:52.770> plants<00:01:53.130> drug<00:01:53.640> plants<00:01:54.200> all<00:01:55.200> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
boxes of dead plants drug plants all of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.289 
boxes of dead plants drug plants all of
our<00:01:55.710> additives<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:57.360> our<00:01:57.630> scratch<00:01:58.140> paper<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
our additives all our scratch paper and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.590 
our additives all our scratch paper and
just<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.750> paraphernalia<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> was

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
just all the paraphernalia so it was

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.959 
just all the paraphernalia so it was
like<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:04.140> six<00:02:04.560> boxes<00:02:04.860> worth<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> stuff<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
like about six boxes worth the stuff I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.590 
like about six boxes worth the stuff I
think<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.780> moved<00:02:07.020> over<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.500> leah's

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
think that we moved over to leah's

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.210 
think that we moved over to leah's
and<00:02:11.570> we<00:02:12.570> decided<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.230> we're<00:02:13.770> going<00:02:14.100> to

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and we decided that we're going to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.290 
and we decided that we're going to
basically<00:02:15.090> start<00:02:15.510> over<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.170> our<00:02:16.500> red<00:02:16.740> paper

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
basically start over on our red paper

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.340 
basically start over on our red paper
because<00:02:18.470> what<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:20.220> figured<00:02:20.610> out<00:02:20.790> um<00:02:21.350> that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
because what we figured out um that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
because what we figured out um that
works<00:02:23.510> really<00:02:24.510> well<00:02:24.720> we<00:02:25.590> found<00:02:25.800> out<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.340> of

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
works really well we found out kind of

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.910 
works really well we found out kind of
by<00:02:26.550> accident<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:29.600> we<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.380> way<00:02:31.560> we

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
by accident is we just do it the way we

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.250 
by accident is we just do it the way we
were<00:02:32.070> doing<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.520> we<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:32.670> take<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.600> paper<00:02:33.870> and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
were doing it we just take the paper and

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.020 
were doing it we just take the paper and
lay<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.130> out<00:02:36.290> just<00:02:37.290> naked<00:02:37.620> lay<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.730> out<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
lay it out just naked lay it out on the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.970 
lay it out just naked lay it out on the
table<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.630> let<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.870> dry<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.380> let<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.560> buckle

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
table and let it dry and let it buckle

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.490 
table and let it dry and let it buckle
but<00:02:41.880> then<00:02:42.120> what<00:02:42.360> we<00:02:42.510> discovered<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.050> worked

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
but then what we discovered that worked

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.080 
but then what we discovered that worked
better<00:02:43.800> than<00:02:44.360> book<00:02:45.360> pressing<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.080> was<00:02:46.800> then<00:02:47.580> I

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
better than book pressing it was then I

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.880 
better than book pressing it was then I
are<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> dry<00:02:49.350> paper<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.910> actually

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
are in the dry paper and it actually

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.080 
are in the dry paper and it actually
flattened<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.070> out<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.490> guess<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:53.970> never

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
flattened it out I guess we never

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.820 
flattened it out I guess we never
thought<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.660> drying<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.200> totally<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.800> know

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
thought of drying it totally you know

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.620 
thought of drying it totally you know
ironing<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.760> totally<00:02:57.210> dry<00:02:57.740> but<00:02:58.740> that<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.270> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
ironing it totally dry but that that is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.890 
ironing it totally dry but that that is
really<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.950> way<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.340> golf<00:03:02.700> for<00:03:03.420> us<00:03:03.480> because

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
really the way to golf for us because

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.660 
really the way to golf for us because
we're<00:03:04.230> mass-producing<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.250> mean<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.520> you're

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
we're mass-producing I mean if you're

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.210 
we're mass-producing I mean if you're
only<00:03:05.820> making<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.240> couple<00:03:06.600> papers<00:03:06.780> yeah<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.160> I'm

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
only making a couple papers yeah and I'm

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.720 
only making a couple papers yeah and I'm
dry<00:03:08.460> but<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:10.200> doesn't<00:03:10.620> doesn't<00:03:11.190> work<00:03:11.490> too

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
dry but that doesn't doesn't work too

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.590 
dry but that doesn't doesn't work too
well<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.210> these<00:03:13.200> were<00:03:14.160> made<00:03:16.610> I'm<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.850> had<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.480> do

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
the video so that was really worth the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.740 
the video so that was really worth the
money<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:43.220> this<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:45.030> know<00:04:45.060> before<00:04:45.720> you

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
money and this is you know before you

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.650 
money and this is you know before you
lift<00:04:46.140> it<00:04:46.350> up<00:04:46.500> your<00:04:47.250> got<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.670> halfway<00:04:47.910> up<00:04:48.300> and

lift it up your got it halfway up and

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.590 
lift it up your got it halfway up and
then<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.610> pop<00:04:50.610> them<00:04:50.790> in<00:04:51.000> there<00:04:51.180> but<00:04:51.330> i<00:04:51.360> got

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
then you pop them in there but i got

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.300 
then you pop them in there but i got
them<00:04:51.780> in<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:51.960> little<00:04:52.140> too<00:04:52.380> far<00:04:52.590> they<00:04:52.770> got<00:04:52.920> really

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
them in a little too far they got really

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.370 
them in a little too far they got really
covered<00:04:53.670> but<00:04:54.330> i<00:04:54.360> mean<00:04:54.900> these<00:04:55.050> are<00:04:55.230> just

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
covered but i mean these are just

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.030 
covered but i mean these are just
experiments<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:58.050> ones<00:04:58.260> i'm<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.830> last

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
experiments and the ones i'm the last

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.860 
experiments and the ones i'm the last
ones<00:04:59.370> here<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.730> i'm<00:04:59.820> cutting<00:05:00.210> up<00:05:00.360> mariner

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
ones here that i'm cutting up mariner

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.650 
ones here that i'm cutting up mariner
cutting<00:05:01.560> up<00:05:01.680> poking<00:05:02.100> holes<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.430> these<00:05:03.330> were

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
cutting up poking holes in these were

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.410 
cutting up poking holes in these were
the<00:05:03.840> ones<00:05:04.050> i've<00:05:04.830> got<00:05:05.040> about<00:05:05.160> six<00:05:05.610> six<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.300> them

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
the ones i've got about six six of them

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.800 
the ones i've got about six six of them
i<00:05:06.570> think<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:07.460> were<00:05:08.460> made<00:05:09.120> from<00:05:09.660> all<00:05:10.380> that

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
i think that were made from all that

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.420 
i think that were made from all that
ends<00:05:12.810> of<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.110> twelve<00:05:13.350> by<00:05:13.500> twelve<00:05:13.530> paper<00:05:14.070> that

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
ends of the twelve by twelve paper that

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.550 
ends of the twelve by twelve paper that
i<00:05:14.460> saved<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:15.210> i<00:05:15.390> ended<00:05:15.600> up<00:05:15.720> with<00:05:15.900> 12<00:05:16.170> sheets<00:05:16.440> of

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
i saved and i ended up with 12 sheets of

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.820 
i saved and i ended up with 12 sheets of
paper<00:05:16.710> out<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.190> that<00:05:17.610> so<00:05:18.600> that<00:05:19.170> worked<00:05:19.740> out

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
paper out of that so that worked out

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.190 
paper out of that so that worked out
pretty<00:05:19.890> well<00:05:20.160> so<00:05:20.790> this<00:05:20.940> is<00:05:21.150> this<00:05:21.480> is<00:05:21.690> what<00:05:21.900> they

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
pretty well so this is this is what they

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.710 
pretty well so this is this is what they
look<00:05:22.380> like<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:25.580> i<00:05:26.580> don't<00:05:26.790> know<00:05:26.850> i<00:05:26.970> made<00:05:27.210> a<00:05:27.450> lot

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
look like and i don't know i made a lot

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.600 
look like and i don't know i made a lot
to<00:05:27.870> do<00:05:28.020> something<00:05:28.440> to<00:05:28.590> jazz<00:05:28.800> him<00:05:29.040> up<00:05:29.160> put

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
to do something to jazz him up put

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.100 
to do something to jazz him up put
something<00:05:29.910> on<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.030> front<00:05:30.330> or<00:05:30.480> something<00:05:30.870> but

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
something on the front or something but

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.200 
something on the front or something but
anyway<00:05:34.110> so<00:05:34.530> that's<00:05:34.680> kind<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.310> what's<00:05:35.970> been

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
anyway so that's kind of what's been

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.720 
anyway so that's kind of what's been
going<00:05:36.600> on<00:05:36.720> around<00:05:36.930> here<00:05:37.410> well<00:05:38.010> I<00:05:38.040> took<00:05:38.190> some

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
going on around here well I took some

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.480 
going on around here well I took some
just<00:05:39.480> felt<00:05:40.050> you<00:05:40.290> that<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.710> buy<00:05:40.830> by<00:05:41.040> the<00:05:41.070> yard

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
just felt you that you buy by the yard

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.380 
just felt you that you buy by the yard
at<00:05:42.420> the<00:05:42.750> fabric<00:05:42.990> store<00:05:43.170> and<00:05:43.560> we<00:05:44.520> folded<00:05:45.060> felt

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
at the fabric store and we folded felt

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.840 
at the fabric store and we folded felt
up<00:05:45.660> and<00:05:45.870> put<00:05:46.080> it<00:05:46.110> underneath<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:47.490> cheap

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
up and put it underneath that cheap

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.020 
up and put it underneath that cheap
ironing<00:05:48.270> board<00:05:48.510> and<00:05:48.890> now<00:05:49.890> you<00:05:50.400> don't<00:05:50.550> get<00:05:50.790> any

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
ironing board and now you don't get any

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.420 
ironing board and now you don't get any
little<00:05:51.900> hole<00:05:52.080> marks<00:05:52.500> or<00:05:52.680> anything<00:05:52.710> underneath

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
little hole marks or anything underneath

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:00.590 
little hole marks or anything underneath
there<00:05:55.700> now<00:05:56.700> let's<00:05:57.150> see<00:05:57.420> I<00:05:58.670> think<00:05:59.670> that's<00:06:00.150> about

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
there now let's see I think that's about

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:10.070 
there now let's see I think that's about
it<00:06:03.170> and<00:06:04.170> now<00:06:04.830> this<00:06:05.430> is<00:06:05.640> just<00:06:05.670> join<00:06:06.210> I<00:06:08.150> have<00:06:09.150> this

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
it and now this is just join I have this

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.830 
it and now this is just join I have this
as<00:06:10.440> a<00:06:10.850> template<00:06:11.850> I'm<00:06:12.090> doing<00:06:12.360> it<00:06:12.480> a<00:06:12.510> little<00:06:12.630> bit

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
as a template I'm doing it a little bit

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.450 
as a template I'm doing it a little bit
different<00:06:13.230> because<00:06:13.320> before<00:06:13.470> i<00:06:13.920> had<00:06:14.250> like

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
different because before i had like

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.330 
different because before i had like
choices<00:06:14.700> many<00:06:15.120> holes<00:06:15.390> and<00:06:15.660> I<00:06:16.320> was<00:06:16.500> just<00:06:16.950> trying

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
choices many holes and I was just trying

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:25.850 
choices many holes and I was just trying
it<00:06:17.520> with<00:06:17.670> less<00:06:17.970> holes

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.030 

and<00:06:26.860> try<00:06:27.310> to<00:06:27.370> get<00:06:27.790> it<00:06:27.970> along<00:06:28.240> max<00:06:28.900> edge<00:06:29.260> that's

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
and try to get it along max edge that's

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.970 
and try to get it along max edge that's
pretty<00:06:30.280> good<00:06:31.860> and<00:06:32.860> then<00:06:33.160> you<00:06:33.970> just<00:06:34.800> got<00:06:35.800> the

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
pretty good and then you just got the

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.000 
pretty good and then you just got the
last<00:06:36.190> two<00:06:36.810> and<00:06:37.810> then<00:06:37.960> I<00:06:38.200> just<00:06:38.260> saw<00:06:38.740> them

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
last two and then I just saw them

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.470 
last two and then I just saw them
together<00:06:39.130> I've<00:06:39.550> been<00:06:39.730> just<00:06:39.970> sewing<00:06:40.360> them

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
together I've been just sewing them

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.360 
together I've been just sewing them
together<00:06:40.630> with<00:06:41.080> embroidery<00:06:41.650> thread<00:06:42.480> and<00:06:44.370> then

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
together with embroidery thread and then

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.510 
together with embroidery thread and then
just<00:06:46.120> tying<00:06:46.420> a<00:06:46.660> knot<00:06:46.900> or<00:06:46.960> a<00:06:47.410> bowl<00:06:47.740> this<00:06:48.160> is<00:06:48.340> the

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
just tying a knot or a bowl this is the

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.980 
just tying a knot or a bowl this is the
simplest<00:06:49.320> fastest<00:06:50.320> way<00:06:50.560> if<00:06:51.460> i<00:06:51.760> use<00:06:52.090> a<00:06:52.120> yarn

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
simplest fastest way if i use a yarn

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.500 
simplest fastest way if i use a yarn
which<00:06:53.440> is<00:06:53.980> bigger<00:06:54.640> and<00:06:54.970> you<00:06:55.060> need<00:06:55.210> a<00:06:55.240> bigger

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
which is bigger and you need a bigger

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.720 
which is bigger and you need a bigger
hole<00:06:55.810> that's<00:06:56.500> what<00:06:56.710> i<00:06:56.740> like<00:06:56.830> about<00:06:57.010> this<00:06:57.490> you

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
hole that's what i like about this you

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.470 
hole that's what i like about this you
can<00:06:57.940> lose<00:06:58.510> money<00:06:58.900> mo<00:06:59.140> tools<00:06:59.380> but<00:07:00.040> the<00:07:00.640> opinion

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
can lose money mo tools but the opinion

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.000 
can lose money mo tools but the opinion
on<00:07:01.540> the<00:07:01.660> size<00:07:01.840> hole<00:07:02.140> you<00:07:02.320> want<00:07:02.560> you<00:07:02.830> know<00:07:02.920> I've

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.010 
on the size hole you want you know I've

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.250 
on the size hole you want you know I've
got<00:07:03.250> a<00:07:03.700> bunch<00:07:04.060> of<00:07:04.240> ends<00:07:04.600> that<00:07:04.750> I<00:07:04.840> can<00:07:05.080> use<00:07:05.110> a

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
got a bunch of ends that I can use a

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.360 
got a bunch of ends that I can use a
bigger<00:07:05.530> hole<00:07:05.800> if<00:07:05.950> I'm<00:07:06.160> using<00:07:06.340> yarn<00:07:07.800> anyway<00:07:08.800> and

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
bigger hole if I'm using yarn anyway and

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.920 
bigger hole if I'm using yarn anyway and
I've<00:07:09.490> showed<00:07:09.520> you<00:07:09.820> some<00:07:10.270> of<00:07:10.300> that<00:07:10.420> before

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
I've showed you some of that before

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.200 
I've showed you some of that before
anyway<00:07:11.410> but<00:07:12.220> i<00:07:12.250> thought<00:07:12.490> i<00:07:12.550> would<00:07:12.670> let<00:07:13.000> you

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210

anyway but i thought i would let you
know<00:07:13.240> what's<00:07:13.630> happening<00:07:14.880> what<00:07:15.880> have<00:07:16.000> been<00:07:16.120> up

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
know what's happening what have been up
