 "Preventing diabetes by eating more" 

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:11.337
 Studies like this show that for those who eat the most legumes, 

00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:13.816
 there seems to be only a fraction of the risk 

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:17.698
 the emergence of that form of pre-diabetic known as metabolic syndrome. 

00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:20.228
 For those who ate three or more portions of legumes per week 

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.832
 there was only about a quarter of the probability of the disease, 

00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:25.719
 compared to those who ate one whole or less. 

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.681
 Yes, the consumption of legumes is associated with population studies 

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:33.332
 with lower body weight, a thinner waist, less obesity, and lower blood pressure. 

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:37.332
 However, it was uncertain whether there was a link between legumes consumption and more favorable 

00:00:37.332 --> 00:00:38.668
 weight factors and metabolic risk factors 

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:41.505
 physiological effects of legumes themselves, 

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:45.865
 or just another indicator of a healthy lifestyle. 

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:50.664
 Anyone who is smart enough to eat legumes can be smart enough to eat different 

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:55.384
 other healthy foods, so the consumption of legumes is only an indicator of a healthy diet. 

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:59.131
 So the scientists decided to test it. 

00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.886
 Reducing abdominal fat can be the best way to treat metabolic syndrome; 

00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:06.791
 reduces the risk of prediabetes turning into real diabetes. 

00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:12.099
 Most weight reduction strategies are based on reducing energy intake, 

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:17.465
 however, evidence suggests that the majority of those who lose weight by limiting calorie intake, 

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:22.251
 gets lost weight in the coming months or years back. 

00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:25.333
 Starvation almost never works in the long run. 

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:30.066
 It is therefore important to identify foods that can be easily incorporated into the diet 

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.182
 and spontaneously lead to achievement and retention 

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:36.799
 weight gain and better metabolism control. 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.665
 So for the first time scientists have done comparative tests. 

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.730
 Legumes vs. limiting calories. A legume group was asked 

00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:49.710
 to consume five cups of lentils, peas, chickpeas, or white beans a week. 

00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:53.270
 So participants in the legume group were asked to eat MORE. 

00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:57.600
 On the other hand, calorie-restricted participants were asked to eat less. 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.000
 And the group, where she consumed MORE FOOD, won! 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.070
 Not only was the regular consumption of legumes reduced in prediabetes risk factors 

00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:07.130
 as effective as serving portion sizes, 

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:10.700
 perhaps slimming down your waist or better controlling your blood sugar 

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:15.160
 The legume diet also brought other beneficial effects, as opposed to just limiting calories. 

00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:18.330
 Perhaps this was due to some of the functional properties of legumes, 

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.380
 such as beans or peas. 

00:02:20.387 --> 00:02:27.010
 Finally, five cups of beans, chickpeas, split peas or lentils a week as a diet supplement 

00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:30.020
 the participants were not told that they would otherwise change their diet, 

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:32.520
 reduced risk factors for metabolic syndrome. 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.650
 And these effects were comparable and in some cases better, 

00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:40.850
 than when people were told to take 500 calories out of their daily intake. 

00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:47.080
 These results are encouraging news for those at risk of type 2 diabetes, 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.220
 or already have it because they suggest that simple diet changes 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:58.880
 such as the addition of legumes may have a positive effect on controlling blood sugar levels.
