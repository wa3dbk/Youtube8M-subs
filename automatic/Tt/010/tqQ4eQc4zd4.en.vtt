electric car driver now over the two
years<00:00:56.880> that<00:00:56.940> I've<00:00:57.180> been<00:00:57.510> driving<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.260> car

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
years that I've been driving this car

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.010 
years that I've been driving this car
this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.739> my<00:00:58.920> Nissan<00:00:59.370> Leaf<00:00:59.579> I've<00:01:00.149> traveled

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
this is my Nissan Leaf I've traveled

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.790 
this is my Nissan Leaf I've traveled
just<00:01:01.290> short<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.219> 36,000<00:01:03.059> miles<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.290> total

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
just short of 36,000 miles and the total

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.219 
just short of 36,000 miles and the total
electricity<00:01:05.550> cost<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.300> cost<00:01:06.570> me<00:01:06.660> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
electricity cost that it's cost me is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
electricity cost that it's cost me is
around<00:01:07.800> about<00:01:07.979> 700<00:01:08.670> pounds

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
around about 700 pounds

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.400 
around about 700 pounds
for<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.649> for<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.850> 36,000<00:01:11.850> miles<00:01:12.090> um<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:13.289> a

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
for that for the 36,000 miles um it's a

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.450 
for that for the 36,000 miles um it's a
really<00:01:13.649> difficult<00:01:13.800> thing<00:01:14.009> to<00:01:14.160> work<00:01:14.280> out

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
really difficult thing to work out

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
really difficult thing to work out
because<00:01:14.640> there's<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.360> many<00:01:15.539> variables<00:01:15.690> for<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because there's so many variables for a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.010 
because there's so many variables for a
start<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.220> use<00:01:17.789> generally<00:01:18.330> charge<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.660> car<00:01:18.899> at

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
start I use generally charge this car at

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.070 
start I use generally charge this car at
night<00:01:19.050> on<00:01:19.530> off-peak<00:01:20.009> electricity<00:01:20.899> there<00:01:21.899> are

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
night on off-peak electricity there are

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.930 
night on off-peak electricity there are
days<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> summer<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.250> particular<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:23.789> I

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
days in the summer in particular when I

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.639 
days in the summer in particular when I
charge<00:01:24.209> it<00:01:24.360> during<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.780> day<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.319> is

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
charge it during the day and that is

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.469 
charge it during the day and that is
because<00:01:26.039> there<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.429> direct<00:01:26.789> feed<00:01:26.940> from<00:01:27.119> my

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
because there is a direct feed from my

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.990 
because there is a direct feed from my
solar<00:01:27.810> panels<00:01:28.200> through<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.130> inverter

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
solar panels through the inverter

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.650 
solar panels through the inverter
through<00:01:30.660> some<00:01:30.990> meters<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.590> into<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.099> car<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
through some meters and into the car and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.210 
through some meters and into the car and
the<00:01:33.660> estimates<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.349> how<00:01:34.410> far<00:01:34.740> I've<00:01:34.890> driven<00:01:35.039> in

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the estimates for how far I've driven in

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.339 
the estimates for how far I've driven in
those<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:35.580> years<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.910> purely<00:01:36.509> solar<00:01:36.959> energy

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
those two years on purely solar energy

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.050 
those two years on purely solar energy
are<00:01:37.560> between<00:01:38.130> eight<00:01:38.429> and<00:01:38.490> eight<00:01:38.819> and<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> half

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
are between eight and eight and a half

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.900 
are between eight and eight and a half
thousand<00:01:39.660> miles<00:01:39.840> over<00:01:40.319> two<00:01:40.470> years<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
thousand miles over two years now that

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.550 
thousand miles over two years now that
is<00:01:42.090> eight<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.720> half<00:01:42.750> thousand<00:01:43.229> miles<00:01:43.349> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
is eight and a half thousand miles of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.800 
is eight and a half thousand miles of
driving<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.979> car<00:01:44.009> without<00:01:44.910> burning<00:01:45.390> anything

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
driving a car without burning anything

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.710 
driving a car without burning anything
which<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:47.160> extraordinary<00:01:47.729> leap<00:01:48.539> in

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
which is really extraordinary leap in

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.419 
which is really extraordinary leap in
technology<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.289> I<00:01:49.380> think<00:01:49.410> that's<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.369> know

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
technology and I think that's you know

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.550 
technology and I think that's you know
very<00:01:50.789> much<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.390> fully<00:01:51.929> charged<00:01:52.319> is<00:01:52.440> all

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
very much what fully charged is all

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.850 
very much what fully charged is all
about<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.970> also<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.539> is<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.140> much<00:01:55.349> cheaper<00:01:55.619> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
about and also it is so much cheaper to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770 
about and also it is so much cheaper to
drive<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.340> servicing<00:01:56.819> costs<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.660> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
drive the servicing costs for that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.010 
drive the servicing costs for that
36,000<00:01:58.500> miles<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.130> far<00:01:59.429> totaled<00:02:00.020> 150

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
36,000 miles have so far totaled 150

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
36,000 miles have so far totaled 150
pounds<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:02.069> fact<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.429> of<00:02:02.459> the<00:02:02.550> biggest

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
pounds in fact one of the biggest

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.999 
pounds in fact one of the biggest
expenses<00:02:03.209> is<00:02:03.390> screen<00:02:03.899> wash<00:02:04.140> whenever<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.830> buy

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
expenses is screen wash whenever I buy

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.219 
expenses is screen wash whenever I buy
some<00:02:05.429> screen<00:02:05.759> wash<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.780> really

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
some screen wash I think this is really

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.040 
thought thing that I'm really intrigued
is<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.639> I've<00:04:32.760> been<00:04:32.790> asked<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.210> many<00:04:33.630> times

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
is that I've been asked this many times

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.460 
is that I've been asked this many times
is<00:04:35.040> wire<00:04:35.400> up<00:04:35.700> there<00:04:35.880> diesel<00:04:36.450> hybrids<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.350> know

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
is wire up there diesel hybrids you know

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.780 
is wire up there diesel hybrids you know
because<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.680> would<00:04:37.740> look<00:04:37.830> vibrant<00:04:38.190> up<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.639> that

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
because I would look vibrant up to that

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.820 
because I would look vibrant up to that
with<00:04:38.970> your<00:04:39.090> engine<00:04:39.600> yet<00:04:39.810> but<00:04:40.290> this<00:04:40.440> one<00:04:40.620> I

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
with your engine yet but this one I

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.860 
with your engine yet but this one I

think is fascinating this is how big is

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.270 
think is fascinating this is how big is
the<00:04:42.960> engineer<00:04:43.820> 813-c<00:04:45.470> c02<00:04:46.470> cylinder<00:04:46.950> Susy's

fuel<00:04:52.770> pressure<00:04:53.010> see<00:04:53.400> right<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.820> kill<00:04:54.060> your

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
fuel pressure see right I kill your

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.200 
fuel pressure see right I kill your
brother<00:04:54.690> but<00:04:55.530> no<00:04:55.800> he<00:04:55.860> uses<00:04:56.190> like<00:04:56.340> one<00:04:56.550> rail<00:04:56.970> of

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210

fuel pretty much like a petrol and then

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.690 
fuel pretty much like a petrol and then
the<00:05:00.660> injectors<00:05:01.169> do<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.620> firing<00:05:02.100> right<00:05:02.430> I

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
the injectors do the firing right I

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.640 
the injectors do the firing right I
floored<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.660> saying<00:05:03.990> yeah<00:05:04.139> but<00:05:04.320> see<00:05:04.470> guys<00:05:04.620> that

camera this wing cam

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.070 
camera this wing cam
noise<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.580> noise<00:05:17.610> it<00:05:18.000> makes<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.360> really<00:05:18.510> true

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
noise the noise it makes is really true
