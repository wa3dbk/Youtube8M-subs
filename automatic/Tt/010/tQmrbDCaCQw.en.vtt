what<00:00:45.270> we're<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.029 
what we're going to do is we're going to
first<00:00:47.120> go<00:00:48.120> ahead<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.809> some<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.230> some

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
first go ahead and use some of the some

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.709 
first go ahead and use some of the some
of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> product<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.610> pour<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.059> into<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.510> cake

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
of the product and pour it into the cake

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.479 
of the product and pour it into the cake
but<00:00:52.410> before<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.860> we're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.250> ice

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
but before that we're going to ice

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.270 
but before that we're going to ice
around<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> ring<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.620> make<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> border

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
around the ring so we can make a border

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.450 
around the ring so we can make a border
so<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.460> none<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.260> mix<00:00:58.260> starts<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.219> spill

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
so that none of the mix starts to spill

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.910 
so that none of the mix starts to spill
all<00:00:59.579> over<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> board<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.230> now<00:01:01.350> we're<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
all over the board so now we're going to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.609 
all over the board so now we're going to
go<00:01:02.100> ahead<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.430> continue<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.820> our<00:01:02.940> boarder

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
go ahead and continue with our boarder

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.690 
go ahead and continue with our boarder
piping<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> all<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> way<00:01:05.129> around<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> cake

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
piping it all the way around the cake

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.450 
piping it all the way around the cake
it's<00:01:06.689> basically<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.770> creating<00:01:08.369> a
