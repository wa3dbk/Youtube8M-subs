right<00:00:02.550> now<00:00:02.699> I'm<00:00:02.760> going<00:00:02.880> to<00:00:02.940> show<00:00:03.090> you<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.270> RAM

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
right now I'm going to show you the RAM

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.030 
right now I'm going to show you the RAM
-<00:00:03.899> B<00:00:04.200> -<00:00:04.590> -<00:00:05.040> or<00:00:05.189> two<00:00:05.430> rectangular<00:00:06.210> plates<00:00:07.040> you

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
- B - - or two rectangular plates you

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.830 
- B - - or two rectangular plates you
can<00:00:08.160> see<00:00:08.309> here<00:00:08.460> there's<00:00:08.580> quite<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.790> few<00:00:08.850> and<00:00:09.389> I

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
can see here there's quite a few and I

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.240 
can see here there's quite a few and I
just<00:00:10.019> want<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.200> go<00:00:10.290> through<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.710> explain<00:00:10.860> to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
just want to go through and explain to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.970 
just want to go through and explain to
you<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.639> sizing<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.300> each<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:12.719> they<00:00:13.590> all<00:00:13.740> work

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
you the sizing of each one they all work

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.620 
you the sizing of each one they all work
the<00:00:14.160> same<00:00:14.190> they<00:00:14.580> all<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:15.150> inch<00:00:15.330> ball

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the same they all have a one inch ball

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.220 
the same they all have a one inch ball
on<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.950> top<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.670> them<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.810> allows<00:00:19.080> you

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
on the top of them which allows you

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.720 
on the top of them which allows you
mount<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.210> ram<00:00:21.210> one<00:00:21.869> inch<00:00:22.050> socket<00:00:22.619> arm<00:00:22.980> we

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
mount it to a ram one inch socket arm we

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.220 
mount it to a ram one inch socket arm we
have<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.970> size<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> standard<00:00:24.990> size<00:00:25.199> of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
have this size here the standard size of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.109 
have this size here the standard size of
a<00:00:25.350> medium-sized<00:00:25.859> or<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.279> small<00:00:26.609> size<00:00:26.850> whatever

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
a medium-sized or a small size whatever

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.480 
a medium-sized or a small size whatever
and<00:00:27.869> then<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.560> create<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.160> mount

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and then you can just create a mount

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.140 
and then you can just create a mount
from<00:00:29.699> these

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
from these

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.049 
from these
now<00:00:30.689> ideally<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.550> plates<00:00:32.910> all

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
now ideally with this these plates all

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.620 
now ideally with this these plates all
just<00:00:33.300> vary<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.870> whole<00:00:34.860> patterns<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.430> size<00:00:35.640> but

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
just vary in whole patterns and size but

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.360 
just vary in whole patterns and size but
really<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.020> end<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> day<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.920> depends

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
really at the end of the day it depends

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.740 
really at the end of the day it depends
on<00:00:38.489> what<00:00:38.640> you're<00:00:38.790> mounting<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.600> either

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
on what you're mounting you can either

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
on what you're mounting you can either
use<00:00:39.930> these<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> base<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> connect<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
use these as a base or to connect to the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.530 
use these as a base or to connect to the
back<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.180> some<00:00:42.840> system<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.320> already<00:00:43.559> have

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
back of some system you already have

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.110 
back of some system you already have
these<00:00:45.540> all<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.930> come<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:47.670> inch<00:00:47.850> ball

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
these all do come with a one inch ball

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.910 
these all do come with a one inch ball
the<00:00:48.360> ones<00:00:48.539> I'm<00:00:48.690> showing<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.770> you

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the ones I'm showing you here but you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.670 
the ones I'm showing you here but you
can<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.280> them<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:51.020> exactly<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> same<00:00:52.200> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
can get them all exactly the same but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
can get them all exactly the same but
we're<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.219> average<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.940> diameter<00:00:54.239> there

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
we're the one average for diameter there

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.110 
we're the one average for diameter there
so<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> part<00:00:56.550> numbers<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.000> be

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so and the part numbers are going to be

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.270 
so and the part numbers are going to be
the<00:00:57.239> same<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.870> every<00:00:58.050> way<00:00:58.559> except<00:00:59.070> they're

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the same in every way except they're

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.189 
the same in every way except they're
going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> ramp<00:00:59.910> tour<00:01:00.300> -<00:01:00.660> serious

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
going to be the ramp tour - serious

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.779 
going to be the ramp tour - serious
instead<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> RAM<00:01:01.890> B<00:01:02.160> which<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:02.670> these

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
instead the RAM B which is what these

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.760 
instead the RAM B which is what these
are<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.570> let's<00:01:03.750> quickly<00:01:03.960> whip<00:01:04.289> through<00:01:04.559> these

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
are so let's quickly whip through these

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.929 
are so let's quickly whip through these
you've<00:01:05.670> got<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> RAM<00:01:06.090> -<00:01:06.299> B<00:01:06.600> -<00:01:07.080> 2<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:07.770> 2<00:01:07.979> -<00:01:08.340> 1<00:01:08.700> -

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you've got the RAM - B - 2 or 2 - 1 -

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.130 
you've got the RAM - B - 2 or 2 - 1 -
which<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.439> plate<00:01:10.799> which<00:01:11.400> has<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:12.140> whole
