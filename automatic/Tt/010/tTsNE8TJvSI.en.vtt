 Hi everyone, guys welcome to the third 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.719
 appointment of my work on the camper 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:20.420
 as promised this time we will talk 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.760
 batteries and battery switch 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.880
 then here we immediately see battery 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.670
 engine is a 100 amberg battery that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.969
 it must always remain in perfect shape 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.200
 because otherwise the engine will not go in anymore 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.480
 bike to allow it to always remain 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.910
 charge we can use or a 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.850
 parallel or we can 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.700
 buy a charge maintainer that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.539
 in winter stops it keeps it charged 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.510
 making cycles charge and discharge 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.410
 this is the non-service battery 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.309
 essential for starting but 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.629
 essential for the use of services 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.479
 inside the camper just like 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.110
 saying in battery of services like 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.790
 water pump television 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.620
 device also two events with 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.070
 use of the inverter you have seen 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.220
 a previous episode and this too is 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.980
 a hundred ampere more as you have seen 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.270
 always in the previous bet or an 80 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:31.540
 ampere under the seville 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:34.990
 then 180 x plus 100 of the engine 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.229
 we review the inverter fuse which 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.740
 which does not tragically lead to the inverter 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.860
 which parallels the two batteries e 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.820
 so are the cases that enter into the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.530
 so let's get inside the cell now 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:58.770
 camper where we will talk a bit of autonomy 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.770
 costs and battery life 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.840
 we are inside the camper as you see 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.580
 brought past one on the table of the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.320
 of neto where I connected mine 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.980
 phone in office that is working 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:18.250
 with inverter you see that I have it in charge 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:28.120
 noticed by the green light on after a 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:32.560
 when they came back to create I heard 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.980
 the sound and it returns to charge see then 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.230
 we talked about the maintenance of charge 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.680
 of the batteries 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.380
 batteries can be kept 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.540
 charges from or charge maintainer such as 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.400
 I said earlier that it does charge cycles 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.290
 download so it always keeps it in excellent 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.260
 status or with a panel 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.840
 photovoltaic that charges the batteries 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.680
 services and a parallel who when 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.020
 service batteries are charged starts 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 to charge the engine battery as well 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.870
 I did it 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.120
 I have a parallel actor and panels 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.790
 photovoltaic because the maintainer then 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.450
 always needs a 220 volt cable 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.040
 that turns for the cam parking is inconvenient 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.410
 instead with the panel I find myself very much 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.220
 well and the batteries after the break 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.190
 winter are always a lot are always 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.170
 we say in excellent condition and I have 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.910
 also installed a battery stack 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.480
 that allows me in the winter fates of 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.519
 unplug all utilities being a 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.590
 my pretty old camper not 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.140
 has no alarm on a watch then 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.239
 we have no connection problems 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.370
 of the battery and then I put 2 st 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:56.700
 kamata and one for the engine a bargain 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:00.190
 autonomy services then we say that I 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.190
 in summer it has a range of one 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.030
 week and a half even two weeks 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.819
 because I use it 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:15.660
 the bathroom pump when there is a need 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:18.660
 is active a little in the morning at 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:23.370
 afternoon and evening at noon e 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.680
 in the evening and if the lights are little because 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.150
 precisely in the summer we see you see you 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.070
 late so I'm not much 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.190
 important in the middle of winter with the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.070
 stove ventilation always lights 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.310
 lit has a maximum range of one 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.740
 week and a few days no more 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.980
 instead in summer then with the panel 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.570
 solar having the panel with so much 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:54.180
 sunshine I can load so much and then to 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:00.090
 always keep the batteries charged 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.110
 even if I consume enough the duration of 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.770
 a battery 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:13.840
 in the context of autonomy but duration 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:16.870
 in the sense of always remaining excellent 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.070
 state of never losing the charge is of 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:24.280
 the average is 78 years with a maintainer 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.770
 charge can lengthen the life or the 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.840
 kept re as if as the speech of 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.060
 first the panel because it never suffers 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:38.500
 deep and even shocks 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:41.290
 overloads we talk about costs one 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.440
 100 to a battery for like that 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.080
 I use that I have two from 100 and one from 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.310
 80 a 100 amp battery 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:55.080
 if you take a good battery of brands 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.770
 let's say the top costs about 100 150 euros 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.440
 instead a normal brand costs on one 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.990
 instead we say hundreds of euros 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.280
 of the tam tam for let 's say the media 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:15.160
 would be of an aura dump then 80 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:20.050
 for about ninety euro 85 so ling 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:23.470
 costs costs based on the benefit 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:26.500
 mine is 600 watts and it cost me 70 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.930
 euro with internet blog you can 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.790
 also find inverters from a kilowatt e 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:38.440
 so in the 1000 watts to 89 90 saw 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:40.060
 always on ebay but that's what 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.910
 I had to do I do not need in 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.820
 kilowatts and 600 watts are fine with me 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:51.190
 not having the conditioner not having 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:53.380
 not too many do too many 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:58.420
 and therefore also for this video we have 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:02.020
 concluded in the next video we will talk 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.050
 of windows and in winter stops 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.580
 the 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:10.819
 we say the synthetic fat that 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:14.270
 we should put in order not to make it dent 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:16.490
 because many times when after winter 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.669
 they go to open at the windows of the 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.960
 nations have stuck to al 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:22.520
 window 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.990
 so we will talk about this 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:30.229
 topic of the obscurants and of the 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:34.090
 mosquito nets then for this video everything 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.090
 and the next video bye
