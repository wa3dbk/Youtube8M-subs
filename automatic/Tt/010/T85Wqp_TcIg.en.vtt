transition mode you know they kind of
like<00:05:22.180> do<00:05:22.330> go<00:05:22.539> deep<00:05:22.779> shallow<00:05:23.259> and<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:23.770> got<00:05:23.919> a

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
like do go deep shallow and you got a

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.369 
like do go deep shallow and you got a
mix<00:05:24.309> some<00:05:24.610> are<00:05:24.759> deep<00:05:24.969> some<00:05:25.599> are<00:05:25.749> shallow<00:05:25.990> and

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.550 
mix some are deep some are shallow and
we<00:05:27.009> found<00:05:27.189> out<00:05:27.400> today<00:05:28.080> everyone<00:05:29.080> seemed<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:29.439> be

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
we found out today everyone seemed to be

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.110 
we found out today everyone seemed to be
the<00:05:29.650> better<00:05:29.800> truck<00:05:30.159> most<00:05:30.639> of<00:05:30.759> our<00:05:30.819> shallow

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
the better truck most of our shallow

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:42.689 
the better truck most of our shallow
fish<00:05:31.449> are<00:05:31.659> smaller<00:05:40.979> but<00:05:41.979> if<00:05:42.249> you<00:05:42.339> find<00:05:42.580> the

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
fish are smaller but if you find the

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.600 
fish are smaller but if you find the
bait<00:05:42.930> you'll<00:05:43.930> find<00:05:44.199> the<00:05:44.289> fish<00:05:44.529> as<00:05:44.860> it<00:05:45.310> gets

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
bait you'll find the fish as it gets

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.010 
bait you'll find the fish as it gets
colder<00:05:46.089> and<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.509> trial<00:05:46.779> are<00:05:46.870> gonna

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
colder and the trial are gonna

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.739 
colder and the trial are gonna
concentrate<00:05:47.409> more<00:05:47.860> and<00:05:48.240> usually<00:05:49.240> once<00:05:49.659> you

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:49.749 
concentrate more and usually once you

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.719 
concentrate more and usually once you
find<00:05:49.990> them<00:05:50.169> you'll<00:05:50.379> have<00:05:50.589> real<00:05:51.129> good<00:05:51.279> success

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
find them you'll have real good success

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.559 
find them you'll have real good success
don't<00:05:52.149> worry<00:05:52.240> stock<00:05:52.689> same<00:05:53.529> way<00:05:53.710> with<00:05:53.860> gray

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
don't worry stock same way with gray

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.269 
don't worry stock same way with gray
would<00:05:55.569> you<00:05:55.689> find<00:05:55.930> out<00:05:56.139> with<00:05:56.529> as<00:05:56.830> far<00:05:57.069> as<00:05:57.129> the

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
tides go with fishing fish in the wall

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.610 
tides go with fishing fish in the wall
it's<00:06:00.370> pretty<00:06:00.610> cut<00:06:00.819> and<00:06:00.849> dry<00:06:01.089> yeah<00:06:01.990> definitely

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
it's pretty cut and dry yeah definitely

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.579 
it's pretty cut and dry yeah definitely
he<00:06:02.800> definitely<00:06:02.979> movement<00:06:04.229> you<00:06:05.229> want<00:06:05.379> some

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:05.589 
he definitely movement you want some

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:07.290 
he definitely movement you want some
type<00:06:05.770> of<00:06:05.800> movement<00:06:06.370> why<00:06:06.580> they'd<00:06:06.759> be<00:06:06.789> falling

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
type of movement why they'd be falling

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.909 
type of movement why they'd be falling
or<00:06:07.419> income<00:06:07.779> and<00:06:07.990> probably<00:06:08.409> following<00:06:08.860> would

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
or income and probably following would

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.119 
or income and probably following would
be<00:06:09.039> the<00:06:09.159> best<00:06:10.319> if<00:06:11.319> it<00:06:11.469> pushes<00:06:11.740> all<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:11.889> bait

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
be the best if it pushes all the bait

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.339 
be the best if it pushes all the bait
out<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.370> marsh<00:06:12.610> and<00:06:12.909> they<00:06:13.689> all<00:06:13.839> get<00:06:14.050> stacked

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
out the marsh and they all get stacked

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.379 
out the marsh and they all get stacked
up<00:06:14.529> at<00:06:14.680> a<00:06:14.709> wall<00:06:14.919> and<00:06:15.159> official<00:06:15.909> just<00:06:16.209> gets

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
up at a wall and official just gets

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.239 
up at a wall and official just gets
tacked<00:06:16.629> up<00:06:16.810> there<00:06:16.990> but<00:06:17.139> as<00:06:17.259> far<00:06:17.529> as<00:06:17.560> the<00:06:18.009> tides

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:18.249 
tacked up there but as far as the tides

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:20.369 
tacked up there but as far as the tides
coming<00:06:18.580> through<00:06:18.909> that<00:06:18.939> the<00:06:19.479> opening<00:06:20.050> in<00:06:20.229> the

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:20.379 
coming through that the opening in the

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.099 
coming through that the opening in the
wall<00:06:20.409> yeah
