00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.730
 hello friends with you i'm fox and 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.919
 today look at the bridge of Socrates which 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.599
 adds that most ship mainkraftu 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.700
 most importantly this ship develops more 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.070
 high speed rather than a boat and on it 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.960
 much nicer to explore new lands 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.000
 travel on water so let's 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.650
 let's see how to do it to start 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.750
 we need to make special 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.370
 boards which possesses to apparently 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.920
 increased strength do not know why 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.230
 it is necessary but let's do it 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.510
 to make one special board to us 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.579
 need h9 ordinary boards 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.380
 see how they make it easy 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.660
 simpler than anything here 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.970
 say we need 4 boards to 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.489
 make our ship base more precisely to 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.020
 our ship pick up the received doses 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.329
 cars and now we need to do 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.120
 fabrics with cloth will make sails like 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.250
 making it even easier for this is just 3 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.950
 wool cubes put in a row and get as much 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.630
 8 pieces of cloth we need twenty 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.579
 four pieces of cloth on the general then send 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.989
 his senate but since it is impossible to scrubs 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.450
 Tyrone 1816 824 we have to take 24 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.220
 our fabric and now we need 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.190
 make it sails sails are made 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.890
 also pretty easy just fill in 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.290
 Again, the whole craft of Abe and we get 1 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.390
 sailing panda two sails 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.250
 we take our sails and now we do 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.070
 match numa what is the basis of the ship so 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.590
 say the match is done very easily 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.450
 also in this graph in general everything is very 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.040
 easy to do and the last thing we need 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.119
 do it and i like of course to 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.549
 stop our ship 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.760
 of this we put three flowers of iron in a row and 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.740
 above them we lay out a tree 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.810
 anchor actually got us all that 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.430
 need to make our ship 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.680
 now let's discuss how it 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.020
 we pick up and he's going well 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.310
 it is very easy to anchor over it 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.329
 put the mast 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.979
 along the edges of the special board and sail everything 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.899
 water our ship let's see 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.970
 later it will hold the water and 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.079
 Test Drive 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.299
 we press the right mouse button as from 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.610
 glands of deed slot to him like thats cool 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.960
 ship 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.509
 sit on it with the right mouse button 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.090
 click on the ship and just look like 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:15.220
 it accelerates look wow what 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.720
 speed is just a class on it all 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.610
 proper fruit is nothing more 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.680
 adds but quite enough for that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.390
 to teach this game is fun for everyone 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.690
