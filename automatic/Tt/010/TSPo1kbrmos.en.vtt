00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
on one word in our actual season you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.709 
on one word in our actual season you
know<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.730> can't<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.300> much<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.690> own

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
know I can't do as much on my own

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.350 
know I can't do as much on my own

because we're having practices and games

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
because we're having practices and games
so<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> can't<00:00:48.989> really<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.440> much<00:00:49.469> training

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
