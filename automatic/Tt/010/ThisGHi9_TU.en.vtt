metal portion just take a look at this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.109 
metal portion just take a look at this
rust<00:00:23.689> look<00:00:24.689> at<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.320> rust<00:00:26.029> very<00:00:27.029> nice<00:00:29.119> all

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
rust look at this rust very nice all

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.359 
rust look at this rust very nice all
right<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.929> rust<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.800> Ross<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.309> is

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
right so this is rust of Ross this is

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.780 
right so this is rust of Ross this is
rust<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.059> top<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.600> rust<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.950> want<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.430> rust

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
rust on top of rust you want to see rust

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.910 
rust on top of rust you want to see rust
and<00:00:36.739> we're<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> show<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.329> how<00:00:39.329> to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
years ago long time ago and the paint
really<00:01:22.950> held<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.610> pretty<00:01:23.729> nice<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.240> did<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
really held up pretty nice we did a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.200 
really held up pretty nice we did a
two-tone<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.759> top<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
two-tone on it as you can see the top is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
two-tone on it as you can see the top is
like<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.720> Wimbledon<00:01:28.380> white<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> classic<00:01:29.250> white

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
like a Wimbledon white a classic white

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.060 
like a Wimbledon white a classic white
we<00:01:29.729> did<00:01:29.909> these<00:01:30.320> moldings<00:01:31.320> white<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:31.920> did

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
we did these moldings white and we did

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.510 
we did these moldings white and we did
the<00:01:32.189> green<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> sides<00:01:34.040> but<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.159> held<00:01:35.340> up

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the green on the sides but it held up

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.550 
the green on the sides but it held up
pretty<00:01:35.670> good<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.180> 10<00:01:36.420> years<00:01:36.750> actually<00:01:39.560> we're

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
pretty good for 10 years actually we're

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.960 
pretty good for 10 years actually we're
going<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> need<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> redo<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> front<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
going to need to redo the front the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.800 
going to need to redo the front the
front<00:01:42.210> was<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:43.140> bad<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.590> rusted<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.810> we

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
front was really bad and rusted and we

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.920 
front was really bad and rusted and we
just<00:01:46.049> bonded<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:47.340> ten<00:01:47.640> years<00:01:47.850> ago<00:01:47.970> but

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
just bonded it about ten years ago but

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.679 
just bonded it about ten years ago but
this<00:01:49.110> looks<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:49.890> new<00:01:50.130> rust<00:01:50.689> there

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
this looks like it's all new rust there

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.440 
this looks like it's all new rust there
was<00:01:51.869> no<00:01:52.049> bondo<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.530> there<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.240> but<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.390> know

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
was no bondo on there here but I know

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.600 
was no bondo on there here but I know
all<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:55.200> all<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.890> bondo<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
all like all in here is bondo but it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.490 
all like all in here is bondo but it
held<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.939> pretty<00:01:57.119> good<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.750> could<00:01:57.869> see<00:01:58.140> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
held up pretty good you could see you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.219 
held up pretty good you could see you
could<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.649> some<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> cracking<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:01.020> it's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
could see some of the cracking but it's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.130 
could see some of the cracking but it's
still<00:02:01.850> still<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.390> listed<00:02:03.780> looks<00:02:03.930> good

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
still still you know listed looks good

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.870 
still still you know listed looks good
so<00:02:04.799> we're<00:02:04.920> actually<00:02:05.070> gonna<00:02:05.310> put<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> new<00:02:05.700> front

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
so we're actually gonna put a new front
