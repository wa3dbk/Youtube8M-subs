00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
brothers 2 also adds an interesting new

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
brothers 2 also adds an interesting new
element<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.080> time-honored<00:03:22.080> razor-sharp

platforming<00:03:28.850> but<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.940> course<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.329> primary

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
platforming but of course the primary

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.259 
platforming but of course the primary
difference<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.709> while<00:03:32.250> coin<00:03:32.670> hunting<00:03:33.120> is

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
difference is that while coin hunting is

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.539 
difference is that while coin hunting is
built<00:03:33.690> into<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.079> design<00:03:34.230> it's<00:03:34.769> not<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
built into the design it's not to the

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.220 
built into the design it's not to the
extent<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.000> Yoshi<00:03:36.329> whoops<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.930> that's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
extent that Yoshi whoops and that's

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.170 
extent that Yoshi whoops and that's
where<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.470> game<00:03:37.590> falters<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> bit<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.820> has<00:03:38.970> this

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
where the game falters a bit it has this

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.390 
where the game falters a bit it has this
interesting<00:03:39.959> focus<00:03:40.260> on<00:03:40.560> coins<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.190> even

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
interesting focus on coins it even

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.430 
interesting focus on coins it even
brings<00:03:41.640> back<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.000> raccoon<00:03:42.420> leaf<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:43.319> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
brings back the raccoon leaf but the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.110 
brings back the raccoon leaf but the
design<00:03:43.769> never<00:03:44.010> really<00:03:44.310> exploits<00:03:44.850> those

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
design never really exploits those

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.599 
design never really exploits those
concepts<00:03:45.720> as<00:03:45.959> much<00:03:46.230> as<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.530> could<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:47.010> really

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
concepts as much as it could I really

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.009 
concepts as much as it could I really
think<00:03:47.850> these<00:03:47.970> things<00:03:48.269> could<00:03:48.480> have<00:03:48.569> been<00:03:48.600> taken

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
think these things could have been taken

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.990 
think these things could have been taken
further<00:03:49.319> but<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.400> new<00:03:50.640> super<00:03:50.970> mario
