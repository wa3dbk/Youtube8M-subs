briefly<00:04:24.289> to<00:04:24.590> 850<00:04:25.580> odd<00:04:25.699> dollars<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:27.139> average

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.820 
briefly to 850 odd dollars the average
price<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.070> month<00:04:28.340> was<00:04:28.690> 666

price that month was 666
inflation-adjusted<00:04:30.830> today<00:04:31.490> that's<00:04:31.789> a<00:04:31.880> couple

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
inflation-adjusted today that's a couple

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.390 
inflation-adjusted today that's a couple
of<00:04:32.240> thousand<00:04:32.630> dollars<00:04:32.960> on<00:04:33.169> one<00:04:33.889> inflation

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
of thousand dollars on one inflation

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.270 
of thousand dollars on one inflation
measure<00:04:34.580> on<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:35.570> more<00:04:35.870> fair<00:04:36.470> inflation<00:04:37.130> measure

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.219 
measure on a more fair inflation measure
it's<00:04:37.820> probably<00:04:38.180> more<00:04:38.330> like<00:04:38.539> six<00:04:38.810> thousand

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
it's probably more like six thousand

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.110 
it's probably more like six thousand
dollar<00:04:39.410> so<00:04:39.590> when<00:04:39.710> people<00:04:39.979> say<00:04:40.220> we've<00:04:40.970> only

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
dollar so when people say we've only

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.689 
dollar so when people say we've only
just<00:04:41.240> recently<00:04:41.990> passed<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:43.010> old<00:04:43.220> high<00:04:43.490> of

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
just recently passed the old high of

just recently passed the old high of
gold<00:04:44.000> you've<00:04:44.780> got<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.050> understand<00:04:45.530> that

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
gold you've got to understand that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.650 
gold you've got to understand that
