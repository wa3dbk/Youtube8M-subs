00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.190
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.490
 product videos i want you today 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.860
 once a little more special 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.139
 Rear rubber seal for 7 or 13 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.269
 present pole pendant sockets 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.910
 and that is the special thing about this 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.189
 rubber sleeve that she on the back 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.070
 back is kept completely plan and 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.750
 You can use this cable to exit 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.720
 from the socket to the left or 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.429
 Realize the right side 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.439
 you know the rubber seal in the 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.070
 usually so that are the standard rubber 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.890
 sounds 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.490
 these have the cable coming out in the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.890
 with me back out who but 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.900
 For example, the outlet somewhere plan 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.210
 wants to puncture on the underground 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.520
 He must think like he does 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.160
 cable can then lead out to the side 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.900
 and right there is this backward one 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.270
 Rubber seal into the game 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.810
 You can order these in our online shop 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.790
 under article number 66 11 05 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.920
 purchase 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.380
 please take care that these 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.160
 rubber parts for sockets with oval 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.810
 design is so wahle design 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.290
 Always recognize that this 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.610
 flanks on the side of the socket 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.880
 The housing is not flattened 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.980
 completely round is considered as an example 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.190
 I have myself for this product video 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.470
 times for a 7 pin trailer outlet 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.580
 I decided with plastic housing 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.040
 have our article number 66 11 30 here 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.290
 taken to hand 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.900
 This has the advantage that the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.990
 manufacturers already have the markings for 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.060
 the cable still leaks out 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.460
 have to produce and indeed to left 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.000
 or right side like they have on the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.010
 dearest eats must make the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.960
 Marks are here at the side 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.490
 already marked so far before and she 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 can now simply not after 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.659
 have opted for left or 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.400
 right these pieces with a sharp 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:07.119
 break out knife or cutter knife 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.130
 this is best done by opening the lid and 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.020
 Press the insert of the socket after 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.470
 out back then they have that 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.210
 easier the mark 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.470
 then cut out 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.970
 I have even ever 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.040
 I'm preparing for that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.740
 the cable from traction left side 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.730
 After I decided that out then 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.800
 That's how it looks now 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.820
 we have the cable breakthrough so far 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.130
 manufactured 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.120
 Now I have the rubber parts so times 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.450
 turn around because it is so then 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.430
 together after we so the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.340
 we could have made preparations 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.230
 the use of these sockets 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.790
 to take the hand again 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.180
 make the wiring 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.820
 please pay attention to the wiring 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.100
 insist that you put this rubber cover over 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.780
 have the cable pushed over it 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.760
 because once you have wiring 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.590
 you have got the spout 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.080
 of course not over it and need 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.670
 to clarify everything again 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.260
 maybe at this point to the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.780
 dimensions we have in one for one 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.140
 Cable cross steps 16 millimeters 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.930
 prepared on the back we have 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.880
 an opening with about 9 mm 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.040
 Make sure that everything is flexible 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.940
 here and who still does not 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.880
 that can be enough with a pair of scissors 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.739
 original 40 mm long cable exit 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.020
 cut something back 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:40.160
 that will always return from the scope 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.410
 Continue so that you have several veins 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.320
 can realize cross sections as they 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.090
 need it 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.970
 after so everything ready so far 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.830
 have mounted 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.200
 Press the sockets insert 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.440
 back into the socket and that 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.270
 there is so sure here this nose the 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.800
 then force the top of the hole they pure 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.590
 can not swap it works 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.800
 only in this facility once 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.720
 Click then latches the extent that a 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.260
 and what just have to do it now 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.269
 then the outlet is in this little one 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.049
 lead into it 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.359
 this is still the only fumbling part 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.580
 who is ahead of them and if they are 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.000
 then have it done 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.000
 like this 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.199
 so I think it is very good too 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.340
 see 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:39.510
 the rubber seal is not really so 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.270
 very nice plan on from the inside it will be 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.120
 then look like this 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.729
 you get the cable through wonderfully 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.100
 Finally, break it here 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.780
 still the screw executions out 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.820
 six pieces are marked three 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.350
 But they only need it depending on whether they 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.229
 a cable exits to the left or 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.180
 be done on the right side and then 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.150
 the whole thing is already done 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.900
 I thank you for watching and 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.900
 please look at our other as well 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.900
