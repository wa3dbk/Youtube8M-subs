 Welcome to all who accompany my 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.970
 channel 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.070
 This is our third tutorial. 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.980
 today we'll be talking about the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.530
 installation of the programs to configure 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.490
 the media pedal but by the way 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.320
 homemade 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.740
 But how do we go? 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.980
 set the true home cooking on high 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.649
 ready we'll use the joystick 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.629
 before the chic folding people to 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.109
 We're going to test the pedalboard. 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.569
 the joystick with the right programs then 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.699
 there the programs there we will go 

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:45.989
 be there 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.319
 then looking here at the computer screen 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.289
 here we will try to install in your 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:55.469
 So let's go there and we'll go 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.449

 or program for the galley that is rich 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.729
 will have a link below or difficult to 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.649

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:48.950

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.950
 You can close here, huh? 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:59.810
 if you've been dragging work 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.299
 really weird 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.390
 however here 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.480
 Ah, we have a limit 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.100
 by regions today's film are all 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:31.460
 strange name but very easy 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.570
 first the ok midi is for 32 bits 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.790
 32 bit 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.990
 when I had 32 bits of windows and 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.950
 used it but there it is in 64 bits and from there 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.220
 did not work 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.660
 and there you have to install un allows the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.200
 same thing that will create a 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.300
 input 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.230
 the record is going to give the commands 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.850
 so we'll talk first is the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.420
 64-bit limit just came 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.210
 right-click goes 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.620
 compatibility properties run the 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.620
 previous windows version 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:17.610
 Then you apply, okay? 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:22.080
 Then you come from what next run accepted. 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.830
 the terms and next create an icon in the 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.830
 next job is 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:03.460
 a bit slow because I 'm going to give a 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:06.650
 Pause here in the video and I'll be back here 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:18.410

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:21.170
 live happy then beauty 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.700
 the first installed midi he created a 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.220
 icon here 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.310
 I'm going to install another's name but he 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.830
 it's not for 32 bits but it's going to install 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.930
 him to show how he 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.970
 being there it will not work but I 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:40.570
