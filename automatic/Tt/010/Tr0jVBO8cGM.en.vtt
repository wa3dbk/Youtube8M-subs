00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 and then leave on robert laffont but here's that 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.770
 jean-baptist lice 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.560
 he took a place in the summer morning studio a place from which 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.030
 he goes every day to electrify you wake up with his azerty chronicle 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.820
 converted hello jean-baptiste my day by jean-baptiste my first chronicle 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.420
 the summer is nothing bookish since you talk to us this morning about 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.700
 now infamous anders behring yes I'd like a day and I have 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.080
 been hit do not 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.360
 not something that is a little bit the men of the digital trio if you 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.279
 want like it's now become the usual journalists stables have 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.930
 started looking for traces of the killer on the internet and on the networks 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.519
 social a facebook page and that was there 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.109
 with a lot of things presented a presence was also on tweeter 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.379
 with meal one click to his credit but got to this point me I was 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.439
 struck by the selection of information that was carried out by 

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.280
 the newspapers the media especially french 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.700
 and when we cough spotted that the killer was my players or haufor kraft 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:53.989
 a modern warfare 2 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.039
 MP games according to the information that was not taken over 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.170
 by the north larry smith has been extensively commented for example on 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.199
 fox news where it can be 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.199
 an old traditional reflex seeking to connect youth violence launched 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:04.810
 by 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.910
 in any case and that it is certain that the seller I played well to see their faith 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.950
 grime for those interested it was present for them under the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.650
 pseudonym conservatism but yes absolutely 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.880
 on a single on a server called if their world he was from elsewhere 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.240
 described by his traders as a rather kind boy affable norma under all 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.829
 reports 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.330
 for one who for several months no longer plays roland faure arte 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.660
 because he had projects in real life now we understand with 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.060
 sadness what were his plans on other present documents 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.480
 on the internet sony little bit the chip in the ear and especially the famous 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.050
 document of 1500 pages which we realized during the weekend that he 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.970
 was actually made from copy and paste of a whole bunch of 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.120
 documents and by whom was tailor 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.570
 and in this document what's going on and well we realize that he can 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.320
 feed his presence on the fair traces to sow doubt edison panic 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.359
 in the Western media why 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.739
 but because he had noticed that ostracized people had an ease 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:01.559
 like that to add opprobrium to people who spend limited time and who 

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:03.830
 had thought it would be a way 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.479
 simple and practical if you do not ask him questions about his activities 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.660
 started creating this online presence on high court video games 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.750
 avoid having to answer ok on which particular concerned about his 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.910
 schedule his diary to his travels and preparing for these 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.090
 attacks to a fine and if you want so this is the man who cries to the wolf 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.050
 then what is it 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.160
 by creating a fear maybe a little irrational anyway I hope 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.510
 thank you for the 15 million players of this game in any case for 100 m that he has 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.629
 ended up giving someone the idea of ​​using that fear to turn it around 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.480
 against people who were in the process who could have done something to 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.560
 prevent 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.739
 attacks 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.889
 so me in my opinion it's something that reveals the nature 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.409
 deeply terrifying if you want this mechanism but eventually we 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.029
 causes death by playing on culture and imagination 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.049
 thank you jean-baptiste your chronic warned what is it to find 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.589
 every day in the summer camp
