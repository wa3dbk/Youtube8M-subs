00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.960
 how did euro jazz say again ? 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.730
 clavicle more gameplay 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.430
 commentary and today i will join 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 the series beginning life stories in last 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.180
 time we have written really many 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.250
 Here you can something so from you 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.460
 tell some stories from your own 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.660
 live what you have experienced and bla bla bla 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.920
 Now I thought so now 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.660
 let me mean it 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
 You sometimes serve comments here and there 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.180
 always tell a story from his life 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.220
 me once 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.170
 but now I'm really just such a 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.480
 make the right series out of it and you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.950
 tell a few things before with the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.190
 I'll tell you today's story 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.010
 for the first time to the gameplay and that is it 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.180
 today with the amg it can believe it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.379
 is not the ska played this evening 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.989
 and the gameplay I do not know yet 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.129
 exactly as I should call that one 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.930
 extra 100 plus or so now stop that 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.030
 I'll get the nuclear one I'll be 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.369
 I think on a 42 streak 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.890
 Meanwhile, my lot has started there too 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.330
 doubled up three to four times and 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.860
 overwrite but I have the whole 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.780
 time not used because I have no 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.119
 Bock somehow had me in the corner 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.680
 squat and then go there anyway 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.100
 play because I expected it too 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.350
 I was sure you will die yes 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.290
 people at the very end then I set the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.320
 oster once what happens to me 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.869
 dying at the end is a score of 75 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.340
 to one and not something you can 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.580
 In any case, be very good 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.369
 so you can go to today's story and indeed 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.710
 I have my friends so it 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.970
 think about where to start what stories 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.680
 I should tell 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.229
 and because it just with my 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.810
 first accident and that was really a lot 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.640
 too much for me 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.320
 I had my license you have 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.909
 get my car too 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.079
 on the fourth of october, that was both 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.430
 with probably already done 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.840
 I made it easy to know when I 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.529
 third october birthday and so bla 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.440
 bla bla and then it was the 6th october 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:17.520
 speaks two days second 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.440
 where I got my car and then 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.190
 as well as driven to max i itch 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.870
 pal 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.150
 we had otherwise and then we are 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 yes, especially mcdrive have gone in 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.500
 ordered everything and then we have it 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.050
 also get paid blablabla granted 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.790
 So then we look in there and we 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.430
 had chicken mcnuggets among others 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.500
 ordered and had no sauce so 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.060
 have we had come so thought 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.520
 again purely because what summer otherwise 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.560
 eating and drying is so shit and 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.180
 our McDonald's is so constructed that 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.910
 du quasi we only once the mc drive 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.890
 have done completely new on it 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.000
 you have to drive and you have to do it now 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.360
 so imagine 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.730
 left is a track to the mc drive and 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.380
 right next to it is the track to 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.000
 Parking so we have to 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.910
 decided decided because the mc 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.930
 drive snake was mad for a long time 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.640
 they just thought of that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.440
 the parking lot go in just say that 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.050
 they are already a little sweet 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.370
 give sour sauce 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.750
 I was that long the hilarious 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.700
 jerk so you do not drive so fast 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.480
 one should drive also only 10 km h 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.250
 I was nice along the right track 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.780
 suddenly there is a full throttle of the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.000
 left track because it probably 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.489
 also took too long gave full throttle 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.070
 pull right and pop in full 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.900
 me in front of him at mc drive 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.470
 were at a window pane too 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.520
 below 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.370
 the guys shout forum the passenger 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.920
 hidden gets out and brings in full 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.550
 his fist and laboriously his fist 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.950

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.080
 my buddy next to luckily still 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.030
 just seen me still draws to himself 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.800
 down on his lap and that's why he has 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.140
 hit the steering wheel with his fist 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.000
 and I'm getting ready to knock out 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.860
 he has been resting because he gave me 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.070
 he is just going in there 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.690
 once it's full to scream with it 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.580
 I saw you , what's wrong with you ? 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.900
 just pull out though and 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.940
 Fehrs me in the car purely 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.100

 The old car of my brother I say yes 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.880
 what does not itch because it is full 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.280
 freaked out and bows so beautifully 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.830
 the driver alighted both full 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.290
 yelled at it though it was the fault 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.460
 it was that was just too much to blame 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.110
 the iss is full all the time 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.450
 but also busy with the author 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.400
 blown away for whatever reason 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:37.030
 and that was really too much for me 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.050
 that was real were really aggressive people 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.340
 I do not know then I am just next 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.350
 I drove to the parking lot 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.240
 afterwards we had a honda civic 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.820
 but the very old already totally 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.540
 Rust our shit so my car 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.880
 I had my little macke 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.320
 and because it was completely shredded because of it 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.480
 just such a funny case 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.760
 cost the car was but we on the 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.890
 parking since I have only times my papa 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.660
 Called because I hope I do 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.280
 should not just because it's easy 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.660
 really much too much for me only two days 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.670
 driver's license then he still wants me there 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.410
 beaten up just is wrong 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.090
 Parking is then exactly one more 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.630
 a few times and has his hand 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.670
 elevated 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.160
 then my buddy is still freaked out 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.960
 ey said this and so has now 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.200
 everything a bit down until 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.580
 That's why my plan was called 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.780
 always come and then I have 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.430
 Of course, the police should 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.320
 call then they are already full again 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.030
 obituary lived not police 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.620
 I almost wanted to take my phone away 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.880
 But then I finally did 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.750
 somehow then the police managed 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.780
 call 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.510
 they came and then they did 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.560
 somehow everything clarified but exactly that 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.240
 was somehow also a mistake 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.740
 from me then I was my name 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.810
 shocked or I do not know why 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.850
 but then I was crying too and 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.470
 even when the police were still there and me 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.670
 did not tell my dad somehow 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.500
 that guy me here now a few 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.450
 tried to beat and so and so 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.980
 one time it would actually be full 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.990
 the fist come at me 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.030
 keep my buddy important pulled down 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.130
 besides, my dad is not told because 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.450
 I was kind of messed up and somehow 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.560
 then the police will have me too 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.090
 to say why I am all the time 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.320
 howl I am now knew too 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.490
 not so now I would too 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.070
 not heal anymore but i believe that 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.640
 was just no idea car new and stuff 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.810
 as I have cried and have the 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.010
 me still announced and have to 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.770
 I still asked for everything at home 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:24.520
 Told he was then we would have immediately 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.410
 reminder and blablabla and yes 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.850
 no idea actually unnecessary 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.229
 because nothing really happens 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.009
 in any case after that was yet 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.749
 leaving the ire in front of you 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.089
 The police, of course , immediately said 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:36.229
 that was the fault of insurance 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:39.529
 those still somehow tried that 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.969
 otherwise steer back but there's enough to 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:43.159
 luck, everything was fine 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.930
 yes that was definitely my story 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:47.749
 from my first accident 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.639
 I have to say but here woman on 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:51.529
 tax and so will now come one 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.939
 someday, somebody else will be there 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:55.550
 that was not bad at all 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.889
 and so were okay i have never had one 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.819
 accident made people i am full of 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:04.279
 In any case that was it for every driver 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.930
 Now let me have some people 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:07.699
 Thumb up there if you follow the new 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.889
 reallife stories like or 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.330
 also this sequence has fallen me 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.800
 definitely some comments 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.020
 Of course , I would be happy too 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.800
 and there I would say mold and 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.800
 Until next time
