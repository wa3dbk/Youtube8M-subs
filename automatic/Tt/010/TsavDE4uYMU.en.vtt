00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.350 
Invisalign and damen braces is very

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.580 
Invisalign and damen braces is very
similar<00:00:09.830> it<00:00:10.130> really<00:00:10.580> does<00:00:10.730> vary<00:00:11.440> according<00:00:12.440> to

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
similar it really does vary according to

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.930 
similar it really does vary according to
what's<00:00:12.830> going<00:00:12.920> on<00:00:13.250> in<00:00:13.370> the<00:00:13.460> person's<00:00:13.820> mouth

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
what's going on in the person's mouth

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.910 
what's going on in the person's mouth
and<00:00:14.179> the<00:00:14.269> complexity<00:00:14.780> of<00:00:14.929> what<00:00:15.710> we're<00:00:15.889> doing

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
and the complexity of what we're doing

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.570 
and the complexity of what we're doing
so<00:00:16.490> if<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.180> an<00:00:17.360> easy<00:00:17.540> case<00:00:18.040> we<00:00:19.040> may<00:00:19.189> only<00:00:19.460> be

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
so if it's an easy case we may only be

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.189 
so if it's an easy case we may only be
looking<00:00:19.939> at<00:00:20.060> 12<00:00:20.390> months<00:00:20.599> and<00:00:20.930> getting

looking at 12 months and getting
something<00:00:21.440> done<00:00:21.590> for<00:00:21.710> somebody<00:00:22.279> and<00:00:23.240> if

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
something done for somebody and if

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.150 
something done for somebody and if
that's<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:23.990> case<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.410> Invisalign<00:00:24.949> you're
