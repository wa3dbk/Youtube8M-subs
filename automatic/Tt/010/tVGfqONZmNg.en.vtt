00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
actually going to stamp the petals with

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.590 
actually going to stamp the petals with
these<00:00:37.530> little<00:00:37.980> flower<00:00:38.670> stamps<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.450> have

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

I'm just randomly stamping all over the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
I'm just randomly stamping all over the
petals<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.329> finish<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.930> now<00:00:49.350> i'm<00:00:49.500> going

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.100 
darker purple over that and i'll
randomly<00:01:02.430> stamp<00:01:03.030> these<00:01:03.180> flowers<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:04.049> over

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
randomly stamp these flowers all over

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.890 
randomly stamp these flowers all over
the<00:01:04.979> petals<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.790> there<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.570> it's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the petals and there you can see it's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.080 
the petals and there you can see it's
done<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:08.010> use<00:01:08.159> my<00:01:08.369> bone<00:01:08.580> folder<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:10.939> curl<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
done we use my bone folder and curl the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:24.820 
done we use my bone folder and curl the
petals<00:01:14.450> in<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:17.189> individual<00:01:17.850> pedals

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.480 

now<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.340> start<00:01:26.520> assembling<00:01:30.260> using

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
now I want to start assembling using

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.359 
now I want to start assembling using
two-way<00:01:32.490> zip<00:01:33.150> glue<00:01:33.950> putting<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> little<00:01:35.159> bit<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
two-way zip glue putting a little bit of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.730 
two-way zip glue putting a little bit of
glue<00:01:35.580> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.909> bigger<00:01:36.119> piece<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:37.380> gluing

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
glue on the bigger piece and then gluing

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.600 
glue on the bigger piece and then gluing
a<00:01:38.009> small<00:01:38.340> pedal<00:01:38.759> layer<00:01:38.940> to<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> bottom<00:01:43.610> now

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
a small pedal layer to the bottom now

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
a small pedal layer to the bottom now
adding<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> other<00:01:45.149> pedal<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.380> are

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
adding the other pedal and these are

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560 
adding the other pedal and these are
separate<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.580> want<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> curl<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
separate so if you want to curl just the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.180 
separate so if you want to curl just the
bottom<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> top<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.890> want<00:01:50.130> to

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
bottom and not the top or you want to

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.770 
bottom and not the top or you want to
change<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.700> way<00:01:50.820> they're<00:01:51.000> overlapped<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
change the way they're overlapped you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.980 
change the way they're overlapped you
can<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.130> curl<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
can you can curl in just the just the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.029 
can you can curl in just the just the
inside<00:01:55.440> too<00:01:57.020> I'm<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.289> actually<00:01:58.530> spray

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
inside too I'm going to actually spray

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.740 
inside too I'm going to actually spray
the<00:01:59.190> center<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.670> more<00:01:59.700> glimmer<00:02:00.509> mess

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the center with more glimmer mess

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.340 
the center with more glimmer mess
because<00:02:00.929> I<00:02:01.080> want<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.410> be<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.590> darker<00:02:01.920> purple

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
because I want it to be a darker purple

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:12.979 
because I want it to be a darker purple
let<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.560> dry<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:09.929> dry<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:11.989> can

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
let that dry and now that it's dry I can

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.400 
let that dry and now that it's dry I can
show<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.319> how<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.739> lines<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.120> petals

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.050 

so<00:02:19.410> I'm<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.650> flip<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.920> over<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.550> use<00:02:20.880> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
so I'm going to flip it over and use the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.500 
so I'm going to flip it over and use the
same<00:02:21.330> glue<00:02:21.750> pen<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.400> cover<00:02:26.700> each<00:02:27.209> of

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
same glue pen and kind of cover each of

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.710 
same glue pen and kind of cover each of
the<00:02:27.660> pieces<00:02:27.870> each<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> little<00:02:29.720> spikes

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
the pieces each of the little spikes

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.410 
the pieces each of the little spikes
with<00:02:31.200> glue<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.310> they'll<00:02:32.700> stick<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.269> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
with glue so that they'll stick to the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:43.340 
with glue so that they'll stick to the
flower<00:02:40.040> just<00:02:41.040> try<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.370> get<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.670> up<00:02:42.019> be<00:02:43.019> really

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
flower just try and get it up be really

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.190 
flower just try and get it up be really
careful<00:02:45.560> now<00:02:46.560> I'm<00:02:46.799> going<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.070> line<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.340> up<00:02:48.200> so

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
careful now I'm going to line it up so

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.400 
careful now I'm going to line it up so
that<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.530> two<00:02:49.769> bottom<00:02:50.040> spikes<00:02:50.549> go<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.410> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
that the two bottom spikes go to the
