00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
is that you do that would have avoided

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.389 
is that you do that would have avoided
because<00:00:33.840> DC<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.469> was<00:00:34.590> only<00:00:34.829> two<00:00:34.980> years<00:00:35.130> ago<00:00:35.280> I

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
again because all this well there's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.180 
again because all this well there's
tootin<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.600> biggest<00:00:42.870> reason<00:00:45.800> stealing<00:00:46.800> Spain

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
tootin the biggest reason stealing Spain

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.889 
tootin the biggest reason stealing Spain
is<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.690> water<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.480> or<00:00:51.480> humidity

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
is because of water and or humidity

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.319 
is because of water and or humidity
either<00:00:52.559> you've<00:00:52.890> got<00:00:53.070> humidity<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.879> inside

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
either you've got humidity on the inside

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.959 
either you've got humidity on the inside
you<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:56.070> attaches<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you know that you get attaches to the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
you know that you get attaches to the
ceiling<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.809> water<00:00:58.199> from<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.649> from

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
ceiling or you have water from that from

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.900 
ceiling or you have water from that from
on<00:00:59.370> top<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.359> there's<00:01:00.629> water<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> biggest

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
on top so there's water is the biggest

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
on top so there's water is the biggest
staining<00:01:02.910> factor<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.570> ceiling<00:01:03.840> okay

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
staining factor on a ceiling okay

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.170 
staining factor on a ceiling okay
so<00:01:06.439> there's<00:01:07.439> different<00:01:08.220> products<00:01:08.820> out<00:01:08.970> there

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
so there's different products out there

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.920 
so there's different products out there
to<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
to do that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.810 
to do that
I<00:01:09.960> found<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.860> product<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.310> works<00:01:11.460> very<00:01:11.760> very

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it'll never what about humidity in this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.399 
it'll never what about humidity in this
in<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:38.040> humidity<00:01:38.579> right<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.630> goes<00:01:39.869> through

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
in like humidity right it goes through

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.230 
in like humidity right it goes through
the<00:01:40.619> wall<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.189> ceiling<00:01:41.759> board<00:01:42.000> whatever
