your blender now I have a Vitamix which
has<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.730> soup<00:00:52.120> setting<00:00:52.570> on<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.870> if<00:00:53.020> you<00:00:53.170> don't

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
have a Vitamix you can still make this

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.389 
have a Vitamix you can still make this
but<00:00:56.350> you're<00:00:56.530> gonna<00:00:56.620> have<00:00:56.859> to<00:00:57.039> do<00:00:57.190> those

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
but you're gonna have to do those

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.439 
but you're gonna have to do those
process<00:00:58.090> it<00:00:58.239> until<00:00:58.359> it's<00:00:58.629> smooth<00:00:59.699> in<00:01:00.699> your

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
process it until it's smooth in your

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.779 
process it until it's smooth in your
blender<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.649> then<00:01:02.890> go<00:01:03.250> ahead<00:01:03.429> and<00:01:03.519> heat<00:01:03.609> it<00:01:03.730> on

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
blender and then go ahead and heat it on

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.420 
blender and then go ahead and heat it on
the<00:01:03.850> stove<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:05.560> already<00:01:06.040> have<00:01:06.160> the<00:01:06.250> soup

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
the stove so I already have the soup

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.310 
the stove so I already have the soup
variable<00:01:07.030> chosen<00:01:07.509> so<00:01:07.630> I'm<00:01:07.750> going<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:07.930> do<00:01:08.080> is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
variable chosen so I'm going to do is

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:37.750 
variable chosen so I'm going to do is
just<00:01:08.650> uh

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.850 

okay<00:01:38.760> so<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.570> done

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
okay so it's done

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.610 
okay so it's done
again<00:01:41.520> because<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.630> Vitamix<00:01:43.110> has<00:01:43.260> a<00:01:43.290> super

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
again because my Vitamix has a super

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.620 
again because my Vitamix has a super
variable<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.160> it<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.580> had<00:01:44.850> only<00:01:44.970> process<00:01:45.480> this

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
variable on it it had only process this

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.670 
variable on it it had only process this
is<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.960> till<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.530> smooth<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:48.410> heats<00:01:49.410> it<00:01:49.560> as

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
is that till it's smooth it heats it as

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.219 
is that till it's smooth it heats it as
well<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:50.760> can<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.120> this<00:01:51.330> if<00:01:51.660> you<00:01:51.780> don't<00:01:51.960> have

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
well you can do this if you don't have

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.320 
well you can do this if you don't have
the<00:01:52.500> same<00:01:52.710> Vitamix<00:01:53.160> that<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.370> do<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.940> if<00:01:54.210> you

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
the same Vitamix that I do or if you

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.550 
the same Vitamix that I do or if you
just<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.690> another<00:01:54.900> high-powered<00:01:55.350> blender

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
just have another high-powered blender

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.400 
just have another high-powered blender
the<00:01:56.190> idea<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.030> make<00:01:57.330> sure<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
the idea is to just make sure that the

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.950 
the idea is to just make sure that the
tomatoes<00:01:59.100> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> diced<00:02:00.330> tomatoes<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
tomatoes of the diced tomatoes and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.680 
tomatoes of the diced tomatoes and
either<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:02.040> heavy<00:02:02.220> cream<00:02:02.550> or<00:02:02.880> your<00:02:03.390> Martin

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
either your heavy cream or your Martin

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.130 
either your heavy cream or your Martin
Colton<00:02:03.990> event<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:05.340> smooth<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.510> this<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:06.840> hot

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
Colton event it's smooth so this is hot

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.669 
Colton event it's smooth so this is hot
I<00:02:07.530> don't<00:02:08.100> need<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.869> put<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> stove<00:02:10.500> but

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
I don't need to put it on the stove but

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.260 
I don't need to put it on the stove but
you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.100> process<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.459> still<00:02:11.850> smooth<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you can process your still smooth and

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790 
you can process your still smooth and
then<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.540> heat<00:02:12.690> then<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> stove<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.650> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
then just heat then the stove and you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.390 
then just heat then the stove and you
can<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.190> if<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.520> steam<00:02:14.790> that's<00:02:15.090> coming<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.660> oh

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
can see if the steam that's coming up oh

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.180 
can see if the steam that's coming up oh
and<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.520> smells<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.000> good<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.890> can

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
and it smells so good just so you can

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:30.680 
and it smells so good just so you can
see<00:02:24.920> that's<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:27.890> no<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.390> pretty<00:02:30.390> deep

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
see that's it no this is a pretty deep

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.160 
see that's it no this is a pretty deep
bowl<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.520> would<00:02:32.520> say<00:02:32.670> that's<00:02:32.850> enough<00:02:33.150> for<00:02:33.510> two

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
bowl I would say that's enough for two

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:43.750 
bowl I would say that's enough for two
servings<00:02:34.380> or<00:02:34.800> two<00:02:34.950> people<00:02:35.720> don't<00:02:36.720> see<00:02:36.870> how

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.580 

mm-hmm<00:02:44.820> that's<00:02:45.510> good

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.180 

it's<00:02:49.590> really<00:02:49.799> good

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
it's really good

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.170 
it's really good
