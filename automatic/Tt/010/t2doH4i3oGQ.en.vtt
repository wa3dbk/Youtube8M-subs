rediagnosis<00:02:07.560> ons<00:02:08.190> hopkins<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.300> felt<00:02:09.539> like

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
rediagnosis ons hopkins and we felt like

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.999 
rediagnosis ons hopkins and we felt like
we<00:02:09.750> had<00:02:09.840> won<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> lottery<00:02:10.229> when<00:02:10.770> she's

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
we had won the lottery when she's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.589 
we had won the lottery when she's
diagnosed<00:02:11.400> with<00:02:11.849> spinal<00:02:11.970> muscular<00:02:12.390> atrophy

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.790 
diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy
type<00:02:13.200> 2<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.670> her<00:02:15.599> life<00:02:15.840> expectancy<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.560> far

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
type 2 so her life expectancy is far

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.890 
type 2 so her life expectancy is far
greater<00:02:16.830> than<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.459> had<00:02:17.610> anticipated

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
greater than we had anticipated

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960 
greater than we had anticipated
so<00:02:19.019> we<00:02:19.590> had<00:02:19.799> felt<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:20.579> had<00:02:20.700> won<00:02:20.849> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.420 
so we had felt like we had won the
lottery<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.560> know<00:02:22.650> my<00:02:22.829> goals<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.310> mother

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
lottery so you know my goals and mother

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.069 
lottery so you know my goals and mother
is<00:02:23.579> just<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.819> make<00:02:23.939> every<00:02:24.209> day<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.599> special<00:02:25.019> as

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
is just to make every day as special as

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.869 
is just to make every day as special as
it<00:02:25.200> possibly<00:02:25.560> could<00:02:25.829> and<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.489> this<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.849> a

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
it possibly could and and this is a

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.149 
it possibly could and and this is a
great<00:02:27.090> way<00:02:27.209> because<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.959> takes<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.590> focus<00:02:28.799> off

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
great way because it takes the focus off

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.009 
great way because it takes the focus off
of<00:02:29.220> shag<00:02:29.670> there's<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> lot<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.180> focus<00:02:30.450> always<00:02:30.870> on

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
of shag there's a lot of focus always on

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.890 
of shag there's a lot of focus always on
edge<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.709> magnet<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.540> grocery

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
edge is like a magnet and the grocery

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.380 
edge is like a magnet and the grocery
store<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.189> is<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.730> takes<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.239> focus

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
store so this is a this takes the focus

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.780 
store so this is a this takes the focus
a<00:02:36.629> little<00:02:36.720> bit<00:02:36.870> off<00:02:37.049> of<00:02:37.079> her<00:02:37.409> it<00:02:38.220> also<00:02:38.370> puts<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
a little bit off of her it also puts the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.640 
a little bit off of her it also puts the
focus<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.390> disease<00:02:39.689> because<00:02:40.109> I<00:02:40.140> think<00:02:40.439> one

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
focus on the disease because I think one

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.229 
focus on the disease because I think one
of<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.859> things<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.159> you<00:02:41.280> found<00:02:41.579> about<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.060> is

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
of the things that you found about it is

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.000 
of the things that you found about it is
that<00:02:42.269> because<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.200> people<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.769> few<00:02:43.950> people

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
that because so people so few people

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.309 
that because so people so few people
know<00:02:44.340> about<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.849> is<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.150> rare<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.750> doesn't

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
know about and it is so rare it doesn't

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.569 
know about and it is so rare it doesn't
get<00:02:46.439> not<00:02:46.680> only<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.890> attention<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
get not only the attention but the

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.429 
get not only the attention but the
funding<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.239> does<00:02:48.450> needs<00:02:48.720> yeah<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.260> doesn't

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
funding it does needs yeah it doesn't

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.839 
funding it does needs yeah it doesn't
and<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.769> is<00:02:49.890> kind<00:02:50.069> of<00:02:50.099> an<00:02:50.220> out-of-the-box

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
and this is kind of an out-of-the-box

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.839 
and this is kind of an out-of-the-box
way<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.829> subsidize<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:53.129> funding<00:02:53.579> because

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
way to subsidize that funding because

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.789 
way to subsidize that funding because
the<00:02:53.970> problem<00:02:54.389> is<00:02:54.599> there<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.349> know<00:02:55.470> if<00:02:55.650> it

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
the problem is there you know if it

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.589 
the problem is there you know if it
costs<00:02:56.099> five<00:02:56.430> million<00:02:56.670> dollars<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.239> research

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
costs five million dollars to research

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.649 
costs five million dollars to research
the<00:02:57.840> disease<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.440> only<00:02:59.159> 300<00:02:59.970> kids<00:03:00.180> have<00:03:00.450> it

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
the disease and only 300 kids have it

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:01.699 
the disease and only 300 kids have it
they're<00:03:00.989> never<00:03:01.109> going<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.379> make<00:03:01.470> their<00:03:01.620> money

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
they're never going to make their money

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.949 
they're never going to make their money
back<00:03:01.889> it's<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.159> business<00:03:02.400> decision<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:03.000> yeah

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
back it's a business decision so yeah

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.869
