00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
register it just did it right there you

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.820 
register it just did it right there you
see<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.040> T<00:04:25.220> and<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.639> H<00:04:25.669> appear<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.510> there<00:04:27.500> th

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
see the T and the H appear and there th

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.270 
see the T and the H appear and there th
worked<00:04:28.330> but<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.450> time<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:29.750> didn't<00:04:30.050> there<00:04:31.039> see

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
worked but that time it didn't there see

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.379 
worked but that time it didn't there see
it's<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:31.520> read<00:04:31.669> during<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.880> last<00:04:32.150> and

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
it's just read during the last and

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.270 
it's just read during the last and
that's<00:04:32.750> happening<00:04:33.229> because<00:04:33.380> it<00:04:33.650> thinks<00:04:34.130> I'm

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
that's happening because it thinks I'm

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.129 
that's happening because it thinks I'm
swiping<00:04:34.669> between<00:04:35.060> those<00:04:35.450> letters<00:04:35.780> just<00:04:35.960> like

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
swiping between those letters just like

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.680 
swiping between those letters just like
that<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:37.160> see<00:04:37.340> if<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.550> swipe<00:04:37.850> I'm<00:04:38.449> actually

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
that so see if I swipe I'm actually

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.450 
that so see if I swipe I'm actually
swiping<00:04:39.260> there<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.620> see<00:04:39.740> how<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:39.889> you<00:04:39.979> just<00:04:40.100> get

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
swiping there and see how I you just get

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.950 
swiping there and see how I you just get
the<00:04:40.580> age<00:04:40.760> but<00:04:41.570> if<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.720> type<00:04:41.930> th<00:04:43.660> see<00:04:44.660> I'm<00:04:44.870> only

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
the age but if I type th see I'm only

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.510 
the age but if I type th see I'm only
getting<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.289> H<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.889> could<00:04:46.039> see<00:04:46.250> that<00:04:46.370> it

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
getting the H and you could see that it

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.279 
getting the H and you could see that it
thought<00:04:46.729> I<00:04:46.760> pushed<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.419> thought<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:47.900> swiped

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
thought I pushed I thought I swiped

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.290 
thought I pushed I thought I swiped
through<00:04:48.530> tyh<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.400> thought<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:49.789> was<00:04:49.970> doing<00:04:50.090> a

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
through tyh so I thought I was doing a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.529 
through tyh so I thought I was doing a
swipe<00:04:50.600> but<00:04:51.590> in<00:04:51.770> reality<00:04:51.919> I<00:04:52.220> wasn't<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:52.880> mean<00:04:53.479> I'm

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
swipe but in reality I wasn't I mean I'm

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:54.969 
swipe but in reality I wasn't I mean I'm
hitting<00:04:53.810> both<00:04:53.960> letters<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:54.380> could<00:04:54.470> see<00:04:54.770> them

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
hitting both letters you could see them

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.430 
hitting both letters you could see them
both<00:04:55.190> appear<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:55.789> the<00:04:55.880> screen<00:04:56.240> there<00:04:56.570> but

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
both appear on the screen there but

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.339 
both appear on the screen there but
clearly<00:04:57.740> it's<00:04:58.700> only<00:04:59.030> registering<00:04:59.479> the<00:04:59.720> T<00:04:59.960> I

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
clearly it's only registering the T I

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.690 
clearly it's only registering the T I
mean<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.979> H<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.460> second<00:05:01.880> part<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:04.070> if<00:05:04.400> we<00:05:04.550> go

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
mean the H the second part so if we go

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.409 
mean the H the second part so if we go
back<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:06.200> marker<00:05:06.650> app<00:05:07.090> it's<00:05:08.090> super

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
back to the marker app it's super

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.640 
back to the marker app it's super
