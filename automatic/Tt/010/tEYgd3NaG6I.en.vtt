question has to do with feeding she says

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.120 
question has to do with feeding she says
that<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.270> not<00:00:21.359> taking<00:00:21.720> 12<00:00:22.320> hours<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
that it's not taking 12 hours for it to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.820 
that it's not taking 12 hours for it to
double<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.640> size<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.570> more<00:00:24.840> reaching<00:00:25.680> its

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
double in size it's more reaching its

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.040 
double in size it's more reaching its
peak<00:00:26.010> after<00:00:26.460> 3<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.849> 5<00:00:27.060> hours<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.869> well

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
peak after 3 to 5 hours and it is well

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.769 
peak after 3 to 5 hours and it is well
fallen<00:00:28.800> by<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.340> time<00:00:29.670> 12<00:00:30.060> hours<00:00:30.210> rolls<00:00:30.630> around

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
fallen by the time 12 hours rolls around

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.569 
fallen by the time 12 hours rolls around
so<00:00:31.260> she<00:00:31.320> wants<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> know<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:32.040> she<00:00:32.189> should<00:00:32.219> feed

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
so she wants to know if she should feed

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.850 
so she wants to know if she should feed
it<00:00:32.730> sooner<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.300> Tammy<00:00:34.050> also<00:00:34.410> has<00:00:34.559> another

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
it sooner and Tammy also has another

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.280 
it sooner and Tammy also has another
question<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:36.090> stick<00:00:36.390> around<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.809> let's

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
question so stick around for that let's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.740 
question so stick around for that let's
answer<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.710> first<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.579> now<00:00:38.850> there

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
answer the first one right now there

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.139 
answer the first one right now there
really<00:00:39.989> isn't<00:00:40.290> need<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.700> feed<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
really isn't need for you to feed the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.380 
really isn't need for you to feed the
starter<00:00:42.510> sooner<00:00:42.899> than<00:00:43.020> 12<00:00:43.320> hours<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.489> here's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
starter sooner than 12 hours but here's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.110 
starter sooner than 12 hours but here's
the<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.770> you<00:00:46.770> don't<00:00:47.010> need<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the if you don't need to do it if the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.959 
the if you don't need to do it if the
starter<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> behaving<00:00:49.410> well<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> by<00:00:50.370> behaving

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
starter is behaving well and by behaving

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.260 
starter is behaving well and by behaving
well<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.390> mean<00:00:51.649> acting<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> good<00:00:53.820> starter

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
well I mean acting like a good starter

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.490 
well I mean acting like a good starter
acts<00:00:54.510> good<00:00:55.260> normal<00:00:55.739> behavior<00:00:57.350> bubbling<00:00:58.350> up

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
acts good normal behavior bubbling up

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.939 
acts good normal behavior bubbling up
rising<00:00:59.239> being<00:01:00.239> dome-shaped<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.500> then

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
rising being dome-shaped and then

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.219 
rising being dome-shaped and then
falling<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.120> producing<00:01:03.660> hooch<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
falling down and producing hooch on a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
falling down and producing hooch on a
regular<00:01:04.710> cycle<00:01:04.949> while<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.670> continues<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
regular cycle while it continues to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.230 
regular cycle while it continues to
smell<00:01:06.750> good<00:01:07.110> it'll<00:01:07.860> smell<00:01:08.189> sour<00:01:08.580> it'll<00:01:09.030> smell

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
smell good it'll smell sour it'll smell

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.570 
smell good it'll smell sour it'll smell
a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.630> fresh<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.439> will<00:01:10.590> also<00:01:10.890> behave<00:01:11.310> well

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
a little fresh it will also behave well

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940 
a little fresh it will also behave well
when<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> bake<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.799> you're

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
when you go to bake it like if you're

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.649 
when you go to bake it like if you're
gonna<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.340> pancakes<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:15.180> something<00:01:15.540> like

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
gonna make pancakes or something like

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
gonna make pancakes or something like
that<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> starter<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.280> doing

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that so if the starter is doing

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.700 
that so if the starter is doing
everything<00:01:17.850> normally<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:19.310> that<00:01:20.310> extra<00:01:20.759> time

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
everything normally then that extra time

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
everything normally then that extra time
between<00:01:22.710> feedings<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.790> harming<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.420> in

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
between feedings is not harming it in

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.289 
between feedings is not harming it in
any<00:01:24.720> way<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> makes<00:01:26.369> sense<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.119> know

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
any way and so it makes sense you know

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.840 
any way and so it makes sense you know
if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.570> don't<00:01:27.750> need<00:01:28.020> lots<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.470> starter<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
if you don't need lots of starter to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.719 
if you don't need lots of starter to
keep<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> frugal<00:01:31.320> practice<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:32.040> feeding

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
keep up the frugal practice of feeding

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.640 
keep up the frugal practice of feeding
every<00:01:32.970> 12<00:01:33.240> hours<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.049> added<00:01:34.409> another

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
every 12 hours if you added another

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.410 
every 12 hours if you added another
feeding<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.400> had<00:01:35.579> no<00:01:35.759> use<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
feeding and you had no use for all that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.789 
feeding and you had no use for all that
starter<00:01:36.810> you're<00:01:36.930> building<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:37.619> you're

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
starter you're building up then you're

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.609 
starter you're building up then you're
just<00:01:37.979> using<00:01:38.400> flour<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.060> need<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.360> use

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
just using flour you don't need to use

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.980 
just using flour you don't need to use
now<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.400> other<00:01:41.579> side<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> coin<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
now the other side of the coin is if the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.249 
now the other side of the coin is if the
starter<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.770> doing<00:01:44.159> well<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:45.259> getting

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
starter is not doing well it's getting

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.480 
starter is not doing well it's getting
less<00:01:46.740> bubbly<00:01:47.310> over<00:01:47.729> time<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:49.009> not<00:01:50.009> smelling

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
less bubbly over time it's not smelling

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.149 
less bubbly over time it's not smelling
quite<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.119> good<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:52.470> doing<00:01:52.890> very<00:01:53.040> well

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
quite so good it's not doing very well
