that Robert the gardener wanted me to

more energy into displaying their flower
producing<00:00:57.070> nectar<00:00:57.460> because<00:00:57.610> they<00:00:57.850> want<00:00:58.089> to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
producing nectar because they want to

says I'm done this job is finished I
don't<00:01:03.400> want<00:01:03.610> any<00:01:03.790> more<00:01:04.030> bees<00:01:04.299> we've<00:01:04.750> done<00:01:04.989> the

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
don't want any more bees we've done the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.460 
don't want any more bees we've done the
job<00:01:05.940> that<00:01:06.940> tree<00:01:07.330> up<00:01:07.540> there<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.990> Sycamore

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
job that tree up there the Sycamore

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.070 
job that tree up there the Sycamore
which<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> weed<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.659> people<00:01:10.990> they

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
which is really the weed of people they

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.620 
which is really the weed of people they
can't<00:01:11.409> stand<00:01:11.830> Sycamore<00:01:12.460> but<00:01:12.940> for<00:01:13.150> bees<00:01:13.330> it

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
can't stand Sycamore but for bees it

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.870 
can't stand Sycamore but for bees it
really<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.140> great<00:01:14.409> because<00:01:14.799> they<00:01:15.310> produce<00:01:15.549> a

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
really is great because they produce a

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.390 
really is great because they produce a
lot<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.119> nectar<00:01:16.900> at<00:01:17.080> this<00:01:17.320> time<00:01:17.650> and<00:01:18.040> all<00:01:18.159> those

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
lot of nectar at this time and all those

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.690 
lot of nectar at this time and all those
candles<00:01:19.330> hanging<00:01:19.689> down<00:01:19.930> are<00:01:20.320> producing<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.460> lot

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
candles hanging down are producing a lot

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.670 
candles hanging down are producing a lot
of<00:01:22.090> honey<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:22.630> right<00:01:22.869> next<00:01:23.110> door<00:01:23.260> to<00:01:23.439> my

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
of honey and it's right next door to my

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.859 
of honey and it's right next door to my
beast<00:01:23.890> that<00:01:24.130> they're<00:01:24.280> terribly<00:01:24.700> happy<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.270> it

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
beast that they're terribly happy and it

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.359 
beast that they're terribly happy and it
may<00:01:26.020> be<00:01:26.080> one<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.530> reasons<00:01:26.860> they're<00:01:27.009> not<00:01:27.189> on

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
may be one of the reasons they're not on

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.160 
may be one of the reasons they're not on
the<00:01:27.520> apple<00:01:27.820> blossom<00:01:28.180> because<00:01:28.450> that's<00:01:28.689> nearer

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
the apple blossom because that's nearer

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.289 
the apple blossom because that's nearer
and<00:01:29.530> it's<00:01:30.189> producing<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.790> lot<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.119> honey

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
and it's producing a lot of honey

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.140 
and it's producing a lot of honey
particularly<00:01:32.290> after<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:33.220> rain<00:01:33.400> on<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.730> warm

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
particularly after the rain on a warm

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.450 
particularly after the rain on a warm
day<00:01:34.240> because<00:01:34.780> there's<00:01:35.560> been<00:01:35.740> an<00:01:35.890> evaporation

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
day because there's been an evaporation

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.210 
day because there's been an evaporation
for<00:01:36.820> on<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.090> nectar<00:01:37.300> so<00:01:37.630> it's<00:01:37.810> less<00:01:38.560> dilute

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
for on the nectar so it's less dilute

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.760 
for on the nectar so it's less dilute
with<00:01:39.430> SAP<00:01:39.730> and<00:01:40.330> it's<00:01:40.870> just<00:01:41.140> next<00:01:41.320> door<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.680> them

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
with SAP and it's just next door to them

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.730 
with SAP and it's just next door to them
and<00:01:41.920> there's<00:01:42.070> another<00:01:42.340> tree<00:01:42.640> behind<00:01:43.740> Sycamore

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
and there's another tree behind Sycamore

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.030 
and there's another tree behind Sycamore
are<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:44.980> great<00:01:45.250> source<00:01:45.490> of<00:01:45.700> nectar<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:47.380> an<00:01:47.620> urban
