show<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.619> how<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.800> install<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.490> because

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
show you how to install this because

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.480 
show you how to install this because
they<00:01:08.910> didn't<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.330> instructions<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.649> it

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
they didn't have instructions and it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.040 
they didn't have instructions and it
would<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.759> really<00:01:12.060> helped<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.929> had

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
would have really helped because I had

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.200 
would have really helped because I had
to<00:01:13.140> try<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.590> about<00:01:13.860> ten<00:01:14.160> different<00:01:14.340> ways<00:01:14.789> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to try like about ten different ways to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.419 
to try like about ten different ways to
get<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.840> install<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.160> only<00:01:17.280> one

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
get this to install and there's only one

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.260 
get this to install and there's only one
way<00:01:17.910> it<00:01:18.060> goes<00:01:18.300> on<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.890> right<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.789> check<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
way it goes on just right so check this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.419 
way it goes on just right so check this
out<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.869> course<00:01:21.899> I<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.679> no<00:01:22.920> claims<00:01:23.250> that

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
out and of course I make no claims that

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.760 
out and of course I make no claims that
this<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.660> way<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> or<00:01:25.410> they<00:01:25.590> would

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this is the way to do it or they would

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.300 
this is the way to do it or they would
say<00:01:26.039> for<00:01:26.460> any<00:01:26.640> other<00:01:26.940> thing<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.259> protect<00:01:28.830> me

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
is just how I put it on and I'm gonna

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.430 
is just how I put it on and I'm gonna
show<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.060> close-ups<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.229> should

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
show you some close-ups and that should

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.190 
show you some close-ups and that should
help<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.800> install<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:40.580> look<00:01:41.580> right<00:01:41.849> there

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.139 

they<00:01:45.770> give<00:01:46.039> you<00:01:46.219> a<00:01:46.780> little<00:01:48.579> you<00:01:49.579> know<00:01:49.759> like<00:01:50.119> a

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
they give you a little you know like a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.669 
they give you a little you know like a
bracket<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:52.130> fits<00:01:52.490> onto<00:01:52.789> your<00:01:53.119> fork<00:01:53.679> the

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
bracket that fits onto your fork the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.679 
bracket that fits onto your fork the
bracket<00:01:55.159> could<00:01:55.399> be<00:01:55.549> just<00:01:55.969> a<00:01:56.149> little<00:01:56.539> bit

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
bracket could be just a little bit

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.389 
bracket could be just a little bit
smaller<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:57.289> you'll<00:01:57.679> either<00:01:57.860> have<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.369> use

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
smaller so you'll either have to use

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.450 
smaller so you'll either have to use
shims<00:01:58.850> or<00:01:59.240> if<00:01:59.719> you<00:01:59.840> put<00:02:00.079> it<00:02:00.229> way<00:02:00.560> down<00:02:01.039> at<00:02:01.429> the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
shims or if you put it way down at the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.029 
shims or if you put it way down at the
bottom<00:02:01.579> of<00:02:02.090> your<00:02:02.299> fork<00:02:02.659> there<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.710> kind<00:02:04.009> of

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
bottom of your fork there is kind of

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.649 
bottom of your fork there is kind of
like<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.189> little<00:02:04.520> Ridge<00:02:04.729> there<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.509> makes

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
like a little Ridge there and it makes

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.840 
like a little Ridge there and it makes
it<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.049> tight<00:02:06.409> enough<00:02:06.439> now<00:02:07.369> when<00:02:07.549> you<00:02:07.670> do

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
it just tight enough now when you do

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.080 
it just tight enough now when you do
that<00:02:08.090> be<00:02:08.690> careful<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:09.380> don't<00:02:09.410> pinch<00:02:10.690> the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
that be careful you don't pinch the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.910 
that be careful you don't pinch the
speedometer<00:02:14.090> cable<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:21.260> then<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.590> have<00:02:21.739> to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
speedometer cable and then you have to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.699 
speedometer cable and then you have to
kind<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.220> tie<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:23.209> speedometer<00:02:23.900> cable<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
kind of tie the speedometer cable to the

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.190 
kind of tie the speedometer cable to the
fork<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.880> doesn't<00:02:26.209> rub<00:02:26.390> up<00:02:26.599> against<00:02:27.079> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
fork so it doesn't rub up against the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.220 
fork so it doesn't rub up against the
wheel<00:02:27.410> all<00:02:28.220> right<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:29.239> check<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.569> out<00:02:29.840> make

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
wheel all right so check that out make

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.319 
wheel all right so check that out make
sure<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.560> do<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.920> one<00:02:31.130> right<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.849> then<00:02:31.880> you

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
sure you do that one right and then you

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.890 
sure you do that one right and then you
kind<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.690> see<00:02:32.900> how<00:02:33.079> this<00:02:33.290> goes<00:02:34.480> you'll<00:02:35.480> have<00:02:35.720> to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
kind of see how this goes you'll have to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.039 
kind of see how this goes you'll have to
adjust<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.769> little<00:02:37.099> bit<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:38.420> know<00:02:38.599> kind<00:02:38.630> of

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
adjust it a little bit you know kind of

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.509 
adjust it a little bit you know kind of
you<00:02:39.950> know<00:02:40.450> adjust<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.900> doesn't<00:02:42.170> rub<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
you know adjust it so it doesn't rub the

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.020 
you know adjust it so it doesn't rub the
wheel<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:45.200> then<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.620> kind<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.190> put<00:02:46.489> it<00:02:46.849> over

little tie rod you may have to flip that
over<00:03:10.609> so<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.389> it<00:03:11.510> fits<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.260> way<00:03:13.060> forward

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
over so that it fits this way forward

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.520 
over so that it fits this way forward
and<00:03:14.500> underneath<00:03:17.230> forward<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:20.200> little<00:03:21.200> rubber

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
and underneath forward a little rubber

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.550 
and underneath forward a little rubber
stopper<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.579> underneath<00:03:23.480> that's<00:03:23.989> gonna<00:03:24.260> give

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
stopper and underneath that's gonna give

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.300 
stopper and underneath that's gonna give
you<00:03:24.739> just<00:03:25.160> enough<00:03:25.609> throw<00:03:26.889> give<00:03:27.889> you<00:03:28.010> just

you just enough throw give you just
enough<00:03:28.609> throw<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.389> that<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.690> thing<00:03:29.900> goes

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
enough throw so that this thing goes

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.170 
enough throw so that this thing goes
back<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:30.530> forth<00:03:30.769> it's<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.459> little<00:03:31.730> bit<00:03:31.849> tighter

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
back and forth it's a little bit tighter

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.460 
back and forth it's a little bit tighter
