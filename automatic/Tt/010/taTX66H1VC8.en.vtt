00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
anything on it by default some people

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.350 
anything on it by default some people
like<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:20.740> just<00:05:21.009> put<00:05:21.160> upload<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.030> squared

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
like to just put upload the squared

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.080 
like to just put upload the squared
image<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.199> let<00:05:23.770> apples<00:05:24.130> processing<00:05:24.910> anything

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
image and let apples processing anything

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.939 
image and let apples processing anything
actually<00:05:25.360> handle<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:25.870> rounding<00:05:26.229> and<00:05:26.380> then

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
actually handle the rounding and then

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.400 
actually handle the rounding and then
the<00:05:27.160> I<00:05:27.190> believe<00:05:27.760> it<00:05:27.880> gives<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.120> highlight<00:05:28.479> but

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
the I believe it gives the highlight but

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.080 
the I believe it gives the highlight but
there<00:05:29.680> is<00:05:29.830> an<00:05:29.949> option<00:05:30.130> when<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:30.550> create<00:05:30.880> those

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
there is an option when you create those

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.149 
there is an option when you create those
you<00:05:31.300> can<00:05:31.539> actually<00:05:32.669> disable<00:05:33.669> the<00:05:34.000> auto

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
you can actually disable the auto

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.800 
you can actually disable the auto
configuration<00:05:36.159> and<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:37.180> so<00:05:37.389> this<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.690> you

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
configuration and and so this is you

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.050 
configuration and and so this is you
know<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:38.590> just<00:05:38.919> gives<00:05:39.099> you<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.580> options<00:05:39.940> are

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060
