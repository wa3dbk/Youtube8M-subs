he has been fantastic and for that

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.959 
he has been fantastic and for that
reason<00:01:01.590> I've<00:01:01.949> given<00:01:02.160> him<00:01:02.219> an<00:01:02.370> overall<00:01:02.760> boost

he's taken a more of a holding midfield

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
he's taken a more of a holding midfield
role<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.409> every<00:01:07.830> game<00:01:08.070> goes<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> he<00:01:08.820> is

match fitness crazy to think he could go
so<00:02:49.290> far<00:02:49.530> for<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.799> season<00:02:50.129> without<00:02:50.220> looking<00:02:50.579> fit

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
so far for a season without looking fit

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.009 
so far for a season without looking fit
and<00:02:50.879> I<00:02:51.000> think<00:02:51.180> he<00:02:51.269> was<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.390> first<00:02:51.690> player<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
and I think he was the first player to

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.199 
and I think he was the first player to
go<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.290> 20<00:02:52.709> games<00:02:52.980> not<00:02:53.340> finishing<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.819> single

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
go like 20 games not finishing a single

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.000 
go like 20 games not finishing a single
one<00:02:54.359> of<00:02:54.390> them<00:02:54.599> but<00:02:54.780> I've<00:02:55.260> noticed<00:02:55.470> pace<00:02:55.799> down<00:02:55.950> a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
one of them but I've noticed pace down a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.860

past<00:04:07.829> has<00:04:07.950> been<00:04:08.129> exceptional<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.790> I've<00:04:08.940> also

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
past has been exceptional and I've also

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.879 
past has been exceptional and I've also
bumped<00:04:09.540> his<00:04:09.720> heading<00:04:10.019> up<00:04:10.139> because<00:04:10.410> believe<00:04:10.859> it

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
bumped his heading up because believe it

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.009 
bumped his heading up because believe it
or<00:04:11.040> not<00:04:11.190> he's<00:04:11.430> actually<00:04:11.730> scored<00:04:12.239> quite<00:04:12.629> a<00:04:12.750> few

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
or not he's actually scored quite a few

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.780 
or not he's actually scored quite a few
headers<00:04:13.319> like<00:04:13.500> four<00:04:13.829> or<00:04:13.949> five<00:04:13.980> last<00:04:14.459> season

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
headers like four or five last season

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.670 
headers like four or five last season
which<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.060> crazy<00:04:15.269> but<00:04:15.810> anyway<00:04:15.989> on<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.199> wolcott

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
which is crazy but anyway on to wolcott

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.529 
which is crazy but anyway on to wolcott
now<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.400> Wolcott<00:04:17.849> actually<00:04:18.239> had<00:04:18.389> a<00:04:18.419> really

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
now so Wolcott actually had a really

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.150 
now so Wolcott actually had a really
good<00:04:18.900> season<00:04:18.959> he's<00:04:19.560> always<00:04:19.829> been<00:04:19.949> one<00:04:20.130> of

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
good season he's always been one of

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.560 
good season he's always been one of
those<00:04:20.310> players<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:20.699> in<00:04:20.880> my<00:04:21.030> opinion<00:04:21.150> I've

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
those players that in my opinion I've

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.420 
those players that in my opinion I've
never<00:04:21.840> really<00:04:22.289> rated<00:04:22.530> until<00:04:23.039> this<00:04:23.159> year<00:04:23.219> I

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
never really rated until this year I

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.100 
never really rated until this year I
think<00:04:23.580> he's<00:04:23.880> had<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> really<00:04:24.330> good<00:04:24.539> season<00:04:24.599> and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
think he's had a really good season and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.750 
think he's had a really good season and
I<00:04:25.140> think<00:04:26.010> for<00:04:26.159> if

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
I think for if

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.070 
I think for if
finally<00:04:27.030> started<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.480> get<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.780> bit<00:04:27.960> of

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
finally started to get a bit of

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.680 
finally started to get a bit of
recognition<00:04:28.260> as<00:04:28.800> well<00:04:28.980> I<00:04:29.340> do<00:04:29.790> sometimes<00:04:30.000> finke

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
recognition as well I do sometimes finke

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.330 
recognition as well I do sometimes finke
is<00:04:30.780> overrated<00:04:31.320> by<00:04:31.440> some<00:04:31.650> people<00:04:31.770> but<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.280> do

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
is overrated by some people but I do

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.460 
is overrated by some people but I do
think<00:04:32.670> however<00:04:32.820> he<00:04:33.150> does<00:04:33.360> deserve<00:04:33.540> an<00:04:33.840> 84<00:04:34.440> on

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
think however he does deserve an 84 on

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.190 
think however he does deserve an 84 on
FIFA<00:04:34.860> after<00:04:35.520> last<00:04:35.760> season<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:36.420> I've<00:04:36.810> not<00:04:37.020> just

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
FIFA after last season so I've not just

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.840 
FIFA after last season so I've not just
pasted<00:04:37.440> down--<00:04:37.620> one<00:04:37.890> because<00:04:38.400> quite<00:04:38.790> frankly

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
pasted down-- one because quite frankly

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.690 
pasted down-- one because quite frankly
he<00:04:39.630> isn't<00:04:39.870> 96<00:04:40.440> Pacey<00:04:40.710> like<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.340> players

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
he isn't 96 Pacey like this players

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.820 
he isn't 96 Pacey like this players
quicker<00:04:42.000> than<00:04:42.120> him<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.900> Bama<00:04:43.230> yang<00:04:43.500> like

quicker than him like a Bama yang like

quicker than him like a Bama yang like
me<00:04:44.340> actually<00:04:44.580> he<00:04:45.120> is<00:04:45.210> it<00:04:45.360> he's<00:04:45.540> quick<00:04:45.840> but<00:04:46.170> he's

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
me actually he is it he's quick but he's

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.230 
me actually he is it he's quick but he's
not<00:04:46.320> insanely<00:04:46.860> quick<00:04:47.190> he's<00:04:47.730> dribbling<00:04:47.970> I've

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
not insanely quick he's dribbling I've

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.880 
not insanely quick he's dribbling I've
put<00:04:48.420> up<00:04:48.510> free<00:04:48.780> because<00:04:49.080> before<00:04:49.410> I<00:04:49.470> felt<00:04:49.830> like

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
put up free because before I felt like

put up free because before I felt like
his<00:04:50.040> dribbling<00:04:50.370> was<00:04:50.490> one<00:04:50.700> of<00:04:50.820> his<00:04:50.940> main<00:04:51.150> issues

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
his dribbling was one of his main issues

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.660 
his dribbling was one of his main issues
where<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:52.140> only<00:04:52.650> way<00:04:52.800> he<00:04:52.950> could<00:04:53.130> get<00:04:53.310> past<00:04:53.490> the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
where the only way he could get past the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.250 
where the only way he could get past the
play<00:04:53.850> was<00:04:54.060> by<00:04:54.090> knocking<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.750> past<00:04:54.960> them<00:04:55.170> and

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
play was by knocking it past them and

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.690 
play was by knocking it past them and
running<00:04:55.680> into<00:04:55.950> them<00:04:56.040> and<00:04:56.190> hoping<00:04:56.490> for<00:04:56.550> the

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
running into them and hoping for the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.270 
running into them and hoping for the
best<00:04:56.760> but<00:04:57.090> now<00:04:57.630> it<00:04:57.780> seems<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:58.080> be<00:04:58.110> it's<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.160> bit

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
best but now it seems to be it's a bit

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.740 
best but now it seems to be it's a bit
bare<00:04:59.520> with<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.880> ball<00:05:00.030> his<00:05:00.210> feet<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.510> he<00:05:00.600> can

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
bare with the ball his feet and he can

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.960 
bare with the ball his feet and he can
actually<00:05:01.170> take<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.530> past<00:05:01.740> players<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.280> bumped

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
actually take it past players I bumped

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.150 
actually take it past players I bumped
his<00:05:03.060> shooting<00:05:03.330> up<00:05:03.480> massively<00:05:04.020> 277<00:05:04.800> he<00:05:04.860> scored

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
his shooting up massively 277 he scored

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160 
his shooting up massively 277 he scored
a<00:05:05.220> lot<00:05:05.460> of<00:05:05.640> goals<00:05:05.820> this<00:05:06.000> season<00:05:06.210> particularly

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
a lot of goals this season particularly

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.420 
a lot of goals this season particularly
when<00:05:07.380> he'd<00:05:07.500> been<00:05:07.620> planning<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.040> striking

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
when he'd been planning the striking

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.460 
when he'd been planning the striking
roll<00:05:08.610> but<00:05:08.760> cutting<00:05:09.030> inside<00:05:09.360> he<00:05:09.600> scored<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:10.020> very

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
roll but cutting inside he scored a very

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.960 
roll but cutting inside he scored a very
nice<00:05:10.740> amount<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.190> gold<00:05:11.340> so<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.520> think<00:05:11.580> putting

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
nice amount of gold so I think putting

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.660 
nice amount of gold so I think putting
it<00:05:12.090> up<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.270> 77<00:05:12.810> is<00:05:13.080> very<00:05:13.710> very<00:05:13.980> fair<00:05:14.340> indeed

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
it up to 77 is very very fair indeed

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.860 
it up to 77 is very very fair indeed
considering<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.330> amount<00:05:15.420> of<00:05:15.510> players<00:05:15.690> with

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
considering the amount of players with

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.480 
considering the amount of players with
better<00:05:16.050> shot<00:05:16.320> they<00:05:16.650> scored<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:17.010> lot<00:05:17.190> less<00:05:17.340> in

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
better shot they scored a lot less in

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.190 
better shot they scored a lot less in
the<00:05:17.580> league<00:05:17.730> than<00:05:17.940> him<00:05:18.090> last<00:05:18.300> season<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:19.080> last

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
the league than him last season and last

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.690 
the league than him last season and last
but<00:05:19.320> not<00:05:19.470> least<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.830> haven't<00:05:20.100> changed<00:05:20.550> his

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
but not least I haven't changed his

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.130 
but not least I haven't changed his
heading<00:05:21.030> just<00:05:21.270> like<00:05:21.420> most<00:05:21.630> players<00:05:21.870> on<00:05:22.050> the

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
heading just like most players on the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.800 
heading just like most players on the
team<00:05:22.320> finally<00:05:23.100> we<00:05:23.310> have<00:05:23.520> Olivia's<00:05:24.030> room<00:05:24.060> now<00:05:24.600> I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
team finally we have Olivia's room now I

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.930 
team finally we have Olivia's room now I
really<00:05:25.770> really<00:05:26.010> struggled<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.460> decide<00:05:26.790> what

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
really really struggled to decide what

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.610 
really really struggled to decide what
to<00:05:27.060> do<00:05:27.180> on<00:05:27.300> this<00:05:27.390> one<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.840> spent<00:05:28.200> a<00:05:28.320> long

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
to do on this one and I spent a long

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.020 
to do on this one and I spent a long
time<00:05:28.650> really<00:05:29.220> thinking<00:05:29.550> about<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.760> and<00:05:29.970> I

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
time really thinking about it and I

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.110 
time really thinking about it and I
thought<00:05:30.560> 82<00:05:31.560> is<00:05:31.860> actually<00:05:32.370> quite<00:05:32.550> fair<00:05:32.940> when

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
thought 82 is actually quite fair when

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.030 
thought 82 is actually quite fair when

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
that Shahrukh kind of deserves that

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.310 
that Shahrukh kind of deserves that
because<00:05:41.490> he'd<00:05:41.610> be<00:05:42.030> he<00:05:42.480> hasn't<00:05:42.750> been<00:05:42.870> amazing

because he'd be he hasn't been amazing

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.660 
because he'd be he hasn't been amazing
he<00:05:43.380> hasn't<00:05:43.410> set<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.890> world<00:05:44.070> on<00:05:44.160> fire<00:05:44.220> but<00:05:44.550> he

overall I bumped his pace up by one he's
just<00:05:59.340> seemed<00:05:59.550> to<00:05:59.670> be<00:05:59.790> a<00:05:59.820> bit<00:06:00.030> more<00:06:00.120> athletic

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
just seemed to be a bit more athletic

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.820 
just seemed to be a bit more athletic
the<00:06:00.660> season<00:06:00.990> he's<00:06:01.140> got<00:06:01.350> into<00:06:01.530> better<00:06:01.710> shape

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
the season he's got into better shape

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.590

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
he's dribbling I've put up free he's

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.660 
he's dribbling I've put up free he's
been<00:06:03.780> fantastic<00:06:04.470> holding<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:04.890> ball<00:06:05.100> up<00:06:05.250> that

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
been fantastic holding the ball up that

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.950 
been fantastic holding the ball up that
has<00:06:05.790> basically<00:06:06.120> been<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.450> main<00:06:06.630> thing<00:06:06.870> he's

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
has basically been the main thing he's

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.030 
has basically been the main thing he's
been<00:06:07.110> good<00:06:07.260> at<00:06:07.410> it<00:06:07.500> when<00:06:07.620> we've<00:06:07.740> knocked<00:06:07.920> the

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
been good at it when we've knocked the

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.680 
been good at it when we've knocked the
ball<00:06:08.160> up<00:06:08.340> to<00:06:08.460> him<00:06:08.580> he<00:06:08.700> has<00:06:08.910> been<00:06:09.150> able<00:06:09.330> to<00:06:09.540> keep

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
ball up to him he has been able to keep

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.750 
ball up to him he has been able to keep
hold<00:06:09.960> of<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:10.200> for<00:06:10.590> a<00:06:10.620> little<00:06:10.800> while<00:06:11.040> which<00:06:11.580> is

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
hold of it for a little while which is

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.070 
hold of it for a little while which is
really<00:06:12.090> quite<00:06:12.330> important<00:06:12.810> when<00:06:12.930> you're<00:06:13.020> a

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
really quite important when you're a

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.960 
really quite important when you're a
lone<00:06:13.260> striker<00:06:13.590> I<00:06:13.920> shoot<00:06:14.250> enough<00:06:14.460> but<00:06:14.610> one<00:06:14.940> I

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
lone striker I shoot enough but one I

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.760 
lone striker I shoot enough but one I
think<00:06:15.240> he's<00:06:15.360> had<00:06:15.510> a<00:06:15.540> few<00:06:15.870> really<00:06:16.200> good<00:06:16.290> chances

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
think he's had a few really good chances

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.230 
think he's had a few really good chances
at<00:06:16.920> the<00:06:17.010> same<00:06:17.160> time<00:06:17.310> he<00:06:17.460> has<00:06:17.580> wasted<00:06:17.820> a<00:06:18.090> lot<00:06:18.120> of

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
at the same time he has wasted a lot of

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.790 
at the same time he has wasted a lot of
chances<00:06:18.600> but<00:06:18.840> there's<00:06:19.320> nothing<00:06:19.560> you<00:06:19.650> can

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
chances but there's nothing you can

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.440 
chances but there's nothing you can
really<00:06:19.830> do<00:06:20.130> about<00:06:20.160> that<00:06:20.340> defense<00:06:21.060> I've<00:06:21.240> kept

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
really do about that defense I've kept

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.970 
really do about that defense I've kept
the<00:06:21.510> same<00:06:21.690> and<00:06:21.870> his<00:06:21.960> passing<00:06:22.380> I<00:06:22.500> bumped<00:06:22.830> up

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
the same and his passing I bumped up

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.950 
the same and his passing I bumped up
five<00:06:23.400> because<00:06:23.730> again<00:06:24.030> with<00:06:24.570> him<00:06:24.690> being<00:06:24.810> the

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
five because again with him being the

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.480 
five because again with him being the
lone<00:06:25.110> striker<00:06:25.350> it<00:06:25.560> seems<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:25.830> lot<00:06:26.010> the<00:06:26.130> time<00:06:26.370> the

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
lone striker it seems a lot the time the

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.340 
lone striker it seems a lot the time the
ball<00:06:26.700> goes<00:06:26.880> up<00:06:27.060> to<00:06:27.180> him<00:06:27.300> he<00:06:27.570> like<00:06:27.750> controls<00:06:28.200> the

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
ball goes up to him he like controls the

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.050 
ball goes up to him he like controls the
ball<00:06:28.470> down<00:06:28.710> and<00:06:28.860> then<00:06:29.040> plays<00:06:29.520> it<00:06:29.730> off<00:06:29.850> to<00:06:30.030> the

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
ball down and then plays it off to the

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.430 
ball down and then plays it off to the
winger's<00:06:30.480> and<00:06:30.600> I<00:06:30.630> think<00:06:30.810> his<00:06:30.900> passing<00:06:31.320> has

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
winger's and I think his passing has

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.990 
winger's and I think his passing has
actually<00:06:31.710> been<00:06:31.800> quite<00:06:31.950> impressive<00:06:32.460> and<00:06:32.580> same

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
actually been quite impressive and same

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
actually been quite impressive and same
with<00:06:33.030> his<00:06:33.240> head<00:06:33.390> enough<00:06:33.600> bumped<00:06:33.840> up<00:06:33.990> one

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
with his head enough bumped up one

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.750 
with his head enough bumped up one
because<00:06:34.410> he<00:06:34.500> is<00:06:34.590> one<00:06:34.770> a<00:06:34.920> lot<00:06:35.130> of<00:06:35.310> headers<00:06:35.610> now

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
because he is one a lot of headers now

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.540 
because he is one a lot of headers now
and<00:06:36.000> I<00:06:36.450> don't<00:06:36.600> a<00:06:36.840> writ<00:06:37.020> reiterate<00:06:37.740> guys<00:06:37.950> this
