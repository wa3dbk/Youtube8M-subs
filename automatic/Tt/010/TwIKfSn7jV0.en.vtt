everyone if you've watched my videos for
a<00:00:02.700> while<00:00:02.850> especially<00:00:03.030> my<00:00:03.419> tech<00:00:03.659> ones<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:04.140> know

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
a while especially my tech ones you know

a while especially my tech ones you know
I'm<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.440> big<00:00:04.680> Synology<00:00:05.370> nas<00:00:05.700> fan<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.960> I'm<00:00:07.080> just

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
I'm a big Synology nas fan and I'm just

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.169 
I'm a big Synology nas fan and I'm just
getting<00:00:07.560> into<00:00:07.799> using<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.460> surveillance

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
getting into using this surveillance

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.870 
getting into using this surveillance
station<00:00:10.099> functionality<00:00:11.099> with<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.700> in

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
station functionality with it in

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.230 
station functionality with it in
basically<00:00:12.330> what<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:13.460> this<00:00:14.460> icon<00:00:14.730> down

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
basically what that is is this icon down

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.510 
basically what that is is this icon down
here<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.170> basically<00:00:16.650> allows<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.460> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
here and it's basically allows you to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.590 
here and it's basically allows you to
control<00:00:17.910> multiple<00:00:18.750> IP<00:00:19.560> cameras<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.880> use

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
control multiple IP cameras and use

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.429 
control multiple IP cameras and use
motion<00:00:22.020> detection<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.400> know<00:00:23.430> level<00:00:24.119> of

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
motion detection is a you know level of

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.220 
motion detection is a you know level of
security<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.830> your<00:00:26.160> area<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.019> just<00:00:28.019> it's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
security for your area and just it's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.470 
security for your area and just it's
just<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.529> fun<00:00:28.769> thing<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:29.189> doing<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.849> playing

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
just a fun thing I'm doing just playing

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.370 
just a fun thing I'm doing just playing
with<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.050> figuring<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.800> out<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> overall<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
with it figuring it out but so overall I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
with it figuring it out but so overall I
think<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.829> analogy<00:00:35.250> stuff<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.760> awesome<00:00:36.000> but

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
think this analogy stuff is awesome but

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.540 
think this analogy stuff is awesome but
the<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.989> thing<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.860> read<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.370> bit

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the one thing if you read a little bit

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.700 
the one thing if you read a little bit
about<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.000> stuff<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.719> negative<00:00:40.290> this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
about this stuff the one negative this

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.220 
about this stuff the one negative this
analogy<00:00:41.070> always<00:00:41.370> gets<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.910> they<00:00:42.750> only<00:00:42.870> include

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
analogy always gets is they only include

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.670 
analogy always gets is they only include
one<00:00:43.489> surveillance<00:00:44.489> station<00:00:45.350> license<00:00:46.350> in

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
one surveillance station license in

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
top it off not only is the camera

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.730 
top it off not only is the camera
licensing<00:01:25.979> expensive<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.439> can't

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
licensing expensive it's just you can't

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.859 
licensing expensive it's just you can't
order<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> online<00:01:29.610> basically<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.689> get

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
order it online basically and get

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.550 
order it online basically and get
immediate<00:01:31.939> license<00:01:32.939> code<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.380> order

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
immediate license code you have to order

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.609 
immediate license code you have to order
it<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:34.950> Amazon<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.820> wherever<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.350> wait<00:01:37.350> for

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
it there Amazon or wherever and wait for

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
it there Amazon or wherever and wait for
a<00:01:37.650> physical<00:01:38.369> package<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.939> show<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
a physical package to show up with a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.370 
a physical package to show up with a
single<00:01:39.840> number<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.960> expensive

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
single number on it so it's expensive

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.179 
single number on it so it's expensive
and<00:01:43.829> slow<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.119> recently<00:01:45.329> found<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.259> website

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and slow and I recently found a website

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.060 
and slow and I recently found a website
through<00:01:47.820> lots<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.329> searching<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.070> it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
through lots of searching that it's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.010 
through lots of searching that it's
slightly<00:01:50.430> cheaper<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.299> still<00:01:51.630> expensive

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
slightly cheaper it's still expensive

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.490 
slightly cheaper it's still expensive
but<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:53.070> about<00:01:53.329> $50<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
but it's about $50 and you can get it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.690 
but it's about $50 and you can get it
the<00:01:55.890> code<00:01:56.670> license<00:01:57.329> code<00:01:57.570> over<00:01:57.899> email<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
the code license code over email and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.969 
the code license code over email and
it's<00:01:59.700> not<00:01:59.909> instant<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.810> usually<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.229> 24<00:02:01.860> hour

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
it's not instant it's usually a 24 hour

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.510 
it's not instant it's usually a 24 hour
turnaround<00:02:02.869> but<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.049> better<00:02:04.229> than<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.860> week

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
turnaround but it's better than a week

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.089 
turnaround but it's better than a week
or<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.850> waiting<00:02:06.149> for<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.619> license<00:02:07.619> code<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
sheet of paper

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.729 
sheet of paper
five<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.129> ten<00:02:11.310> more<00:02:11.489> dollars<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.530> am

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
five to ten more dollars for it so I am
