broken<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:51.180> could<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.840> little<00:00:52.289> bit

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
broken in it could be a little bit

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.299 
broken in it could be a little bit
softer<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.480> it<00:00:54.480> definitely<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.230> game<00:00:56.039> ready

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

I've<00:01:00.750> been<00:01:00.960> wondering<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> these<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I've been wondering one of these for a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.350 
I've been wondering one of these for a
while<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.579> pretty<00:01:02.969> stoked<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
while so I was pretty stoked to get it

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.780 
while so I was pretty stoked to get it
it<00:01:06.360> has<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:07.020> untied<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> pinky<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.400> thumb

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it has I untied the pinky and thumb

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.950 
it has I untied the pinky and thumb
loops<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.060> got<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.450> nice<00:01:12.689> shape

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
loops and it's got a really nice shape

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
loops and it's got a really nice shape
going<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.070> slight<00:01:14.580> double<00:01:15.060> flare

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
going with the slight double flare

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.460 
going with the slight double flare
nothing<00:01:16.170> too<00:01:16.380> extreme<00:01:16.979> um<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.780> yeah<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
nothing too extreme um so yeah this I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.080 
nothing too extreme um so yeah this I
guess<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.920> could<00:01:20.100> technically<00:01:20.580> call<00:01:20.880> my

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
guess you could technically call my

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.469 
guess you could technically call my
infield<00:01:21.570> gamer<00:01:22.369> but<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:24.060> play

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
infield gamer but I really don't play

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.800 
infield gamer but I really don't play
the<00:01:24.900> infield<00:01:25.110> anymore<00:01:25.770> I'm<00:01:26.549> pretty<00:01:27.030> much<00:01:27.210> only

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the infield anymore I'm pretty much only

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.990 
the infield anymore I'm pretty much only
catching<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.439> playing<00:01:28.650> first<00:01:28.950> base<00:01:29.159> well<00:01:29.970> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
catching or playing first base well I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.899 
catching or playing first base well I
