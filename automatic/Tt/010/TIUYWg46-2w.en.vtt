00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.420
 video 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.130
 today November 22 , 2013 the xbox one has 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.260
 reached the shelves of all the stores 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.480
 and in this video we see precisely 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.139
 the unboxing of the day one edition 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.240
 proposes a thematic joystick and then a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.630
 fifa 14 in. download code 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.119
 xbox version its ok so this is the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.650
 fairly large package before 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.779
 a consona banks the console 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.609
 obviously of a good size 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.920
 the more we remember is the larger of the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.469
 direct competitor playstation 4 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.649
 therefore the packaging is identical to that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.950
 virtually normal one from the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.590
 one event and consists of a courageous one 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:47.579
 therefore we remove the culture made 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:54.059
 this we have the package from behind 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:57.899
 it will be said and can therefore be opened 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.469
 we find the first thing we find ourselves 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.150
 front and let's show it is the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:10.740
 kinect kent 2.0 also enough 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:18.000
 grandicello then we open the first one 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:22.100
 compartment we find the led set the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:29.460
 code to download fifa 14 in version 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:34.619
 xbox juan then quick start guide a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:40.400
 sticker with xbox logo then we see 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.400
 a little bit code I need to cut 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 cot 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:55.010
 but since nobody says there is a 14 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.130
 days of count vabbÃ¨ 3 2 1 be then 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.420
 code for 14 two weeks trial of 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.410
 xbox live gold in short between this 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.430
 battlefield and what you go out practically 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:12.380
 almost a month of free subscription then 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:17.060
 other codes but that spike then change well 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:23.540
 321 via another xbox one code that gives us 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:31.459
 access to a I believe the fuck is fucking us 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:34.700
 of types or I knew 321 then more 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.680
 code that takes c from the goal 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.970
 unlocked to have bought the xbox at 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.700
 launching 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.060
 so nothing of particular sensor 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:49.550
 Kinect kinect sensor guide to browse 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.070
 good manual then dig here between cable and 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.630
 feeder we have what it concerns 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.690
 then the console power supply 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.450
 power supply as always as for the xbox 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.700
 360 external to the console and then 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.970
 cable from the power supply to the socket of 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.970
 current 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.220
 we take the kinect from the inside 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.300
 of the package even if there is now the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.420
 cable on the back here it is 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.620
 the dedicated compartment opens 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.590
 so we have kinect here it is then 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.760
 as said, quite large 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.220
 these are more or less sizes then 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.610
 ok cable with proprietary port with 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.989
 annexed also small door here it is for 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.989
 connect it to the console 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.090
 ok 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.190
 we can also kinect 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.870
 finally we find before the console 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.120
 real that is found in the room 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.030
 lower 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.540
 we have the discrete hdmi cable length 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.160
 not very long not very short and then 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.129
 finally the joystick of the new xbox one 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.810
 what I remember was perfected for 40 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.989
 different aspects to offer comfort 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.980
 greater during the game session is 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.980
 a better grip on the pad 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.730
 therefore for which we find the batteries 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.700
 22 the cell as usual the pad 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.859
 here it is day edition 2013 I don't know 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.460
 if you read or a little bit 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.210
 here it is they have to put just say 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.760
 with the consoles precisely edition of wan e 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.630
 he took a little bit 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.040
 get used to the new provision on 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.910
 joystick though having also played up 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.919
 xbox 360 we say that the passage is not 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.320
 neither short nor long in a short time there 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.260
 get used to the triggers are different now 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.350
 they are impulse and are managed in a manner 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.669
 different shiny part at the top and part 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.830
 opaque at the bottom practically never key 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.860
 then new keys this nostar the disc 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.090
 back cross directional ok the rest 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.010
 more or less the same part of course 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.440
 also the improvements as far as 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:07.349
 regards the analogue levers 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:10.860
 perfect that said let's move on to the real 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.690
 and its console said console 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.300
 therefore we find ourselves before 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:22.410
 front the ignition button a 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.050
 touch go disk button 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.260
 disc ejection 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.620
 then on top of the console 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.270
 we have a division between space 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.430
 for territory therefore for the spillage 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.669
 air and shiny space with the 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:43.349
 wording xbox then left side of the 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.180
 console we find a USB 3.0 port ad 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.960
 high speed button then for the 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.849
 joystick synchronization or the side 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.050
 right other slits for the spillage 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.440
 of air 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.669
 and ok, opaque and behind we find that 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.009
 that actually offers us the console 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.569
 which offers to be a center of 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.780
 detention then only one 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.360
 so we have two hdmi ports the first one is 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.979
 for the output signal and then there is 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.180
 that's the entry here like this 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.509
 we can also see another video 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.199
 connect sky decoder or decoder 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.199
 DTT 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.500
 then as first we have the one for 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.479
 power supply output for audio 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.190
 digital two other usb ports that if not 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.539
 I'm always mistaken for 3.0 leads 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.969
 kinect owns other door 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:34.080
 owner and finally ethernet socket 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:36.449
 for connection to the network stopped 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.009
 considering that this console we remember is 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.169
 compatible with all wifi standards 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.060
 come out now so you won't have 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:45.900
 problems also to set it at the level of 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.060
 perfect connection that said 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.719
 unboxing and console ends here 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.449
 I stay on the playlist on the channel for 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:55.800
 all videos about the xbox one with 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:57.750
 ethan boxing you want later on 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.190
 even the gameplay is all that 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.370
 concerns precisely the new console of 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.080
 home microsoft 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.009
 before remembering as usual

 vote for the video etcetera 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.309
 I anticipate that you can find topics 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:14.689
 discussion on the console 

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:18.610
 information on the xbox.com site on which 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:21.020
 find xbox themed articles that too 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.099
 obviously a profound one 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.689
 deepening all the news 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:26.809
