have<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.250> little<00:02:05.399> slot<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:05.850> there<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
have that little slot right there on the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.990 
have that little slot right there on the
back<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:07.409> we're<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.160> just

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
back and what we're going to do is just

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.910 
back and what we're going to do is just
slide<00:02:09.569> our<00:02:09.750> phone<00:02:09.989> right<00:02:10.229> into<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.800> like

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
slide our phone right into it just like

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.730 
slide our phone right into it just like
that<00:02:11.250> BAM

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
that BAM

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.620 
that BAM
and<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.220> lines<00:02:13.490> up<00:02:13.790> directly<00:02:14.060> with<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
and that lines up directly with the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.870 
and that lines up directly with the
camera<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.380> can<00:02:15.530> see<00:02:15.680> right<00:02:15.710> here<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
camera as you can see right here the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.670 
camera as you can see right here the
camera<00:02:17.270> lines<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.690> perfectly<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.470> lens

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
camera lines up perfectly in the lens

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.820 
camera lines up perfectly in the lens
and<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.910> if<00:02:20.180> we<00:02:20.330> want<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.600> switch<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.960> lens<00:02:21.170> he

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
and so if we want to switch the lens he

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.890 
and so if we want to switch the lens he
can<00:02:21.980> just<00:02:22.160> flip<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.490> around<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.060> there<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.840> go

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
can just flip it around and there you go

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.260 
can just flip it around and there you go
now<00:02:24.230> we<00:02:24.290> have<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.530> different<00:02:24.950> lens<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.370> there<00:02:25.610> so

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
now we have a different lens on there so

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.900 
now we have a different lens on there so
that's<00:02:26.600> what's<00:02:26.900> cool<00:02:27.140> about<00:02:27.200> olloclip<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.610> it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
that's what's cool about olloclip is it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.470 
that's what's cool about olloclip is it
provides<00:02:29.920> versatility<00:02:30.920> as<00:02:31.250> far<00:02:31.490> as<00:02:31.640> having

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
provides versatility as far as having

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.810 
provides versatility as far as having
camera<00:02:32.900> lenses<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.950> it's<00:02:34.100> easy<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.460> come<00:02:34.700> on

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
camera lenses and it's easy to come on

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.700 
camera lenses and it's easy to come on
and<00:02:34.970> off<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.240> then<00:02:35.330> if<00:02:35.390> we<00:02:35.480> unscrew<00:02:35.960> this

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710
