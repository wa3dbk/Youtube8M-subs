couldn't<00:02:24.069> be<00:02:24.280> human<00:02:24.909> being<00:02:25.180> doing<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.079> if

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
couldn't be human being doing this if

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.740 
couldn't be human being doing this if
it's<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.799> human<00:02:27.189> being<00:02:27.400> having<00:02:28.000> done<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.420> it's

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
it's a human being having done this it's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.979 
it's a human being having done this it's
a<00:02:28.900> genius<00:02:29.349> really<00:02:29.860> because<00:02:30.489> it's<00:02:30.760> i<00:02:31.000> think<00:02:31.720> it

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
a genius really because it's i think it

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.949 
a genius really because it's i think it
was<00:02:32.319> about<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.829> hundred<00:02:33.159> meters<00:02:33.760> long<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
was about a hundred meters long and the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.410 
was about a hundred meters long and the
surface<00:02:35.409> that<00:02:35.620> were<00:02:35.980> exactly<00:02:36.670> made<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.269> it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
surface that were exactly made and it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.770 
surface that were exactly made and it
was<00:02:37.780> really<00:02:38.230> beautiful<00:02:38.430> our<00:02:39.780> investigative

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
was really beautiful our investigative

began with a land survey to determine if

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.270 
began with a land survey to determine if
the<00:02:50.859> circles<00:02:51.280> could<00:02:51.459> possibly<00:02:52.000> be<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.510> hoax

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
the circles could possibly be a hoax

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.789 
the circles could possibly be a hoax
she'll<00:02:54.280> fake<00:02:54.519> them<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.239> would<00:02:55.480> really<00:02:55.900> align

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
she'll fake them you would really align

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.250 
she'll fake them you would really align
them<00:02:57.159> with<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.819> trend<00:02:58.120> lines<00:02:58.359> but<00:02:58.959> they<00:02:59.139> are

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
them with the trend lines but they are

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.050 
them with the trend lines but they are
not<00:02:59.409> an<00:02:59.590> alignment<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.250> trend<00:03:00.609> lines<00:03:00.819> and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
not an alignment to the trend lines and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.780 
not an alignment to the trend lines and
it<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.720> exactly<00:03:02.290> in<00:03:02.500> an<00:03:02.620> east-west<00:03:03.159> alignment

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
it is exactly in an east-west alignment

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.270 
it is exactly in an east-west alignment
and<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.269> really<00:03:05.049> guide<00:03:05.590> me<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.069> conclusion

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and so really guide me to the conclusion

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.699 
and so really guide me to the conclusion
but<00:03:06.790> we<00:03:06.940> have<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.180> real<00:03:07.450> phenomenon<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.260> that
