00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.370
 a notch above it will be the heads of 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.050
 sam series was proposed by the 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.330
 parliament then him 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.460
 is there added nor choice he uses that 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.130
 in tennis the killer has caught two 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.040
 elected and the seeded will be who 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.730
 so that will be the case what did ricco 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.700
 give up that was 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.530
 list of ten years number 2 then I 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.090
 put abdullah and his first show little 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.780
 people that's a very player 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.150
 competitive 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.140
 I will pass the seed and then 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.420
 I got a clown myself too 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.650
 become at the organizer 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.540
 so that will be the flat and two series 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.040
 is captured from these new places and a 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.800
 notch above the 8 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.840
 now there are the eight all the way down and 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.830
 above we will place a word each 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.410
 box see one seed per match 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.940
 then ben I took to do first 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.080
 the seeds of which we can see 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:32.220
 that she is 4 in so I started 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.100
 co2 funeral helmet and abdoulaye and 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.840
 then I know planned the 8 who 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.400
 remain whether the year transfers 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.960
 two teeth and will draw the eight for 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.330
 see what will be the matches and 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.250
 culture then of a new part of the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.840
 gains we will already shoot the first head 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.420
 serial the small road to note is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.070
 that in every ball 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.120
 I put the normal names but I know 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.830
 that they have from them like that I can have 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.000
 the placemen suppose that the key moment 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.920
 of his sees anything certainly a little 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.970
 transparent but to get a 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.970
 good time to go 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.720
 my first head first tdc body 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.100
 place on the left I draw for 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.840
 know how I will not jump from his 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.310
 valley rays from first place to 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.920
 place valence then promise maybe two 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:16.110
 cells in place and left then that's it 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:20.100
 will it be that it would not be it will be me 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.380
 would prefer to have in this moment plays 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.360
 not my fits in first head of 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.930
 series 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:31.780
 a seed we are going to sort 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:40.200
