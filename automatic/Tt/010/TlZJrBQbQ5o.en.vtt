00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
with Matchbox cars actually there was a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.470 
with Matchbox cars actually there was a
time<00:00:19.470> when<00:00:19.770> when<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> wanted<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.730> become<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> car

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
time when when I wanted to become a car

time when when I wanted to become a car
design<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.830> very<00:00:23.779> very<00:00:24.779> hard<00:00:25.080> thing

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
design it it is a very very hard thing

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:35.770 
design it it is a very very hard thing
to<00:00:25.350> become<00:00:25.769> especially<00:00:26.519> when<00:00:26.699> you're<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:26.970> time

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.110

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
because the collectors usually have not
