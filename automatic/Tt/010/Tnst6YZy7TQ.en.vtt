00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.240
 car 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.660
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.660
 roo 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:21.660
 Tteyuu next two steps in Japan in a typical step of the house that I'll use the now down 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.770
 There is a step called by name , but it is a bit 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.620
 I want to give a lecture 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.460
 First of all, from the right foot 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.130
 Take your foot out one step 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.940
 Just a step behind 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.649
 I intend to step into it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:46.700
 The third leg is bring the foot in front of him to the cross in front of you 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.700
 Put the foot out on the other side as well and lower it slightly 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.829
 Cross the foot 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.200
 It is this movement that says this Meet 1 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.690
 Ssu 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.920
 Wow 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.470
 Tsuntsu 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.790
 1 2 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.250
 Movement of 1 Ettsu' child will be the basic 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.560
 The point is 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.890
 Foot 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:20.800
 Anxiety as much as possible when making it cross 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:22.290
 2 such Fu to the possible direction of the little body with using the waist walk eyes is not a crab crotch 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.380
 Change 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.470
 I think that is quite good in the pose 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.510
 Take your feet out and twist your body 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.220
 Take your legs out and twist your body 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:42.260
 Get your feet out to the world and twist your body 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:48.640
 At this time when you put your legs out and twist your body , don't go to the twist with so much body alone 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.640
 I think it works well if you change the direction of the body from the waist 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.440
 The movement is based on this and then goes down to this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.360
 Go down and down 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.360
 Team 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.880
 Team 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.990
 Use Dan knees softly 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.289
 Relax on the rhythm I just went 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.819
 While bouncing 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.819
 Go take this step 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.660
 9 points 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:39.020
 The booboo says 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:44.100
 Oh 2 Oh 2 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.590
 Walk pomp and pomp pomp 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.960
 So as not to cut rhythm to relax the knee 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:56.590
 I keep watching my feet 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:03:01.520
 Yes points but I have a place where 81 does not go that well well 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.870
 Even though the foot is a walk , the rhythm continues like this 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.870
 Little is suspended in the foot 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.680
 3rd floor 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:14.819
 There is a case that it bounces like this, but here 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.300
 House is the speed is fast a little faster Jeanne to bpm 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.430
 Because it is dance 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.230
 This rhythm of this basic of here 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.060
 I think that it is the point that it can not be caught on the foot mainly on this rhythm person 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.959
 I think it's a bit difficult 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.200
 I think it will fit to the Humor Court if you get this done Hit it again once 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.250
 Ah know one-two 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.250
 2 waiting for Sue 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.010
 Ah ah ah
