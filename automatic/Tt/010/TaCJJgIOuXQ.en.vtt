00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.690
 i 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.330
 Hello 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.460
 this school Cecilia sees the 4th 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.479
 conference as a middle-aged 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.210
 environment 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.880
 me and my friends decided to make 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.299
 school, I'm sitting 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.690
 It seems impossible, but not for us to be. 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:23.490
 an ecologically sustainable choice 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.830
 we need to focus on development 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.420
 do not respect our planet in the present 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.119
 and satisfying human needs 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.069
 without compromising the future of land and 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.810
 our next generations 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.369
 we start with projects of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.929
 sustainability in the game 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.060
 here in Scotland we stop the leader 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.369
 We also created agenda 21 in the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.380
 geography 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.200
 another way of thinking about the future of 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.049
 our generations are building death 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.319
 I tried like we did 8,900 with account 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.959
 lucas how it all started first 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.289
 We clean the grounds and we 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:06.899
 we surround the garden we put up 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.899
 there fried and then we started to plant 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.460
 I'll tell you why we chose a 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.310
 Organic vegetable gardening is a type of poison 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.740
 because we think that a vegetable garden 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.770
 is better for health 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.810
 because poison is not used in the two 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.210
 we can use natural alternatives 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.910
 as we used here in the garden the 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.870
 castor oil that serves to scare them away 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.700
 17 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.770
 in the case of our view a vegetable garden 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.080
 organic people can not use pesticides 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.450
 so we use these natural poisons 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.700
 here in love that has at least seven 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.600
 organs visited some and we were also 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.730
 know some aspects by fans 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.320
 Ariosto is very important to the city. 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.320
 we learned a little bit this 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.959
 ie ii 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.330
 we use cultural water and poison and the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.650
 Table organic fertilizer carried 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.830
 with food 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.009
 We throw dung leaves water and leave 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.009
 good 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.010
 we hope to cooperate with one of the 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.050
 tried with our race at the conference 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.270
 the commitment not to leave with 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.370
 the door of the house and we also started 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.370
 produce organic fertilizer at school
