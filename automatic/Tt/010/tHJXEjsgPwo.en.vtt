speak<00:00:00.510> on<00:00:01.100> Jack<00:00:02.100> or<00:00:02.669> XLR<00:00:03.620> in<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.770> video<00:00:05.069> we're

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
speak on Jack or XLR in this video we're

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.639 
speak on Jack or XLR in this video we're
looking<00:00:05.700> at<00:00:05.819> which<00:00:06.240> which<00:00:06.870> are<00:00:07.049> these<00:00:07.140> cables

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
looking at which which are these cables

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.680 
looking at which which are these cables
is<00:00:08.220> probably<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.790> best<00:00:08.940> one<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.300> hook<00:00:09.480> up<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
is probably the best one to hook up the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.720 
is probably the best one to hook up the
speakers<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> look<00:00:11.219> at<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.370> pros<00:00:11.550> and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
speakers with a look at the pros and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.999 
speakers with a look at the pros and
cons<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.090> each<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:13.080> different<00:00:13.349> factors<00:00:13.559> what

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
cons of each the different factors what

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.200 
cons of each the different factors what
makes<00:00:14.219> them<00:00:14.340> different<00:00:14.519> why<00:00:14.910> are<00:00:14.969> they

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
makes them different why are they

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.340 
makes them different why are they
different<00:00:15.360> why<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:15.870> they<00:00:16.080> even<00:00:16.109> have

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
different why do they even have

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.250 
different why do they even have
different<00:00:17.330> different<00:00:18.330> cables<00:00:18.840> why<00:00:18.990> couldn't

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
different different cables why couldn't

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.890 
different different cables why couldn't
they<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.770> universal<00:00:20.070> one<00:00:20.720> so<00:00:21.720> first

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
they have just a universal one so first

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.939 
they have just a universal one so first
of<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.140> we're<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> take<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> look<00:00:22.710> at

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
of all we're going to take a look at

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.200 
of all we're going to take a look at
these<00:00:23.130> speak<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.699> cable

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.939 

now<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.689> good<00:00:28.869> thing<00:00:28.990> about<00:00:29.020> speak<00:00:29.410> on<00:00:29.619> is

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
now the good thing about speak on is

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.330 
now the good thing about speak on is
straight<00:00:30.910> away<00:00:31.119> on<00:00:31.390> its<00:00:31.960> appearance<00:00:32.290> it's<00:00:33.160> got

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
straight away on its appearance it's got

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.979 
straight away on its appearance it's got
this<00:00:33.430> blue<00:00:33.790> little<00:00:34.300> tightening<00:00:34.750> here<00:00:34.900> which

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
this blue little tightening here which

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.540 
this blue little tightening here which
obviously<00:00:35.110> up<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.710> Cape<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:36.130> place<00:00:36.340> and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
obviously up to the Cape and place and

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.390 
obviously up to the Cape and place and
make<00:00:36.670> sure<00:00:36.700> isn't<00:00:36.970> get<00:00:37.450> pulled<00:00:37.660> out<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:39.100> if

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
make sure isn't get pulled out but if

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.360 
make sure isn't get pulled out but if
you've<00:00:39.700> got<00:00:39.730> bag<00:00:40.120> full<00:00:40.360> of<00:00:40.420> cables<00:00:40.900> that<00:00:41.079> will

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
you've got bag full of cables that will

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.580 
you've got bag full of cables that will
straightaway<00:00:42.660> identify<00:00:43.660> this<00:00:43.720> cable<00:00:44.320> from<00:00:44.440> of

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
straightaway identify this cable from of

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.680 
straightaway identify this cable from of
the<00:00:44.769> rest<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.160> other<00:00:45.340> cables<00:00:45.730> you<00:00:45.790> have<00:00:45.820> unless

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
the rest of other cables you have unless

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.410 
the rest of other cables you have unless
you've<00:00:46.900> got<00:00:47.019> some<00:00:47.260> blue<00:00:47.379> XLR<00:00:47.830> cables<00:00:48.280> or<00:00:48.489> power

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
you've got some blue XLR cables or power

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.840 
you've got some blue XLR cables or power
cables<00:00:49.839> etc<00:00:50.220> now<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.280> good<00:00:51.460> thing<00:00:51.519> I<00:00:51.670> really

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
cables etc now the good thing I really

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.520 
cables etc now the good thing I really
like<00:00:51.970> about<00:00:52.000> speed<00:00:52.420> cons<00:00:52.629> is<00:00:52.960> that<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.350> don't

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
like about speed cons is that you don't

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.020 
like about speed cons is that you don't
just<00:00:53.710> push<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.010> middle<00:00:54.100> pull<00:00:54.339> of<00:00:54.430> mine<00:00:54.550> you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
just push the middle pull of mine you

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.430 
just push the middle pull of mine you
have<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.330> twist<00:00:55.480> them<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:55.989> side<00:00:56.199> it's

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
have to twist them to the side it's

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.810 
have to twist them to the side it's
quite<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.620> lot<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.830> see<00:00:56.920> on<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.070> video<00:00:57.160> but<00:00:57.579> you

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
quite a lot to see on the video but you

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.579 
quite a lot to see on the video but you
twist<00:00:58.210> them<00:00:58.360> in<00:00:58.420> sideways<00:00:58.960> he's<00:00:59.199> got<00:00:59.379> two

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.280 
twist them in sideways he's got two
little<00:00:59.829> ridges<00:01:00.580> there<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.960> then<00:01:02.049> you<00:01:02.110> have<00:01:02.199> to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
little ridges there and then you have to

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.580 
little ridges there and then you have to
turn<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.129> right<00:01:03.400> now<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:03.970> release<00:01:04.590> its

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
turn to the right now to release its

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.080 
turn to the right now to release its
it's<00:01:06.190> a<00:01:06.250> bit<00:01:06.369> different<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:06.700> have<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:06.850> pull

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.240 
it's a bit different you have to pull
this<00:01:07.240> little<00:01:07.540> metal<00:01:07.659> clip<00:01:07.990> down<00:01:08.170> it's<00:01:09.040> got<00:01:09.130> an

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
this little metal clip down it's got an

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.620 
this little metal clip down it's got an
arrow<00:01:09.430> on<00:01:09.549> there<00:01:09.850> as<00:01:09.940> well<00:01:10.119> which<00:01:10.330> means<00:01:10.479> you

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
like about the speed on cable other than

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.550 
like about the speed on cable other than
fact<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.580> it's<00:01:36.700> pretty<00:01:36.940> big<00:01:37.240> robust<00:01:37.840> easy<00:01:38.290> to

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
fact that it's pretty big robust easy to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.590 
fact that it's pretty big robust easy to
handle<00:01:38.920> right<00:01:39.730> that's<00:01:39.970> it<00:01:40.120> for<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.330> speaking

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
handle right that's it for the speaking

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.910 
handle right that's it for the speaking
people<00:01:40.870> let's<00:01:41.020> have<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.200> look<00:01:41.380> at<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.680> jack

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
people let's have a look at the jack

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.810 
people let's have a look at the jack
cable

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.280 

what<00:01:47.240> you're<00:01:47.420> looking<00:01:47.570> at<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.690> jack<00:01:47.870> cable<00:01:48.080> this

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
what you're looking at a jack cable this

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.050 
what you're looking at a jack cable this
is<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.470> little<00:01:48.800> bit<00:01:48.920> different<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.340> speak<00:01:49.610> on<00:01:49.820> in

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
is a little bit different to speak on in

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.100 
is a little bit different to speak on in
the<00:01:50.120> fact<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.450> it's<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.810> bit<00:01:50.960> more

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
the fact that it's a bit more

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.050 
the fact that it's a bit more
streamlined<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.860> we've<00:01:52.340> got<00:01:52.430> a<00:01:52.460> spring<00:01:52.790> here

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
streamlined and we've got a spring here

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.820 
streamlined and we've got a spring here
as<00:01:53.180> well<00:01:53.360> which<00:01:53.570> basically<00:01:54.080> just<00:01:54.229> holds<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
as well which basically just holds the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.920 
as well which basically just holds the
cable<00:01:54.979> in<00:01:55.250> place<00:01:55.370> so<00:01:55.850> say<00:01:56.150> this<00:01:56.390> from<00:01:56.600> just

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
cable in place so say this from just

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.840 
cable in place so say this from just
dropping<00:01:57.440> immediately<00:01:57.860> down<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.310> springs<00:01:58.670> or

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
dropping immediately down the springs or

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.120 
dropping immediately down the springs or
holds<00:01:59.120> it<00:01:59.210> up<00:01:59.300> so<00:01:59.600> it<00:02:00.140> reduces<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.710> risks<00:02:01.010> of

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
holds it up so it reduces the risks of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.430 
holds it up so it reduces the risks of
the<00:02:01.280> wires<00:02:01.490> getting<00:02:01.760> pulled<00:02:02.060> out<00:02:02.180> or<00:02:03.110> I'm

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
the wires getting pulled out or I'm

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.710 
the wires getting pulled out or I'm
connected<00:02:03.979> from<00:02:04.100> inside<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.910> is<00:02:05.150> it's<00:02:05.390> again

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
connected from inside this is it's again

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.469 
connected from inside this is it's again
a<00:02:05.750> metal<00:02:06.170> constructions<00:02:07.009> gonna<00:02:07.280> be<00:02:07.340> good<00:02:07.550> but

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
a metal constructions gonna be good but

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.730 
a metal constructions gonna be good but
the<00:02:08.570> good<00:02:08.690> thing<00:02:08.720> about<00:02:08.869> not<00:02:09.320> being<00:02:09.470> made<00:02:09.649> of

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
the good thing about not being made of

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.199 
the good thing about not being made of
plastic<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.399> if<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.700> was<00:02:10.820> made<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.000> plastic

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
plastic that if it was made of plastic

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.180 
plastic that if it was made of plastic
and<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.230> dropped<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.680> floor<00:02:12.770> if

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and you dropped it on the floor if

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.890 
and you dropped it on the floor if
someone<00:02:13.490> put<00:02:13.610> their<00:02:13.760> foot<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.180> crushed

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
someone put their foot on it crushed

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.520 
someone put their foot on it crushed
gone<00:02:15.350> straight<00:02:15.770> away<00:02:15.980> once<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.910> cable<00:02:17.240> down

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
gone straight away once the cable down

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.570 
gone straight away once the cable down
but<00:02:18.530> no<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> solid<00:02:19.430> metal

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
but no this is a solid metal

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.550 
but no this is a solid metal
construction<00:02:19.790> really<00:02:20.480> really<00:02:20.750> good<00:02:20.959> good

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
construction really really good good

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.330 
construction really really good good
thing<00:02:21.709> about<00:02:21.830> Jack's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
thing about Jack's

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.500 
thing about Jack's
is<00:02:22.489> that<00:02:22.900> well<00:02:23.930> how<00:02:24.890> simple<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.760> just

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
is that well how simple it is you just

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.320 
is that well how simple it is you just
put<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.720> in<00:02:26.810> done<00:02:27.260> that's<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.970> bad<00:02:28.970> thing<00:02:29.150> about

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
put it in done that's it bad thing about

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.910 
put it in done that's it bad thing about
it<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.660> like<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.900> said<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.560> depends<00:02:30.800> on

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
it is like I said it depends on

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.740 
it is like I said it depends on
application<00:02:31.520> using<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:31.940> for<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:32.360> you're<00:02:32.510> using

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
application using it for if you're using

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.210 
application using it for if you're using
it<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.050> pub<00:02:33.260> or<00:02:33.560> somewhere<00:02:33.980> where<00:02:34.070> you've

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
it in a pub or somewhere where you've

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.530 
it in a pub or somewhere where you've
got<00:02:34.370> people<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.730> might<00:02:35.000> want<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.180> compromise

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
got people that might want to compromise

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.259 
got people that might want to compromise
what<00:02:36.020> you're<00:02:36.140> doing<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:37.610> really<00:02:37.790> easy<00:02:38.060> for

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
what you're doing it's really easy for

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.390 
what you're doing it's really easy for
them<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:38.930> basically<00:02:39.620> pull<00:02:39.920> out<00:02:40.100> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
them to just basically pull out and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.340 
them to just basically pull out and
that's<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.269> if<00:02:41.510> you're<00:02:41.720> gonna<00:02:41.840> use<00:02:42.019> Jack's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
that's it if you're gonna use Jack's

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.590 
that's it if you're gonna use Jack's
then<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.800> would<00:02:42.950> do<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.190> something<00:02:43.820> look<00:02:44.120> from

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
then I would do it something look from

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.780 
then I would do it something look from
your<00:02:44.720> amplifier<00:02:45.290> or<00:02:45.590> your<00:02:46.040> inputs<00:02:46.610> or<00:02:46.730> outputs

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
your amplifier or your inputs or outputs

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.820 
your amplifier or your inputs or outputs
from<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.239> amplifier<00:02:47.630> somewhere<00:02:48.500> where<00:02:48.620> your

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
from the amplifier somewhere where your

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.030 
from the amplifier somewhere where your
amplifies<00:02:49.400> tucked<00:02:49.730> away<00:02:49.910> or<00:02:50.900> on<00:02:51.410> your<00:02:51.560> setup

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
amplifies tucked away or on your setup

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.620 
amplifies tucked away or on your setup
so<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.280> you've<00:02:52.489> got<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.940> not<00:02:53.150> got<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
so that you've got you not got the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.600 
so that you've got you not got the
chance<00:02:54.049> for<00:02:54.260> anyone<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.799> sort<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.070> unplug<00:02:55.489> the

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
chance for anyone to sort of unplug the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.600 
chance for anyone to sort of unplug the
cables<00:02:56.000> let's<00:02:56.450> take<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.690> look<00:02:56.930> at<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.530> XLR

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.880 

not<00:03:02.910> many<00:03:03.090> speakers<00:03:03.600> use<00:03:03.810> XLR<00:03:04.320> connections<00:03:04.770> I

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
not many speakers use XLR connections I

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.680 
not many speakers use XLR connections I
think<00:03:05.070> it's<00:03:05.160> more<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> active<00:03:06.150> speakers

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
think it's more of the active speakers

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.740 
think it's more of the active speakers
more<00:03:06.930> higher-end<00:03:07.200> pricey<00:03:08.160> speakers<00:03:08.760> one<00:03:09.630> of

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
more higher-end pricey speakers one of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.200 
more higher-end pricey speakers one of
the<00:03:09.810> RCF<00:03:10.320> do<00:03:10.680> our<00:03:10.860> XR<00:03:11.370> connections<00:03:11.910> and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
the RCF do our XR connections and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.890 
the RCF do our XR connections and
possibly<00:03:12.600> even<00:03:12.720> alto<00:03:14.030> but<00:03:15.030> let's<00:03:15.540> have<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> look

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
possibly even alto but let's have a look

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.830 
possibly even alto but let's have a look
at<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.190> XLR<00:03:17.190> cable<00:03:17.550> now<00:03:18.210> depending<00:03:18.570> which<00:03:18.630> end

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
at the XLR cable now depending which end

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.760 
at the XLR cable now depending which end
you've<00:03:18.930> got<00:03:19.050> whether<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.440> male<00:03:19.590> or<00:03:19.740> female

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
you've got whether it's a male or female

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.700 
you've got whether it's a male or female
and<00:03:20.340> you've<00:03:21.090> got<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:21.930> end<00:03:22.200> where<00:03:22.440> you've

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
and you've got the one end where you've

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.800 
and you've got the one end where you've
just<00:03:22.740> basically<00:03:23.310> got<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:24.210> metal

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
just basically got this metal

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.110 
just basically got this metal
construction<00:03:25.350> again<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.850> good<00:03:26.970> thing

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
construction again and the good thing

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.340 
construction again and the good thing
about<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.540> fact<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:28.050> got<00:03:28.140> look<00:03:28.290> at

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
about the fact that it's got look at

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.140 
about the fact that it's got look at
this<00:03:28.440> guy<00:03:28.620> bring<00:03:28.980> around<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.730> keeps<00:03:29.970> it

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
this guy bring around is that keeps it

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.370 
this guy bring around is that keeps it
in<00:03:30.240> line<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:30.600> it's<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:30.810> going<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.020> wiggle<00:03:31.260> from

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
in line so it's not going to wiggle from

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.770 
in line so it's not going to wiggle from
side<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.650> side<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:32.220> goes<00:03:32.490> in<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:32.820> chamber<00:03:33.300> and

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
side to side it goes in this chamber and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.620 
side to side it goes in this chamber and
it<00:03:33.990> stays<00:03:34.260> where<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.150> other<00:03:36.240> ends

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
it stays where it is on the other ends

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.880 
it stays where it is on the other ends
depending<00:03:37.020> on<00:03:37.080> which<00:03:37.200> end<00:03:37.410> you're<00:03:37.560> going<00:03:37.680> into

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
depending on which end you're going into

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.120 
depending on which end you're going into
your<00:03:38.010> speaker's<00:03:38.520> male<00:03:39.300> or<00:03:39.450> female<00:03:39.920> you've<00:03:40.920> got

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
your speaker's male or female you've got

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.590 
your speaker's male or female you've got
this<00:03:41.340> little<00:03:41.610> clip<00:03:41.850> here<00:03:42.030> which<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.390> basically

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
this little clip here which is basically

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.720 
this little clip here which is basically
like<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.960> locking<00:03:43.320> clip<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.830> stop<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.160> from<00:03:44.280> sort

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
like a locking clip to stop it from sort

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.040 
like a locking clip to stop it from sort
of<00:03:44.760> pulling<00:03:45.030> out<00:03:45.180> which<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:45.510> really<00:03:45.720> really

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
of pulling out which is really really

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.510 
of pulling out which is really really
good<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.370> more<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.270> suppose<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> sort<00:03:49.350> of

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
good this is more of I suppose a sort of

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.160 
good this is more of I suppose a sort of
precautionary<00:03:50.520> thing<00:03:50.820> if<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.900> was<00:03:52.020> on<00:03:52.110> the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
precautionary thing if it was on the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.630 
precautionary thing if it was on the
back<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.440> your<00:03:52.530> speakers<00:03:53.040> it's<00:03:53.250> not<00:03:53.430> because

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
back of your speakers it's not because

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.160 
back of your speakers it's not because
if<00:03:53.850> someone<00:03:54.120> threads<00:03:54.360> on<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.570> cable<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.020> not

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
if someone threads on the cable it's not

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.660 
if someone threads on the cable it's not
just<00:03:55.320> going<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.530> fling<00:03:55.710> out<00:03:55.860> it's<00:03:56.190> got<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.430> lock

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
just going to fling out it's got a lock

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.120 
just going to fling out it's got a lock
on<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:57.600> not<00:03:57.720> gonna<00:03:57.930> be<00:03:58.320> able<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.010> be

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
on that so it's not gonna be able to be

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.580 
on that so it's not gonna be able to be
released<00:03:59.690> but<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.870> doesn't<00:04:01.080> mean<00:04:01.140> say<00:04:01.380> it's

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
released but that doesn't mean say it's

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.140 
released but that doesn't mean say it's
gonna<00:04:01.710> stop<00:04:02.040> someone<00:04:02.430> from<00:04:02.460> pulling<00:04:02.880> out<00:04:02.940> of

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
gonna stop someone from pulling out of

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.750 
gonna stop someone from pulling out of
the<00:04:03.240> back<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.510> your<00:04:03.540> speaker's<00:04:04.460> like<00:04:05.460> I<00:04:05.550> said

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
the back of your speaker's like I said

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.870 
the back of your speaker's like I said
it's<00:04:06.180> basically<00:04:07.130> precautionary<00:04:08.130> thing<00:04:08.190> one

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
it's basically precautionary thing one

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.940 
it's basically precautionary thing one
of<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.000> downsides<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.720> XLR<00:04:10.170> connections<00:04:10.680> is

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
of the downsides to XLR connections is

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.250 
of the downsides to XLR connections is
that<00:04:11.160> you've<00:04:11.280> got<00:04:11.520> your<00:04:12.239> standard<00:04:12.690> speaker

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
that you've got your standard speaker

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.770 
that you've got your standard speaker
and<00:04:13.410> white<00:04:13.560> cables<00:04:14.100> you've<00:04:14.880> also<00:04:15.030> got<00:04:15.300> DMX

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
and white cables you've also got DMX

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.110 
and white cables you've also got DMX
cables<00:04:16.230> which<00:04:16.440> run<00:04:16.830> off<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.070> same<00:04:17.250> thing<00:04:17.549> exit

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
cables which run off the same thing exit

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.030 
cables which run off the same thing exit
our<00:04:18.209> connections<00:04:18.709> there's<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.799> huge

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
our connections there's a huge

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.010 
our connections there's a huge
difference<00:04:20.489> as<00:04:20.730> pointed<00:04:21.270> out<00:04:21.330> in<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.570> load<00:04:21.840> of

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
difference as pointed out in a load of

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.810 
difference as pointed out in a load of
other<00:04:22.109> people's<00:04:22.410> videos<00:04:22.530> between<00:04:23.010> speaker

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
other people's videos between speaker

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.350 
other people's videos between speaker
and<00:04:24.120> mic<00:04:24.510> XLR<00:04:24.990> cables<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.590> DMX<00:04:26.490> cables<00:04:27.030> they

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
and mic XLR cables and DMX cables they

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.820 
and mic XLR cables and DMX cables they
do<00:04:27.419> completely<00:04:27.960> different<00:04:28.050> things<00:04:28.500> they're

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
do completely different things they're

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.560 
do completely different things they're
completely<00:04:29.220> different<00:04:29.370> designs<00:04:29.850> completely

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
completely different designs completely

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.680 
completely different designs completely
different<00:04:30.840> with<00:04:30.990> wiring<00:04:31.700> so<00:04:32.700> that's<00:04:33.419> one

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
different with wiring so that's one

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.120 
different with wiring so that's one
thing<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.960> be<00:04:34.050> careful<00:04:34.200> of<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.800> only<00:04:34.980> thing

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
thing to be careful of the only thing

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.710 
thing to be careful of the only thing
about<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.550> is<00:04:35.880> that<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.180> might<00:04:36.330> have<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.600> do

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
about this is that you might have to do

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.990 
about this is that you might have to do
what<00:04:36.810> I've<00:04:36.960> done<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:38.100> put<00:04:38.310> some<00:04:38.490> red<00:04:38.700> or<00:04:38.850> white

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
what I've done and put some red or white

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.970 
what I've done and put some red or white
tape<00:04:39.300> or<00:04:39.510> some<00:04:39.660> some<00:04:39.990> indication<00:04:40.530> tape<00:04:40.770> to

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
tape or some some indication tape to

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.430 
tape or some some indication tape to
show<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.610> when<00:04:41.760> you're<00:04:41.880> in<00:04:42.000> in<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.390> bag<00:04:42.600> the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
show you the when you're in in a bag the

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.770 
show you the when you're in in a bag the
DMX<00:04:43.830> cables<00:04:44.250> or<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.460> particular<00:04:44.910> color<00:04:45.090> directs

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
DMX cables or a particular color directs

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.480 
DMX cables or a particular color directs
a<00:04:45.900> lotta<00:04:46.080> connections<00:04:46.500> or<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.650> different<00:04:47.340> color

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
a lotta connections or a different color

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.480 
a lotta connections or a different color
so<00:04:48.060> which<00:04:48.210> one<00:04:48.390> would<00:04:48.480> you<00:04:48.540> say<00:04:48.630> is<00:04:49.050> best

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
so which one would you say is best

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.830 
so which one would you say is best
overall<00:04:50.490> for<00:04:50.669> me<00:04:50.790> it's<00:04:51.090> got<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.419> be<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.630> speak

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
overall for me it's got to be the speak

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.409 
overall for me it's got to be the speak
on<00:04:52.050> cable<00:04:52.490> like<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.580> facts<00:04:53.790> as<00:04:53.910> we<00:04:53.970> mentioned

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
on cable like the facts as we mentioned

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.240 
on cable like the facts as we mentioned
the<00:04:54.510> fact<00:04:54.540> is<00:04:54.900> basically<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.710> got<00:04:55.800> color<00:04:56.040> on

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
the fact is basically you got color on

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.500 
the fact is basically you got color on
it<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:56.520> can<00:04:56.700> spot<00:04:56.970> that<00:04:57.180> from<00:04:57.390> different

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
it so you can spot that from different

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.930 
it so you can spot that from different
cables<00:04:58.080> which<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.320> really<00:04:58.560> good<00:04:58.770> also<00:04:59.730> the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
cables which is really good also the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.970 
cables which is really good also the
locking<00:05:00.450> pin<00:05:00.690> feature<00:05:00.930> so<00:05:01.290> that<00:05:01.320> if<00:05:01.740> you're<00:05:01.919> in

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
locking pin feature so that if you're in

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.500 
locking pin feature so that if you're in
a<00:05:02.070> particular<00:05:02.310> situation<00:05:02.610> where<00:05:03.090> people<00:05:03.360> want

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
a particular situation where people want

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.450 
a particular situation where people want
to<00:05:03.540> try<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:03.930> unplug<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.260> speaker's<00:05:04.800> by<00:05:05.400> the

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
to try and unplug the speaker's by the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.909 
to try and unplug the speaker's by the
time<00:05:05.730> they<00:05:05.850> figured<00:05:06.210> out<00:05:06.300> how<00:05:06.480> to<00:05:06.540> do<00:05:06.720> it

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
time they figured out how to do it

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.140 
time they figured out how to do it
you'll<00:05:07.919> have<00:05:08.010> noticed<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.580> on<00:05:08.700> me<00:05:08.790> you'll<00:05:08.940> be

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
you'll have noticed that on me you'll be

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.940 
you'll have noticed that on me you'll be
able<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.330> send<00:05:09.570> someone<00:05:09.780> over<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.200> say<00:05:10.380> puck

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
able to send someone over and say puck

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.060 
able to send someone over and say puck
again<00:05:11.600> but<00:05:12.600> yeah<00:05:13.050> as<00:05:13.320> well<00:05:13.530> as<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.740> solid

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
again but yeah as well as the solid

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.790 
again but yeah as well as the solid
construction

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
construction

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.770 
construction
and<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.460> only<00:05:15.610> downside<00:05:16.030> would<00:05:16.150> be<00:05:16.330> that<00:05:16.660> I

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
and the only downside would be that I

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.850 
and the only downside would be that I
think<00:05:17.020> this<00:05:17.080> one<00:05:17.259> is<00:05:17.289> actually<00:05:17.500> made<00:05:17.740> of

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
think this one is actually made of

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.700 
think this one is actually made of
plastic<00:05:18.370> it<00:05:18.490> may<00:05:18.610> not<00:05:18.759> be<00:05:19.169> but<00:05:20.169> it's<00:05:20.470> made<00:05:20.680> of

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
plastic it may not be but it's made of

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.409 
plastic it may not be but it's made of
plastic<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:21.190> seems<00:05:21.370> like<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.729> really<00:05:22.210> solid

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
plastic it seems like a really solid

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:23.879 
plastic it seems like a really solid
plastic<00:05:22.960> it<00:05:23.080> doesn't<00:05:23.259> look<00:05:23.349> like<00:05:23.379> a<00:05:23.500> flimsy

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
plastic it doesn't look like a flimsy

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.339 
plastic it doesn't look like a flimsy
type<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.490> would<00:05:24.550> break<00:05:24.849> in<00:05:25.300> my<00:05:25.509> opinion<00:05:25.930> it's

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
type that would break in my opinion it's

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.039 
type that would break in my opinion it's
got<00:05:26.500> this<00:05:26.650> pecan
