00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.550
 hardware info tv becomes possible 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.689
 made by ocz 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.689
 msi and asus 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.490
 in this episode of her two info tv 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.490
 the apple ipad mini retina 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.579
 welcome to heart info tv recently 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.829
 did discuss the new apple ipad very much 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.070
 but there is of course still in new ipad 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.570
 and that is the ipad mini retina and the name 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.670
 it already indicates the most important thing 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.360
 news is also the little ipad has now 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.489
 such a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.930
 very high resolution screen yes because ipad 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.970
 mini as we had hitherto had 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.559
 a 7.9 went screen there is nothing to it 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.269
 only that was still low 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.100
 resolution screen with 1000 hours twenty 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.269
 768 pixels 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.530
 because of that is not for such a small screen 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.150
 very bad but certainly if you 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.890
 for example, want a book or a website 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.780
 reading is just not that bad 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.369
 nice and apple now on those steps 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.479
 made with my ipad mini with which 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.070
 the actual four times as high 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.020
 resolution and thinking 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.670
 the predecessor so this snow in 2048 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.990
 1536 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.490
 that is the same as the retina screen 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.350
 from the of the large ipad next door 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.180
 so in that regard it is really one 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.930
 year quadruple the number 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.670
 pixels on the screen 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.010
 yes and my small screen is that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.830
 actually even more special because then the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.450
 We had iPad Retina but we did 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 full of admiration for the pixel density 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.220
 of the device the pixel density of 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.020
 which ipad mini retina is which i still have a lot 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.520
 higher that light and well above 300 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.800
 pixels per inch times with my means 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.270
 also 5-inch smartphones that are okay 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.860
 high ones above the 400 pixel prince 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.420
 so in that regard it is not 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.950
 I am super exciting but it is natural 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.240
 still a very high resolution 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.740
 on a relatively small screen and you 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.659
 continues to have that effect the pixels 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.520
 be so small that year with the naked 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.600
 eye really cannot distinguish 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.920
 no and in fact that means 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.240
 actually with the big ipad already like that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.860
 where the pixels are a bit larger 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.990
 in that regard it does not have very much 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.220
 advantage but you can do the same to you 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.409
 have it there so you can stick on one now 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.479
 small ipad so much bigger yes around it 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.490
 is to stay with the screen because yes 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.900
 as we are used to from apple 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.780
 fencing just isn't 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.340
 also economized that ipad mini retina has 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.989
 really just a screen whatever but you 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.750
 qualitatively lick your finger 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.640
 was going to be very critical 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.680
 are we must conclude that 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.140
 that the cases of air anyway little 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.640
 better is yes the earth retina fencing 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.319
 the yellow jersey bertus from the erno of the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.629
 previous generation are just indeed 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.950
 better both the colors and the colors 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.330
 production as its name so say 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.040
 but the delta is in the color deviation 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.569
 just really higher up with this device and on 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.660
 the color space is what small that 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.040
 simply means 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.810
 in short that green is less green 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.920
 red less red and blue less blue 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.450
 making it all just something 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.310
 it is still less sparkling 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.070
 always a very nice screen but me 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.660
 center and the city and much better than 70% 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.010
 of the android tablet for sure but it is 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.570
 not as good as that of the big odd one 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.340
 retina fencing 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.740
 then or the rest because when i met it 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.210
 Frank could have been on the iPad Air 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.480
 naturally extensively discussed the 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.090
 processes in it that apple a7 newest 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.910
 generation apple to brake chip the first 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.160
 to anyone's brake processor that 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.140
 is suitable for those new to brake v8 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.550
 viruses cebit architecture then 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.800
 conclude that the thing is green blood 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.480
 fast and exactly that will make you sit so too 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.950
 in that little mini yes and it is such 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.480
 dual-core the only difference between the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.860
 two is that he is 1.3 here 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.380
 gerardus believes that the big one 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.670
 was worked out at 1.4 looking at the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.480
 benchmark cyrus in that too 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.920
 difference 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.810
 but it's still really one 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.280
 super-fast tablet in all benchmarks 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.990
 you can run your cross platform 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.950
 that this dual-core processor 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.570
 he has my two fingers in the nose 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.070
 the bulk of the benchmarks wind up all 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.780
 quad-core processors currently 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.070
 so are used in android devices 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.050
 really how 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.430
 recently slightly less fast than the than ipad 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.470
 there still series too fast 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.420
 and then again want to celebrate session bit 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.040
 sounds marketing-technical nice but that 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.810
 actually he did not say what these 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.390
 chip so special just makes it fact 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.130
 he just very smart l see it and 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.200
 that with that switch to 4 they you 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.300
 also prays some optimizations 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.280
 has been able to apply that ensures 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.280
 really that the thing is very fast 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.810
 my door they said yes because otherwise that 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.980
 has much smaller than the battery then are 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.660
 big brother and of course also small 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.980
 screen what more hero is the battery works 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.450
 it still really really good at that 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.500
 This device can last you very very long 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.330
 more browser even if you have one for it 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.220
 burdened he will last a very long time with them 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.720
 you can easily get it for nine or nine hours 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.160
 watch a movie for example that is not 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.250
 only problem and that is just fine 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.770
 for such a small device in terms of thickness and 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.880
 in terms of size there is actually not whole 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.980
 much changed compared to the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.540
 existing ipad mini is slightly larger and 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.010
 slightly fatter he is fatter you 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.300
 and slightly heavier that choice dimensions 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.030
 his put it a little thicker but that is 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.840
 actually not visible behind the comma 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.850
 in the millimeters 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.290
 yes and he will therefore not even 20 grams 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.450
 wave but that is actually water 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.250
 that if they both and themselves 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.910
 at the same time you do n't go 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.410
 brand walk 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.419
 yes and then the rest of the had respect 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.740
 but just to complete yes how what 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.009
 there are never so many of them 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.779
 apple because it's downtown 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.139
 a home button on enlightening 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:53.360
 connectors and the power button of course 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.949
 no possibility of memory 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.129
 Extend no dear in it 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.199
 device that is new is a new one 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.960
 wallace chip 5 also doing your apps 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.249
 but unfortunately early 802 11ac but rarely 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.710
 I also saw that in the great one that happened 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:08.539
 new ipad air the standard version 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.909
 has it is his party of course 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.619
 with and without 3g and 4g because 4 is now too 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.139
 with the radio standard version 

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:17.330
 Supports the prices starting with such 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.800
 390 euros for the 16 gigabyte version and 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.419
 au coeur company steps you make 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.120
 it costs around 90 euros so for to 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.919
 32 is cost 90 euros to 64 again 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.240
 and that in itself is a big one 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.620
 advantage over at least one 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.330
 reasonable advantage over the 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.159
 great ipad because he is not just what 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.149
 more handy what what what in use what me 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.680
 He regards it is very nice also 

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:35.089
 even a bit cheaper because if you get them 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.069
 the 16 are directly opposite each other 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.349
 gigabyte we phi versions then we see it 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.599
 is therefore 390 euros is 2 for the larger ones 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.219
 ipad air paid around 480 so that will 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.649
 a significant price difference from others 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.990
 that your kids say cheaper my word 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:49.459
 choice would be less expensive but it is 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.379
 2013 

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:54.499
 you actually want 32 gigabytes in you 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:56.330
 tablet and then you pay just 500 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:57.649
 euro young 80 denotes then how you 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.819
 wrong that just remains real money 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.159
 to real money but good you get 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.449
 there is the well-known apple quality 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.680
 so to speak with the apso of 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.999
 you're sure all works well 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.830
 gets the ecosystem 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:08.569
 yes it is certainly not cheap tablets 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.830
 but it is cheaper than the iPad 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.319
 air that also that new a7 processor 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.059
 because so actually we can too 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.680
 do set the mcl 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:18.559
 really attached for whatever reason 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.419
 that larger screen is actually 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:21.050
 The new iPad mini were two nivel de 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.430
 better choice 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.599
 yes I think a lot of people do it 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.159
 especially there to users such 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.539
 small device that is there is just 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.099
 more pleasant this impression much easier 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.419
 she still doesn't mean a device 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.129
 when you put your bag but also in your bag 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.839
 you find that easier and he is just 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.919
 you really want to be more comfortable to use

 read a lot of books or 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.919
 magazines then a bigger screen 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.330
 more pleasant and I can imagine 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.009
 productive titles with a keyboard 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.389

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.680

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.089
 the majority of people that that this 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.039

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:48.589

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.379
 PC bit because I really rarely have them like that 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:12.259

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:19.870
