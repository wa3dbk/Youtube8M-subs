00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:11.600
 we worked well in retreat we have 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.420
 fortunately had very few 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.040
 problems with some joints see 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.260
 Morganella 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:24.260
 now the ankle of abel of bolzoni 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.560
 but things that can be cured in short 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.000
 a few days so in this sense one is 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.220
 done a good job 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.440
 and clear that tomorrow's is 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.090
 a further stage of approach to 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.690
 what can be the beginning of 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.610
 championship 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.290
 we take it in this sense because it is 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.059
 normal than the last few weeks before 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.980
 to get closer to the championship and holding 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.300
 considering the fact that after the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.860
 before the championship there will be another 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.699
 break 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.440
 It is clear that the work program is 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.780
 going to take a road well 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.430
 specifies that of speed 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.800
 of the speed that within a few 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.930
 time will come 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.720
 we needed to put in loads of 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.580
 important work the team did 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.690
 and well giving great availability 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.450
 the group is working as it should now 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.670
 that of tomorrow can be another 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.400
 stage of verification approach to the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.850
 championship to go and check 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.409
 some situations some things 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.760
 some guys like you are 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.890
 eventually inserted with me 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.810
 we are pursuing some concepts 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.470
 that in this league they will come back 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.090
 very useful 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.850
 oh well the world in a team that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.860
 first and foremost a great coach like 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.390
 novice for I know so get ready 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.670
 always very well tactically 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.080
 teams with a right spirit then 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.810
 despite having want to come here to do 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.720
 a great game as it should be 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.820
 it's a team that you know plays 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.100
 together for some time a few da 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.080
 a few years already and therefore definitely a 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.060
 very challenging test 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.010
 I've already told the team about the boys 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.260
 that we should think about overcoming ourselves 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.780
 to do is try to do a good job 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.650
 race on all aspects because it is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.340
 clear that they as they array in 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.430
 very compact aggressive ready field 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.440
 always attacking the depths there 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.660
 they will therefore put a strain on the test 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.480
 we will have to be good at knowing how to enter 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.360
 immediately in the game to it for 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.030
 to take 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.710
 in hand the situation for the boys who 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.740
 i'm here with us i'm here with us like 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.450
 I said it's not like I think about this 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.460
 moment there is so much talk no 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.290
 how it is normal that it is as it is right that 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:43.670
 both from us and from other parts of from here to 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.320
 8 9 days ten days these will be 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.200
 they will only be talking 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.840
 then those who really are will count 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.060
 the real contents and therefore us there 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.880
 we must concentrate on what is the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.410
 our daily work continue 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.550
 grow that collectively e 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.760
 individually and then then 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.430
 we will verify closed 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.110
 closed the doors who we will be in fact 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.989
 we need our fans 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.820
 fans the saint understood and in any case 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.520
 last year we also worked 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.959
 so that this enthusiasm would return 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.030
 this feeling of this recreated 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.510
 great enthusiasm relationship between the fans 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.830
 and the team and we succeeded because 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.870
 the welcome we received in 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.250
 week was important 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.410
 we want to continue on that path 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.420
 because it is clear that last year the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.269
 most beautiful thing we did second 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.040
 me was the one to have to carry 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.769
 always the colors of the company i up 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.760
 colors of the jersey team 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.760
 on all fields
