00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
of that gag type is planted and thus

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.910

then the level four and the level five

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.090 
then the level four and the level five
you<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.049> all<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.680> up<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.979> your
