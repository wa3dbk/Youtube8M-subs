sample<00:00:20.560> which<00:00:20.920> has<00:00:21.130> been<00:00:21.970> tested<00:00:22.240> on<00:00:22.600> a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
sample which has been tested on a

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.770 
sample which has been tested on a
website<00:00:23.260> called<00:00:23.740> Tom's<00:00:24.100> Hardware<00:00:24.430> so<00:00:25.240> this<00:00:25.660> is

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
website called Tom's Hardware so this is

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.630 
website called Tom's Hardware so this is
basically<00:00:25.930> what<00:00:26.350> we<00:00:26.500> are<00:00:26.800> going<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.280> have<00:00:27.610> a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
basically what we are going to have a

actually been leaked because of Dylan

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.900 
actually been leaked because of Dylan
nickajack<00:00:40.780> who<00:00:41.530> said<00:00:41.800> that<00:00:41.829> there<00:00:42.460> will<00:00:42.670> be<00:00:42.700> no

new<00:00:43.390> GPUs<00:00:44.970> from<00:00:45.970> md<00:00:46.329> until<00:00:46.870> q3<00:00:47.500> 2013<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:49.350> why

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
new GPUs from md until q3 2013 and why

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.190 
new GPUs from md until q3 2013 and why
they're<00:00:50.590> going<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:50.920> do<00:00:51.070> this<00:00:51.219> is<00:00:51.430> actually<00:00:51.850> um

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
they're going to do this is actually um

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.420 
they're going to do this is actually um
because<00:00:53.200> they<00:00:53.350> want<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.590> focus<00:00:53.800> on<00:00:54.190> their

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
because they want to focus on their

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.709 
because they want to focus on their
current<00:00:54.700> m<00:00:55.920> 7000<00:00:56.920> series<00:00:57.600> basically<00:00:58.600> because

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
current m 7000 series basically because

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.340 
current m 7000 series basically because
they<00:00:59.110> are<00:00:59.320> actually<00:00:59.590> quite<00:01:00.070> fast<00:01:00.520> and<00:01:01.170> why<00:01:02.170> not

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
they are actually quite fast and why not

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.429 
they are actually quite fast and why not
because<00:01:03.010> well<00:01:03.760> they<00:01:04.059> outperform<00:01:04.659> other<00:01:04.899> cards

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
because well they outperform other cards

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.190 
because well they outperform other cards
for<00:01:05.710> instance<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.090> as<00:01:07.479> you<00:01:07.600> can<00:01:07.719> see<00:01:07.750> here<00:01:08.079> on

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
for instance and as you can see here on

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.200 
for instance and as you can see here on
this<00:01:08.350> little<00:01:08.530> graphics<00:01:09.070> it's<00:01:09.369> basically<00:01:09.880> says

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
this little graphics it's basically says

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.399 
this little graphics it's basically says
that<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.680> current<00:01:11.920> series<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.670> Fame<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.510> the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
that the current series of Fame of the

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.580 
that the current series of Fame of the
AMD<00:01:14.680> Radeon<00:01:15.190> graphics<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:17.049> will<00:01:17.200> basically

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
AMD Radeon graphics they will basically

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.370 
AMD Radeon graphics they will basically
be<00:01:17.740> like<00:01:18.220> they<00:01:18.970> are<00:01:19.150> right<00:01:19.180> now<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:19.930> SP

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
be like they are right now and SP

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.000 
be like they are right now and SP
Stabler<00:01:20.799> 4l<00:01:21.070> 2013<00:01:22.290> yes<00:01:23.290> that<00:01:23.650> is<00:01:23.680> basically

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
Stabler 4l 2013 yes that is basically

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.000 
Stabler 4l 2013 yes that is basically
what<00:01:24.130> we<00:01:24.340> have<00:01:24.490> on<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:24.760> light<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:26.560> course

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
what we have on this light and of course

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.160 
what we have on this light and of course
why<00:01:27.189> do<00:01:27.250> we<00:01:27.430> have<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.880> wait<00:01:28.420> all<00:01:28.750> this<00:01:28.869> time<00:01:28.930> I

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
why do we have to wait all this time I

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.210 
why do we have to wait all this time I
mean<00:01:29.590> it's<00:01:29.860> like<00:01:30.220> not<00:01:31.260> not<00:01:32.260> that<00:01:32.500> difficult<00:01:32.740> at

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
mean it's like not not that difficult at

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.399 
mean it's like not not that difficult at
some<00:01:33.549> time<00:01:33.580> we<00:01:33.939> actually<00:01:34.299> saw<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.659> lot<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.170> these

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
some time we actually saw a lot of these

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.160 
some time we actually saw a lot of these
um<00:01:36.119> graphics<00:01:37.119> card<00:01:37.299> new<00:01:37.450> architectures

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
um graphics card new architectures

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.950 
um graphics card new architectures
coming<00:01:38.560> out<00:01:38.710> even<00:01:39.009> twice<00:01:39.250> a<00:01:39.520> year<00:01:39.850> but<00:01:40.210> now<00:01:40.900> we

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
coming out even twice a year but now we

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.390 
coming out even twice a year but now we
only<00:01:41.320> experiencing<00:01:42.070> like<00:01:42.250> 2<00:01:42.549> or<00:01:44.400> 11

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
only experiencing like 2 or 11

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.880 
only experiencing like 2 or 11
architecture<00:01:46.030> each<00:01:46.240> year<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.049> this<00:01:47.439> is<00:01:47.650> this

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
architecture each year so this is this

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.590 
architecture each year so this is this
is<00:01:48.040> actually<00:01:48.460> getting<00:01:48.670> quite<00:01:48.790> boring<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.570> be

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
is actually getting quite boring to be

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.510 
is actually getting quite boring to be
honest<00:01:49.930> because<00:01:50.049> we<00:01:50.380> are<00:01:50.470> not<00:01:50.650> getting<00:01:51.130> so

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
honest because we are not getting so

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.030 
honest because we are not getting so
much<00:01:51.700> new<00:01:51.909> hardware<00:01:52.299> on<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.689> market<00:01:53.110> however

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
much new hardware on the market however

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.760 
much new hardware on the market however
we<00:01:54.280> should<00:01:54.790> actually<00:01:55.090> notice<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.560> new

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
we should actually notice that the new

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.069 
we should actually notice that the new
ps4<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.119> xbox<00:01:59.130> 720<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.759> going<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.900> be

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
ps4 and the xbox 720 is going to be

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.950 
ps4 and the xbox 720 is going to be
released<00:02:02.500> in<00:02:02.680> 2013<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.700> as<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:04.570> know<00:02:04.720> I

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
released in 2013 and as you know I

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.870 
released in 2013 and as you know I
should<00:02:05.470> probably<00:02:05.590> know<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.009> they<00:02:06.579> will

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
should probably know that they will

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.050 
should probably know that they will
contain<00:02:07.329> a<00:02:07.600> nd<00:02:08.349> processor<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:09.909> an

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
contain a nd processor and it is an

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.960 
contain a nd processor and it is an
eight-core<00:02:10.689> processor<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:11.860> 1.6<00:02:12.640> gigahertz

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
eight-core processor with 1.6 gigahertz

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.799 
eight-core processor with 1.6 gigahertz
I<00:02:13.420> think<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.049> like<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.499> room<00:02:14.950> assess<00:02:15.279> it

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:15.809 
I think it's like that room assess it

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.780 
I think it's like that room assess it
nonetheless<00:02:16.809> it's<00:02:17.319> basically<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.609> of<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
nonetheless it's basically one of the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.100 
nonetheless it's basically one of the
reasons<00:02:19.120> why<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.569> all

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
reasons why and all

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.770 
reasons why and all
so<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.770> HD<00:02:22.260> 7970<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.910> basically

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
so that the HD 7970 is basically

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.440 
so that the HD 7970 is basically
outperforming<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.500> gtx<00:02:27.220> 680<00:02:27.730> at<00:02:28.060> least<00:02:28.270> when

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
outperforming the gtx 680 at least when

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.030 
outperforming the gtx 680 at least when
it<00:02:28.480> comes<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.020> geek<00:02:29.260> GJ<00:02:29.740> her<00:02:30.240> gigahertz

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
it comes to the geek GJ her gigahertz

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.980 
it comes to the geek GJ her gigahertz
version<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.910> there<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:34.360> no<00:02:34.540> reason<00:02:34.960> to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
version of it so there is no reason to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.740 
version of it so there is no reason to
upgrade<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.850> current<00:02:37.240> series<00:02:37.510> because

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
upgrade on the current series because

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.650 
upgrade on the current series because
they<00:02:37.960> actually<00:02:38.380> are<00:02:38.590> quite<00:02:38.950> good<00:02:39.300> also<00:02:40.300> under

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
they actually are quite good also under

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.210 
they actually are quite good also under
cheap<00:02:41.170> they<00:02:41.650> are<00:02:41.770> more<00:02:42.040> cheap<00:02:42.310> than<00:02:44.010> then<00:02:45.010> she

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
cheap they are more cheap than then she

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.060 
cheap they are more cheap than then she
take<00:02:45.460> 680<00:02:45.970> for<00:02:46.150> instance<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:47.470> course<00:02:47.860> we

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
take 680 for instance and of course we

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.900 
take 680 for instance and of course we
could<00:02:48.310> perhaps<00:02:48.520> experience<00:02:49.480> or<00:02:49.720> see<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.320> new

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
could perhaps experience or see a new

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.380 
could perhaps experience or see a new

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
official HD 7790 graphics card which is

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.490 
official HD 7790 graphics card which is
basically<00:02:58.840> jeweled<00:02:59.830> GPU<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:02.230> are<00:03:02.320> already

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
basically jeweled GPU and we are already

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.910 
basically jeweled GPU and we are already
have<00:03:02.920> seen<00:03:03.190> some<00:03:03.520> kind<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:04.590> um<00:03:06.450> of

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
have seen some kind of I um of

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.430 
have seen some kind of I um of
unofficial<00:03:09.390> graphics<00:03:10.390> like<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.810> but<00:03:11.230> they

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
unofficial graphics like that but they

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.440 
unofficial graphics like that but they
they<00:03:12.160> are<00:03:12.220> not<00:03:12.400> official<00:03:13.000> as<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.300> can

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
they are not official as you can

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.680 
they are not official as you can
probably<00:03:13.750> tell<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.350> yeah<00:03:15.120> mr.<00:03:16.120> obvious<00:03:16.450> I

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
probably tell and yeah mr. obvious I

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.850 
probably tell and yeah mr. obvious I
know<00:03:17.760> well<00:03:18.760> we<00:03:19.360> have<00:03:19.540> seen<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.959> from<00:03:20.110> our<00:03:20.350> Ares

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
know well we have seen it from our Ares

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.820 
know well we have seen it from our Ares
and<00:03:21.130> such<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.900> yeah<00:03:22.900> well<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.350> little<00:03:23.500> image

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
and such and yeah well this little image

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.240 
and such and yeah well this little image
actor<00:03:24.130> shows<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:25.269> gigahertz<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.980> MD

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
actor shows that the gigahertz of the MD

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.830 
actor shows that the gigahertz of the MD
card<00:03:27.519> is<00:03:27.700> actually<00:03:28.090> twelve<00:03:28.330> percent<00:03:28.570> faster

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
card is actually twelve percent faster

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.780 
card is actually twelve percent faster
than<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.350> g<00:03:29.380> take<00:03:29.680> society<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.670> it's

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
than the g take society and that it's

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.240 
than the g take society and that it's
mainly<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.600> has<00:03:31.780> more<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:33.130> your

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
mainly because it has more with your

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.440 
mainly because it has more with your
round<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:34.150> has<00:03:34.900> more<00:03:35.760> more<00:03:36.760> power<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.269> high

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
round so it has more more power in high

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.330 
round so it has more more power in high
resolution<00:03:37.959> gaming<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.650> as<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:38.980> can<00:03:39.100> see<00:03:39.130> on

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
resolution gaming and as you can see on

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.560 
resolution gaming and as you can see on
this<00:03:39.489> it<00:03:39.730> is<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:40.120> quite<00:03:40.600> huge<00:03:41.730> resolution<00:03:42.730> but

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
this it is a quite huge resolution but

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.440 
this it is a quite huge resolution but
not<00:03:43.930> enough<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:44.920> we<00:03:45.910> have<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.269> have<00:03:46.420> a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
not enough of that we have to have a

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.390 
not enough of that we have to have a
look<00:03:46.600> at<00:03:46.750> Intel<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.620> what<00:03:47.920> they<00:03:48.070> are<00:03:48.130> going<00:03:48.280> to

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
look at Intel and what they are going to

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.289 
look at Intel and what they are going to
do<00:03:48.580> in<00:03:48.820> 2013<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.130> yes<00:03:51.130> we<00:03:51.489> are<00:03:51.519> going<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.150> have

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
do in 2013 and yes we are going to have

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.850 
do in 2013 and yes we are going to have
a<00:03:52.330> look<00:03:52.540> at<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:53.310> engineering<00:03:54.310> sample<00:03:54.760> for<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.860> 2.8

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
a look at a engineering sample for a 2.8

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.750 
a look at a engineering sample for a 2.8
haswell<00:03:57.760> cpu<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.890> here<00:03:59.890> they<00:04:00.070> are<00:04:00.190> this<00:04:00.610> is

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
haswell cpu and here they are this is

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.920 
haswell cpu and here they are this is
basically<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.540> test<00:04:01.810> from<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:03.660> place<00:04:04.660> I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
basically the test from this place I

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.490 
basically the test from this place I
found<00:04:05.170> these<00:04:05.410> tests<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.940> basically

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
found these tests on and it basically

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.000 
found these tests on and it basically
says<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.670> at<00:04:09.670> this<00:04:09.970> level<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.930> hassle<00:04:11.620> isn't

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
says that at this level the hassle isn't

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.370 
says that at this level the hassle isn't
actually<00:04:12.190> faster<00:04:12.820> than<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.630> current<00:04:13.840> Ivy

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
actually faster than the current Ivy

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.039 
actually faster than the current Ivy
Bridge<00:04:14.590> generation<00:04:15.459> so<00:04:15.730> for<00:04:16.359> instance<00:04:16.450> we<00:04:16.900> can

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
Bridge generation so for instance we can

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.219 
Bridge generation so for instance we can
have<00:04:17.260> at<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.799> look<00:04:18.310> at<00:04:18.519> super<00:04:18.850> pi<00:04:19.030> 1m<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.690> you

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
have at a look at super pi 1m and you

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.380 
have at a look at super pi 1m and you
will<00:04:20.380> see<00:04:20.739> that<00:04:20.769> it's<00:04:21.160> one<00:04:21.400> second<00:04:21.790> slower<00:04:21.910> and

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
will see that it's one second slower and

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.490 
will see that it's one second slower and
in<00:04:22.720> other<00:04:23.470> tests<00:04:23.919> it's<00:04:24.190> almost<00:04:24.630> equal<00:04:25.630> but

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
in other tests it's almost equal but

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.029 
in other tests it's almost equal but
faster<00:04:27.100> than<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:28.000> young<00:04:28.500> then<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.650> current

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
faster than the young then the current

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.400 
faster than the young then the current
generation<00:04:30.849> but<00:04:31.690> it's<00:04:31.840> actually<00:04:32.289> quite

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
generation but it's actually quite

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.839 
generation but it's actually quite
disappointing<00:04:33.130> because<00:04:33.310> we

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
disappointing because we

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.419 
disappointing because we
should<00:04:34.449> expect<00:04:35.020> more<00:04:35.289> power<00:04:35.559> from<00:04:35.860> these<00:04:36.069> gpus

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:36.429 
should expect more power from these gpus

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:40.429 
should expect more power from these gpus
our<00:04:36.939> CPUs<00:04:37.539> I<00:04:37.889> already<00:04:38.889> talked<00:04:39.219> about<00:04:39.339> the<00:04:39.610> GPU

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
our CPUs I already talked about the GPU

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.100 
our CPUs I already talked about the GPU
nonetheless<00:04:41.439> um<00:04:41.949> it<00:04:42.610> basically<00:04:43.080> says<00:04:44.080> that

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
nonetheless um it basically says that

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.859 
nonetheless um it basically says that
the<00:04:44.740> we<00:04:45.219> are<00:04:45.309> going<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.639> have<00:04:45.789> this<00:04:45.969> processing

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:46.869 
the we are going to have this processing

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:48.869 
the we are going to have this processing
power<00:04:47.199> at<00:04:47.439> this<00:04:47.619> point<00:04:47.860> but<00:04:48.039> remember<00:04:48.699> it<00:04:48.849> is

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
power at this point but remember it is

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.209 
power at this point but remember it is
an<00:04:49.209> engineering<00:04:49.929> sample<00:04:50.379> so<00:04:50.800> we<00:04:50.830> are<00:04:51.069> not

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:51.219 
an engineering sample so we are not

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.469 
an engineering sample so we are not
going<00:04:51.459> to<00:04:51.879> see<00:04:52.779> this<00:04:53.020> small<00:04:53.469> amount<00:04:54.099> of

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
going to see this small amount of

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.619 
going to see this small amount of
increase<00:04:55.479> so<00:04:56.409> yeah<00:04:56.800> well<00:04:57.129> it's<00:04:57.610> okay<00:04:58.029> for<00:04:58.089> this

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629 
increase so yeah well it's okay for this

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:00.959 
increase so yeah well it's okay for this
stage<00:04:58.869> but<00:04:59.289> at<00:04:59.529> this<00:04:59.679> stage<00:04:59.740> it<00:05:00.309> is<00:05:00.429> right<00:05:00.819> now

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
stage but at this stage it is right now

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.209 
stage but at this stage it is right now
as<00:05:01.599> you<00:05:01.869> can<00:05:01.959> see<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.229> it<00:05:02.439> is<00:05:02.589> an<00:05:02.800> engineer

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
as you can see it it is an engineer

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.489 
as you can see it it is an engineer
example<00:05:03.729> but<00:05:04.599> also<00:05:04.749> you<00:05:04.959> have<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.110> take<00:05:05.379> into

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:05.499 
example but also you have to take into

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.040 
example but also you have to take into
account<00:05:05.830> that<00:05:06.209> Intel<00:05:07.209> is<00:05:07.360> that<00:05:07.539> going<00:05:07.809> to

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
account that Intel is that going to

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.109 
account that Intel is that going to
focus<00:05:08.259> on<00:05:08.939> on<00:05:09.939> processing<00:05:10.899> power<00:05:11.080> on<00:05:11.379> this

00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:12.119 
focus on on processing power on this

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:14.489 
focus on on processing power on this
architecture<00:05:13.119> they<00:05:13.300> are<00:05:13.479> basically<00:05:13.869> going<00:05:14.259> to

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:14.499 
architecture they are basically going to

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.480 
architecture they are basically going to
focus<00:05:14.649> on<00:05:14.949> their<00:05:15.279> integrated<00:05:16.649> GPU<00:05:17.649> switch<00:05:18.219> is

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
focus on their integrated GPU switch is

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.839 
focus on their integrated GPU switch is
going<00:05:19.119> to<00:05:19.269> be<00:05:19.419> a<00:05:19.659> benefit<00:05:20.229> for<00:05:20.499> slower<00:05:21.249> systems

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
going to be a benefit for slower systems

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.119 
going to be a benefit for slower systems
like<00:05:22.110> laptops<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.289> such<00:05:23.469> and<00:05:23.769> they're<00:05:23.979> going

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
like laptops and such and they're going

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.079 
like laptops and such and they're going
to<00:05:24.219> improve<00:05:24.939> their<00:05:25.509> um<00:05:26.349> the<00:05:27.189> graphics<00:05:27.669> on<00:05:27.909> the

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:28.089 
to improve their um the graphics on the

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.559 
to improve their um the graphics on the
cpu<00:05:28.539> with<00:05:28.899> almost<00:05:29.740> 40%<00:05:30.249> which<00:05:31.149> is<00:05:31.300> really

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
cpu with almost 40% which is really

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.869 
cpu with almost 40% which is really
really<00:05:31.869> a<00:05:32.289> lot<00:05:32.319> and<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:33.219> could<00:05:33.369> probably<00:05:33.580> go

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
really a lot and you could probably go

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.169 
really a lot and you could probably go
and<00:05:34.119> gain<00:05:34.479> some<00:05:34.529> quite<00:05:35.529> decent<00:05:36.219> games<00:05:36.580> when

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:37.179 
and gain some quite decent games when

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:40.139 
and gain some quite decent games when
that<00:05:37.539> is<00:05:37.719> actually<00:05:38.139> when<00:05:38.619> this<00:05:39.069> cpu<00:05:39.819> is<00:05:39.939> going

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:40.149 
that is actually when this cpu is going

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:44.850 
that is actually when this cpu is going
to<00:05:40.240> be<00:05:41.610> available<00:05:42.610> in<00:05:42.819> the<00:05:43.119> stores<00:05:43.599> and<00:05:44.110> we<00:05:44.709> of

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
to be available in the stores and we of
