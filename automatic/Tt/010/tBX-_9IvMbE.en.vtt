00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.269
 I feel good in this video, I'm going 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.170
 address the issue of how to buy 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.170
 model airplane 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.890
 in fact this subject is a bit more 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:25.539
 dense than he says and will wait a little 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:29.230
 how you should start in the air husband is 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.850
 so if you're crazy about buying the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.619
 model why you want to start 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.670
 our modernism 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:40.089
 This is not your first step and if 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.070
 you make a purchase without knowing 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.269
 you are very likely to make a 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.430
 wrong purchase 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.350
 go try max it was hers because you 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.379
 gets anxious and will not be able to 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.909
 breaking up will spend your money up 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.120
 so the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:58.239
 do is study a little clear of 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.949
 see some materials in 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.070
 down in the description I will leave some 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.449
 materials for you to see is but the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.710
 first thing you have to see if 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.640
 Do you have space? 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.430
 the place a place for you is power 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.340
 practice model airplanes and one of 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.920
 best places is usually already are 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.729
 defined by those who are already practicing it 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.130
 the modernism 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.469
 then in your city has a club 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.619
 aeromodelling on a track 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:29.170
 you can go there and see how you do to 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.659
 to join you have this space 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.100
 there it is much safer because it is already 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.100
 prepared for it 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.119
 now if society in your region does not 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.520
 have a specific location for this 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.420
 find a place that is the safest 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.409
 possible spacious powder in trees without 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.049
 nothing blocking then in the air is that 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.469
 do not have cars passing people 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.749
 passing the place far to 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.479
 ensure that while you are flying and 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:07.060
 learning mainly you do not eat 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:11.080
 have no problem in you is if 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.019
 lost and hit a car a person who 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.610
 You could hurt someone then is okay for 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.610
 this I have to look for a location 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.310
 away and also helps 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.100
 interference with communication with 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.140
 where you will be in an area with 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.050
 less magnetic waves are fine 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.780
 the second step would be to purchase the radio 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.800
 You do not need to bring a next kit. 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.960
 all together 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.860
 The aeromodelist works so you have 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.040
 a radio that is where you control or 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.510
 on this radio you can use the same radio 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.230
 for vows were models 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.120
 so start radio is the key piece between 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.440
 all models have to dedicate themselves 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.100
 more to him and then the second to the second 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.980
 step for you is to start modernism is 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.230
 choose a fast one I have a video that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.390
 I'm going to leave me down here too. 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.580
 on youtube for you are you see how 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.680
 choosing an architect is ready 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.280
 You can watch and even if you want. 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:24.010
 to know more is something about modernism is 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.170
 how to write on the channel you arrived at no 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.480
 second step however has first that 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.320
 should if you have a place where you can 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.790
 make the pitch is the second model 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.150
 to choose a radio 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.110
 the third would be you choose your era 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.440
 The model itself is starting to go naked. 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.720
 everyone recommends that it gets easier 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.220
 there are several people who have already learned 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.010
 like several others but I recommend the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.850
 that the majority begins that it is a model 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.890
 coach and the most common in these 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.940
 cases is a cessna type 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.530
 the cessna 182 specific to training 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.030
 and electric 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:14.200
 I indicate electric because it is because he is 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.169
 It's easier, it 's as little as 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.959
 when I was going to buy ready, everything is ready 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:24.640
 It is easier for you to keep it 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.590
 for you to operate it and you do not have any more 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.229
 an item to worry about in your 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.569
 so much learning but each one has a 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.059
 preferably people who prefer 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.439
 You're Admiral and this is not going to 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:39.039
 stop getting started 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:42.969
 I'm just making a recommendation too. 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:48.099
 is preferable on when buying 10 models 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:49.509
 RF kits called tam which is in 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.449
 an acronym in English that goes 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:55.869
 mean almost ready to fly 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:59.559
 and then what is this that normally 

00:04:55.869 --> 00:05:01.719
 have or are missing a radio and a receiver that 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:04.899
 It's what you 've already bought separately for 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:07.869
 operate or is missing the radio and 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:11.770
 battery or maximum radio battery and 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:14.529
 engine is what normally they come there 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.789
 so there are few things missing from 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:21.550
 preferably only one radio and one 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.839
 receiver and not the battery but if you want 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.709
 buy a separate battery also 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:28.509
 It's not hard, then it 's these are 

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:30.309
 some tips to get you started 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.499
 I do not want to do any extensive video 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:35.529
 to vote after doing another 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:38.979
 video to explain yourself a little better 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:42.189
 how to choose one was a better model 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.509
 A little more detail is 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.369
 choose the model 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.619
 I will not restrict myself to just 

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:51.369
 coach talk in a general way 

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:53.649
 because if you already have one is the model that 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:57.789
 Do you want to go for a thing but do not know if 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:58.899
 Are you going to do it then? 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.629
 watch 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:03.009
 I hope you have helped sign up here 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.539
 below you will receive the 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.539
 updates I'll always bet 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:14.009
 more videos and I hope you have 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:14.009
 good 11 a bath if a hug and even more
