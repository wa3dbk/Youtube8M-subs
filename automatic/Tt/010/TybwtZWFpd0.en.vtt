00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.389
 feeling is just overwhelming 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.480
 do not make us better from the game 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.830
 how it went today and what 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.840
 you see what's going on out there that is 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.800
 they are just unbelievable moment 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.539
 of course, outstanding 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.600
 we are compliment to the team 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.180
 super great game and I think in the end 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.580
 earned 3 2 1 kor data leg cramp there 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.610
 on the fence above because I am there longer 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.920
 can stand as ten seconds and that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.329
 at the moment the emotions but right in the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.489
 Cabin when I'm worth the fun with guys 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.020
 probably understand but was 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.239
 incredible evening like the like 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.649
 All season you have to say we have 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 just writing on a wave of 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.149
 Successful somehow and so unbelievable 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 can really describe yourself 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.430
 outstanding time in the moment yes I believe 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.079
 that the team simply has quality 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.539
 even against higher-class teams too 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.800
 exist primarily in the first 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.660
 phase one quarter of an hour 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.920
 have not had that luck 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.239
 quite so well but luck that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.189
 you do not fall behind 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.770
 but then we go out at the moment 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.670
 relatively few do we then many gates 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.490
 and of course that benefits us and 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.810
 also in the middle of course with the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.240
 support from the fans in the back 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 then each step again a bit 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 easier and that is unbelievable the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.330
 attitude i think we had everything 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.100
 Everything really we had from 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.939
 little toe visit to the last 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.680
 throw in the hair tip that we are the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.270
 gates have prevented and that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.619
 Last shot of course and yes 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.150
 incredible performance from us 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.960
 Energy performance from first to the first 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.590
 last second 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.810
 i think klose follow the ball on tom 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.579
 Protector in the tip lay who on me 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.729
 and I love half left purely good 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.430
 broken in yes nice gate the lottery 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.350
 today was a flat hedge have 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.850
 it speculates that the thing is not 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.460
 the the no get and easy ren 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.180
 against or a pure ecstasy pure joy 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.130
 and just let go for basel 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.020
 yes that's another footballer 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.049
 even even people completely clear 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.580
 deserves a little bit more though 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.990
 Playing soccer is just like being in the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.910
 play first league or in the third 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.850
 you have to do the basics you have to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.800
 fight has to keep going fast 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.120
 show willingness to run and that again 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.320
 and then you can do it in one day 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.240
 you can beat every team 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.130
 So let's get together now 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.440
 happy and then if we try 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.240
