00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.380
 It also tastes very good and off you go 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.139
 with the ingredients of our rice salad 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.859
 we need two bags of the rice 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:25.230
 fit tips long grain two bags are 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:32.460
 so to speak, 500 grams of rice salt and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 pepper mayonnaise a can corn one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.629
 can mandarin orange a paprika 1 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.969
 tablespoon curie turkey breast strips the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.390
 There are many at Aldi and turkey breast 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.219
 classic are just completely normal 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.719
 normal sliced â€‹â€‹this 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.000
 then vocally too small with 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.620
 in and that's it actually 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.770
 already as you can really see 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.750
 simple and very delicious as the first 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.229
 he cooks two bags of tea 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.869
 long grain rice and when it's done let it go 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.610
 Cool the first so so once 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.260
 turkey breast strip once 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.869
 turkey breast cut I have here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:22.409
 this is what you do 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:24.450
 Completely also tear to next 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:32.390
 comes the small snipped paprika 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:37.250
 Add a corn and the mandarin 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.250
 I think that looks totally great 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.800
 but that would be too much for the whole year 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.800
 dry 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:00.090
 of course, salt and curry powder so that 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.420
 Now you are completely stirred again 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.770
 careful with each other 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.350
 he tastes best when then 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.050
 But I think that is a day draws 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.310
 of course a matter of taste 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.890
 you can of course immediately 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.390
 distort the whole mingled with each other 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.460
 have come to the end only the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.200
 mayonnaise with this is yours 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.800
 Of course, let alone how much you leave 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.350
 I want to do it in the kimi way 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.650
 therefore about half a bottle of that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.680
 So that's 500 milliliters 250 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.600
 milliliters of mayonnaise that works naturally 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.780
 with a bottle very good because you can 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.580
 so good can push so one more 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.440
 In any case, that's it 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.220
 half bottle and that will now 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.220
 Of course, nice with each other 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.220
 stirred 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:06.270
 find a half bottle of mayonnaise almost 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:10.070
 to 500 grams of rice perfect so and ready 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.410
 is the fruity curry rice salad 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.160
 that is just another 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.959
 Taste experience and it does not have to 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.850
 always be so complicated 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.520
 sometimes life is wonderful too 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.730
 with little simple things so good 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.730
 appetite
