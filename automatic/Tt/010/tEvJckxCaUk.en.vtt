finish<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.060> like<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.210> said<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
finish to it and like I said this is a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.090 
finish to it and like I said this is a
touch<00:01:58.049> cover<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.590> don't<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:58.950> any

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
touch cover so you don't have any

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.530 
touch cover so you don't have any
tactile<00:01:59.610> feedback<00:01:59.969> here

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
tactile feedback here

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.660 
tactile feedback here
however<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.200> buttons<00:02:01.590> are<00:02:01.860> raised<00:02:02.340> up

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
however the buttons are raised up

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.999 
however the buttons are raised up
slightly<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> magnetic<00:02:04.619> cover

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
slightly and this is a magnetic cover

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.760 
slightly and this is a magnetic cover
that<00:02:05.219> attaches<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> surface<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.170> again<00:02:07.619> we

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that attaches to the surface so again we

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.240 
that attaches to the surface so again we
also<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.220> kind<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.640> felt

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
also have kind of a felt

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.550 
also have kind of a felt
finish<00:02:09.759> over<00:02:10.330> here<00:02:10.570> on<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.869> other<00:02:11.050> side<00:02:11.380> as

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
finish over here on the other side as

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.470 
finish over here on the other side as
well<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.980> let's<00:02:12.400> go<00:02:12.520> ahead<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.940> set<00:02:13.300> this

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
well and let's go ahead and set this

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.810 
well and let's go ahead and set this
down<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.960> then<00:02:14.380> take<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.950> look<00:02:15.190> at<00:02:15.400> what<00:02:15.670> else

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
down and then take a look at what else

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.200 
down and then take a look at what else
comes<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.480> box<00:02:17.550> all<00:02:18.550> right<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.820> appears<00:02:19.090> we

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
comes in the box all right it appears we

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.180 
comes in the box all right it appears we
have<00:02:19.240> another<00:02:19.630> piece<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:19.930> tape<00:02:20.290> here<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.680> this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
have another piece of tape here and this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.620 
have another piece of tape here and this
one<00:02:21.370> looks<00:02:21.550> like<00:02:21.640> we<00:02:21.850> have<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.090> actually<00:02:22.420> cut

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
one looks like we have to actually cut

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.920 
one looks like we have to actually cut
it<00:02:27.660> okay

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
it okay

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.620 
it okay
lifting<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.590> up<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.940> can<00:02:31.060> go<00:02:31.180> ahead<00:02:31.300> and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
lifting that up you can go ahead and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.540 
lifting that up you can go ahead and
take<00:02:31.930> out<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.350> actual<00:02:32.740> surface<00:02:33.070> tablet<00:02:35.550> now

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
take out the actual surface tablet now

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.670 
take out the actual surface tablet now
initial<00:02:36.940> impressions<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.690> mean<00:02:38.230> even<00:02:38.590> though

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
initial impressions I mean even though

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.530 
initial impressions I mean even though
it<00:02:38.830> still<00:02:39.070> has<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.370> plastic<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.360> can

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
it still has the plastic on it you can

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.840 
it still has the plastic on it you can
tell<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:40.990> is<00:02:41.050> great<00:02:41.680> build<00:02:42.100> quality<00:02:42.220> but

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
tell this is great build quality but

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.880 
tell this is great build quality but
slightly<00:02:43.239> heavier<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.989> slightly<00:02:44.530> bigger

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
slightly heavier and slightly bigger

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.490 
slightly heavier and slightly bigger
than<00:02:45.190> Apple's<00:02:45.700> iPad<00:02:46.000> tablet<00:02:46.780> which<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.470> course

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
than Apple's iPad tablet which of course

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.220 
than Apple's iPad tablet which of course
is<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.220> surfaces<00:02:48.700> main<00:02:48.940> competitor<00:02:49.600> as<00:02:49.750> of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
is the surfaces main competitor as of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.190 
is the surfaces main competitor as of
now<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.800> tablet<00:02:51.280> space<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:52.090> here<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.020> the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
now in the tablet space so here is the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.160 
now in the tablet space so here is the
third<00:02:54.010> generation<00:02:54.640> iPad<00:02:55.030> as<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.780> can<00:02:55.930> see

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
third generation iPad as you can see

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.870 
third generation iPad as you can see
there<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> pretty<00:02:57.010> significant<00:02:57.730> difference

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
there is a pretty significant difference

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.110 
there is a pretty significant difference
in<00:02:58.300> size<00:02:58.690> between<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.590> surface<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.670> iPad

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
in size between the surface and the iPad

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.820 
in size between the surface and the iPad
but<00:03:01.660> enough<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.050> let's<00:03:02.140> go<00:03:02.440> ahead<00:03:02.560> and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
but enough of that let's go ahead and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.340 
but enough of that let's go ahead and
set<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.340> iPad<00:03:03.730> on<00:03:03.910> down<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.390> look<00:03:05.080> at<00:03:05.230> what

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
set the iPad on down and look at what

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.750 
set the iPad on down and look at what
else<00:03:05.440> comes<00:03:05.739> in<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:05.950> box<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.340> then<00:03:06.580> we'll

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
else comes in the box and then we'll

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.199 
else comes in the box and then we'll
come<00:03:06.970> back<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.720> surface<00:03:07.959> tablet<00:03:08.620> so

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
come back to the surface tablet so

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.760 
come back to the surface tablet so
setting<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.330> off<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.720> side<00:03:10.810> here<00:03:11.020> let's

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
setting this off to the side here let's

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.130 
setting this off to the side here let's
go<00:03:11.920> ahead<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.459> hold<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.180> booklet<00:03:13.630> out<00:03:13.959> of

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
go ahead and hold this booklet out of

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.460 
go ahead and hold this booklet out of
the<00:03:14.290> middle<00:03:14.650> which<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.670> attached<00:03:16.420> via<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.200> piece

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
the middle which is attached via a piece

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.800 
the middle which is attached via a piece
of<00:03:17.620> sticky<00:03:18.130> tape<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.790> back<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:19.540> right

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
of sticky tape on the back of this right

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.420 
of sticky tape on the back of this right
here<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:26.140> pulling<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.680> out<00:03:26.860> this<00:03:27.100> looks<00:03:27.310> like

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
here so pulling this out this looks like

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.729 
here so pulling this out this looks like
a<00:03:27.489> simple<00:03:27.910> QuickStart<00:03:28.690> guide<00:03:28.930> we<00:03:29.590> don't

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
a simple QuickStart guide we don't

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.590 
a simple QuickStart guide we don't
really<00:03:29.980> need<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.190> honestly<00:03:30.940> probably<00:03:31.330> not

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
really need that honestly probably not

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.420 
really need that honestly probably not
even<00:03:31.720> going<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.110> use<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.440> setting<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.340> the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
even going to use it setting that to the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.949 
even going to use it setting that to the
side<00:03:33.670> now<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.150> have<00:03:34.450> some<00:03:34.660> more<00:03:34.840> information
