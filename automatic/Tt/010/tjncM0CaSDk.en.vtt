00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
crash holla right and so what would have

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.860 
crash holla right and so what would have
been<00:01:25.930> on<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:26.170> plane<00:01:26.590> it's<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.220> cargo<00:01:27.700> plane<00:01:27.870> so

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
been on that plane it's a cargo plane so

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.690 
been on that plane it's a cargo plane so
I<00:01:28.900> mean<00:01:29.260> thankfully<00:01:29.650> obviously<00:01:30.430> it's<00:01:30.550> not<00:01:30.670> a

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
I mean thankfully obviously it's not a

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.340 
I mean thankfully obviously it's not a
passenger<00:01:31.300> plane<00:01:31.450> or<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.750> death<00:01:32.020> toll<00:01:32.230> would

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
passenger plane or the death toll would

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.050 
passenger plane or the death toll would
have<00:01:32.470> been<00:01:32.590> much<00:01:32.740> much<00:01:32.980> higher<00:01:33.250> but<00:01:33.580> what

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
have been much much higher but what

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.490 
have been much much higher but what
would<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.240> plane<00:01:34.660> like<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:34.900> have<00:01:35.290> been

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
would a plane like that have been

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.370

typical<00:01:56.260> cargo<00:01:57.190> hub<00:01:57.460> by<00:01:58.150> all<00:01:58.390> accounts

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
typical cargo hub by all accounts

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.690 
typical cargo hub by all accounts
carrying<00:01:59.380> military<00:02:00.630> equipment<00:02:01.630> vehicles

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700

packaged<00:02:03.700> cargo<00:02:04.240> that<00:02:04.450> sort<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:04.870> thing<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.260> have

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
packaged cargo that sort of thing I have

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.219 
packaged cargo that sort of thing I have
been<00:02:06.070> on<00:02:06.220> some<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.610> these<00:02:06.870> military<00:02:07.870> cargo

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
been on some of these military cargo

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.740 
been on some of these military cargo
flights<00:02:08.680> out<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.280> Bagram<00:02:09.910> it's<00:02:10.180> one<00:02:10.570> of<00:02:10.600> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
flights out of Bagram it's one of the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.560 
flights out of Bagram it's one of the
ways<00:02:10.960> they<00:02:11.320> hold<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:12.190> really<00:02:12.760> heavy<00:02:12.970> weapons

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
ways they hold the really heavy weapons

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.910 
ways they hold the really heavy weapons
have

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
have

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.130 
have
gear<00:02:14.250> out<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.730> there<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.630> know<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:15.990> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
gear out of there but you know it's a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.010 
gear out of there but you know it's a
very<00:02:16.650> precise<00:02:17.450> engineering<00:02:18.450> operation

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
very precise engineering operation

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.339 
very precise engineering operation
really<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.830> tie<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.250> stuff<00:02:20.940> down<00:02:21.300> inside<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
really to tie this stuff down inside the

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.910 
really to tie this stuff down inside the
plane<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:23.520> very<00:02:23.970> precise<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.650> lot<00:02:25.890> of

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
plane it's very precise so a lot of

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.820 
plane it's very precise so a lot of
questions<00:02:26.400> about<00:02:26.610> maybe<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.780> no<00:02:28.290> one<00:02:28.560> knows

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
questions about maybe and no one knows

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.360 
questions about maybe and no one knows
maybe<00:02:29.640> somehow<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.720> cargo<00:02:31.170> shifted<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.830> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
maybe somehow the cargo shifted and that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.930 
maybe somehow the cargo shifted and that
contributed<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.450> catastrophe
