I<00:00:27.000> think<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.570> need<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.750> go<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.439> size<00:00:28.470> with

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
I think you need to go up a size with

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.250 
I think you need to go up a size with
the<00:00:29.039> specter<00:00:29.689> one<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> ways<00:00:31.019> they've

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the specter one of the ways they've

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.049 
the specter one of the ways they've
reduced<00:00:31.410> weight<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.399> through<00:00:32.669> their<00:00:32.820> use<00:00:33.030> of

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
reduced weight is through their use of

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.810 
reduced weight is through their use of
event<00:00:33.989> three-layer<00:00:34.890> super<00:00:35.399> lightweight

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the same time highly breathable so

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.709 
the same time highly breathable so
really<00:00:41.640> suitable<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.090> high<00:00:42.450> aerobic

one of the other innovative ways they've

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
one of the other innovative ways they've
reduced<00:00:48.480> weight<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.469> through<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.950> tornado

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250

is two pieces of velcro come together on
the<00:00:57.809> outside<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.320> each<00:00:58.440> opening<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.370> roll<00:00:59.730> it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the outside of each opening you roll it

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.760 
the outside of each opening you roll it
over<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.420> then<00:01:00.840> secure<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.440> with<00:01:01.559> an<00:01:01.680> elastic

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
over and then secure it with an elastic

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.850 
over and then secure it with an elastic
hook<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:03.090> works<00:01:03.359> exactly<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.019> same<00:01:04.110> way<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

at<00:01:08.159> keeping<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> water<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.880> let's<00:01:09.869> take<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
at keeping the water out let's take a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:38.610 
at keeping the water out let's take a
look<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.619> how<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.920> works

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.960 

now<00:01:39.620> we've<00:01:39.830> taken<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.190> look<00:01:40.340> at<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.580> tornado

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
now we've taken a look at the tornado

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.030 
now we've taken a look at the tornado
roll<00:01:41.270> closure<00:01:41.540> system<00:01:42.110> let's<00:01:42.560> have<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.770> look<00:01:42.920> at

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
roll closure system let's have a look at

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.830 
roll closure system let's have a look at
the<00:01:43.100> hood<00:01:45.580> now<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.640> hood<00:01:46.880> has<00:01:47.060> no<00:01:47.300> adjusters

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
the hood now the hood has no adjusters

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.930 
the hood now the hood has no adjusters
but<00:01:48.080> it's<00:01:48.230> kept<00:01:48.470> nice<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:48.980> snug<00:01:49.220> through<00:01:49.820> the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
but it's kept nice and snug through the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.040 
but it's kept nice and snug through the
use<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.120> elastic<00:01:50.810> at<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:50.990> back<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:53.360> elastic

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
use of elastic at the back and elastic

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.740 
use of elastic at the back and elastic
around<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.380> outside<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.950> hood<00:01:55.750> Montaigne

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
around the outside of the hood Montaigne

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.600 
around the outside of the hood Montaigne
designed<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.350> hood<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.740> work<00:01:57.980> with<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.310> paint

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
designed the hood to work with a paint

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.490 
designed the hood to work with a paint
cap<00:01:58.910> but<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.390> think<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.810> works<00:01:59.990> well<00:02:00.260> enough

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
cap but I think it works well enough

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500 
cap but I think it works well enough
without<00:02:00.620> one<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:01.550> if<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.790> do<00:02:02.030> want<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.270> use<00:02:02.480> a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
without one but if you do want to use a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.180 
without one but if you do want to use a
peaked<00:02:02.840> cap<00:02:02.930> they've<00:02:03.650> got<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:03.830> natty

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
peaked cap they've got a natty

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.950 
peaked cap they've got a natty
attachment<00:02:04.820> at<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.970> back<00:02:05.150> of<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.360> hood<00:02:05.540> which

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
attachment at the back of the hood which

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.020 
attachment at the back of the hood which
secures<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:07.370> if<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:07.550> want<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.790> roll

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
secures it and so if you want to roll

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.609 
secures it and so if you want to roll
away<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:08.450> cap<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.140> hood<00:02:09.260> at<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> same

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
away the cap and the hood at the same

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.620 
away the cap and the hood at the same
time<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.310> can<00:02:10.580> do<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:13.450> arms<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
time you can do so the arms of the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.900 
time you can do so the arms of the
jacket<00:02:15.050> are<00:02:15.230> articulated<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.550> there's<00:02:16.730> no

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
jacket are articulated so there's no
