00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that's gonna give it is that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.719 
that's gonna give it is that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
around on your back what it is is it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.609 
around on your back what it is is it
gives<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.689> structure<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.380> still

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
gives it that that structure but still

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.229 
gives it that that structure but still
on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> inside<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.399> tie<00:02:08.580> off<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
on the inside we can tie off of that and

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.550 
on the inside we can tie off of that and
create<00:02:09.479> those<00:02:09.599> different<00:02:09.929> compartments<00:02:10.410> so

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
create those different compartments so

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.990 
create those different compartments so
things<00:02:10.920> don't<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.220> all<00:02:11.459> moved<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.849> together

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
things don't just all moved in together

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.910 
things don't just all moved in together
and<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:13.230> know<00:02:13.319> speaking

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and you know speaking

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
and you know speaking
movement<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.120> really<00:02:15.390> designed<00:02:15.569> for

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
movement this is really designed for

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.710 
movement this is really designed for
people<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.650> get<00:02:16.980> out<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.030> go<00:02:18.270> not<00:02:18.480> just

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
people to get out and and go not just

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.530 
people to get out and and go not just
for<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.709> know<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.980> slow<00:02:20.370> hike<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
for a you know a slow hike up the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.180 
for a you know a slow hike up the
mountain<00:02:21.569> this<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.380> people<00:02:22.620> who<00:02:22.739> move<00:02:22.920> and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
mountain this is for people who move and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.680 
mountain this is for people who move and
move<00:02:23.400> quickly<00:02:23.430> absolutely<00:02:24.270> or<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.540> don't

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
move quickly absolutely or just don't

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.910 
move quickly absolutely or just don't
want<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.840> feel<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.110> weight<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.500> bag<00:02:25.650> and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
want to feel the weight of the bag and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.800 
want to feel the weight of the bag and
their<00:02:26.099> gear<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:27.060> basically<00:02:27.390> tries<00:02:27.690> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
their gear just just basically tries to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.880 
their gear just just basically tries to
dissipate<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> weight<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.500> their<00:02:28.620> gear

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
dissipate the weight of their gear

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.050 
dissipate the weight of their gear
without<00:02:29.160> even<00:02:29.370> thinking<00:02:29.700> about<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.940> weight

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
without even thinking about the weight

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.309 
without even thinking about the weight
of<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.209> pack<00:02:30.390> because<00:02:30.840> there's<00:02:31.050> really<00:02:31.170> not

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
of the pack because there's really not

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.320 
of the pack because there's really not
much<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.530> speak<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.950> there<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.790> like<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.209> said

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
much to speak of there so like I said

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.550 
much to speak of there so like I said
just<00:02:33.540> great<00:02:33.720> dissipation<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.380> weight

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
just great dissipation of the weight

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.809 
just great dissipation of the weight
right<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.770> there<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.160> rod<00:02:35.310> does<00:02:35.489> come<00:02:35.670> on

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
right in there the rod does come on

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.420 
right in there the rod does come on
right<00:02:36.030> under<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.300> hips<00:02:36.450> right<00:02:36.630> there<00:02:36.780> too<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
right under the hips right there too the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.940 
right under the hips right there too the
suspension<00:02:38.970> system<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.420> adjustable<00:02:40.080> talked<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
suspension system is adjustable talked a

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.559 
suspension system is adjustable talked a
little<00:02:41.069> bit<00:02:41.220> about<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.550> sir<00:02:41.910> maybe<00:02:42.239> what<00:02:42.450> its

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
little bit about that sir maybe what its

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.089 
little bit about that sir maybe what its
gonna<00:02:42.630> do<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:42.989> slide<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.709> down<00:02:43.769> till<00:02:44.069> we

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
gonna do is slide up and down till we

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.610 
gonna do is slide up and down till we
get<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.370> maximum<00:02:44.730> height<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.620> abdomen

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
get to the maximum height of the abdomen

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.160 
get to the maximum height of the abdomen
or<00:02:46.739> overall<00:02:47.370> torso<00:02:47.760> length<00:02:47.970> cinch<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.900> off<00:02:48.989> on

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
or overall torso length cinch it off on

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.570 
or overall torso length cinch it off on
the<00:02:49.260> inside<00:02:49.590> tie<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:49.950> down<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.400> it's<00:02:50.519> gonna

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the inside tie it down and it's gonna

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.699 
the inside tie it down and it's gonna
allow<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.150> really<00:02:51.330> hold<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.780> place<00:02:51.989> you

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
allow it to really hold in place you

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.229 
allow it to really hold in place you
might<00:02:52.830> come<00:02:53.010> up<00:02:53.130> just<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.370> little<00:02:53.400> bit<00:02:53.730> but<00:02:53.910> it's

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
might come up just a little bit but it's

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.610 
might come up just a little bit but it's
basically<00:02:54.510> not<00:02:54.690> gonna<00:02:54.870> feel<00:02:55.140> like<00:02:55.260> you've<00:02:55.410> got

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
basically not gonna feel like you've got

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.690 
basically not gonna feel like you've got
something<00:02:55.830> restricting<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:56.549> you're

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
something restricting you as you're
