00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.640 
I think if you're like me and you were
looking<00:04:35.120> for<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.330> primer<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:36.229> try<00:04:36.380> for<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
looking for a primer to try for the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.290 
looking for a primer to try for the
first<00:04:36.680> time<00:04:37.009> I<00:04:37.310> definitely<00:04:37.699> think<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.150> one

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
first time I definitely think this one

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.059 
first time I definitely think this one
would<00:04:38.419> be<00:04:38.479> really<00:04:38.780> great<00:04:39.080> it's<00:04:39.259> only<00:04:39.470> like<00:04:39.650> 7

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
97 or something at walmart so I think

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.200 
97 or something at walmart so I think
that's<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.860> really<00:04:42.919> great<00:04:43.490> choice<00:04:43.940> for<00:04:43.970> a

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.770 
lately I've been finding that I needed
something<00:06:31.580> almost<00:06:31.880> like<00:06:32.120> you<00:06:32.300> know<00:06:32.419> that

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
something almost like you know that

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.120 
something almost like you know that
people<00:06:32.960> a<00:06:33.110> lot<00:06:33.289> of<00:06:33.409> people<00:06:33.530> use<00:06:33.830> the

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
people a lot of people use the

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.070 
people a lot of people use the
clarisonic<00:06:34.880> and<00:06:35.060> I<00:06:35.240> really<00:06:35.539> loved<00:06:35.750> how<00:06:35.930> it's

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
clarisonic and I really loved how it's

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.529 
clarisonic and I really loved how it's
just<00:06:36.320> something<00:06:36.650> that's<00:06:36.860> really<00:06:37.539> buffing

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
just something that's really buffing

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:40.070 
just something that's really buffing
into<00:06:38.900> your<00:06:39.050> skin<00:06:39.320> and<00:06:39.469> I<00:06:39.529> felt<00:06:39.740> like<00:06:39.800> I

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
into your skin and I felt like I

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.839 
into your skin and I felt like I
did<00:06:40.229> something<00:06:40.560> like<00:06:40.680> that<00:06:40.740> without<00:06:41.490> the

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:41.849 
did something like that without the

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.179 
did something like that without the
money<00:06:42.000> and<00:06:42.300> without<00:06:42.930> just<00:06:43.379> also<00:06:43.740> the

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:44.189 
money and without just also the

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:45.559 
money and without just also the
harshness<00:06:44.460> because<00:06:44.879> I<00:06:44.939> really<00:06:45.210> sensitive

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 
harshness because I really sensitive

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.779 
harshness because I really sensitive
skin<00:06:45.900> this<00:06:46.319> is<00:06:46.470> a<00:06:46.530> great<00:06:46.740> alternative<00:06:46.860> you<00:06:47.610> do

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789
