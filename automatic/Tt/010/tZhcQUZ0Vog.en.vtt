00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
blocks bricks fall off the side so

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.269 
blocks bricks fall off the side so
though<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.519> levels<00:00:29.820> get<00:00:29.939> more<00:00:30.210> difficult

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
falling off if too many fall off you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
falling off if too many fall off you
won't<00:00:42.360> complete<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.989> level<00:00:43.579> if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.700> don't

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
for the level a green ones turned into

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:59.860

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
looks like I may lose that so this is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.549 
looks like I may lose that so this is
actually<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> pretty<00:01:02.910> fun<00:01:03.149> game<00:01:03.350> there's<00:01:04.350> quite

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
gonna kind of do this a little bit

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.929 
gonna kind of do this a little bit
slower<00:01:39.560> okay<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.070> gonna<00:01:41.280> help<00:01:41.610> come

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.590 
slower okay now it's gonna help come
down<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.420> let's<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.259> oh<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:45.540> don't

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
down so let's see if I can oh I don't

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.810 
down so let's see if I can oh I don't
know<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.290> those<00:01:46.470> two<00:01:46.680> big<00:01:46.920> pieces<00:01:47.130> off<00:01:47.549> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
know with those two big pieces off I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
know with those two big pieces off I
might<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.270> pass<00:01:48.540> oh<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:51.540> did<00:01:51.899> look<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.710> did

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
might not pass oh I did look like I did

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.109 
might not pass oh I did look like I did
that<00:01:53.159> big<00:01:53.369> piece<00:01:54.829> I<00:01:55.829> guess<00:01:56.189> wasn't<00:01:56.640> enough<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that big piece I guess wasn't enough to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
that big piece I guess wasn't enough to
keep<00:01:57.390> me<00:01:58.610> from<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.820> passing<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> level<00:02:00.990> let's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
keep me from not passing the level let's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.430 
keep me from not passing the level let's
see<00:02:01.829> here<00:02:03.590> alright

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.690 

I<00:02:10.010> think<00:02:11.010> I<00:02:11.100> might<00:02:11.280> past<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.730> level<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.120> well

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
I think I might past that level as well

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.240 
I think I might past that level as well
so<00:02:14.700> pretty<00:02:15.270> fun<00:02:15.450> games<00:02:15.690> called<00:02:16.020> glass<00:02:16.350> tower<00:02:16.740> 3
