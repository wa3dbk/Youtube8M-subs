videos I'll quickly do a brief recap
basically<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.370> nuts<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.670> bolts<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
basically the nuts and bolts one of the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.069 
NASA videos comment Ison meteor shower
it's<00:00:58.980> called<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.879> narrator<00:01:00.180> says<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> or

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it's called the narrator says in it or

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.579 
it's called the narrator says in it or
employees<00:01:01.699> comet<00:01:02.699> ison<00:01:03.090> will<00:01:03.420> hit<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.290> Sun

employees comet ison will hit the Sun

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.300 
employees comet ison will hit the Sun
now<00:01:05.220> let's<00:01:05.580> put<00:01:05.760> our<00:01:05.850> side<00:01:06.150> okay<00:01:07.040> if<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> does

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
now let's put our side okay if it does

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
now let's put our side okay if it does
or<00:01:08.340> doesn't<00:01:08.640> make<00:01:08.909> nods<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.869> does<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.170> odds

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
or doesn't make nods it does make odds

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
or doesn't make nods it does make odds
dependent<00:01:11.070> obviously<00:01:11.490> naturally<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:12.090> my

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
dependent obviously naturally but my

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.530 
dependent obviously naturally but my
next<00:01:12.659> question<00:01:13.200> okay<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.090> based<00:01:15.090> around<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
next question okay is based around the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.050 
next question okay is based around the
NASA<00:01:15.810> trajectories<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.850> first

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
NASA trajectories now the first

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450 
NASA trajectories now the first
trajectory<00:01:18.720> they<00:01:19.200> had<00:01:19.470> two<00:01:19.650> will<00:01:19.979> Vance<00:01:20.220> per

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
trajectory they had two will Vance per

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.789 
trajectory they had two will Vance per
second<00:01:21.030> trajectory<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.930> comet<00:01:22.259> ison<00:01:22.590> because

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
second trajectory for comet ison because

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.200 
second trajectory for comet ison because
obviously<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.900> comment<00:01:24.900> had<00:01:24.990> changed<00:01:25.470> course

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
obviously the comment had changed course

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.550 
obviously the comment had changed course
so<00:01:27.210> they<00:01:27.270> say<00:01:28.130> now<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.570> lot<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.630> people<00:01:30.689> say<00:01:31.079> well

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so they say now a lot of people say well

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.990 
so they say now a lot of people say well
comments<00:01:31.950> don't<00:01:32.040> change<00:01:32.310> course<00:01:32.579> they're

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
comments don't change course they're

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.530 
comments don't change course they're
very<00:01:33.270> easy<00:01:33.360> probable<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.770> doesn't<00:01:34.979> happen

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
very easy probable and it doesn't happen

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.899 
very easy probable and it doesn't happen
I'm<00:01:36.540> sorry<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.140> I've<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.590> NASA<00:01:38.070> made<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> mistake

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I'm sorry but I've a NASA made a mistake

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.270 
I'm sorry but I've a NASA made a mistake
on<00:01:38.939> their<00:01:39.150> first<00:01:39.329> trajectory<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.280> commands

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
on their first trajectory or commands

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.010 
on their first trajectory or commands
change<00:01:41.579> cause<00:01:41.759> either<00:01:41.970> way<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.750> fire<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
change cause either way they fire a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.620 
change cause either way they fire a
second<00:01:43.470> trajectory<00:01:43.950> now<00:01:44.250> my<00:01:45.030> question<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
second trajectory now my question is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
second trajectory now my question is
around<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.140> trajectory<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:48.049> what<00:01:49.340> what<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
around this trajectory now what what I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.740 
around this trajectory now what what I
don't<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.560> forgive<00:01:52.560> me<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:52.799> I'm<00:01:52.920> wrong

you<00:03:37.659> look<00:03:37.900> at<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.139> angle<00:03:38.379> and<00:03:38.709> then<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.340> look

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
you look at that angle and then you look

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.039

at the speed at which is coming out and
then<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.620> tell<00:03:41.859> me<00:03:41.889> but<00:03:42.699> yes<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.269> will<00:03:43.449> go

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
then you tell me but yes it will go

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.050 
then you tell me but yes it will go
round<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.199> Sun<00:03:44.439> and<00:03:44.739> come<00:03:45.459> back<00:03:45.609> at<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:45.909> same
