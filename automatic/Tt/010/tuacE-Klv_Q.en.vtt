00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
the boxes we've moved a couple times in

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.949 
the boxes we've moved a couple times in
people<00:02:12.220> who<00:02:12.370> moved<00:02:13.150> for<00:02:13.390> us<00:02:13.510> weren't<00:02:13.750> always

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
people who moved for us weren't always

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.600 
people who moved for us weren't always
the<00:02:14.200> most<00:02:14.380> careful<00:02:14.770> or<00:02:14.890> appreciative<00:02:15.459> of

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
the most careful or appreciative of

the most careful or appreciative of
collector<00:02:16.510> collectibles<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:19.510> looks<00:02:19.660> like

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
collector collectibles so it looks like

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.030 
collector collectibles so it looks like
there<00:02:19.930> used<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.080> be<00:02:20.170> some<00:02:20.380> tape<00:02:20.560> here<00:02:20.800> I'm<00:02:20.890> not

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
there used to be some tape here I'm not

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.320 
there used to be some tape here I'm not
sure<00:02:21.190> if<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.340> came<00:02:21.610> with<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.880> box<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.270> that

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
sure if that came with the box but that

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.280 
sure if that came with the box but that
was<00:02:22.569> taped<00:02:23.380> during<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:24.550> move<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.630> think<00:02:25.900> that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
was taped during a move I think that

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.540
