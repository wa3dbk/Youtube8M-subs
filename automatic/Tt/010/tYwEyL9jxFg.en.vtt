00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.319
 2013 was a mixed year for 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.210
 nintendo on the one hand his laptop has 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.800
 really took off with games 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.990
 strong a new version of the machine 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.799
 more affordable and sales that are 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.170
 soared 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.430
 on the other his living room console drags the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.529
 paw and experience great 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.180
 difficulties in finding a buyer in a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.900
 turbulent climate for the builder 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.939

 philippe lavouÃ© general manager of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.720
 Nintendo France analyzes the past year 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.250
 and the paths of these consoles in 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.410
 starting with his champion the 3ds 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.980
 when very beautiful end of year on the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.800
 3ds that stands out as the console the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.800
 most sold of the market we sold 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.489
 nearly a million units over the year 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.010
 2013 and beyond the consoles what is 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.800
 quite remarkable are the sales 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.379
 we sold 1 million 600 thousand 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.160
 games more than in 2012 so a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.199
 very very sharp acceleration is deserved 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.199
 because we had a quality line up 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810
 2 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.610
 of all the great games that was 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.230
 presented on the end of the year it is 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.290
 it's the only one that's strong 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.290
 progression 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.350
 and beyond our expectations to be 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.149
 completely transparent and then a 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.130
 90% increase compared to 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.899
 previous opus which leaves us to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.310
 think with this new pokemon x and y 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.840
 we recruited a new 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.469
 generation of players so that's 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.289
 extremely encouraging then the 2d s7 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.700
 about 180 thousand units sold since 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.909
 October 12 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.460
 so this is it's a result 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.740
 quite quite honorable and that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.570
 allowed us to give a dynamic 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.299
 to the entire segment on on the end 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.869
 year and it certainly allowed us 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.369
 to accelerate segment penetration 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.380
 went looking for generations of 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.340
 players that they are asking themselves the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.550
 question of passing the cap of the 3ds for 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.489
 a fairly objective reason for price 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.920
 price entry of the console is 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.200
 certainly to go for more 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.000
 more children on over the end period 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.890
 of year which is traditionally 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.890
 favorable to their recruitment 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.540
 more than encouraging record for the 3ds 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.700
 so that of the wii u is much less 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.290
 jubilant the living room console 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.480
 nintendo suffers all the more since 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.910
 the arrival of ps4 and xbox one 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.760
 released a year after the wii or the rattrap 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.500
 already their delay a delicate situation 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.980
 for nintendo who does not surrender 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.980
 so far 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.900
 on the front of the wii where we still 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.630
 settings to do 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.850
 very clearly the volumes are below 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.860
 of our expectations 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.170
 all the same 180 miles sale we are on 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.330
 an installed base of 300 thousand units 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.709
 the success or otherwise of a platform 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.959
 anyway it's our belief at 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.730
 Nintendo's first and foremost 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.250
 proposition of game to the quality of the games 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.040
 probably be louis or we sinned and 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.320
 it is recognized one by a deficit of 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.300
 great proposals especially in the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.060
 early-year phase 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.680
 so we missed this phase this phase 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.330
 dynamic what a plateau phase that 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.150
 we actually knew about the 3ds 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:27.310
 is what we managed to get around and 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.870
 developing a lot more rhythm in 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.730
 the game proposition so I think that 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.250
 the wii u is different she has 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.110
 a lot of potential we still have 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.810
 a lot of adjustments to make 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.230
 and then we have a game that is likely to 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.940
 give us a very strong acceleration 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.430
 it's mario kart 8 at our studies show 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.720
 it's one of the most anticipated games 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.130
 of the year 2014 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.310
 we have numbers that give us the 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.310
 fear of heights 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.300
 we still have some work left 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.880
 we have not finished 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.950
 to convince and explain what 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.990
 proposes the gamepad is what offers the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.100
 wiiu of different is greater than the 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.080
 wii if nintendo does not restart their 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.970
 living room console with games the wii u 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.690
 is becoming an accident 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.030
 industrial 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.370
 these were the words of the CEO of 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.650
 micromania early january a spike of 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.600
 distributor visibly dissatisfied with 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.500
 sales of the wiiu 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.720
 we always listen with a lot 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.890
 of attention the feedbacks of our 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.140
 distributors but I believe it is 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.770
 important to remember that our our 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:36.680
 activity has nothing to standardize and at 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.260
 level of big hits we would like 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.560
 obviously have a more rhythm 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.290
 supported and have more sales 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.080
 important we learned to respect 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.240
 also the time of understanding our 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.550
 proposals by consumers on 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.440
 is probably in a market that is 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.730
 more complex than it was 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.890
 still a short time in the Japanese of 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.240
 docks or sow which means originality 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.020
 for nintendo it's something 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.380
 Very important 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.180
 this desire to deliver originality 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.190
 sometimes can take a little bit of 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.120
 time so we understand the impatience we 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.400
 is all impatient 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.670
 we are all looking forward to playing mario 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.300
 kart 8 we are 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.190
 all looking forward to playing this character 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.470
 but the time of creation is sometimes 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.980
 a little bit different from the time of 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.810
 trade 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.900
 we should 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.889
 to see the long-awaited acceleration on 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.889
 over the coming year
