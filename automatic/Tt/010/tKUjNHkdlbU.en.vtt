little<00:06:54.120> circles<00:06:54.510> what<00:06:55.140> you<00:06:55.260> want<00:06:55.440> to<00:06:55.530> do<00:06:55.680> is

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
little circles what you want to do is

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.030 
little circles what you want to do is
start<00:06:56.970> from<00:06:57.390> the<00:06:57.540> center<00:06:57.900> and<00:06:58.020> work<00:06:58.110> your<00:06:58.950> way

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
start from the center and work your way

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.030 
start from the center and work your way
straight<00:06:59.580> to<00:06:59.610> the<00:06:59.910> edge<00:07:00.080> then<00:07:01.080> turn<00:07:01.920> your

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
straight to the edge then turn your

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.370 
straight to the edge then turn your
optics<00:07:02.460> and<00:07:02.810> repeat<00:07:03.810> again<00:07:04.350> until<00:07:04.860> you<00:07:05.010> get

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
optics and repeat again until you get

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.810 
optics and repeat again until you get
360-degree<00:07:07.380> coverage<00:07:07.620> you<00:07:08.280> basically<00:07:08.580> want

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
360-degree coverage you basically want

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.880 
360-degree coverage you basically want
to<00:07:08.880> try<00:07:09.060> doing<00:07:09.420> this<00:07:09.540> just<00:07:09.930> like<00:07:10.200> spokes<00:07:10.560> on<00:07:10.830> a

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:10.890 
to try doing this just like spokes on a

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.130 
to try doing this just like spokes on a
wheel<00:07:11.010> from<00:07:11.700> the<00:07:11.880> center<00:07:12.240> straight<00:07:12.900> to<00:07:13.050> the

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.140 
wheel from the center straight to the

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.620 
wheel from the center straight to the
outside<00:07:13.500> edge<00:07:13.650> then<00:07:14.220> turn<00:07:14.580> and<00:07:14.790> repeat<00:07:15.360> until

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
outside edge then turn and repeat until

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:25.519 
outside edge then turn and repeat until
it's<00:07:15.930> completely<00:07:16.260> done

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:25.529
