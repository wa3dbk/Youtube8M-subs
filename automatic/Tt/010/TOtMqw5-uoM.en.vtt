00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
in the box as always is the case itself

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.689 
in the box as always is the case itself
and<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:52.050> user's<00:00:52.500> manual<00:00:52.890> that's<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.520> need

1000 erekle is heading in a whole
different<00:00:58.109> direction<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.829> terms<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.430> design

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
different direction in terms of design

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
different direction in terms of design
it<00:01:00.180> might<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> design<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it might not be the design you

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.439 
it might not be the design you
necessarily<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> lot<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> people

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
necessarily like but a lot of people

including<00:01:03.600> myself<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.949> liked<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> simple

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
including myself really liked it simple

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
including myself really liked it simple
and<00:01:06.119> minimalistic<00:01:06.510> designs<00:01:07.020> when<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> comes

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and minimalistic designs when it comes

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.070 
and minimalistic designs when it comes
to<00:01:08.100> cases<00:01:08.490> well<00:01:08.939> let's<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.330> cases<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:09.900> other

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to cases well let's just cases but other

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.660 
to cases well let's just cases but other
components<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.710> well<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.100> find<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.549> really

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

gaming<00:01:16.500> case<00:01:16.680> designs<00:01:17.100> they're<00:01:17.549> slowly

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
gaming case designs they're slowly

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.450 
gaming case designs they're slowly
moving<00:01:18.360> away<00:01:18.630> from<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.229> design<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.770> go<00:01:20.220> for

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
moving away from that design and go for

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.820 
moving away from that design and go for
more<00:01:20.670> minimalistic<00:01:21.630> designs<00:01:21.990> well<00:01:22.590> let's<00:01:22.740> not

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
more minimalistic designs well let's not

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.130 
more minimalistic designs well let's not
say<00:01:23.130> move<00:01:23.430> away<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.479> add<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.900> their

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
say move away more like add to their

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 
say move away more like add to their
