skull and there's a little dip so that's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.779 
skull and there's a little dip so that's
government<00:01:19.700> vessel<00:01:19.970> 16<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.429> turn<00:01:22.429> back<00:01:22.580> around

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
government vessel 16 so turn back around

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
the second set of patches is a white one

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.410 
the second set of patches is a white one
goes<00:01:29.179> a<00:01:29.660> little<00:01:30.170> bit<00:01:30.380> in<00:01:30.500> front<00:01:30.890> of<00:01:31.099> and<00:01:31.520> above

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
the here on the temple and then the tan

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.430 
the here on the temple and then the tan
same<00:01:38.179> spot<00:01:38.509> on<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.720> other<00:01:38.840> side

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.080 

yeah<00:01:43.440> so<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:44.010> bit<00:01:44.190> above<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.850> front

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
yeah so a little bit above and in front

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.990 
yeah so a little bit above and in front
of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> V<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:46.080> front<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> ear<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.850> can

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
of the V in front of the ear and you can

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.800 
of the V in front of the ear and you can
actually<00:01:48.150> use<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> headband<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.350> help<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
actually use a headband to help you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.830 
actually use a headband to help you
attach<00:01:51.810> these<00:01:52.080> or<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.530> use<00:01:52.680> hair<00:01:53.280> pins<00:01:53.840> if

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
attach these or you can use hair pins if

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.400 
attach these or you can use hair pins if
that's<00:01:55.370> better<00:01:56.370> for<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.910> then<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:58.140> last

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
that's better for you and then the last

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.219 
that's better for you and then the last
white<00:01:59.040> patch<00:01:59.400> goes<00:01:59.910> on<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.510> very<00:02:00.660> top<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
white patch goes on the very top of the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
white patch goes on the very top of the
head<00:02:03.320> like<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.490> helps<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.149> create

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
head like so so this helps to create

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.530 
head like so so this helps to create
alpha<00:02:09.660> waves<00:02:10.289> which<00:02:10.770> are<00:02:10.979> waves<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.390> get

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
alpha waves which are waves that you get

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.350 
alpha waves which are waves that you get
when<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.810> meditate<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:14.610> are<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.120> more

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
when you meditate and you are in a more

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.690 
when you meditate and you are in a more
relaxed<00:02:15.780> state<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.470> use<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.100> patches

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
relaxed state so you can use the patches

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
relaxed state so you can use the patches
for<00:02:18.090> approximately<00:02:18.780> 30<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.290> 60<00:02:19.650> minutes<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.980> day

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
for approximately 30 to 60 minutes a day

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.580 
for approximately 30 to 60 minutes a day
to<00:02:20.850> help<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.239> with<00:02:21.450> stress<00:02:21.690> management<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
I'm just going to show you how we would

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.310 
I'm just going to show you how we would

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
use it with with the headband so you can

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.600 
use it with with the headband so you can
actually<00:02:28.560> put<00:02:29.040> them<00:02:29.160> underneath<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.820> headband

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
actually put them underneath a headband

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.830 
actually put them underneath a headband
