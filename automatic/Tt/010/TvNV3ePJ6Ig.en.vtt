whichever you'd like to call it and

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.150 
whichever you'd like to call it and
didn't<00:00:09.780> really<00:00:09.929> expect<00:00:10.440> them<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.650> do<00:00:10.889> very

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
didn't really expect them to do very

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.999 
didn't really expect them to do very
well<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.610> I'm<00:00:11.700> actually<00:00:12.090> been<00:00:13.009> pleasantly

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
well that I'm actually been pleasantly

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.140 
well that I'm actually been pleasantly
surprised<00:00:14.580> by<00:00:14.969> them<00:00:16.070> there's<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.160> few<00:00:17.490> things<00:00:17.850> I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
surprised by them there's a few things I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.880 
surprised by them there's a few things I
would<00:00:18.210> say<00:00:18.600> about<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.320> I'm<00:00:19.410> actually<00:00:19.590> an

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
would say about it and I'm actually an

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.570 
would say about it and I'm actually an
automotive<00:00:20.250> mechanic<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.550> I

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
automotive mechanic and you know I

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.400 
automotive mechanic and you know I
thought<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.300> know<00:00:24.420> heck<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.019> could<00:00:25.080> build<00:00:25.289> one

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
thought you know heck I could build one

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.200 
thought you know heck I could build one
of<00:00:25.619> these<00:00:25.740> they're<00:00:26.160> pretty<00:00:26.369> cool<00:00:26.580> good<00:00:27.000> gas

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
of these they're pretty cool good gas

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.169 
of these they're pretty cool good gas
mileage<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.779> thought<00:00:27.960> why<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:28.680> uh<00:00:29.179> you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
mileage I thought why not but uh you

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.490 
mileage I thought why not but uh you
know<00:00:30.300> they're<00:00:30.539> pretty<00:00:30.689> good<00:00:30.960> if<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.170> get<00:00:31.349> them

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
know they're pretty good if you get them

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.389 
know they're pretty good if you get them
tuned<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.640> know<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.950> ended<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.160> running

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
tuned right you know I ended up running

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.940 
tuned right you know I ended up running
one<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> those<00:00:35.940> boost<00:00:36.270> bottles<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:37.680> if

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
one of those boost bottles and then if

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.400 
one of those boost bottles and then if
you<00:00:38.070> run<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> boost<00:00:38.550> model<00:00:38.969> I'm<00:00:39.780> sure<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> lot<00:00:40.379> of

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
you run a boost model I'm sure a lot of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.880 
you run a boost model I'm sure a lot of
people<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.100> did<00:00:42.050> had<00:00:43.050> problems<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.710> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
people like I did had problems with it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.229 
people like I did had problems with it
idling<00:00:44.579> too<00:00:44.789> high

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
idling too high

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.260 
idling too high
so<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.170> could<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> any<00:00:46.860> lower<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.820> I

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
so and I could not get it any lower if I

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.479 
so and I could not get it any lower if I
went<00:00:48.719> too<00:00:48.870> low<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.230> bog<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> did<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.370> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
went too low it bog out so I did is I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.000 
went too low it bog out so I did is I
actually<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.969> know<00:00:51.230> pulled<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.469> needle<00:00:52.860> out

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
actually you know pulled the needle out

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.299 
actually you know pulled the needle out
of<00:00:53.160> there<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> slide<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.960> uh<00:00:55.309> rich

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
of there out of the slide and uh rich

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.170 
of there out of the slide and uh rich
and<00:00:56.489> did<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> knotch

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and did a knotch

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.920 
and did a knotch
just<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.050> notch<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:59.660> helped<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.750> lot

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
just one notch and that helped a lot

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.080 
just one notch and that helped a lot
then<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.710> could<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.399> idle<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.030> it

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
then I could actually get idle and it

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.250 
then I could actually get idle and it
goes<00:01:03.239> pretty<00:01:03.539> good<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:03.930> I'm<00:01:04.110> not

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
goes pretty good you know I'm not

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.340 
goes pretty good you know I'm not
worried<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:05.420> melting<00:01:06.420> my<00:01:06.510> piston<00:01:06.990> so

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
worried about melting my piston so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.039 
worried about melting my piston so
that's<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.650> good<00:01:07.799> thing<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:09.270> never<00:01:09.689> tried<00:01:10.020> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
that's a good thing and I never tried it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
that's a good thing and I never tried it
with<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.590> stock<00:01:10.979> air<00:01:11.220> cleaner<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
with the stock air cleaner with the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.120 
with the stock air cleaner with the
boost<00:01:12.030> bottle<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:13.650> thing<00:01:13.920> definitely

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
boost bottle but that thing definitely

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.859 
boost bottle but that thing definitely
has<00:01:14.430> helped<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> lot<00:01:14.880> make<00:01:15.119> sure<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.600> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
has helped a lot make sure you all it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.090 
has helped a lot make sure you all it
though<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:17.070> always<00:01:17.220> important<00:01:18.830> well<00:01:19.830> yes

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
though it's always important well yes

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.020 
though it's always important well yes
and<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.820> uh

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and I uh

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.539 
and I uh
there's<00:01:21.869> baffling<00:01:22.590> inside<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.189> exhaust

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
there's baffling inside that exhaust

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.539 
there's baffling inside that exhaust
well<00:01:23.970> there's<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> crimp<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.950> tube<00:01:26.220> well<00:01:26.520> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
well there's a crimp in the tube well I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.429 
well there's a crimp in the tube well I
pulled<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.090> tube<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.990> drilled<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
pulled that tube out and I drilled a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.800 
pulled that tube out and I drilled a
hole<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> other<00:01:29.759> side<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> crimp

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
hole on the other side of the crimp

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.140 
hole on the other side of the crimp
because<00:01:31.020> there<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.259> no<00:01:31.409> hole<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.000> now<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
because there was no hole and now it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
because there was no hole and now it
runs<00:01:33.390> pretty<00:01:33.869> darn<00:01:34.140> good<00:01:34.380> since<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.860> did<00:01:35.070> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
runs pretty darn good since I did that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.420 
runs pretty darn good since I did that
and<00:01:35.780> sounds<00:01:36.780> better<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.220> still

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and sounds better but I know it still

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.890 
and sounds better but I know it still
has<00:01:38.579> plenty<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:39.090> pressures<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.780> only

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
has plenty of back pressures I only

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.359 
has plenty of back pressures I only
drilled<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> little<00:01:40.680> hole<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
drilled you know a little hole in it and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.999 
drilled you know a little hole in it and
it's<00:01:41.630> really<00:01:42.630> tremendously<00:01:43.229> helped<00:01:43.560> low<00:01:43.770> end

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
it's really tremendously helped low end

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.469 
it's really tremendously helped low end
torque<00:01:44.220> amazingly<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> think<00:01:45.180> it'd<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
torque amazingly you think it'd be the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.050 
torque amazingly you think it'd be the
other<00:01:45.570> way<00:01:45.750> around<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.520> has

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
other way around but it actually has

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.600 
other way around but it actually has
really<00:01:48.390> helped<00:01:48.840> um<00:01:49.310> another<00:01:50.310> thing<00:01:50.520> about

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
really helped um another thing about

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.179 
really helped um another thing about
these<00:01:50.850> engines<00:01:51.420> make<00:01:51.960> sure<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.350> use<00:01:52.470> Loctite

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
these engines make sure you use Loctite

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.569 
these engines make sure you use Loctite

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
them down you know to what you feel is
correct<00:02:07.649> because<00:02:07.829> as<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.190> ride<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
correct because as you ride you know I

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.180 
correct because as you ride you know I
just<00:02:09.720> did<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> today<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:10.890> some

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
just did it today and you can see some

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.400 
just did it today and you can see some
of<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> oil<00:02:11.520> there<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.150> was<00:02:12.720> blowing<00:02:12.900> out<00:02:13.050> my

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
of the oil there I was blowing out my

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.830 
of the oil there I was blowing out my
Gasquet<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.190> thinking<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.030> was<00:02:15.510> losing<00:02:15.630> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
Gasquet and thinking that I was losing a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.000 
Gasquet and thinking that I was losing a
whole<00:02:15.930> bunch<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.170> power<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.470> tighten<00:02:16.890> those

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
whole bunch of power I tighten those

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.600 
whole bunch of power I tighten those
down<00:02:17.070> my<00:02:17.490> power<00:02:17.730> came<00:02:17.970> right<00:02:18.180> back<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.610> that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
down my power came right back so that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.980 
down my power came right back so that
was<00:02:20.760> pretty<00:02:20.970> amazing<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.600> was<00:02:21.690> pretty

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
was pretty amazing I was pretty

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.030 
was pretty amazing I was pretty
surprised<00:02:22.470> um<00:02:22.950> oh<00:02:24.050> yes<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> last<00:02:25.650> thing

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
surprised um oh yes and the last thing

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.000 
surprised um oh yes and the last thing
that's<00:02:26.220> really<00:02:26.640> helped<00:02:26.970> with<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.270> project

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
that's really helped with the project

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.540 
that's really helped with the project
was<00:02:29.010> uh<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.990> put<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.020> plug<00:02:31.350> wire<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.920> better<00:02:32.220> plug

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
was uh I put a plug wire a better plug

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.220 
was uh I put a plug wire a better plug
wire<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:32.970> here<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.390> know<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.660> seems<00:02:33.990> like

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
wire on here and I know that seems like

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.100 
wire on here and I know that seems like
really<00:02:34.470> scary<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.160> do<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.640> uh<00:02:35.670> all<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.810> do<00:02:36.960> is

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
really scary to do but uh all you do is

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.160 
really scary to do but uh all you do is
it<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.440> unscrews<00:02:38.160> from<00:02:39.090> right<00:02:39.300> there<00:02:39.330> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
it just unscrews from right there you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.600 
it just unscrews from right there you
know<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.530> unscrews<00:02:41.010> out<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.310> there<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.550> you

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
know and unscrews out of there and you

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.450 
know and unscrews out of there and you
just<00:02:41.640> screw<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.090> one<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.990> screw

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
just screw that one in it's just a screw

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.220 
just screw that one in it's just a screw
they<00:02:44.460> just<00:02:44.730> screw<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.090> right<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.630> amazingly

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
they just screw it right on to amazingly

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.270 
they just screw it right on to amazingly
so<00:02:47.330> that<00:02:48.330> was<00:02:48.510> pretty<00:02:48.720> simple<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.260> do<00:02:49.440> um<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:50.130> had

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
so that was pretty simple to do um I had

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.890 
so that was pretty simple to do um I had
to<00:02:50.310> cut<00:02:50.730> my<00:02:50.760> pedals<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.360> little<00:02:51.570> bit<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.810> move

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
to cut my pedals a little bit and move

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.390 
to cut my pedals a little bit and move
them<00:02:52.050> over<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.560> don't<00:02:52.620> know<00:02:52.830> if<00:02:52.950> someone<00:02:53.190> has

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
them over I don't know if someone has

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.770 
them over I don't know if someone has
any<00:02:53.580> information<00:02:53.850> where<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.480> could<00:02:54.630> actually

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
any information where I could actually

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.950 
any information where I could actually
buy<00:02:55.610> pedals<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.730> are<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.360> know<00:02:57.480> moved<00:02:57.780> out

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
buy pedals that are you know moved out

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.150 
buy pedals that are you know moved out
of<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.140> way<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.350> something<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
of the way for something like that

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.430 
of the way for something like that
that'd<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.580> really<00:03:00.570> nice<00:03:00.720> no<00:03:00.960> I'm<00:03:01.080> sure<00:03:01.260> there

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that'd be really nice no I'm sure there

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.190 
that'd be really nice no I'm sure there
is<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.830> just<00:03:01.860> don't<00:03:02.160> know<00:03:02.250> where<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.520> find<00:03:02.730> them

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
is I just don't know where to find them

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.260 
is I just don't know where to find them
um<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.860> another<00:03:05.790> must<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:08.850> know<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.000> got

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
um and another must is a you know I got

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.200 
um and another must is a you know I got
the<00:03:09.450> dual<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:10.590> dual<00:03:10.800> break<00:03:11.220> one<00:03:11.790> hey<00:03:12.000> whatever

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
the dual the dual break one hey whatever

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.730 
the dual the dual break one hey whatever
you<00:03:12.450> want<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.690> call<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:13.110> know<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.260> see<00:03:13.560> what

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
you want to call you know you see what

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.380 
you want to call you know you see what
it<00:03:13.860> does<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.280> works<00:03:14.370> both<00:03:14.640> breaks<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.180> one

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
it does it works both breaks with one

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.740 
it does it works both breaks with one
hand<00:03:15.800> so<00:03:16.800> that's<00:03:17.280> been<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.580> big<00:03:17.970> improvement<00:03:18.420> in

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
hand so that's been a big improvement in

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.740 
hand so that's been a big improvement in
stopping<00:03:19.410> that's<00:03:19.740> just<00:03:20.670> tremendously<00:03:21.270> helped

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
stopping that's just tremendously helped

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.470 
stopping that's just tremendously helped
and<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.290> know<00:03:22.700> things<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.940> haven't<00:03:24.240> done

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
and you know things that I haven't done

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.980 
and you know things that I haven't done
that<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.110> would<00:03:25.350> suggest<00:03:25.560> people<00:03:25.980> would<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.520> is

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
that I would suggest people would do is

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.630 
that I would suggest people would do is

you hit a bump you know that wears out
your<00:03:55.020> pivots<00:03:55.440> in<00:03:55.620> there<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.040> after<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:57.030> while

the<00:03:57.270> ball<00:03:57.450> bearing<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.620> know<00:03:58.739> kind<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.610> makes

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
the ball bearing you know kind of makes

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.510 
the ball bearing you know kind of makes
its<00:04:00.000> own<00:04:00.120> seat<00:04:00.480> for<00:04:00.750> itself<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.410> just<00:04:02.340> gets

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
its own seat for itself and just gets

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.740 
its own seat for itself and just gets
looser<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.030> looser<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.450> there's<00:04:03.600> really

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
looser and looser and there's really

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.640 
looser and looser and there's really
nothing<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.170> can<00:04:04.410> do<00:04:04.530> about<00:04:04.650> it

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
nothing you can do about it

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.860 
nothing you can do about it
lastly<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.860> would<00:04:08.040> suggest<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:09.000> sprocket

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
lastly I would suggest that sprocket

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.990 
lastly I would suggest that sprocket
back<00:04:10.110> there<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:11.400> know<00:04:11.430> it's<00:04:11.700> worked<00:04:11.880> pretty

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
back there you know it's worked pretty

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.880 
back there you know it's worked pretty
good<00:04:12.209> driving<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.959> spokes<00:04:13.320> but<00:04:13.620> I'd<00:04:13.709> rather

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
good driving the spokes but I'd rather

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.150 
good driving the spokes but I'd rather
it<00:04:14.190> not<00:04:14.220> be<00:04:14.459> hooked<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.060> spokes<00:04:15.420> but<00:04:16.160> you

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
it not be hooked to the spokes but you

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.949 
it not be hooked to the spokes but you
know<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.609> disc<00:04:17.970> brakes<00:04:18.090> would<00:04:18.510> always<00:04:18.690> be

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
know and disc brakes would always be

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.680 
know and disc brakes would always be
nice<00:04:19.140> but<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.590> mean<00:04:19.850> over<00:04:20.850> all<00:04:21.000> those<00:04:21.299> few
