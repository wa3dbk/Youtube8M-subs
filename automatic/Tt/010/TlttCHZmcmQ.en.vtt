and then you're just he's got some good
puck<00:02:21.120> awareness<00:02:21.599> I<00:02:21.750> find<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.019> he's<00:02:22.170> always

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
puck awareness I find that he's always

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.170 
puck awareness I find that he's always
in<00:02:22.650> front<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.010> net<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> really<00:02:24.060> like

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
in front of the net so I really like

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.789 
in front of the net so I really like
that<00:02:24.209> took<00:02:24.540> about<00:02:24.659> that<00:02:24.930> too<00:02:25.110> cuz<00:02:25.620> he<00:02:25.680> does

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
that took about that too cuz he does

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.729 
that took about that too cuz he does
score<00:02:26.040> those<00:02:26.190> rebounding<00:02:26.760> goals<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.239> front<00:02:27.989> to

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
score those rebounding goals in front to

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.740 
score those rebounding goals in front to
get<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.099> past<00:02:29.280> bully<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:30.360> here<00:02:30.569> too

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750

get the past bully and you see here too
i<00:02:30.780> think<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.170> he<00:02:31.260> does<00:02:31.290> make<00:02:31.620> similar<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:32.160> he's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
i think so he does make similar as he's

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.520 
i think so he does make similar as he's
in<00:02:33.239> front<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.569> net<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.900> he<00:02:33.959> just<00:02:34.170> picks<00:02:34.230> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
in front of the net and he just picks it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.400 
in front of the net and he just picks it
up<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.860> tucks<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.720> he's<00:02:37.019> got<00:02:37.200> really

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
up and tucks it in so he's got really

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.650 
up and tucks it in so he's got really
good<00:02:37.530> presence<00:02:38.519> on<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> icy<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.360> always<00:02:39.569> in
