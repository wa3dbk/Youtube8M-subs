00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.139
 one of the wheels 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.670
 you can system works without problems 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.450
 following the simple instructions here 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.390
 we propose to you 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.220
 get a wheel holder first 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.220
 all the spokes is a wheel center 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.440
 first remove the catch from the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.320
 wheel from the bicycle and remove the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.400
 then rotate it on the door 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.400
 wheels and lock it 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.170
 if it's a mountain bike 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.000
 also remove the brake latch a 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.440
 at this point you have to turn the wheel 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.690
 of the bicycle and in the meantime 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.080
 record the beams using the puller 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.080
 rays 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.030
 to realize if the wheel is 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.159
 centered or not, it will be enough to see if the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.649
 circle is going to rub on the latch of the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.569
 wheel center of the bicycle in that 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.700
 in case the centering is not optimal e 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.700
 the rays will have to be registered again 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.869
 repeat this operation until the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.000
 centering will not be satisfactory 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.709
 only at this point can you remove the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.069
 latches raised to the wheel by the door 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.069
 wheels 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.780
 always keep in mind that if yours 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.670
 bicycle was a mountain bike 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.510
 you will also have to remove the retainers of the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.340
 wheel itself finally reassembled the wheel 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.170
 of the bicycle on the frame by putting it back 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.150
 the detention and in the case of one 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.630
 mountain bike also refit the retainer 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.460
 of the brake you will thus have the wheel of the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.910
 your bike perfectly centered 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.440
 for a problem-free ride vi 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.090
 let's remember that to accomplish this 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.430
 you just need a wheel holder 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.430
 wash points and a wheeled center
