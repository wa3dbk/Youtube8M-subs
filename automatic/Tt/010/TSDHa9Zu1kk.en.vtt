00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:11.150
 well, that's all end 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.150
 and for a moment 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.279
 so there behind the door what to do what 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.730
 I also do something that was something that was 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.550
 so I also had a weapon so 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.539
 167 parts of toys that your 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.779
 not in a hurry 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 yes no, I remember everything fine for today 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.669
 only sinister was planned 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 appearance with you and what is it all the same 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.180
 this is a bric company pistol which 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.579
 can shoot 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.760
 160 parts all plain parts 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.809
 color instruction is good that 2 logic 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.809
 toys are not particularly in a hurry 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.360
 clean it up pretty interesting if 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.269
 piling up the details as they will 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.460
 shown in the bag then everything is logical 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.180
 and it's understandable the first time I see a variation on 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.140
 Lego theme in the form of weapons appearance 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.390

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.009

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.310

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.380

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.280

 I got out and here you have it someone 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.020

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.720
 perhaps leave the gloves take here 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.310
 my grandmother scolded me without gloves 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.860
 I walk while it is too true 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.800
 grateful for the release of more gloves 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.520

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.459

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.870

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.760
