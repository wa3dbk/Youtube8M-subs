00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.610
 welcome again so it's done 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.730
 we are used to the fact that British vovis are high thanks to their 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.189
 characteristic helmets 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.189
 British helmets measure approximately 30 centimeters 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 its rounded shape fits perfectly on the head but still add 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.679
 quite tall the police 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:23.710
 and that's not bad 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.710
 when one faces adversity 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.539
 times change but the vovis's helmet is not the same for a century and 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:37.640
 medium 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.520
 today a metal mold is used to duplicate those in reinforced plastic 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.280
 the mold descends and enters an oven 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 an operator places a plastic sheet on top 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.680
 lower the lid and slide a warm cover over you only need a few 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.680
 minutes for the heat to talk about the plastic 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.459
 the mold rises and from below the vacuum molds the plastic its form 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.950
 hardens almost immediately and there you hit it with a rubber mallet to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 remove the skeleton from the helmet of the mold 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.670
 with a saw the excess material of the wing is cut 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.590
 and the helmet is now ready for the lining 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.760
 for which it is used 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.530
 a water-repellent lullaby 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.740
 the two halves of the helmet pattern are cut 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.920
 and they are sewed 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.850
 leaving an elevated posture he was the helmet a nicer line 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.700
 the pieces that will form the lining of the inner part sheen colán are treated 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.250
 with steam humidifying it is easier to work with them 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 then queued the entire exterior of the helmet 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.109
 The cloth lining is already wet which makes it easier to spread over the 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.109
 Surface in casting of plastic case framework 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.659
 it stretches so that it fits well and does not get wrinkled 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.300
 then with a wooden tool the air bubbles are ready 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.299
 could be left 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.269
 the Alavés is cut to fix it 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.969
 and a qom border is sewn around the wing to reinforce it and make it more 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.969
 Elegant 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.709
 the eyelashes of the decorative elements are wetted in a powder creeds or and 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 they use to mark their location on the crown of the helmet 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.709
 seat in the holes where the marks have left 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.199
 then the metal ornament is placed and the tabs are folded against the 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.199
 helmet interior 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.590
 then 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.110
 dry in strips of plastic tape and foam to make the straps and the boat 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.110
 complained 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.030

 a metal band is passed around the helmet and fastened with thumbtacks 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.049

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.279
 Ventilation holes are made in the sides 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:32.329
 i it's time to detail it with a special calibrator 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.500
 with a pair of tweezers the lint is removed and the wool is brushed to hide it 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.099
 After the label is placed confirming that the product meets all 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.960
