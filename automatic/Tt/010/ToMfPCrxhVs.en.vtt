00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.790
 it will be online 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 brave 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.280
 yes and then we finally come 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.010
 time online 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.910
 a title that was had in the years 2013 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.610
 like anything else 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.379
 and thereby a lot of fans or also 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.300
 a lot of anti fans won 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.890
 while behind the anime accuse that 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.750
 it's way too boring and way too 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.160
 mainstream would be barred windows 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.720
 anime so to speak and call as 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.729
 an example of the great atmosphere 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.790
 and the great landscapes 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.350
 you yourself as an anime beer is 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.479
 a bit wrong and do not know 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.070
 where to go you try somehow 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.729
 between these two fronts too 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.619
 convey 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.479
 but why is online from the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.610
 nothing to one of the most famous anime 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.390
 series in less than one 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.940
 become year 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.740
 in asia or at least what singapore 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.050
 As is it clear at the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.759
 great advertising campaign in germany 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.530
 The main reason is probably more that one 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.020
 large audience is addressed 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.270
 two young anime characters in one 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.649
 online roleplaying and the whole thing too 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.660
 still in a very nice sign style 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.520
 in just 25 follow 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.200
 that sounds good but one can 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.050
 Definitely have a look 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.039
 certainly many thought yes and exactly that 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.630
 is it then? 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.190
 but let's do it for everyone first 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.060
 those who do not have the anime yet 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:14.319
 know the story epic music on 6 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:16.120
 november 2022 starts as an eight year old 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.120
 the new game 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.870
 it will be online 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.980
 a mmo rpg or like the very cool kids 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.250
 say mmo rpg but no it's not only 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.680
 just such a mmo rpg it is a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.909
 virtual reality mmo rpg in any case 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.390
 is it like that now with the 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.370
 main character kiri i already have 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.739
 forget the name quito in 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.690
 to follow this world and there on 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.590
 first day a terrible tragedy 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.590
 happens 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.720
 the players just can not 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.910
 Lies more and must in the game 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.590
 stay until you reach level 100 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.260
 killed last boss opponents 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.250
 Should you die in the game you die 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.810
 also in reality 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.270
 and that's one of the big ones 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.430
 Strengthen by sweat online the great 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.470
 staged boss fights also become 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.510
 gamer to research a lot of mmo 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.580
 rpg s have played a lot of things 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.620
 the rants online recognize as 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:23.050
 For example, I do not know I'm not 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.090
 Gamers like the story in general 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.739
 first third quite good as they are fast 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.720
 progresses and not somewhere 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.459
 but I like it 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.709
 beginning of the second third at all 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.430
 not there the story in a way 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.080
 something romantic drifts yes, yes 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.510
 I know that many people like to see it 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.520
 but I borrow this part of two 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.590
 I just do not like him at all 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.910
 find it too cheesy though I 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.380
 actually nothing against romance 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.670
 and where we are at 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.800
 we can also about the same time 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.280
 main characters talk or rather said 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.200
 the one main character because quito 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.299
 Let's just leave one out 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.860
 character level from one to ten would 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:07.690
 chirico with hoop and in 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:12.090
 baby pools drown mercilessly so who 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.680
 is actually who she is actually 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.100
 let's just call it artistic 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.100
 precious 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.940
 It is online now 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.320
 justified or unjustified 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.050
 one of the best known and 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.820
 most used to him at all for 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.010
 experienced anime showers it will be us 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.000
 continue to give nothing new online 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.010
 the anime is very mainstream 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.310
 however, for people just started 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.280
 have the anime look good until 29 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.930
 start with exciting fight beautiful 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.580
 to look at the backgrounds and 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.310
 also nice to look at the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.420
 main characters or as I said one 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.820
 main character 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.710
 it will not be online at all 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.930
 worse animated but on the other 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.120
 side is also not very good 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.770
 anime whether the hype about the weather online 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.780
 is justified or not 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.430
 Firstly, I do not want to be justified 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.620
 answer and secondly, I can too 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.210
 do not answer, I thank you 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.310
 to watch you and hope for her 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.290
 understanding that this review a little bit 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.580
 took longer because I had exam 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.560
 I hope we are at the next 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.570
 anime video again you can as always 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.570
 vote and yes until then 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.870
