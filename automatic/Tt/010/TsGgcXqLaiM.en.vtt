00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 says the saying that walk or not walk 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.540
 big horse may be right the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.160
 most of the time and who we are 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.769
 us to take the opposite to 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.929
 centuries of popular tradition because if not 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.269
 we are nobody this unpleasant task and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.340
 tortuous we leave it to the gentlemen of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.340
 audi engaged in challenging the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.800
 sayings with his new a3 edano and is that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.779
 the a3 sedan has a very good plant 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060
 what we now think of as a car 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.740
 small you have to see it with perspective and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.369
 consider it as a car size 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.890
 medium is with 446 six centimeters more 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.950
 shorts for example that a four of the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 first generation of 1994 but if what 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.270
 we compare with the current a-4 there is a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.520
 rung below in terms of size and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.370
 price but does not for that reason renounce a 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.870
 Very high quality standard 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.600
 mercedes has also done something similar 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.059
 with the cl to eye more than 20 centimeters 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.340
 longer than the 3 sedan but the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.260
 Same pattern derives from its compact 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.809
 class and will stay at some distance in 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.789
 price and size of the next class c well 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.470
 as in the uncritical cl we're going a little bit 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.570
 its interior was less refined or less 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.130
 Mercedes than the other models 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.440
 are given can boast an interior 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.630
 exquisite as we have said to the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.700
 try others to three it seems a 6th scale 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.550
 in this sense it is quite above 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.100
 from cl to retractable control screen 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.380
 rotating nm and padded plastics 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.960
 good ergonomics everything to make us the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.790
 life more convenient and comfortable aboard the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.800
 sedan is 15 centimeters longer than the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.110
 sportback and as the platform and the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.990
 battle are the same where you notice most 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.500
 that length increase is here in the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.740
 trunk gains 45 liters in front of the sport 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.780
 back to locate 425 turn are 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.640
 also 45 liters less than the sight of 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.860
 this leaf but its forms are more 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.530
 regular with the practical ones that are the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.119
 a5 carries 7 sportback and the 3rd could 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.060
 have been separated from the Mercedes has been 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.220
 incorporating a switchable gate as 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.170
 that of his cousin the super shield in 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.720
 place to put a classic stage of 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.789
 The boot is larger than the trunk itself 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.410
 but since you can not take space from 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.030
 where there are not those who can find 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.330
 a wider interior than the sportback 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.400
 Obviously it will take a disappointment 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.990
 they are basically the same acceptable for 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.820
 four occupants but one 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.260
 and back it was very fair because the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.740
 rear seats are not especially 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.740
 wide 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.760
 despite the descending shape of the ce pillar 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.950
 the rear height is not bad 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.360
 once in motion we can apply the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.610
 same sensations as the rest of the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.079
 a3 range seems to be at the controls 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.959
 of a good car of superior category 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.579
 by the haze and solidity that transmits the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.200
 front train keeps the car with 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.180
 great precision within the plot that 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.769
 We are also dialing with the steering wheel 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.260
 we have a differential as standard 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.760
 electronic how it works when 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.980
 we approach a curve at a certain speed 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.319
 the front wheel contrary to that of 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.269
 support tends to be downloaded or tends 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.159
 to detach from the ground when this 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.569
 occurs the system exerts a slight 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.370
 brake pressure on that wheel 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.560
 while the opposite receives more 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.359
 for the difference of forces between 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.920
 both front wheels makes the 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.889
 car lightly close the radius of 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.629
 turn helping to trace the curve works 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.579
 great although you have to admit it 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.560
 does not reach the effectiveness of the train 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.540
 front of said mercedes cl a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.629
 authentic reference among the compact 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.670
 For its part, the third train of the 3 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.889
 he is especially nervous but also the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.450
 third volume helps to sweeten the 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.909
 reactions of the rear making them more 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.760
 progressive and also converting to a3 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.530
 in a very very stable car like in the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.690
 other than three can mount suspension 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.490
 sports that brings a plus of agile 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.870
 in comfort element so that 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.120
 We believe that the series are the most 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.260
 appropriate between comfort and effectiveness and 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.720
 more taking into account the philosophy 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.850
 rutera of the sedan and that we can tell you 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.910
 of the engines so we can choose 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.760
 the diesel of 105 and 150 horses and two 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.730
 of gasoline 140 and 180 the engine of 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.740
 Our unit is 1.8 tfsi of 180 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.140
 horses associated with a gearbox 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.840
 automatic 7-speed s tronic that 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.030
 well goes that softness pushes with decision 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.680
 and stretch a lot at high laps with a 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.680
 very nice sporty sound 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.000
 we will not be short in power 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.190
 even if we do a driving 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.470
 decided and also the approved consumption 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.690
 from 5.6 liters to 100 is not 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.460
 especially high on the side 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.800
 otherwise we will find an answer 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.660
 Slow throttle at low speed 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.090
 since we step on the pedal until we 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.620
 we respond there is a small gap and 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.460
 that can bother us maneuvers 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.460
 anxiety for example 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.740
 It's worth it compared to the 150 diesel 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.419
 horses good if we want an extra 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.460
 sportsmanship not only in benefits 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.039
 but also in forward feelings 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.710
 but it will cost us about two thousand euros more 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.479
 the diesel of 150 horses sure 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.580
 will be one of the best sellers for its 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.919
 balance between benefits and consumption 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.319
 but if we are allergic to diesel sound 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.060
 we prefer softness with gasoline and 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.800
 we mostly do a few kilometers 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.159
 a year we should look at the 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.680
 1.4 tfsi engine of 140 horsepower and 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.840
 completely new development has a 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.550
 particularity disconnects two cylinders 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.379
 when these are not necessary for 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.940
 save fuel has almost the 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.190
 Same features as diesel plus 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.449
 powerful and also its consumptions are 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.449
 practically identical
