00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.850
 we come to another item 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.589
 spotlight because dead man's plate is in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.330
 the divide we will look a us 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.250
 bit closer than the good gameplay 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.440
 left us with the item which was not only 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.650
 give tennis but eyes certain 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.789
 The end effect has two passive ones 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.080
 I would say elements 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.850
 that means we already set the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.100
 values are in the sand then we look at whom 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.800
 it could stand and where in the meter could 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300
 it would be about finding God again 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.660
 I now have a closer look on it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.390
 Dead Man's Play gives a 600 live 55 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.670
 Armor and the whole costs 2007 and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.710
 gold and thus the item is a very 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.920
 very funny category so a bit 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.620
 between sun fire omen frozen merlot and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.410
 Also the look rather items are 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.030
 Relatively similar and we will be in the end 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 comparable in the first place, however 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.480
 we describe the passive thank there 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.039
 it's two elements because the first one is 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.840
 dreadnought that means you are in the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.149
 situation while you were moving 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.620
 distance somehow travels stacks 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.629
 can build one of these tags 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.730
 maximum number of 100 will reach then 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.890
 the following happens for one thing 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.420
 her up to 60 minutes has to pienaar 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.220
 and so funny seem so funny 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 shimmer behind you so have momentum 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.880
 literally the whole thing goes on 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.220
 a bit back if you have 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.810
 will be good or slowed down though 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.700
 what can you do now with the sticks 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.500
 first regardless of whether 100 are 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.540
 or not because in principle you get 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.610
 for every second stakes one 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.380
 Attack point for next car 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.680
 tech that means yes , I call sex 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.810
 Rum says brügelmann 125 bonus damage 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.970
 The whole thing is always done 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.680
 so here's the pro tip if you're with 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.329
 rausholen damage the item maximum 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.650
 then wanted to wriggle back and forth no 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.900
 the enemy little bit and you 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.790
 Hold low values ​​back already 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.470
 It may be about five to ten 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.970
 harm still be this is important if 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.740
 he is longing or not here 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.840
 must also be considered that count 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 also you should meat and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.710
 should somehow move you over the wall 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.689
 or generally get over distance 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.450
 each day a bit like sex 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.610
 sex sex sex sex well you should again 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.490
 100 has doubled 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.380
 hurt and broken 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.700
 Great what you do at 100 bonus 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.560
 damage to the enemy beer comes on the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.330
 tongue fact that if you are one 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.459
 you should even be the fighter 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.560
 opponents by 75 percent for one second 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.390
 slow that is not bad 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.360
 we imagine you are their teaching 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.160
 from and and momentum to the opponents and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.230
 slow down first and then you can 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.970
 work on it after your ability 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.130
 In addition to the factor that you have 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.290
 perfect and you harm that 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.120
 Well do it and come with the wheels 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.400
 We serve virtually the champions the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.560
 item can stand well and in principle 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.569
 are very many and we are looking 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.610
 quasi to what in her criteria for it 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.190
 technically every appointment is very 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.019
 Good first audit tax is one of them 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.760
 In principle, so everyone is not a good point 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.680
 you have to consider only the cars 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.630
 even reinforced war is not 100 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.519
 hurt or something to your space 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.040
 benefit from the item relatively little 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.730
 except for the spurs the course distance 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.500
 puts back that means her crew left 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.660
 endash in some form or even the one 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.010
 center and put stunts back and 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.060
 increases for the next euro 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.010
 expensive damage 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.989
 the next point would be pleasant with 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.430
 The item is always movement speed 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.440
 faster you are the faster 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.510
 gets her stacks and gets even from 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.160
 the moving speed will benefit you 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.660
 by the object receives twice 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.700
 better good and the last point had 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.750
 what to do with the outtakes and that is 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.940
 not bad if you yourself 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.010
 glides or holds the opponent of the men 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.900
 and do not beat him with outtakes 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.489
 Everyone thinks that leaves again 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.380
 but there are some 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.910
 They are so fast, of course 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.920
 benefit massively if they 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.359
 distance travel when car tech like 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.150
 that should be because of me and then me 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.670
 come back to the chemical 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.230
 there is extreme and yet we have 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.209
 already so called her but she is there 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.620
 brutal of the coo to the truck works 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.239
 doing wonderful because you expect the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.250
 Bonus always hurt and should 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.840
 her 106 then it hits the opponent 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.700
 really better it must be considered 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.739
 Do not synergize with sheen and it 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.109
 Also do not tingle addicted to mister 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.760
 hurt noticeably another op would be good 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.470
 hegering if he is with you e 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.910
 rush the break much ground again 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.700
 stand on it and he is one of the few 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.840
 the active of the running speed 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.250
 but it also does a great job of benefiting 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.900
 the only in the bathroom you wilt thou 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.480
 Let's say it is natural for others 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.709
 Also very good that we have the channel 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.900
 rudi schwanner nocturne ola all the up 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.100
 audit tax feet or an opponent ran 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.260
 need and from the running speed 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.910
 This will benefit greatly 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.340
 It is really the whole thing in principle 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.990
 browser palette on the toplink the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.100
 is that really good, it is too 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.070
 not bad if you then as well 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.990
 tank next to his spurs mighty autotxt 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.479
 it obviously increases the damage 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.970
 The question is now this item can 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.440
 with the remaining teams compete for 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.150
 The cheer has the same 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.830
 price categories live less and 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.660
 less armor man is in the but 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.830
 able to do damage to the area 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.240
 means better to examine and decide 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.800
 probably will not stupid comes 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.090
 these pages are too high it is from the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.440
 magic damage which is not bad 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.540
 on the other side we have that 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.010
 omen that has less life is so 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.900
 not so good against majors and me 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.850
 say for it more armor and the active one 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.320
 part brings you more here again 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.120
 Here it is difficult between making 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.530
 well and then more points again 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.570
 little bit more expensive is the view 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.780
 we would love to see him on the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.910
 Plaine increases the amount of the model 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.530
 their fur even better approximates without 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.580
 the page almost not clear anymore 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.590
 Of course, get running speed 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.300
 if you meet space or car ltx 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.190
 makes if lena will do it with this 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.020
 item relatively difficult for the selection 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.789
 is meanwhile really big which is good 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.710
 but they are a different one 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.270
 Price categories must consider what is 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.830
 for now really the best for me 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.450
 and I have to have this 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.770
 object not yet seen so often 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.050
 but some are noticing that 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.910
 right now, but I think it's one 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.039
 niche product for really much 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.460
 special topics on which it is massively good 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.530
 stands 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.530
 Well, and their ideas are with 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.599
 distance like the best 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.080
 with the item exit pure and have fun 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.080
 in the race
