basically it's an RPG but with

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.120 
basically it's an RPG but with
turn-based<00:00:19.430> style<00:00:19.910> fighting<00:00:20.380> so<00:00:21.380> anyway

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
turn-based style fighting so anyway

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.740 
turn-based style fighting so anyway
that's<00:00:22.250> about<00:00:22.460> up<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:22.820> I'll<00:00:22.910> get<00:00:23.270> on<00:00:23.360> to<00:00:23.390> paint

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
that's about up and I'll get on to paint

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.870 
that's about up and I'll get on to paint
a<00:00:23.840> bit<00:00:23.989> more<00:00:24.169> than<00:00:24.380> one<00:00:24.560> obviously<00:00:24.710> but<00:00:25.460> at<00:00:25.730> the

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
a bit more than one obviously but at the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.580 
a bit more than one obviously but at the
start<00:00:26.149> you<00:00:26.329> basically<00:00:26.660> get<00:00:26.869> a<00:00:26.930> cutscene<00:00:27.200> which

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
start you basically get a cutscene which

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.200 
start you basically get a cutscene which
you<00:00:27.680> can<00:00:27.860> skip<00:00:28.220> which<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:28.790> good<00:00:29.000> because

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
you can skip which is good because

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.819 
you can skip which is good because
personally<00:00:29.779> I<00:00:29.809> don't<00:00:29.899> really<00:00:30.290> like<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.619> story

things<00:01:50.820> again<00:01:51.120> basically<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.050> get<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.260> right

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
things again basically you get a right

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.020 
things again basically you get a right
way<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.190> on<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.340> magic<00:01:53.730> so<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.910> can

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
way you can go on to magic so it can

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.460 
way you can go on to magic so it can
queue<00:01:54.240> people<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.870> go<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.050> right<00:01:55.260> homes

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
queue people you can go on right homes

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.110 
queue people you can go on right homes
and<00:01:55.680> swap<00:01:55.830> items<00:01:56.160> around<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.520> people<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:56.910> use

and swap items around with people or use
them<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.780> search<00:01:58.230> or<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.620> can<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.950> go

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
them you can search or you can just go

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
them you can search or you can just go
into<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.310> member<00:01:59.610> details<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.270> check<00:02:00.300> people

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
because as I said I'd go on to them a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.560 
because as I said I'd go on to them a
bit<00:02:17.130> more<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.240> know<00:02:18.270> there

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
bit more and just so that you know there

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.180 
bit more and just so that you know there
were<00:02:18.630> actually<00:02:18.990> forty<00:02:19.410> three<00:02:19.620> bottles<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
were actually forty three bottles in the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.130 
were actually forty three bottles in the
game<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.730> there's<00:02:20.910> plenty<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:27.990> call

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
game so there's plenty to do so we call

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.840 
game so there's plenty to do so we call
them<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> bottles<00:02:29.220> basically

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
them this one of the bottles basically

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.820 
them this one of the bottles basically
it's<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.900> not<00:02:31.020> turn-based<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
it's a it's not turn-based in the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.560 
it's a it's not turn-based in the
strictest<00:02:32.280> sense<00:02:32.310> because<00:02:32.940> sometimes<00:02:33.330> you

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
strictest sense because sometimes you

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.510 
strictest sense because sometimes you
move<00:02:33.780> two<00:02:34.020> units<00:02:34.050> they<00:02:34.590> move<00:02:34.830> two<00:02:34.980> units<00:02:35.010> but

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
move two units they move two units but

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.400 
move two units they move two units but
they<00:02:35.670> knew<00:02:35.820> Matt<00:02:36.000> wanted<00:02:36.360> them<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.600> three<00:02:36.900> it's

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
they knew Matt wanted them of three it's

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.360 
they knew Matt wanted them of three it's
just<00:02:37.560> one<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.770> them<00:02:37.860> things

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
just one of them things

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.460 
just one of them things
so<00:02:38.580> after<00:02:39.390> mover<00:02:39.720> thought<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.260> choose

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
so after mover thought you can choose

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.320 
so after mover thought you can choose
