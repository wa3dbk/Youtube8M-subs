00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.269
 in 1962 the young peter parker after a 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.720
 radioactive spider crash becomes 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.370
 spiderman by and large be spiderman in addition 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.260
 to freak out her mother on leaving a 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.170
 package of cereals complained of 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.080
 can super scratch the wall to be 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.510
 super strong and super age it be alerted 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 imminent danger and weave 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.330
 paintings 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.220
 there are two scales of 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.430
 classification of the characteristics of 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.160
 superheroes that of marvel and that of 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.610
 fans definitely we can not do them 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.649
 trust 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.719
 both scales falls however 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.540
 agree that peter is very 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.790
 intelligent does not prevent that to 52 years passed 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.309
 he says everywhere that he has only 25 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.960
 and six in forty years ago there are some 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.210
 thing that has not changed is that 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.969
 parker is still on the faithful straw 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.410
 to himself but be on the straw in 62 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.750
 and in 2014 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.649
 it's not the same deal in the end 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.569
 it costs how many spiderman beings between 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.880
 the cost of the camera suit 

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:09.369
 different gadgets of the speed'r 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.049
 cellars or outings in couples we say 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.899
 that to have this lifestyle is worth 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.219
 better to have iron man's wallet 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.630
 iron man who can also boast 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.229
 to have as many years on the counter as 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.539
 of conquest 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.130
 unlike this last spider man 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.929
 is an exception because 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.499
 can put a face on each of his 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.409
 companions 

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:27.369
 some more presents others relegated 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.469
 second place 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.950
 we even forget sometimes that peter 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:35.740
 parker was married divorced then married 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.049
 by a demon the thing is that if we 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.719
 gets confused with his super girlfriend with 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.969
 who is going to drink great shots with his 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.429
 great friends because spider man has good 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.590
 heard teamed with other super 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.959
 hero in a myriad of spin off 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.060
 crossover and alternate universe 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.799
 It must be said that it is not the only one 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.109
 to have had this idea since one can be 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.000
 ugly and naughty and like to work in 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.250
 team 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.140
 the worst enemies of spider man were 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.160
 so federate within the memorable 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.880
 sinister if what they have become 12 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:13.830
 may that are actually twenty or 30 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.740
 a lot nasty fight short they are 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.480
 full motivated and super equipped but face 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.610
 to metal arms and and retro 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.360
 thruster an outfit your colleagues 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.360
 Red and blue 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.670
 it sucks the retro punk look of ben ali 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.590
 the high-tech armor made by 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.300
 tony stark going through the bag 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.000
 paper trash or his suit 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.950
 anti-Semitic 6 hours spider metal 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.870
 man had several more costumes 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.880
 or less sophisticated to fight 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.410
 against crime 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.900
 must say that we do not fight the jester 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.000
 green with a tear bomb and it will not 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.459
 however not enough since it is this 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.800
 last who managed to kill spider-man to 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.410
 following an epic fight bringing together 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.110
 a galaxy of big names marvel since 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.270
 little barker is unable to exercise his 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.810
 profession of spider man because of 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.900
 atrocious death 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.840
 the spider man but will not reign anymore 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.000
 will be replaced by moral miles a young 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.790
 Hispanic afro also bitten 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.680
 by a radioactive spider 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.720
 definitely new york insects and are 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.790
 a little more dangerous than we SEVERAL 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.110
 made in France 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.910
 the publisher of these new adventures has 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.940
 confessed to being inspired by barack obama 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.350
 to create the character of miles 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.420
 especially since the president of the states 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.459
 United States of America revealed during 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.200
 campaign be a hardcore of 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.959
 the spider man and in collecting 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.120
 the comics an infinite circle a loop 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.829
 closed by a publication of marvel in 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.989
 which spider man save the life of 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.269
 barack obama in a plot of the chameleon 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.170
 during the investiture ceremony of 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.060
 2009 inspirational spider-man obama inspires 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.120
 in spiderman 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.400
 the story of spider man it's also and 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.050
 especially the alternative realities that 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.480
 make this universe one of the most 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.270
 complete they evening neething superior 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.950
 ultimate band mastic spider man had to 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.010
 die a total of half a dozen 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.569
 time to relive thirty and live together 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.000
 with dozens of universe clones 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.200
 parallel a diversity that one 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.760
 found in different 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.670
 adaptations that could see the day 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.160
 since the creation of the masked hero with 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.019
 subban hyman and turkish spider man 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.400
 the incredible impact that may have 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.200
 the spider man on the culture 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.419
 popular is clearly noticeable 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.350
 with the new franchise that saw the 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.479
 day in 2012 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.120
 it's obvious that spider man has become 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.820
 since its creation an icon is a model 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.169
 and especially a magnificent loser a 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.970
 source of inspiration and 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.770
 entertainment whose power and 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.700
 potential are matched only by the complexity 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.700
 of his universe 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.420
 the elysÃ©e 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.420
 respect
