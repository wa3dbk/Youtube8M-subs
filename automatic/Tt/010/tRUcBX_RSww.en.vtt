there which you really can't tell

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.999

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
because it's daytime but they're really

just brewing stands and nice little

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.770 
just brewing stands and nice little
cabinet<00:05:03.099> designs<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:03.819> I<00:05:03.849> like<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.150> TV<00:05:04.360> I

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
cabinet designs and I like the TV I

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.749 
cabinet designs and I like the TV I
think<00:05:05.020> it<00:05:05.080> looks<00:05:05.259> cool<00:05:05.500> that's<00:05:06.250> my<00:05:06.430> favorite

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
think it looks cool that's my favorite

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.490 
think it looks cool that's my favorite
part<00:05:06.879> about<00:05:07.030> this<00:05:07.270> room<00:05:07.569> is<00:05:07.719> this<00:05:07.900> TV<00:05:08.139> right

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
part about this room is this TV right

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.320 
part about this room is this TV right
here<00:05:09.330> okay<00:05:10.330> so<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:11.139> think<00:05:11.440> that<00:05:11.889> is<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.520> for<00:05:13.150> the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
here okay so I think that is it for the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.300 
here okay so I think that is it for the
inside<00:05:13.870> of<00:05:14.229> the<00:05:14.349> house<00:05:14.879> if<00:05:15.879> I'm<00:05:16.060> not<00:05:16.330> mistaken

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
inside of the house if I'm not mistaken

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.249 
inside of the house if I'm not mistaken
yeah<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.759> is<00:05:18.969> pretty<00:05:19.000> much<00:05:19.389> it<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:22.050> so<00:05:23.050> let's

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
yeah that is pretty much it and so let's

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:29.189 
yeah that is pretty much it and so let's
go<00:05:23.440> on<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.889> back<00:05:24.069> outside<00:05:27.360> this<00:05:28.360> is<00:05:28.689> the
