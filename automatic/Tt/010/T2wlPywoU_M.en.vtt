00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 good 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.640
 the economy can never be a 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.650
 science that works so that the most 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.660
 rich continue to be richer but 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.400
 clearly so that in Argentina there is no 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.020
 poorest and we continue to build a 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.140
 project of a social inclusion 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.290
 heinze wrote an exceptional book in 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.920
 where he said this system for the first time 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.760
 economic produces unemployment 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.540
 structural 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.290
 and if public policy does not come 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.210
 to replace the black holes left by the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.450
 system in its operation there is no 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.000
 possibilities of approaching the full 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.740
 we are going to raise a proposal to the bank 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.720
 central so that in the line of 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.550
 productive investment where the bank 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.080
 central today forces banks to 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.010
 pay 5 percent of their deposits 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.979
 at a reasonable rate are included 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.540
 institutions of inclusive finance 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.960
 in that line so they can have 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.090
 cheap financing acceptable 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.009
 reasonable if we think about finances with 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.360
 inclusion we are going to realize that it is 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.360
 the best model we can have 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.900
 why 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.500
 we get the decision to continue 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.320
 importing or producing our resources 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.670
 with our rules and with people who 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.890
 comes to invest in Argentina 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.570
 I personally think that people talk about 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.600
 been smarter than you can take the 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.430
 country make sure that we produce what 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.420
 our that we generate jobs 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.100
 that we develop our resources that 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.080
 those resources make development 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.390
 economic of this country and that we do 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.330
 here we do it with our people what 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.190
 we do with our technicians and we grow 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.560
 product that we have been growing in 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.690
 operation and improving the service 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.340
 Argentine airlines - sells every time 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.860
 more tickets 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.420
 we go to a project that seeks the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.220
 economic development that seeks the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.590
 economic growth that uses 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.349
 strategic tools with which 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.129
 must have a state to include and 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.129
 to develop 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
 when we think of the effort 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.100
 of the entrepreneurs those who before 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.900
 that there was a public policy of 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.390
 promotion of the social economy and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.370
 solidary they went to barter and like that 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.560
 transformation was happening in our 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.440
 country from thinking that each one is 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.450
 proposed to fight him you can not all that 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.470
 individual transformation of each 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.580
 it ends up modifying a country and thanks 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.970
 and thank you Juan and well I will continue to 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.970
 ahead
