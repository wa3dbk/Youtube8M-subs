watching TV and that really shortens

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.550 
watching TV and that really shortens
these<00:05:55.949> muscles<00:05:56.339> so<00:05:56.849> this<00:05:56.999> exercise<00:05:57.509> is<00:05:57.810> so

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
these muscles so this exercise is so

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.079 
these muscles so this exercise is so
important<00:05:59.129> to<00:05:59.189> open<00:05:59.430> that<00:05:59.550> up<00:05:59.669> so<00:05:59.879> that<00:05:59.999> when

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:00.089 
important to open that up so that when

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:01.519 
important to open that up so that when
you<00:06:00.150> go<00:06:00.240> out<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:00.479> run<00:06:00.629> you<00:06:00.900> can<00:06:01.020> maximize<00:06:01.349> your

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529 
you go out and run you can maximize your

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.800 
you go out and run you can maximize your
date
