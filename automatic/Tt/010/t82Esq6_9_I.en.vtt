00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
the work that we've been doing lately

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.829 
the work that we've been doing lately
has<00:00:10.920> been<00:00:11.099> more<00:00:12.679> background<00:00:13.679> stuff<00:00:14.280> so

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
has been more background stuff so

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.880 
has been more background stuff so
doesn't<00:00:15.839> really<00:00:15.960> lend<00:00:16.170> itself<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.560> screen

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
doesn't really lend itself to screen

doesn't really lend itself to screen
shots<00:00:17.130> well<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.090> thought<00:00:18.359> I'd<00:00:18.420> just<00:00:18.630> take<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> few

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
shots well I thought I'd just take a few

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.470 
shots well I thought I'd just take a few
minutes<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.710> show<00:00:20.039> some<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.730> new<00:00:20.850> UI<00:00:21.029> stuff

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
minutes to show some of the new UI stuff

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.120 
minutes to show some of the new UI stuff

will almost all be gone by the time
police<00:00:53.219> happen<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.030> don't<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.270> too<00:00:54.329> attached

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
police happen so don't get too attached

to<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:57.350> we've<00:00:58.350> changed<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.980> player<00:00:59.850> theme

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to that we've changed the player theme

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.319 
to that we've changed the player theme
icons<00:01:00.629> it'll<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.140> more<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:03.180> now

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
icons it'll be more as we go right now

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.170 
icons it'll be more as we go right now
we've<00:01:03.510> got<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.809> three<00:01:04.170> main<00:01:04.640> factions<00:01:05.640> all

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
we've got the three main factions all

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.710 
we've got the three main factions all
the<00:01:06.299> colors<00:01:07.430> I'll<00:01:08.430> probably<00:01:08.760> use<00:01:09.090> Empire<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the colors I'll probably use Empire the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.060 
the colors I'll probably use Empire the
hand<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> we've<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:11.970> some<00:01:12.930> other<00:01:13.380> faction

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
hand so we've got some other faction

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.390

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
them I'm not sure what most of them are

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.630 
them I'm not sure what most of them are
no<00:01:19.439> that's<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> gist<00:01:19.920> ascendancy<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> think

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
no that's the gist ascendancy I think

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
no that's the gist ascendancy I think
that's<00:01:20.820> Rogue<00:01:21.030> Squadron<00:01:21.799> no<00:01:22.799> idea<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that's Rogue Squadron no idea what the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.539 
that's Rogue Squadron no idea what the
middle<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:25.580> anyways<00:01:26.720> yeah<00:01:28.490> draw<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.700 
middle one is anyways yeah draw the
buttons

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.860 

guess<00:01:36.710> I'll<00:01:36.890> start<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.430> games<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.060> show<00:01:38.240> what

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
guess I'll start a games to show what

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.580 
guess I'll start a games to show what
the<00:01:39.050> end<00:01:39.320> game<00:01:39.440> ugh<00:01:39.650> looks<00:01:39.860> like<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:45.020> faction

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
the end game ugh looks like the faction

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.950 
the end game ugh looks like the faction

still<00:01:50.960> may<00:01:51.950> work<00:01:52.160> on<00:01:52.310> we're<00:01:52.550> not<00:01:52.610> entirely

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
still may work on we're not entirely

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.370 
still may work on we're not entirely
sure<00:01:53.120> how<00:01:53.420> we're<00:01:53.600> going<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.750> arrange<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.200> what

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
sure how we're going to arrange it what

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.130 
sure how we're going to arrange it what
we're<00:01:54.470> going<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.650> put<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:57.520> there's<00:01:58.520> that

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
we're going to put on it so there's that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.420 
we're going to put on it so there's that
and<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:02.630> loading<00:02:03.080> screens<00:02:03.410> are<00:02:03.590> also<00:02:03.740> you

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
and the loading screens are also you

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.450 
and the loading screens are also you
haven't<00:02:04.759> touched<00:02:04.880> them<00:02:05.119> at<00:02:05.270> all<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.590> we'll

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
haven't touched them at all so we'll

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.249 
haven't touched them at all so we'll
probably<00:02:07.640> cut<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:08.060> part<00:02:08.300> out<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.990> point

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
probably cut that part out the point

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.590 
probably cut that part out the point
looking<00:02:09.470> at<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.679> vanilla<00:02:10.070> screens<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:16.540> want<00:02:17.540> to

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
looking at the vanilla screens I want to

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.570 
looking at the vanilla screens I want to
be<00:02:17.660> an<00:02:17.720> envelop<00:02:17.990> dinner<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:25.130> we<00:02:25.220> changed<00:02:25.520> all

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
be an envelop dinner so we changed all

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.100 
be an envelop dinner so we changed all
the<00:02:25.670> difficulty<00:02:26.120> names<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.570> be<00:02:26.660> more<00:02:26.840> star

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
the difficulty names to be more star

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.010 
the difficulty names to be more star
wars<00:02:27.140> ii<00:02:27.610> will<00:02:28.610> be<00:02:28.790> obviously<00:02:29.600> putting<00:02:29.870> in

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
wars ii will be obviously putting in

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.160 
wars ii will be obviously putting in
maps<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:31.120> match<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.330> Star<00:02:32.540> Wars<00:02:32.660> Galaxies<00:02:33.140> I

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
maps to match the Star Wars Galaxies I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.970 
maps to match the Star Wars Galaxies I
think<00:02:33.350> we<00:02:33.440> put<00:02:33.650> up<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:36.230> map<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.530> plans<00:02:36.709> we're

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
think we put up a the map of plans we're

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.560 
think we put up a the map of plans we're
going<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.190> be<00:02:37.280> using<00:02:37.310> it's<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:38.120> lot<00:02:38.269> of<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.420> same

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
going to be using it's a lot of the same

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.000 
going to be using it's a lot of the same
ones<00:02:38.720> from<00:02:38.870> video<00:02:39.110> Civil<00:02:39.440> War<00:02:39.620> plus<00:02:39.890> some
