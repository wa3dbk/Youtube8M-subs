00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
that's why I kind of put false memory as

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.100 
that's why I kind of put false memory as
underrated<00:02:42.239> because<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.630> think<00:02:42.690> more<00:02:42.989> people

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
underrated because I think more people
