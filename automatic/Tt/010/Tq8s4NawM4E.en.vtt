this video I'm going to explain the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.450 
this video I'm going to explain the
protocol<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.090> dr.<00:00:09.420> Joel<00:00:09.660> Wallach<00:00:10.050> uses<00:00:10.590> in

protocol that dr. Joel Wallach uses in

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.459 
protocol that dr. Joel Wallach uses in
reversing<00:00:12.360> Alzheimer's<00:00:13.170> Parkinson's

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
reversing Alzheimer's Parkinson's

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.740 
reversing Alzheimer's Parkinson's
dementia<00:00:15.049> ALS<00:00:16.049> these<00:00:16.740> are<00:00:16.980> all<00:00:17.190> diseases<00:00:17.880> of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
dementia ALS these are all diseases of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.599 
dementia ALS these are all diseases of
just<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.560> different<00:00:19.830> part<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> brain<00:00:20.279> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
just a different part of the brain of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.390 
just a different part of the brain of
the<00:00:20.670> fatty<00:00:20.910> area<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> brain<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
the fatty area of the brain and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.089 
the fatty area of the brain and
basically<00:00:23.400> what's<00:00:23.609> happened<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.500> if<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.769> get

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
basically what's happened is if you get

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.700 
basically what's happened is if you get
on<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> low<00:00:26.730> cholesterol<00:00:26.970> saturated<00:00:27.779> fat<00:00:28.380> diet

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
on a low cholesterol saturated fat diet

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.859 
on a low cholesterol saturated fat diet
and<00:00:28.980> start<00:00:29.220> taking<00:00:29.340> statin<00:00:29.970> drugs<00:00:30.269> yeah

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
and start taking statin drugs yeah

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.060 
and start taking statin drugs yeah
you're<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.320> reduce<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.890> cholesterol

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
you're going to reduce the cholesterol

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.120 
you're going to reduce the cholesterol
in<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.090> brain<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.630> that's<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.230> bad<00:00:34.680> thing

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
in the brain and that's a bad thing

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.260 
in the brain and that's a bad thing
the<00:00:35.430> brain<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.149> 75%<00:00:36.989> weight<00:00:37.590> cholesterol<00:00:38.460> okay

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the brain is 75% weight cholesterol okay

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
the brain is 75% weight cholesterol okay
it's<00:00:39.420> made<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.870> myelin<00:00:40.530> which<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it's made up of myelin which is a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.950 
it's made up of myelin which is a
hundred<00:00:41.700> percent<00:00:41.850> cholesterol<00:00:42.570> that's<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
hundred percent cholesterol that's the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.290 
hundred percent cholesterol that's the
fatty<00:00:43.200> area<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> brain<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.300> insulates

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
fatty area of the brain that insulates

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.990 
fatty area of the brain that insulates
all<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> neurons<00:00:46.170> okay<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.640> you're<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
all the neurons okay so if you're on a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.639 
all the neurons okay so if you're on a
low<00:00:48.180> cholesterol<00:00:48.420> diet<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.260> you're<00:00:49.350> taking

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
low cholesterol diet and you're taking

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.610 
low cholesterol diet and you're taking
these<00:00:49.710> statin<00:00:50.100> drugs<00:00:50.480> that<00:00:51.480> myelin<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.079> being

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
these statin drugs that myelin is being

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
these statin drugs that myelin is being
eliminated<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.850> these<00:00:54.000> nerve

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
eliminated and so all these nerve

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.330 
eliminated and so all these nerve
endings<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.140> tangled<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> back<00:00:56.129> lash

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
endings get tangled up like a back lash

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.639 
endings get tangled up like a back lash
on<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> fishing<00:00:56.910> pole<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.870> that's<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.469> just

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
on a fishing pole and that's and it just

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.110 
on a fishing pole and that's and it just
depends<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.160> area<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> brain<00:00:59.820> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
depends on what area the brain it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729 
depends on what area the brain it
happens<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.629> whether<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.050> Parkinson's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
happens on whether you get Parkinson's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.370 
happens on whether you get Parkinson's
or<00:01:02.010> dementia<00:01:02.579> ALS<00:01:03.890> Alzheimer's<00:01:04.890> okay<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.380> what

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
or dementia ALS Alzheimer's okay so what

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.240 
or dementia ALS Alzheimer's okay so what
he<00:01:07.650> suggests<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:10.260> prevent<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.010> or

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
he suggests to do if or prevent it or

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
he suggests to do if or prevent it or
reverse<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:13.020> want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> start<00:01:13.439> eating

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
reverse it is we want to start eating

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.320 
reverse it is we want to start eating
eggs<00:01:14.930> okay<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.200> you're<00:01:16.729> 200<00:01:17.729> pounds<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.210> need

pounds of body weight you need one of

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.210 
pounds of body weight you need one of
these<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.730> month<00:02:42.880> okay<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.170> has<00:02:44.440> that

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
these a month okay and that has that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.440 
these a month okay and that has that
what<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.460> has<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:48.150> beyond<00:02:49.150> tangy

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
what that has in it is beyond tangy

what that has in it is beyond tangy
tangerine<00:02:49.930> 2.0<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.580> fabulous<00:02:51.910> stuff

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
tangerine 2.0 this is fabulous stuff

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.800 
tangerine 2.0 this is fabulous stuff
it's<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.840> powder<00:02:53.080> form<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:54.880> an<00:02:55.600> a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
it's in a powder form and it's an a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.110 
it's in a powder form and it's an a

motion<00:02:58.540> suspension<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.710> that<00:02:59.920> it's<00:03:00.400> highly

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
absorbable at the cellular level okay so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.910 
absorbable at the cellular level okay so
it<00:03:04.120> gets<00:03:04.330> into<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.600> body<00:03:04.720> absorb<00:03:05.260> about<00:03:05.440> 98%

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
it gets into the body absorb about 98%

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.120 
it gets into the body absorb about 98%
of<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.490> stuff<00:03:06.730> unlike<00:03:07.630> 3%<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.560> elemental
