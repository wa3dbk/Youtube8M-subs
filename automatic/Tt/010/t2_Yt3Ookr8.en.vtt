00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.130
 to make this recipe, I have 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.050
 inspired by the base of a rustic cake 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.380
 using flour in this case the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.260
 our spelled flour and sage 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.379
 inside this container 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.430
 I'll use a bft or burger ready dish 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:44.910
 of spinach or in the other variant 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 spelled burger and broccoli 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.610
 I used 340 grams of flour per 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.700
 we will make this dough 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.620
 plus or minus 2 or 3 tablespoons of oil and one 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:05.009
 about twenty sage leaves 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.810
 let's add our saudia we have 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.369
 previously prepared with oil 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.740
 we also add extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.140
 a pinch of salt 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.130
 we begin to knead by adding man 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.020
 water by hand until we get that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.810
 which will be our dough then 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.850
 we will have to put back for about an hour in 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:36.090
 the dough is practically refrigerator 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:38.920
 ready the water will be all absorbed 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:46.780
 we can wrap them with a film or 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:49.600
 in a well dampened cloth we removed 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.530
 the dough from the refrigerator and now it 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.850
 we divide into four parts and this 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.960
 we said it will be ours 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.490
 container of spelled burgers and broccoli 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.240
 and spinach 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.110
 they begin to pull one of these 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.110
 small doughs 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.340
 we cover a small kitchen mold in 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.030
 this case only used of the card 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.230
 from oven 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:30.120
 but which model the dough we supply the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:36.980
 bottom and then we're going to put it in 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.980
 oven at 180 degrees for 10 15 minutes 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:50.630
 now let's take the spinach burger 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:53.480
 we begin to fill two of these 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.720
 cupcakes on the base we can also 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.489
 put some extra virgin olive oil of 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.970
 olive eventually or we can 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.450
 put it to the end this burger is 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:09.200
 composed of spinach seitan potatoes 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.560
 we predict the other spelled and broccoli 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.900
 we fill this instead mainly and 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.360
 spelled tofu broccoli sunflower seeds 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.350
 we can dust them I chose the 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.780
 always organic cornmeal for 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.459

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:36.170

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:44.060
