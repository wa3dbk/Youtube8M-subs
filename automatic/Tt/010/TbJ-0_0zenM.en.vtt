welcome guys to episode six hundred and

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.170 
welcome guys to episode six hundred and
one<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.720> Minecraft<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.859> i'm<00:00:05.250> using<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.759> fast

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
one of Minecraft and i'm using the fast

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.080 
one of Minecraft and i'm using the fast
building<00:00:06.960> mod<00:00:07.290> now<00:00:07.980> as<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.400> name<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.790> mud

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
building mod now as the name of the mud

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.110 
building mod now as the name of the mud
may<00:00:09.389> suggest<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.110> mud<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.650> for<00:00:11.160> builders<00:00:11.730> and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
may suggest this mud is for builders and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.419 
may suggest this mud is for builders and
specifically<00:00:13.049> designed<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.620> builders<00:00:14.099> for

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
specifically designed for builders for

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.060 
specifically designed for builders for
our<00:00:14.580> two<00:00:15.089> purposes<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:16.109> build<00:00:16.320> vertically<00:00:16.890> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
our two purposes to build vertically and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
our two purposes to build vertically and
to<00:00:17.490> build<00:00:17.640> horizontally<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.810> building

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
to build horizontally and building

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.830 
to build horizontally and building
horizontally<00:00:20.220> may<00:00:20.430> become<00:00:20.760> very<00:00:21.240> useful<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
horizontally may become very useful to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.599 
horizontally may become very useful to
build<00:00:22.050> quick<00:00:22.590> bridges<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.189> don't<00:00:23.369> want<00:00:23.550> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
build quick bridges if you don't want to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.640 
build quick bridges if you don't want to
keep<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.970> moving<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.019> moving<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.470> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
keep on moving it and moving it I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.790 
keep on moving it and moving it I
certainly<00:00:26.310> would<00:00:26.580> love<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.960> actual<00:00:28.320> scale

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
certainly would love to the actual scale

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.250 
certainly would love to the actual scale
of<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.250> horizontally<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> little<00:00:31.080> bit

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
of the horizontally to be a little bit

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.610 
of the horizontally to be a little bit
bigger<00:00:31.470> because<00:00:31.740> vertically<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.940> loads<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.750> 15

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
bigger because vertically it loads up 15

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.970 
bigger because vertically it loads up 15
blocks<00:00:34.829> high<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.809> horizontally<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> does<00:00:37.200> 25

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
blocks high and horizontally it does 25

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.750 
blocks high and horizontally it does 25
blocks<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.760> what<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.640> what<00:00:41.640> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
blocks and what you can do is what you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.030 
blocks and what you can do is what you
do<00:00:41.969> well<00:00:42.450> no<00:00:42.750> no<00:00:42.930> no<00:00:43.110> no<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.770> holding

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
do well no no no no I was holding

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.029 
do well no no no no I was holding
control<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.350> shift<00:00:46.829> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
control is if I was going to shift and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.279 
control is if I was going to shift and
not<00:00:47.160> fall<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.079> you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
not fall down so are we can do is you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
not fall down so are we can do is you
hold<00:00:49.559> down<00:00:49.800> control<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.370> once<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.329> place<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
hold down control and once you place the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
hold down control and once you place the
block<00:00:51.899> down<00:00:52.110> while<00:00:52.379> holding<00:00:52.680> ctrl<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
block down while holding ctrl it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180 
block down while holding ctrl it
actually<00:00:54.329> places<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> blocks<00:00:55.379> down<00:00:55.680> our<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
actually places the blocks down our I

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.709 
actually places the blocks down our I
was<00:00:56.520> supposed<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.300> little<00:00:57.600> bit

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
was supposed to do it a little bit

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
was supposed to do it a little bit
further<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.250> little<00:00:59.850> this

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
further on and I will see a little this

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.520 
further on and I will see a little this
is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> good<00:01:00.359> example<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
is a good example you can see that this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.579 
is a good example you can see that this
is<00:01:01.739> how<00:01:01.890> far<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> went<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.229> there's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
is how far it went in and I know there's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.710 
is how far it went in and I know there's
going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> lot<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> sexual<00:01:05.430> jokes<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.330> in

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
going to be a lot of sexual jokes in in

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.929 
going to be a lot of sexual jokes in in
your<00:01:06.840> windows<00:01:07.200> right<00:01:07.560> there<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.580> keep

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
your windows right there but that keep

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
your windows right there but that keep
moving<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> side<00:01:09.930> there<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> we

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
moving to the side there we go and we

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.740 
moving to the side there we go and we
hold<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.920> control<00:01:11.310> again<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> bam<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.720> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
hold it in control again and bam when I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.649 
hold it in control again and bam when I
flap<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> see<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.460> stops<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.090> any<00:01:15.360> when

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
flap and see now it stops when any when

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.990 
flap and see now it stops when any when
it's<00:01:15.810> about<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> contact<00:01:17.040> any<00:01:17.250> air<00:01:17.430> block<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
it's about to contact any air block so

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.179 
it's about to contact any air block so
you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:19.650> about<00:01:19.979> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you can see here that it's about to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.280 
you can see here that it's about to
contact<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.850> V<00:01:21.000> fence<00:01:21.420> over<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
contact the V fence over here so it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.100 
contact the V fence over here so it
stopped<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.280> didn't<00:01:23.549> protruding<00:01:24.479> fence

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
stopped and that didn't protruding fence

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.690 
stopped and that didn't protruding fence
of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> wall<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:25.830> quite<00:01:25.979> an<00:01:26.159> quite<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
of the wall so that's quite an quite a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.969 
of the wall so that's quite an quite a
nice<00:01:26.939> feature<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.960> won't<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.470> do

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
nice feature and it won't actually do

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.850 
nice feature and it won't actually do
the<00:01:29.130> standard<00:01:29.759> 25<00:01:30.689> blocks<00:01:31.079> arm<00:01:31.470> which<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the standard 25 blocks arm which it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.740 
the standard 25 blocks arm which it
normally<00:01:32.220> does<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.240> there's<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
normally does like so that there's a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810 
normally does like so that there's a
pretty<00:01:34.049> cool<00:01:34.200> feature<00:01:34.470> now<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.250> bug<00:01:35.490> I'd<00:01:35.640> like

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
pretty cool feature now one bug I'd like

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
pretty cool feature now one bug I'd like
to<00:01:36.060> find<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:36.900> myself<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> hold<00:01:38.189> if

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
to find out for myself is if you hold if

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.460 
to find out for myself is if you hold if
you're<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.700> top<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> block<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.020> jump

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you're on top of the block and you jump

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.190 
you're on top of the block and you jump
will<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> air<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.210> suddenly

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
will you go up in the air and suddenly

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560 
will you go up in the air and suddenly
no<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.500> won't<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.520> I'm<00:01:44.820> basically<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
