00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
Dragon Ball super is a hundred episodes

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
Dragon Ball super is a hundred episodes
long<00:01:07.799> which<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.610> first<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.970> thought<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> was

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
long which at first I thought it was

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.000 
long which at first I thought it was
maybe<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.869> placement<00:01:10.320> holder<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.770> really

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
maybe a placement holder it's really

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.200 
maybe a placement holder it's really
easy<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> come<00:01:11.400> throw<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> number<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.060> there

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
easy to come throw a number up there

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.780 
easy to come throw a number up there
just<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.540> there's<00:01:12.720> something<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:14.460> hold

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
just so there's something there to hold

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.490

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.740 
however after investigating I checked
out<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.549> piece<00:01:20.759> which<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:21.270> first<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
out one piece which was my first go to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.690 
out one piece which was my first go to
and<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.170> figured<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.590> anything<00:01:23.340> was<00:01:23.460> gonna<00:01:23.549> have

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and I figured if anything was gonna have

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.980 
and I figured if anything was gonna have
a<00:01:23.729> place<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.000> hold<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.299> would<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.600> one<00:01:24.750> piece

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
a place on hold it would be one piece

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.080 
a place on hold it would be one piece
but<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.380> noticed<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:25.950> piece<00:01:26.159> actually<00:01:26.610> has<00:01:26.790> in

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
but I noticed one piece actually has in

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.600 
but I noticed one piece actually has in
production<00:01:27.869> instead<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> numbers<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
production instead of a numbers so it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.190 
production instead of a numbers so it
shows<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.450> know<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.750> piece<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:30.990> going

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
shows that you know one piece is going

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
shows that you know one piece is going
to<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> long<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.909> know

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
to go on for a long time and as you know

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
to go on for a long time and as you know
one<00:01:33.509> piece<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> longest<00:01:34.560> animes

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
one piece is one of the longest animes

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.219 
one piece is one of the longest animes
out<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.939> over<00:01:36.299> 700<00:01:37.049> seven

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
bit long or do you think it's just a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.109 
bit long or do you think it's just a
placement<00:01:47.700> holder

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
thoughts now with me I think it might

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.020 
thoughts now with me I think it might
actually<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> hundred<00:01:52.950> some<00:01:53.070> song<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.939> then

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
actually be a hundred some song but then

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.700 
actually be a hundred some song but then
again<00:01:54.149> who<00:01:54.750> knows<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.110> could<00:01:55.229> very<00:01:55.409> well<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
again who knows it could very well be a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.020 
again who knows it could very well be a
placement<00:01:56.159> holder<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.520> kind<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.700> tough<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
placement holder it's kind of tough to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.480 
placement holder it's kind of tough to
tell<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.780> early<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.200> stages<00:01:58.469> uh<00:01:58.649> when<00:01:59.369> we

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
tell this early in the stages uh when we

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.520 
tell this early in the stages uh when we
find<00:01:59.820> out<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.360> guess<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.869> go<00:02:00.990> through<00:02:01.229> the

9 Star Dragon Ball was in on it and it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.790 
9 Star Dragon Ball was in on it and it
was<00:02:27.090> very<00:02:27.180> confusing<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.870> at<00:02:28.110> first<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.650> lot<00:02:28.740> of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
was very confusing and at first a lot of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.900 
was very confusing and at first a lot of
people<00:02:28.860> starts<00:02:29.160> throwing<00:02:29.310> our<00:02:29.400> theories<00:02:29.760> or

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
people starts throwing our theories or

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.520 
people starts throwing our theories or
maybe<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.300> an<00:02:30.390> alternate<00:02:30.810> universe

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
maybe it's an alternate universe

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.650 
maybe it's an alternate universe
Dragon<00:02:32.370> Ball<00:02:32.520> maybe<00:02:32.850> now<00:02:33.090> there's<00:02:33.390> nine

Dragon Balls instead of seven

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.470 
Dragon Balls instead of seven
maybe<00:02:35.280> Toriyama<00:02:35.640> forgot<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.270> mostly

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
maybe Toriyama forgot that it's mostly

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.810 
maybe Toriyama forgot that it's mostly
seven<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.080> not<00:02:37.200> more<00:02:37.500> than<00:02:37.650> seven<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.790> a

Dragon Ball theory to drop in a comment
section<00:02:46.230> below<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.830> my<00:02:47.130> theory<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.540> think

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
section below but my theory is I think

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.540 
section below but my theory is I think
someone<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.140> messed<00:02:49.380> up<00:02:49.500> honestly<00:02:49.830> it's

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
someone just messed up honestly it's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.790 
someone just messed up honestly it's
pretty<00:02:50.790> easy<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.000> mess<00:02:51.180> up<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:52.080> some<00:02:52.530> probably

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
pretty easy to mess up and some probably

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.320 
pretty easy to mess up and some probably
meant<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.220> do<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.460> sixth<00:02:53.730> hour<00:02:53.820> ball<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.240> then

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
meant to do the sixth hour ball and then

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.610 
meant to do the sixth hour ball and then
screwed<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.900> then<00:02:55.020> really<00:02:55.260> didn't<00:02:55.470> really

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
screwed up and then really didn't really

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.320 
screwed up and then really didn't really
double-check<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.670> ended<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.090> sending

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
double-check and then ended up sending

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.730 
double-check and then ended up sending
it<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.510> print<00:02:57.780> without<00:02:58.230> really<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.620> know

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
it to print without really you know

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.020 
it to print without really you know
confirming<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.610> know<00:02:59.730> it's<00:02:59.910> supposed

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
confirming that you know it's supposed

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.060 
confirming that you know it's supposed
to<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.360> right<00:03:00.480> amount<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.750> dots<00:03:01.070> but

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
to be the right amount of dots but

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.260 
to be the right amount of dots but
honestly<00:03:02.460> that's<00:03:02.700> what<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:02.850> think<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.090> think

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
honestly that's what I think I think

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.490 
honestly that's what I think I think
someone<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.600> screwed<00:03:03.780> up<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.350> should

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
someone just screwed up and I should

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.430 
someone just screwed up and I should
find<00:03:04.650> too<00:03:04.830> because<00:03:05.070> at<00:03:05.220> first<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.820> thought<00:03:06.120> that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
find too because at first I thought that

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.840 
find too because at first I thought that
this<00:03:07.440> chapter<00:03:07.950> overall<00:03:08.460> might<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:08.760> been

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
this chapter overall might have been

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.970 
this chapter overall might have been
fake<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.690> because<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:10.140> leaked<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.530> Korean

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
fake just because it leaked in Korean

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.140 
fake just because it leaked in Korean
which<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.220> thought<00:03:11.340> was<00:03:11.460> weird<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.970> should<00:03:12.060> have

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
which I thought was weird it should have

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.970 
which I thought was weird it should have
been<00:03:12.240> in<00:03:12.330> Japanese<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.410> top<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.800> it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
been in Japanese and on top of that it

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.200 
been in Japanese and on top of that it
had<00:03:14.100> announced<00:03:14.340> our<00:03:14.550> dragon<00:03:14.880> ball<00:03:15.000> but

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
had announced our dragon ball but

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.030 
had announced our dragon ball but
honestly<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.870> think<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.440> was<00:03:16.560> just<00:03:16.710> human<00:03:16.920> error

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
honestly I think it was just human error

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.280 
honestly I think it was just human error
really<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.910> someone<00:03:18.090> screwed<00:03:18.300> up<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.900> don't

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
really just someone screwed up I don't

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.810 
really just someone screwed up I don't
think<00:03:19.470> there's<00:03:19.740> nine<00:03:19.860> nine<00:03:20.310> dragon<00:03:20.670> balls

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
think there's nine nine dragon balls

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.980 
think there's nine nine dragon balls
which<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.150> hope<00:03:21.330> that's<00:03:21.570> not<00:03:21.600> because<00:03:21.810> that'd

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
which I hope that's not because that'd

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.810 
which I hope that's not because that'd
be<00:03:22.080> really<00:03:22.290> weird<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.800> feel<00:03:22.920> like<00:03:23.280> seven<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
be really weird I feel like seven is the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.910 
be really weird I feel like seven is the
iconic<00:03:24.150> number<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.690> adding<00:03:24.959> two<00:03:25.410> more<00:03:25.620> would

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
iconic number and adding two more would

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.680 
iconic number and adding two more would
just<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.310> just<00:03:26.610> wouldn't<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.150> right

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
just it just wouldn't be right

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.630 
just it just wouldn't be right
so<00:03:27.840> yeah<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:28.860> want<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.160> still<00:03:29.220> wonder<00:03:29.490> your
