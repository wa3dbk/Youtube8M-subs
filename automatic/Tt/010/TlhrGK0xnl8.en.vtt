and<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.780> awful<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> started<00:00:47.309> with

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and it was just awful so I started with

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.369 
and it was just awful so I started with
Hippocrates<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.550> moved<00:00:50.550> forward<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:52.170> first

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
Hippocrates and moved forward the first

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.619 
Hippocrates and moved forward the first
volume<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> two

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
volume of this what is going to be a two

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.470 
volume of this what is going to be a two
volume<00:00:54.809> set<00:00:55.520> really<00:00:56.520> only<00:00:56.760> goes<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.120> far<00:00:57.329> as

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
volume set really only goes as far as

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
volume set really only goes as far as
1900<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.579> I've<00:01:00.420> moved<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.620> dealing

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
1900 and then I've moved now to dealing

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.590 
1900 and then I've moved now to dealing
with<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> things<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.180> happened<00:01:03.329> in

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
with the things that have happened in

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
with the things that have happened in
the<00:01:03.750> 20th<00:01:03.930> century<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.890> two<00:01:05.100> volumes<00:01:05.580> then

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the 20th century the two volumes then

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
the 20th century the two volumes then
really<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.840> capstone<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
really will be the capstone of the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370 
really will be the capstone of the
historical<00:01:08.369> research<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.510> I've<00:01:09.659> done<00:01:09.689> on

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
historical research that I've done on

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
time volume one is different in that

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.330 
time volume one is different in that
each<00:01:15.720> chapter<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.530> set<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.159> an
