00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.140
 What are you saying, beauty guys are here today? 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.750
 this play that plays the demo available 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.080
 on steam for free but if you do not have 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.570
 Yes, for the love of God, make an account. 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.510
 Bocce only gave because it is very fantastic 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.430
 in romario who played here with sonic divan 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.710
 and took all eyes platform 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.180
 possible on the planet can not fail to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.860
 download this game can not fail to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.590
 I should only test and see if I really 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.469
 it's worth it because I downloaded the demo I 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.309
 I really liked it and I'm just waiting for my 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.899
 Mother give me money so I can 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.210
 buy they had the pre-sale hand 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.370
 because it 's fantastic if you still do not 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.530
 Do you know the brother it 's time to meet 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.899
 the game was born in 1922 for the atari 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.579
 jaguar follows seven years later with the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.860
 playstation was also released. 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.229
 released for playstation where he sold 10 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.180
 million copies a year later was released 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.750
 heimann 2 who repeated the success of 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.750
 sales 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.360
 then comes the m3 which was a total fiasco 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.590
 and the producer lost a lot of money 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.450
 it was not only a race in which she lost a 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.979
 big mass but she liked it 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.390
 enough in mp that was already a success 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.549
 even if it guaranteed 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.159
 and they went down it was not so 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.860
 Good when I was a kid, I played 12 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.189
 on PC because it came out in 2003 and this is the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.560
 name watching the game and 2003 did not like 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.950
 quite interesting and was a hero 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.500
 which was the the icon to the dreamcast 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 who had to indicate if he knows and more 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.009
 than others more than the other 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.890
 People there but do not talk about it here. 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.170
 oil since it is the game in question here he 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.329
 again repeats the game formula of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 platform and surgeries platform will 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.810
 leave a link here 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.049
 of a friend channel of my cousin and 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.689
 video of john and jonathan is johnny 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.250
 He made a video explaining how it is. 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.409
 step by step it is a game of 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.600
 platform moves feeling better but 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.850
 as it says in the video roughly in 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.670
 platform is a game in two goals 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.099
 there you have a depth in 3d but 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.690
 if you go to see the game well it 's in 2d where 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.280
 You just go forward down to 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.560
 clear up to the other you do not 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.569
 I can not even the world until I 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.930
 front and you hop from place to place 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.940
 Kill the animals takes bonus items and is 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.160
 practically this is divided into phases 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.140
 right which it is a very difficult thing 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.230
 usually there is the practice of 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.000
 Permissions today it is already the games that speak 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.530
 but this is not his by phases in the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.810
 first phase and at the stage where you can 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.580
 repeat the phase for you to do 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.010
 a better time to catch hidden between 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.430
 to get other things hidden is not 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.470
 are women are not drugs and no no 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.700
 nothing like that, the guys will not go 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.459
 stop thinking about these things 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.190
 It's in the m then I liked it pretty much. 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.290
 I've played the demo five times in three 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.970
 The phases that have me just can not do it 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.959
 the last phase of water that is 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.600
 very difficult 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.950
 and I hope they get started 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.459
 with the launch of the game that is also 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.549
 visible on your twitter did not say more 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.459
 I tried to suffer for those who did not like it and 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.440
 You now have the technical things you want. 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.390
 there are four and you can talk to four 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.239
 characters can go with the read itself 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.090
 this little guy and blonde pa purple shirt 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.480
 he leaves the hand i roger kumble 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.850
 blue sap boxers you want a friend 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.200
 I already donated my residence 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.200
 two new characters 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.049
 I think they are new, at least the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.000
 that I understood so far that in 2009 the 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.329
 new impacts on the question speaking order 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.310
 when I used to exist before but I do not know 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.310
 type in the series the first time it is 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.470
 looking like the truth justin forget 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.780
 the two neighbors there I think they do not 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.850
 they are the same character but they blows 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.920
 they are very similar legality of them is well 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.880
 similar is one with the other thing as 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.710
 same desk 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.320
 and also something that is there that has a 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.670
 Good thing, you have the same thing that I 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.320
 I do not know if after you finish 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.120
 mou after you collect everything you have 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.980
 in the first phase you have a history 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.800
 different and for enem is no longer 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.720
 indifferent to the mail or if it is a 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.280
 another guy who is the same as the blue one 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.440
 filled with white polka dots and 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.290
 gameplay is quite simple you 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.780
 will not use the wsb classics for 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.010
 move them but the little ones even with 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.440
 his right hand and left hand 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.600
 You'll leave the space to jump the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.420
 shift to shift the left shift and 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.140
 west to hit guys that's just the game 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.300
 all 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.130
 only because it's cool because each phase has a 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.450
 a different type of plan is because the 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.190
 People talk about the puzzle choice . 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.140
 different different ways of doing 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.370
 a certain thing to make a 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.780
 certain action to open a 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.610
 determined the door to open 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.140
 certain cage glow jequiÃ© for 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.300
 open a knife for the old or the frail 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.640
 but I tell you the gameplay only 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.190
 that's how he saw it because the game is very difficult 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.960
 having a difficulty in that building has 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.150
 a very medium difficulty is well 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.040
 yummy only play is a game I at 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.260
 Unless, God, I already said that. 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.870
 Yes, I played six times, I've had ice cream. 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.280
 I really really liked it a lot because it is 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.820
 something that was my childhood is 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.130
 switched on 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.930
 I cried a lot, Mario, I played a lot of sony. 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.330
 I played really good that kong 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.010
 I really liked everything like that 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.840
 Much when you come back like this is a 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.420
 nostalgic thing you return a 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.310
 little time playing in me is a game 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.440
 I really liked the platform , right? 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.050
 and otherwise taking too right to 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.870
 simple gameplay you have there art 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.040
