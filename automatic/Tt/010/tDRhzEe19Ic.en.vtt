00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.280 
if you look at the underside of the deck
stones<00:02:05.490> you'll<00:02:05.970> see<00:02:06.210> these<00:02:06.360> ribs<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.110> when

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
stones you'll see these ribs that when

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.590 
stones you'll see these ribs that when
installed<00:02:07.740> must<00:02:08.250> run<00:02:08.520> from<00:02:08.729> joists<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.270> joists

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
installed must run from joists to joists

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.999 
installed must run from joists to joists
now<00:02:10.410> there<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.680> three<00:02:10.979> different

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
now there are three different

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.070 
now there are three different
configurations<00:02:11.630> achieved<00:02:12.630> with<00:02:12.960> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
configurations achieved with the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.500 
configurations achieved with the
connector<00:02:13.530> plate<00:02:13.800> there's<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.760> main<00:02:15.120> piece

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
connector plate there's this main piece

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.180 
connector plate there's this main piece
which<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.810> don't<00:02:15.990> have<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.230> cut<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.740> that's

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
which you don't have to cut and that's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.800 
which you don't have to cut and that's
used<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.640> connect<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.030> corners<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.600> four

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
used to connect the corners of four

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.840 
used to connect the corners of four
stones<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.590> then<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.430> these<00:02:20.580> end

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
stones and then you have these end

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.010 
stones and then you have these end
pieces<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.620> these<00:02:22.620> side<00:02:22.980> pieces<00:02:23.840> now<00:02:24.840> we're

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
pieces and these side pieces now we're

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.990 
pieces and these side pieces now we're
ready<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.350> placing<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.770> deck<00:02:25.980> stones<00:02:26.280> we

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
ready for placing the deck stones we

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.120 
ready for placing the deck stones we
know<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.360> our<00:02:27.480> opening<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.080> square<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.800> that

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
know that our opening is square and that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.300 
know that our opening is square and that
our<00:02:29.310> joists<00:02:29.610> are<00:02:29.970> 16<00:02:30.510> inches<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:31.020> center<00:02:31.310> we

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
could almost do this blindfolded

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.010 
could almost do this blindfolded
well<00:02:34.860> not<00:02:35.040> quite<00:02:35.160> now<00:02:36.150> typically<00:02:36.570> you'd<00:02:36.810> place

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
well not quite now typically you'd place

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.260 
well not quite now typically you'd place
