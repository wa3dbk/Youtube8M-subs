00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.309
 Hello , I love you today 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.410
 again a check sends for you 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.690
 and two it's about this kommune knows 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.429
 you are destined for the micro mode of ikea 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.770
 I have now many years already 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.510
 and suffered a bit 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.730
 does not look quite as good and fresh anymore 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.320
 from and I like the dark wood too 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.850
 not from there, I thought so 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.830
 I'll work it over and take you 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.390
 just join in I'll take you with me 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.490
 Edit chalk color and the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.320
 a little something to change drawers 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.429
 and whatever else I intend to do that 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.649
 looks in this video 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:43.300
 So I'll see you soon 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.249
 only understood unscrewed and the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.569
 Drawer cleared and walls looks like that 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.069
 as if a bomb had hit 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:50.379
 but that does not matter 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.030
 and now I will be the top layer 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.559
 may be a bit to rise by 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.879
 we do not need to sand it down 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.280
 just have to rough it up a bit 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.239
 then later the chalk color and 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.589
 on the wood path 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.569
 and then you can do it simple 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.239
 sandpaper then grind it 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:06.610
 with a fine payment of all hundreds 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.290
 or names of the 20s planning and then how 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.149
 said only slightly to grind in 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.439
 direction of storage and then could 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:16.240
 already quasi ans to quarrel 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.189
 if your piece of furniture then something 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.530
 has cut then goes again with 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.469
 to slightly damp rag over it 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.880
 We remove sanding dust 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.880
 actually already as painting 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.680
 I did not ask for mine 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.120
 always in aluminum foil or also can 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.659
 Freezer bag rinsing and rubber too 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.460
 do 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.020
 then you do not always need enough 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.760
 because now we have to wait for now 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.390
 that it dried a bit around 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.100
 then apply the second layer 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.390
 that was now painting number two and 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.850
 Now I have to dry for two hours 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.410
 leave and then we can continue 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.360
 will tell you now that I am 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.130
 For the last time shows and I never 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.470
 I'll torment it again but I know 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.560
 not if I try I can do 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.450
 srg and I would like now the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.820
 drawers when decorating again with 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.230
 the photo transfer technique i have here 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.880
 nice wrapping paper I have 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.830
 then found in the depot 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.120
 Unfortunately, I only have that right 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.410
 Unfortunately it is not enough anymore 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.060
 my three drawers 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.340
 but I wanted to see you again 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.100
 also show that you see how great that is 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.290
 also works painted surfaces there 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.900
 that even the wrapping paper is it 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.670
 difficult that now smiles like that 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.860
 to apply with the transfer technique 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.840
 everything then paper too fast 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.120
 interspersed and of size then 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.190
 but it is very unwieldy because of that 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.850
 I now in smaller pieces 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.829
 tear and then glue on as well 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.510
 that looks like it's like this 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.190
 a bit flaked off and then 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.750
 later a little bit more 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.730
 making it a harmonious transition 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.110
 I also believe I have it now 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.430
 stored enough I show you the best 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.670
 what I mean 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.239
 look at yourself and then I travel 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.239
 me differently 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.390
 really rip and you already have 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.930
 always like and the world talk and dance 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.560
 become 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.990
 at individual construction sites so I have a goal 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.380
 again a photo transfer mio and 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:43.630
 this torn wallpaper pieces 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:47.330
 rubbish wrapping paper pieces and then 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.140
 and then I paint one first 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.510
 drawer 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.110
 at the moment where i put the paper 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.520
 do not apply now and then scratch 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:01.840
 I put my paper one way and then I put it 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.840
 the paper easy 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.910
 on which a kitchen towel 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.110
 and just paint that smooth as well 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.160
 You see, I have that too now 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.560
 really just so piecemeal 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.600
 glued on and it is also raises 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.950
 Some places fold that too 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.420
 not at all bad because that will be yes 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.459
 anyway sanded close and should 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.650
 yes look a bit like that 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.490
 would have peeled off and then if 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.200
 I have adhered to the dry season 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.570
 then I can just with a cloth 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.350
 or swam it all a bit 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.350
 on wet 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.360
 then you see already comes with the deep 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.730
 but could be with your finger 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.470
 Carefully rub the paper top 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.870
 paper layer that is still on it 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.630
 from the wrapping paper to the color 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.630
 just comes out 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.580
 so now I have it all nice 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.069
 scrubbed out so it looks right now 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.019
 Of course, the transitions are still there 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:18.739
 a little hard that's why I will 

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:21.379
 just a little bit more now 

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:25.119
 let it dry and then I will 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.119
 transitions a bit stop 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.580
 I like that down here 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.370
 I'll do that a little bit now 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.170
 cherry look free work and here 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.640
 the corners and edges again for so long 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:48.940
 sanding is the wood again 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:50.350
 through small community is now finished 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.020
 but everyone won 1 again 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.790
 Nevertheless , it still looks like something 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.200
 will not be left by us therefore 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.700
 have to tidy up a bit again 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.320
 so I can continue working 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.730
 At some point the dresser is ready for me 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.950
 I'm also very happy with the result 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.140
 so beautiful bright and it fits much better 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.850
 into a room and I have here 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.420
 even such metal signs just turn 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.910
 made 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.010
 to the hot glue I have you a whole 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.440
 shown briefly and although I have the 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.240
 mentally order times at vws have ordered 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.880
 We really believe 99 cents three pieces 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.470
 I taste like this below 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.370
 all other materials again 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.200
 in the infobox 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.730
 and that they only look nice in this way 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.280
 a bit on chemistry made with part 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.270
 signs in the train a bit super 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.530
 can paced 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.820
 that means if I have something else then 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.030
 clean but I just can 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.460
 wipe and greens 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.440
 Great thing now I'll show you 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.000
 a few of the three shots of the 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.890
 Come on so you 're a little better 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.230
 you can see there you wish now 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.880
 have fun and see you 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.260
 I'm looking forward to next week 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.260
 So bye bye
