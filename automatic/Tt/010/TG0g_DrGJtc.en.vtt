00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 a compact car with that certain something 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.710
 more power under the hood in the vernacular 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 Also called hot hatch at mercedes 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.960
 the a 250 is just a tenant 43 high 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.920
 short overhangs a massive one 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.900
 rear view and also the interior 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.710
 speaks the new design language young 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:28.120
 dynamic man was successful again 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:33.310
 once concluded with test in humans 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.440
 the a 250 drives a four-cylinder 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.230
 turbo engine on 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.790
 if I now pressure on gas 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.100
 then I realize how he correctly 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:49.370
 beautiful blows very wide speed range 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:54.140
 what bothers me something is missing 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.629
 bit this bite 211 ps out 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.690
 two liters of displacement a maximum 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.629
 torque of 350 newton meters 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.850
 Mr. siebengang-automatik wanders the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.850
 force then in the direction of the front axle 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.860
 the special feature of the a 250 is it 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.850
 only with double clutch transmission this 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.710
 dual-clutch transmission builds mercedes 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.000
 even because mercedes has a long time 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.130
 driven tradition 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.110
 of course one also says this form 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.390
 we want a gearbox ourselves 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.209
 develop and manufacture the costs 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.439
 Of course money but of course you have 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:33.399
 then everything in hand 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.610
 in the beginning the gear was pretty mau 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.649
 the a 250 is now a proof that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.539
 after an improvement or yet 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.939
 some improvements to this gearbox 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:49.640
 really sensational what switches here 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.789
 rather a weak spot is we have 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.970
 here the central gear selector 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.739
 the wander years here is all that steering wheel 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.259
 Maybe that has the advantage that I am here 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:02.030
 faster to use but come on the 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.709
 disadvantage that here in the center console 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.860
 simply nothing more, it is a 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:10.549
 It would be a pity to get over it 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.980
 is a lot for a guy like the a 250 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.980
 rather the right sound 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.510
 Well, the engine sounds like the engine sounds 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.360
 a bit sporty but there are 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.540
 no approach noise increase 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.739
 no kind of sound 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.650
 Design the speed up a bit 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.330
 to roar but really sporty 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.020
 Does not that sound that I really think 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.420
 disappointing 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.880
 hard words for the little one out 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.350
 stuttgart he has the predicate hot 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.930
 hatch was wrong 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.530
 the readings will show what really 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.410
 in it is so good to accelerate 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:01.130
 against the manual mode of the gearbox 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:06.230
 Spd I activate here should slow down 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.230
 stuck by the brake 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.989
 more even though the manual mode 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.819
 I'm taking over switching myself 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.019
 obviously he has one here 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:22.079
 identifier for the acceleration 0 to 100 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:26.579
 as the manufacturer promises in the 66th 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:29.430
 seconds is 100 pace next 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.870
 Discipline the simulation of the seriousness 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.280
 the full braking from 100 km / h 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.280
 I speed up again on tempo 100 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:47.669
 really pressure that has me now 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.060
 So one really surprised 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:53.400
 sensationally good brakes 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.159
 sensational means after 36 meters 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.159
 the a 250 stops 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:08.310
 last but not least the 18 meter slalom den 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:12.530
 Slalom we drive again with esp but 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.530
 in manual gear mode 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.209
 I'm really surprised how 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:23.310
 jagged the class so a link below 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.860
 So control very safe driving 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.640
 very simple but also very fast 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.390
 that was really good is really good 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:40.830
 here a maximum of 64 km / h in the game with the 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:43.880
 fillings first on the main road then 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.010
 on closed route of mercedes a 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.100
 250 has the program easily behind 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.080
 brought and above all one shown with 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.070
 he has nothing to do with the class of yesteryear 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.430
 more to do 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.430
 red
