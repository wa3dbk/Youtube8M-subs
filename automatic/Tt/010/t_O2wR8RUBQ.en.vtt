00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.809 

nice<00:00:04.090> finished<00:00:04.990> blowing<00:00:05.500> devil<00:00:06.130> here<00:00:06.550> we<00:00:06.609> go

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:06.819 
nice finished blowing devil here we go

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.970 
nice finished blowing devil here we go
and<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:10.420> the<00:00:10.809> idea<00:00:11.200> is<00:00:11.349> that<00:00:11.380> this<00:00:11.800> is

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
and so the idea is that this is

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.860 
and so the idea is that this is
obviously<00:00:12.280> our<00:00:12.549> job<00:00:12.910> to<00:00:13.030> fly<00:00:13.150> this<00:00:13.269> bird<00:00:13.630> this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
obviously our job to fly this bird this

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:23.240 
obviously our job to fly this bird this
one's<00:00:14.080> gonna<00:00:14.200> give<00:00:14.380> it<00:00:14.500> try<00:00:14.740> it<00:00:14.769> flying<00:00:20.490> wings

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
one's gonna give it try it flying wings

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:38.719 
one's gonna give it try it flying wings
I<00:00:24.250> guess<00:00:24.850> no<00:00:25.060> one<00:00:36.449> box<00:00:37.449> you<00:00:37.780> know<00:00:37.870> it's<00:00:38.080> glowing

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:38.729 
I guess no one box you know it's glowing

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:40.680 
I guess no one box you know it's glowing
if<00:00:39.729> you<00:00:39.850> look<00:00:40.000> back<00:00:40.150> there's<00:00:40.360> a<00:00:40.449> bit<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:40.659> other

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
if you look back there's a bit the other

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.170 
if you look back there's a bit the other
touch<00:00:41.140> you<00:00:41.409> and<00:00:42.159> the<00:00:42.790> two<00:00:43.030> different

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
touch you and the two different

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.100 
touch you and the two different
mechanisms<00:00:43.479> that<00:00:44.019> I<00:00:44.080> tried<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:46.059> was<00:00:46.330> this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
mechanisms that I tried this was this

00:00:47.110 --> 00:01:06.260 
mechanisms that I tried this was this
mechanism<00:00:47.850> uses<00:00:49.290> purely<00:01:03.930> mr.<00:01:04.930> balance<00:01:05.290> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
mechanism uses purely mr. balance the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.420 
mechanism uses purely mr. balance the
force<00:01:07.270> on<00:01:07.510> me<00:01:07.720> on<00:01:08.170> this<00:01:08.290> editor<00:01:08.710> they<00:01:09.130> say<00:01:09.370> it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
force on me on this editor they say it

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.240 
force on me on this editor they say it
which<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:09.760> attached<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.090> this<00:01:10.470> collar<00:01:11.470> it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
which is attached to this collar it

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.110 
which is attached to this collar it
could<00:01:12.490> work

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
could work

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.000 
could work
we<00:01:13.450> won't<00:01:13.690> come<00:01:13.960> but<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.200> was<00:01:14.290> just<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.620> make<00:01:14.830> it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
we won't come but it was just to make it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.650 
we won't come but it was just to make it
even<00:01:15.160> really<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:18.430> center<00:01:18.850> cam<00:01:19.060> drives

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
even really and they center cam drives

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.630 
even really and they center cam drives
the<00:01:19.900> main<00:01:20.080> shaft<00:01:20.440> up<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.920> Amidon<00:01:21.340> when<00:01:21.550> the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
the main shaft up and Amidon when the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.130 
the main shaft up and Amidon when the
others<00:01:21.970> of<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.180> main<00:01:22.360> shaft<00:01:22.630> would<00:01:22.840> have<00:01:22.990> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
others of the main shaft would have the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.530 
others of the main shaft would have the
delegator<00:01:23.560> touched<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.710> then<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.070> collar

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
delegator touched and then the collar

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.310 
delegator touched and then the collar
would<00:01:28.540> attach<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:31.150> same<00:01:31.390> as<00:01:31.630> on<00:01:31.840> this<00:01:32.080> one

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
would attach to be same as on this one

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.899 
would attach to be same as on this one
here<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.710> color<00:01:32.920> would<00:01:33.070> attach<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.670> wings

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
here the color would attach the wings

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.230 
here the color would attach the wings
remove<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.930> collar<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.350> them<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.909> can<00:01:37.060> see

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
remove the collar of them you can see

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.460 
remove the collar of them you can see
there's<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.510> way<00:01:37.630> just<00:01:37.840> going<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.170> opposite

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
there's a way just going the opposite

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.690 
there's a way just going the opposite
directions<00:01:39.000> call<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.120> goes<00:01:40.240> up<00:01:40.450> twins<00:01:40.780> go<00:01:41.020> down

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.670 

but<00:01:45.299> I'll<00:01:45.450> try<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:47.490> save<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:48.380> shape<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
but I'll try that to save a shape of the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.060 
but I'll try that to save a shape of the
cabinet<00:01:50.159> there<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.659> see<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.920> empty

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
cabinet there you can see all the empty

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.510 
cabinet there you can see all the empty
counters<00:01:54.229> experience<00:01:55.229> section<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.070> follows

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
counters experience section that follows

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.350 
counters experience section that follows
the<00:01:56.970> curve<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.990> eunuch<00:01:58.200> percent<00:01:58.830> come

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.130 

provide<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.509> floppy<00:02:03.780> movement<00:02:05.750> in<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> end<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
provide the floppy movement in the end I

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.900 
provide the floppy movement in the end I
decided<00:02:07.200> against<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.850> because<00:02:10.910> this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
decided against that just because this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.509 
decided against that just because this
way<00:02:12.480> was<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.590> way<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.830> moved<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> shaft<00:02:14.400> I

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
way was the way it moved the shaft I

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.180 
way was the way it moved the shaft I
would<00:02:14.640> rather<00:02:14.819> have<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> positive<00:02:15.900> Drive<00:02:16.190> like

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
would rather have a positive Drive like

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.440 
would rather have a positive Drive like
yeah<00:02:17.370> when<00:02:17.610> account<00:02:17.910> my<00:02:18.090> father<00:02:19.850> originally<00:02:20.850> I

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
yeah when account my father originally I

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.910 
yeah when account my father originally I
had<00:02:21.510> made<00:02:22.730> crank<00:02:23.730> slider<00:02:24.030> mechanism<00:02:24.799> with<00:02:25.799> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
had made crank slider mechanism with a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.620 
had made crank slider mechanism with a
from<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.580> camera<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> outside<00:02:27.150> of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
from and then a camera on the outside of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.840 
from and then a camera on the outside of
it<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:28.049> were<00:02:28.110> evenly<00:02:28.500> spaced<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.489> as<00:02:29.700> you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
it and they were evenly spaced so as you

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.420 
it and they were evenly spaced so as you
moved<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.989> wings<00:02:31.230> fluffed<00:02:31.680> four<00:02:31.980> times<00:02:32.280> as

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
moved it the wings fluffed four times as

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.729 
moved it the wings fluffed four times as
fast<00:02:32.489> as<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> bit<00:02:33.319> but<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.560> end<00:02:34.680> I

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
fast as you a bit but in the end I

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.160 
fast as you a bit but in the end I
decided<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.280> use<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.610> same<00:02:36.209> camera<00:02:36.750> father<00:02:37.019> I

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
decided to use the same camera father I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:51.470 
decided to use the same camera father I
had<00:02:37.290> used<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:39.590> only<00:02:40.590> model<00:02:50.329> so<00:02:51.329> you<00:02:51.390> can

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
had used on the only model so you can

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.690 
had used on the only model so you can
say<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:52.459> again

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
say that again

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.979 
say that again
-<00:02:54.420> comes<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.120> outside<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.600> again<00:02:57.660> it's

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
- comes on the outside and again it's

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.460 
- comes on the outside and again it's
just<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.320> balance<00:02:59.630> that<00:03:00.630> piece<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.230> so

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
just to balance that piece there so

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.650 
just to balance that piece there so
you're<00:03:01.680> moving<00:03:01.829> in<00:03:02.160> there<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.790> pull<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.450> up

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
you're moving in there and pull it up

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.150 
you're moving in there and pull it up
and<00:03:03.870> down<00:03:05.359> and<00:03:06.359> we<00:03:06.510> should<00:03:06.540> tune<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.350> is

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
and down and we should tune it so is

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.420 
and down and we should tune it so is
there<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> bit<00:03:08.579> even<00:03:08.880> space<00:03:09.180> now<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.890> first<00:03:11.160> of

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
there a bit even space now the first of

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.990 
there a bit even space now the first of
clapping's
