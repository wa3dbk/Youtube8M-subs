i<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:40.050> ads<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> don't<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:40.950> pandora

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
i do have ads so I don't have pandora

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.580 
i do have ads so I don't have pandora
one<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.180> had<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.719> an<00:00:42.930> unlimited

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
one and I had to have an unlimited

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.139 
one and I had to have an unlimited
number<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.010> skips<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.579> essentially<00:00:44.879> just

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
number of skips I can essentially just

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.490 
number of skips I can essentially just
keep<00:00:45.300> skipping<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.780> many<00:00:45.960> times<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.320> i<00:00:46.440> would

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
keep skipping as many times as i would

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.440 
keep skipping as many times as i would
like<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:47.969> actually<00:00:48.059> very<00:00:48.270> very

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
like here now this is actually very very

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.209 
like here now this is actually very very
easy<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.989> accomplish<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.590> your<00:00:49.739> device<00:00:50.039> is

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
easy to accomplish and your device is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
easy to accomplish and your device is
going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
going to be have to be or is going to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.540 
going to be have to be or is going to
have<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.350> jailbroken<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.980> accomplish<00:00:53.370> this

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
have to be jailbroken to accomplish this

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.639 
have to be jailbroken to accomplish this
so<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.510> you're<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.140> open<00:00:55.469> up

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
so what you're going to do is open up

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.080 
so what you're going to do is open up
cydia<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> wait<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
cydia and you're going to wait for it to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569 
cydia and you're going to wait for it to
load<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:58.620> come<00:00:58.890> over<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
load and then come over here to the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.760 
load and then come over here to the
search<00:00:59.789> bar<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> course<00:01:00.899> Cydia<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.530> really

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
search bar now of course Cydia is really

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.930 
search bar now of course Cydia is really
annoying<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.399> takes<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.670> little<00:01:02.820> while

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
annoying because it takes a little while

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
annoying because it takes a little while
to<00:01:03.149> load<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.629> soon<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:03.960> done<00:01:04.110> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to load but as soon as that's done this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.469 
to load but as soon as that's done this
is<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.129> very<00:01:05.369> easy<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.850> name<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> tweak

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
is very very easy the name of the tweak

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.969 
is very very easy the name of the tweak
essentially<00:01:06.960> does<00:01:07.140> suggest<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.770> does

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
essentially does suggest what it does

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.340 
essentially does suggest what it does
and<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> called<00:01:08.640> Pandora<00:01:09.150> skips<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:10.200> this
