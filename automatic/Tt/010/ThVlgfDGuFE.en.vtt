00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.869
 what does it look like in a pilot's head when it comes to boosting power 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.909
 of a motorcycle with a thousand motorcycle 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.909
 for your project 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.900
 290 kilometers per hour 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.690
 timothy 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.210
 even stopped 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.620
 that's scary 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.620
 but there are people who think little 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.830
 pilot leandro melo wants to improve 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.920
 which already seemed to be the best 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.000
 is for me a whole 300-per-hour motorcycle that I got in two-pontoon generation 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.760
 cedar 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.649
 is a first-mover action of the north wing and 64 wing are originally it 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.820
 it will get better 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 because the last time she showed up 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.080
 the most important concepts in this project this weight reduction 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 for this new and lighter parts 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.520
 replace the heavier originals the ball rolls 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.880
 for being away from home 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.480
 it has no very large weight reduction compared to the original 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.820
 it becomes 25% lighter 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.460
 and 40% tougher than the wheel the newspaper 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.600
 brake disc with the fact that these records he ends up being older than 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 in an original bed also takes two Achilles children that prevented him from being able 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.650
 to dispute 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.460
 anderson da silva milk that there was no external crisis for much more 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.890
 fast 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 you are within the law developed 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.780
 the performance and also is that in addition to weight reduction 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.680
 materials such as carbon fiber which has been used in formula 1, the 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.590
 are much more resilient 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 with these changes improve the power-to-power ratio 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:10.849
 did not understand 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.229
 so done 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.929
 barack obama can be produced in the world today 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.109
 will pull less than a month and 10 ten days 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.969
 so you have an idea about the captivity with more powerful cars all 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.379
 the fastest of the day 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.269
 - each one of them 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.269
 the horses pulled two kilos of weight 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.989
 to 300 per hour yet for those who do not have stability 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.959
 because the bike has to be more balanced now because it was born 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.019
 in the front fairing aerodynamic effect depression was showing 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:44.849
 formula 1 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.610
 but not so France and in Sana'a in France in the fairing of solidarity 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.989
 it's not samantha kane all these little toys the new musical show on 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.709
 there is a special computer on board is the absence because of the moment 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.639
 where the rudder is over think it is 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.340
 I'm a set of handsets that does this 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.489
 the idea is to format force g 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.239
 already running gravity already the striker for his cast June 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.639
 the bike is now on top of the roller dynamometer that the equipment 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.120
 which will measure what power is coming here in the wheel 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.530
 besides, you can also check it out too, it was well done. 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.630
 now the coolest of all 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.530
 and here 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.860
 you can speed up 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.860
 a new date without any risk 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.340
 so far we have been able to generate 180 horsepower 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.409
 r 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.379
 3rd 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.090
 present in pleasures 99 some knowledge except Tuesday 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.589
 now this equation 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:59.859
 here the result 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.859
 now it remains to know if she is doing well 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.349
 visual 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.639
 brand new 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.120
 track visible 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.120
 there must be explosives 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.599
 what to expect 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.599
 I think this is more than expected 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.909
 After all, you still think it's a little 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.449
 the best age 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.580
