00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.289 
everything that we've been able to
gather<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.290> far<00:04:04.680> I'm<00:04:05.159> judging<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.760> picture<00:04:06.180> of

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
gather so far I'm judging the picture of

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.280 
gather so far I'm judging the picture of
this<00:04:06.450> super<00:04:06.959> crocodile<00:04:07.530> from<00:04:07.769> Africa<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.910> be

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
this super crocodile from Africa to be

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.089 
this super crocodile from Africa to be
real<00:04:11.030> now<00:04:12.030> as<00:04:12.359> to<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.810> size<00:04:13.199> of<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.560> crocodile

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.250 
real now as to the size of the crocodile
that's<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.760> totally<00:04:15.389> different<00:04:15.419> issue<00:04:15.900> but

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
that's a totally different issue but

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.860 
that's a totally different issue but
could<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.250> be<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.579> biggest<00:04:17.940> crocodile<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.750> the

do an estimate if you look at the

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.020 
do an estimate if you look at the
photograph<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.949> will<00:04:38.069> notice<00:04:38.460> an<00:04:38.639> orange
