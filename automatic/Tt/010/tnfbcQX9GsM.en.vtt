first<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.920> way<00:00:37.070> I<00:00:37.100> had<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.550> set<00:00:37.760> up<00:00:37.940> before<00:00:38.360> I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
first the way I had to set up before I

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.600 
first the way I had to set up before I
had<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.670> blue<00:00:41.570> wire<00:00:41.809> from<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.290> Steve<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:42.980> the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
had the blue wire from the Steve and the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.910 
had the blue wire from the Steve and the
red<00:00:43.850> wire<00:00:44.120> from<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.420> stage<00:00:44.750> put<00:00:45.290> it<00:00:45.470> to<00:00:45.710> these

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
red wire from the stage put it to these

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.110 
red wire from the stage put it to these
two<00:00:46.190> wires<00:00:46.430> coming<00:00:47.000> here<00:00:48.159> one<00:00:49.159> to<00:00:49.309> two<00:00:49.610> wires

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
two wires coming here one to two wires

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.410 
two wires coming here one to two wires
out<00:00:50.480> of<00:00:50.659> three<00:00:50.930> here<00:00:51.350> on<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:52.300> esc<00:00:54.610> well<00:00:55.610> some

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
out of three here on the esc well some

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.049 
out of three here on the esc well some
people<00:00:56.830> MCPS<00:00:57.830> is<00:00:58.040> weren't<00:00:58.280> working<00:00:58.699> with<00:00:58.850> that

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
people MCPS is weren't working with that

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.630 
people MCPS is weren't working with that
and<00:00:59.239> some<00:00:59.420> people<00:00:59.750> was<00:01:00.050> working<00:01:00.559> with<00:01:00.650> that<00:01:00.860> so

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
and some people was working with that so

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.110 
and some people was working with that so
it<00:01:02.089> seemed<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.659> think<00:01:03.110> that<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:03.769> might<00:01:03.979> be<00:01:04.309> a

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
it seemed to think that it might be a

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.350 
it seemed to think that it might be a
different<00:01:05.659> type<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.409> board<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:07.400> horizon<00:01:07.970> was

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
different type of board that horizon was

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.990 
different type of board that horizon was
using<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.229> do<00:01:09.950> this<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:12.200> what<00:01:13.159> one<00:01:13.640> of<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.790> guys

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
using to do this so what one of the guys

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.149 
using to do this so what one of the guys
from<00:01:14.030> Helle<00:01:14.659> freak<00:01:14.990> came<00:01:15.290> up<00:01:15.560> with<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.979> was

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
from Helle freak came up with I was

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.130 
from Helle freak came up with I was
talking<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.520> him<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.790> phone<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.750> he<00:01:17.810> came

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
talking to him on the phone and he came

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.219 
talking to him on the phone and he came
up<00:01:18.170> with<00:01:18.440> his<00:01:18.500> idea<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.460> he<00:01:20.420> call<00:01:20.750> me<00:01:20.869> back<00:01:21.049> let

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
up with his idea and he call me back let

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.969 
up with his idea and he call me back let
me<00:01:21.350> know<00:01:21.469> that<00:01:21.649> work<00:01:22.570> was<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.869> get<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.350> good

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
me know that work was to get a good

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.810 
me know that work was to get a good
enough<00:01:25.180> power<00:01:26.180> current<00:01:26.920> front<00:01:27.920> from<00:01:28.399> the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
enough power current front from the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.480 
enough power current front from the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
battery to the Steve converter is to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.160 
battery to the Steve converter is to
basically<00:01:35.799> take<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.070> blue<00:01:37.340> wire<00:01:37.609> here<00:01:38.170> from

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
basically take the blue wire here from

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.349 
basically take the blue wire here from
the<00:01:39.289> Steve<00:01:39.530> sought<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.250> directly<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:41.119> the

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
the Steve sought it directly to the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.090 
the Steve sought it directly to the

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
main motor board the yellow wire I

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.220 
main motor board the yellow wire I
sought<00:06:10.160> it<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.490> the<00:06:10.640> positive<00:06:10.910> side<00:06:11.450> of<00:06:11.930> the

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
sought it to the positive side of the

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.570 
sought it to the positive side of the
main<00:06:12.790> motor<00:06:13.790> board<00:06:14.240> make<00:06:15.200> main<00:06:15.590> plugs<00:06:16.010> or<00:06:16.310> the

main motor board make main plugs or the
motorable<00:06:17.030> other<00:06:17.810> board<00:06:18.400> so<00:06:19.400> here<00:06:20.030> it<00:06:20.150> is

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
motorable other board so here it is

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.620 
motorable other board so here it is
right<00:06:20.360> here<00:06:21.580> alright<00:06:22.580> I<00:06:22.960> hope<00:06:23.960> this<00:06:24.230> helps<00:06:24.740> as

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
right here alright I hope this helps as

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.370 
right here alright I hope this helps as
always<00:06:26.630> say<00:06:26.900> god<00:06:27.740> is<00:06:27.770> good<00:06:28.130> all<00:06:28.490> the<00:06:28.610> time
