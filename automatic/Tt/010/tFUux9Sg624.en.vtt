00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.090
 Hello dear viewers decided 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.650
 make a new development video about how 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.440
 learn to draw any skills 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.740
 need to own to about more or less 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.900
 quality outrun rival well for 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.820
 to learn to circle me 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.210
 seems to need to be able to own 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.859
 both feet well for example you own 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.169
 right foot one hundred percent and left 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.599
 is she there if you are at least somewhere percent 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:36.090
 70 you have developed that is you can do 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.980
 on weight for example blow some or any 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.720
 the soles there ball throw a little or 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.790
 pass well you have to 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.010
 develop learn to develop in both legs 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.590
 for this, I offer you for example you 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 exercise two or three times a week 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.610
 football play for example the first day you 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.280
 play 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.040
 well, as usual, right foot beat there 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.660
 put the right to the goal set yourself 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.180
 engineer on the second day or meet 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.530
 play mostly with your left foot to 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.470
 you have it developed to develop 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.999
 motility of both legs that is you will be well 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.679
 help all of course right but 

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:12.780
 predominantly play with the other foot 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:15.340
 weaker and then you can develop 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.700
 in itself those qualities that will allow you 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.020
 well lead the rival and now start 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.329
 I will show you with an example 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.539
 in 90 percent of the cases in the stroke 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.979
 participate in both legs and therefore they need 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:31.149
 develop and as best as possible 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.929
 very often football matches 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.100
 leads around by just what 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.289
 shift the ball from one foot to another 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.649
 that is, it will look like this 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.649
 you go that's all it is the most simple 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.080
 winding which is often very well 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.740
 uses that is you go with the sword all 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.140
 it is fast where orient rivals 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.060
 as if your direction of travel 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.110
 you have somewhere to go to get away to the left on the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.580
 In fact, you prokidyvayte other side 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.040
 the next move you are a false swing foot 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.600
 when during the dribbling you put 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.610
 movements do in one direction we want 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.610
 other foot to the other now show how 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:17.890
 done during dribbling the following 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.890
 movement is a false setting to toss 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.790
 but in order to statics for example 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.640
 pa rival you stand a friend in front 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.200
 I propose to circle one another 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.030
 option 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.590
 soles your ball rolls like this and 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.230
 toss it on the other foot and 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.300
 go away from him that is to do it 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.470
 sharp jerks 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.470
 show will be 3 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.850
 the next movie is choosing a sword for yourself 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.200
 Waring all here and so Vlad another 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.160
 foot you accompany him 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.160
 now show in speaker 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.470
 king marseilles efendi dan roll he 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.500
 very effective when you have 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.030
 trying to take the ball 2 opponent that is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.710
 first with one foot you stand on the ball 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.480
 prokipyvayte his foot and pick up 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.480
 the other one is like this 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.530
 Once again, for now I will show in dynamics
