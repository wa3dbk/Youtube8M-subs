00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.330
 the woman 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.920
 So it's good with you, it's very 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.969
 slow to early here on the canal the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.529
 Brazilian Recipes 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 I'm here today with a very 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.619
 easy to do that is no harm 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.099
 House made 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.250
 so let's go in a blender we 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.970
 we will put the condensed milk 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:35.489
 the two boxes of sour cream the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:42.750
 yogurt and we'll dump the content 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.820
 of the juice little by little we're going to hit 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.929
 for about a minute two 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:54.530
 minutes quickly there then just put 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:57.510
 in bowls or in a refractory garnish 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.030
 refrigerate for at least two 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.690
 hours or until you get consistency 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.690
 desired 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.590
 so the personal recipe is ready 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.979
 it's time and I see if it really is 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.750
 good so come on 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:55.910
 consistency is very good now 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:59.240
 prove is almost identical to that of 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.040
 danoninho that comes on the market almost 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.090
 identical you have to the opponent 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.610
 feel at home 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:11.690
 I will only be almost identical if it is not 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.739
 inside is not very good to receive all 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.239
