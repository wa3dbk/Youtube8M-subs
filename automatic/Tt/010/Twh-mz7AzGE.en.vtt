the<00:00:52.850> buckles<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:53.420> you'll<00:00:54.110> see<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.650> clasp

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
the buckles and you'll see the clasp

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.400 
the buckles and you'll see the clasp
that<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.880> buckle<00:00:56.180> actually<00:00:56.510> locks<00:00:56.750> down<00:00:57.020> into

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
so when you close it down it's actually

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.270 
so when you close it down it's actually
protected<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:02.780> that's<00:01:02.960> not<00:01:03.110> kind<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.440> pop<00:01:04.070> open

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
protected so that's not kind of pop open

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.730

on<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.759> quite<00:01:05.000> as<00:01:05.180> easily<00:01:05.479> that's<00:01:06.110> also<00:01:06.619> why

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
on you quite as easily that's also why

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.200

they<00:01:06.890> mold<00:01:07.159> in<00:01:07.310> this<00:01:07.460> little<00:01:07.700> piece<00:01:07.880> here<00:01:08.060> you

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
they mold in this little piece here you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.609 
they mold in this little piece here you
might<00:01:08.360> see<00:01:08.509> that<00:01:08.630> on<00:01:08.780> some<00:01:08.960> other<00:01:09.110> boots<00:01:09.380> where

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.530 
might see that on some other boots where
it's<00:01:10.040> designed<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.430> deflect<00:01:10.700> branches<00:01:11.450> and

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540

it's designed to deflect branches and
rocks<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:11.930> things<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:12.289> it<00:01:12.380> doesn't<00:01:12.619> hit<00:01:13.159> your

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
the same direction which makes it really

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.370 
the same direction which makes it really

over<00:01:42.380> them<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:43.280> can<00:01:43.429> change<00:01:43.609> things<00:01:43.789> a

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
over them that can change things a

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.580 
over them that can change things a
little<00:01:43.939> bit<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:44.359> so<00:01:44.869> far<00:01:45.109> like<00:01:45.350> what<00:01:45.499> I'm

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
little bit but so far like what I'm

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.440 
little bit but so far like what I'm
seeing<00:01:45.859> as<00:01:46.219> far<00:01:46.460> as<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.670> buckle<00:01:46.969> system<00:01:47.270> goes

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
seeing as far as the buckle system goes

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.590 
seeing as far as the buckle system goes
obviously<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.899> straps<00:01:48.200> are<00:01:48.380> adjustable<00:01:48.469> and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
obviously the straps are adjustable and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.959 
obviously the straps are adjustable and
upper<00:01:50.600> is<00:01:50.780> fairly<00:01:51.670> accommodating<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:52.880> if

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
upper is fairly accommodating so if

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.999 
upper is fairly accommodating so if
you're<00:01:53.149> wearing<00:01:53.689> knee<00:01:53.840> braces<00:01:54.109> or<00:01:54.530> shin

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
you're wearing knee braces or shin

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.819 
you're wearing knee braces or shin
guards<00:01:55.569> underneath<00:01:56.569> it<00:01:56.990> does<00:01:57.229> have<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.439> nice

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
guards underneath it does have a nice

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.160 
guards underneath it does have a nice
elastic<00:01:58.670> gusset<00:01:59.119> around<00:01:59.359> the<00:01:59.479> top<00:01:59.689> which<00:02:00.139> is

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
elastic gusset around the top which is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.719 
elastic gusset around the top which is
going<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.439> help<00:02:00.590> prevent<00:02:00.859> unwanted<00:02:01.429> debris

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
going to help prevent unwanted debris

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.029 
going to help prevent unwanted debris
and<00:02:02.090> rocks<00:02:02.359> and<00:02:02.600> dirt<00:02:03.170> from<00:02:03.499> going<00:02:03.829> down

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
and rocks and dirt from going down

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.219 
and rocks and dirt from going down
inside<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.700> there<00:02:05.179> you<00:02:05.270> can<00:02:05.389> see<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.749> opening

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
inside and there you can see the opening

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.770 
inside and there you can see the opening
so<00:02:06.469> if<00:02:06.859> you<00:02:06.950> have<00:02:07.069> fairly<00:02:07.399> large<00:02:07.759> calves<00:02:08.119> you

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
so if you have fairly large calves you

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.240 
so if you have fairly large calves you
might<00:02:08.959> run<00:02:09.110> into<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> little<00:02:09.649> bit<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:10.009> tightness

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
might run into a little bit of tightness

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.490 
might run into a little bit of tightness
up<00:02:10.580> here<00:02:10.850> but<00:02:11.360> for<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.600> average<00:02:11.720> guy<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.470> looks

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
up here but for the average guy it looks

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.620 
up here but for the average guy it looks
like<00:02:12.770> they'll<00:02:12.920> work<00:02:13.130> just<00:02:13.160> fine<00:02:13.550> for<00:02:13.880> me

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
like they'll work just fine for me

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.120 
like they'll work just fine for me
they're<00:02:14.900> fine

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
they're fine

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.650 
they're fine
taking<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> look<00:02:16.850> at<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.030> back<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.480> boot

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
taking a look at the back of the boot

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.600 
taking a look at the back of the boot
here<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.260> do<00:02:18.410> have<00:02:18.440> quite<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> bit<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.220> molded

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
here you do have quite a bit of molded

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.920 
here you do have quite a bit of molded
protection<00:02:20.120> at<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.300> back<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.750> foot

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
protection at the back of the foot

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.390 
protection at the back of the foot
basically<00:02:21.410> goes<00:02:21.590> all<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.830> way<00:02:21.920> up<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.280> back

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
basically goes all the way up the back

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.520 
basically goes all the way up the back
of<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.670> leg<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.390> catch<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.990> foot<00:02:24.170> peg<00:02:24.350> to

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
of the leg so if you catch a foot peg to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.780 
of the leg so if you catch a foot peg to
the<00:02:24.620> back<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.920> your<00:02:25.010> calf<00:02:25.190> or<00:02:25.400> anything<00:02:25.580> it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
the back of your calf or anything it's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.150 
the back of your calf or anything it's
gonna<00:02:25.880> help<00:02:26.420> absorb<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:27.020> impact<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.740> then

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
gonna help absorb that impact and then

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.800 
gonna help absorb that impact and then
the<00:02:28.280> sole<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.760> pretty<00:02:29.030> different<00:02:29.270> on<00:02:29.510> these<00:02:29.600> as

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
the sole is pretty different on these as

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.210 
the sole is pretty different on these as
well<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.140> kind<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.380> wraps<00:02:30.680> all<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:30.980> way<00:02:31.100> around

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
well it kind of wraps all the way around

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.110 
well it kind of wraps all the way around
you<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.330> nice<00:02:32.930> thick<00:02:33.200> sole<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.760> going

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
you have a nice thick sole that is going

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.890 
you have a nice thick sole that is going
to<00:02:35.330> be<00:02:37.120> comfortable<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.480> bikes<00:02:38.660> it's

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
to be comfortable on the bikes it's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.270 
to be comfortable on the bikes it's
going<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.080> be<00:02:39.200> able<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.440> you're<00:02:39.980> gonna<00:02:40.040> be<00:02:40.190> able

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
going to be able to you're gonna be able

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.640 
going to be able to you're gonna be able
to<00:02:40.370> move<00:02:40.550> around<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:41.600> do<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.900> replaceable

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
to move around you do have a replaceable

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.820 
to move around you do have a replaceable
insert<00:02:43.280> here<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.300> if<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.720> do<00:02:44.870> go<00:02:45.260> through<00:02:45.500> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
insert here so if you do go through and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.400 
insert here so if you do go through and
chew<00:02:46.040> up<00:02:46.240> your<00:02:47.240> boots<00:02:47.450> fairly<00:02:48.020> regularly

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
chew up your boots fairly regularly

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.780 
chew up your boots fairly regularly
you'll<00:02:48.739> be<00:02:48.830> able<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.040> replace<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.610> inner

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
you'll be able to replace the inner

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.760 
you'll be able to replace the inner
portion<00:02:50.060> there<00:02:50.450> but<00:02:50.900> kind<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.470> different

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
portion there but kind of different

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.960 
portion there but kind of different
because<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.010> wraps<00:02:52.190> all<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.459> way<00:02:52.610> up<00:02:52.730> around

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
because it wraps all the way up around

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.820 
because it wraps all the way up around
the<00:02:53.120> sides<00:02:53.360> wraps<00:02:54.140> all<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.350> way<00:02:54.500> up<00:02:54.590> around

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the sides wraps all the way up around

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.850 
the sides wraps all the way up around
the<00:02:55.010> toe<00:02:55.190> as<00:02:55.400> well<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.780> that's<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.350> kind<00:02:57.739> of

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
the toe as well so that's a kind of

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.210 
the toe as well so that's a kind of
unique<00:02:58.130> most<00:02:58.820> boots<00:02:59.090> don't<00:02:59.560> aren't<00:03:00.560> assembled

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
unique most boots don't aren't assembled

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.000 
unique most boots don't aren't assembled
that<00:03:01.400> way<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:03.140> also<00:03:03.290> have<00:03:03.500> what<00:03:03.739> they<00:03:03.830> call

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
that way you also have what they call

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.850 
that way you also have what they call
their<00:03:04.160> incorporated<00:03:04.910> steel<00:03:05.330> shank<00:03:05.989> there's<00:03:06.770> a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
their incorporated steel shank there's a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.380 
their incorporated steel shank there's a
steel<00:03:07.160> shank<00:03:07.400> right<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.910> center<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.209> the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
steel shank right in the center of the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.699 
steel shank right in the center of the
boot<00:03:08.540> here<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:08.989> if<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.170> come<00:03:09.350> down<00:03:09.530> really

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
boot here so if you come down really

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.100 
boot here so if you come down really
hard<00:03:09.830> or<00:03:10.250> if<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:10.430> wreck<00:03:10.780> that's<00:03:11.780> going<00:03:12.050> to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
hard or if you wreck that's going to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.540 
hard or if you wreck that's going to
prevent<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.470> boot<00:03:12.650> from<00:03:12.890> folding<00:03:13.130> and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
prevent the boot from folding and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.910 
prevent the boot from folding and
hurting<00:03:14.030> your<00:03:14.120> foot<00:03:14.390> it's<00:03:15.140> essentially<00:03:15.890> a

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
hurting your foot it's essentially a

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.340 
hurting your foot it's essentially a
polyurethane<00:03:16.250> shank<00:03:16.970> with<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.239> steel<00:03:17.780> insert

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
polyurethane shank with a steel insert
