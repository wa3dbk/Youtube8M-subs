00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
to be it was a little bit like to the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.780 
to be it was a little bit like to the
side<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.320> then<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.560> wasn't<00:02:46.740> regular<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.640> it

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
side and then it wasn't regular and it

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.480 
side and then it wasn't regular and it
was<00:02:47.880> really<00:02:48.000> low<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:49.070> drinking<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.310> lab

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
was really low and so drinking is in lab

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.940 
was really low and so drinking is in lab
when<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.240> do<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.540> skill<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:52.470> feel<00:02:52.830> like

everybody<00:03:06.270> has<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> typical<00:03:06.720> results<00:03:07.380> and

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
everybody has the typical results and

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.930 
everybody has the typical results and
sometimes<00:03:07.920> their<00:03:08.070> offer<00:03:08.250> under<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.790> then<00:03:08.880> you
