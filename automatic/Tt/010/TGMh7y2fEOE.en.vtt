00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780 

I<00:00:00.179> don't<00:00:00.510> know<00:00:00.630> if<00:00:00.750> you've<00:00:00.900> seen<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.790> new

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
I don't know if you've seen the new

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.160 
I don't know if you've seen the new
rollers<00:00:03.240> that<00:00:03.270> are<00:00:03.510> got<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:04.049> the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
rollers that are got in the

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.280 
rollers that are got in the
modifications<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.130> made<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.730> got<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.390> aluminum

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
modifications I made I got the aluminum

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.250 
modifications I made I got the aluminum
rollers<00:00:07.919> because<00:00:08.220> they<00:00:08.730> run<00:00:09.179> smoother<00:00:09.960> than

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
rollers because they run smoother than

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.230 
rollers because they run smoother than
the<00:00:10.880> plastic<00:00:11.880> rollers<00:00:15.410> also<00:00:16.410> put<00:00:16.710> some<00:00:17.240> wheels

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the plastic rollers also put some wheels

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.450 
the plastic rollers also put some wheels
on<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.050> would<00:00:19.230> float<00:00:19.740> back<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.220> forth

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
on it so it would float back and forth

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.660 
on it so it would float back and forth
like<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.380> emotion<00:00:22.380> rollers<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:23.250> they<00:00:23.400> sell

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
like the emotion rollers that they sell

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.040 
like the emotion rollers that they sell
for<00:00:23.910> $800<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.350> when<00:00:25.560> I'm<00:00:25.680> riding<00:00:26.480> it<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.840> rock

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
for $800 so when I'm riding it can rock

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
for $800 so when I'm riding it can rock
back<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.349> forth<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.490> don't<00:00:29.550> feel<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:29.880> I'm

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
back and forth and I don't feel like I'm

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.569 
back and forth and I don't feel like I'm
going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> jump<00:00:30.689> off<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.050> rollers<00:00:31.439> plus<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.399> got

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
going to jump off the rollers plus I got

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.139 
going to jump off the rollers plus I got
these<00:00:33.590> rollers<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.399> prevent<00:00:35.880> me<00:00:36.120> from

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
these rollers here to prevent me from

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.200 
these rollers here to prevent me from
going<00:00:36.899> off<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.170> sides<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> he's<00:00:38.940> actually

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
going off the sides so he's actually

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.970 
going off the sides so he's actually
spin<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.230> bump<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.620> against<00:00:41.070> him<00:00:42.980> pretty

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
spin when you bump up against him pretty

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.630 
spin when you bump up against him pretty
cool<00:00:44.190> huh

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
cool huh

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.420 
cool huh
I<00:00:45.050> also<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.410> able<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.739> add<00:00:46.950> some<00:00:47.219> resistance

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
I also was able to add some resistance

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.979 
I also was able to add some resistance
to<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.570> rollers<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:50.690> magnet<00:00:51.690> bar

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
to the rollers with this magnet bar

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.709 
to the rollers with this magnet bar
these<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:54.949> some<00:00:55.949> rare<00:00:56.610> earth<00:00:56.850> magnets<00:00:57.510> I

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
these are some rare earth magnets I

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.160 
these are some rare earth magnets I
bought<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> hobby<00:00:59.100> shop<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.750> taped

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
bought at a hobby shop I just taped

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.179 
bought at a hobby shop I just taped
taped<00:01:01.710> them<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.250> piece<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.730> wood<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:04.189> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
taped them to this piece of wood and and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.450 
taped them to this piece of wood and and
then<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.210> them<00:01:06.650> up<00:01:07.650> against<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> roller

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
then you put them up against the roller

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
then you put them up against the roller
are<00:01:08.820> close<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> roller<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
are close to the roller about a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.950 
are close to the roller about a
millimeter<00:01:10.830> from<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.220> roller<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
millimeter from the roller and I have to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
millimeter from the roller and I have to
loosen<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.650> boat<00:01:13.979> over<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
loosen up this boat over here to get to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.179 
loosen up this boat over here to get to
get<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.049> lined<00:01:16.259> up<00:01:16.560> but

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
get it in there and get it lined up but

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.359 
get it in there and get it lined up but
when<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.409> adds<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.890> hell<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
when you do that the it adds a hell of a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.350 
when you do that the it adds a hell of a
lot<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> resistance<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:22.670> lets<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.909> simulate

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
lot of resistance and lets you simulate

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.219 
lot of resistance and lets you simulate
heel<00:01:24.900> climbing<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.530> stuff<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
heel climbing and stuff like that

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.390 
heel climbing and stuff like that
another<00:01:28.229> cool<00:01:28.640> inexpensive<00:01:29.640> modification

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
another cool inexpensive modification

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.420 
another cool inexpensive modification
now<00:01:32.400> here's<00:01:32.820> how<00:01:33.180> easy<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:34.259> spins<00:01:34.650> without<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
now here's how easy it spins without the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:44.590 
now here's how easy it spins without the
magnets<00:01:36.360> installed<00:01:41.329> okay<00:01:42.329> I'll<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.840> again

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
magnets installed okay I'll do it again

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.179 
magnets installed okay I'll do it again
sorry<00:01:45.600> about<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.049> rocking<00:01:46.500> back<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.710> forth

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
sorry about it rocking back and forth

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.660 
sorry about it rocking back and forth
his<00:01:47.460> own<00:01:47.579> rollers<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:50.070> there's<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
his own rollers so now there's about a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.950 
his own rollers so now there's about a
16<00:01:51.470> sixteenth<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.649> an<00:01:52.890> inch<00:01:53.509> between<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
16 sixteenth of an inch between the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.370 
16 sixteenth of an inch between the
magnets<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> rollers<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:57.140> let's<00:01:58.140> see

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
magnets and the rollers and let's see

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.120 
magnets and the rollers and let's see
what<00:01:58.560> effect<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> has

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.400 

okay<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.580> see<00:02:07.760> how<00:02:07.850> quickly<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.270> stopped<00:02:08.630> and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
okay you see how quickly it stopped and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.910 
okay you see how quickly it stopped and
I'm<00:02:09.530> rolling<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.040> as<00:02:10.160> hard<00:02:10.369> as<00:02:10.460> I<00:02:10.610> can<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:14.920> it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
I'm rolling it as hard as I can and it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.150 
I'm rolling it as hard as I can and it
stops<00:02:16.250> pretty<00:02:16.580> much<00:02:16.820> almost<00:02:17.240> immediately

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
stops pretty much almost immediately

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.290 
stops pretty much almost immediately
that's<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.400> added<00:02:19.760> resistance<00:02:22.180> created<00:02:23.180> by

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
that's the added resistance created by

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.410 
that's the added resistance created by
those<00:02:23.450> magnets<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.970> an<00:02:26.120> aluminum

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
those magnets and it's an aluminum

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.910 
those magnets and it's an aluminum
roller<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.410> have<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.010> read<00:02:28.910> up<00:02:29.090> on<00:02:29.300> what<00:02:29.920> is

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
roller so you have to read up on what is

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.050 
roller so you have to read up on what is
it<00:02:31.160> Faraday's<00:02:31.700> law<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:33.190> some<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.430> laws<00:02:34.670> as

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
it Faraday's law and some of the laws as

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.670 
it Faraday's law and some of the laws as
to<00:02:35.480> how<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.810> works<00:02:36.610> but<00:02:37.610> it's<00:02:37.850> pretty<00:02:38.030> cool<00:02:38.270> and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
to how it works but it's pretty cool and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.130 
to how it works but it's pretty cool and
pretty<00:02:39.680> cheap<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:41.090> add<00:02:41.300> resistance<00:02:41.570> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
pretty cheap to add resistance the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.400 
pretty cheap to add resistance the
magnets<00:02:42.560> were<00:02:42.740> about<00:02:43.040> twelve<00:02:43.940> bucks<00:02:44.210> or<00:02:44.540> $15

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
magnets were about twelve bucks or $15
