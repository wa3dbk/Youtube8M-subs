writers<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.420> don't<00:02:12.690> know

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
writers I don't know

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.990 
writers I don't know
because<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.830> can't<00:02:15.190> say<00:02:15.490> that

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:03:06.010

sooner<00:03:08.730> than<00:03:08.879> maybe<00:03:09.090> other<00:03:09.420> musicians<00:03:10.260> that

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
sooner than maybe other musicians that

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.679 
sooner than maybe other musicians that
maybe<00:03:10.799> were<00:03:11.159> better<00:03:11.400> songwriters<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.360> don't

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
maybe were better songwriters I don't

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.079
