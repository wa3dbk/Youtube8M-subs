plunger doohickey that you can fill up

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.320 
plunger doohickey that you can fill up
and<00:00:22.560> squirt<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.070> there<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.490> can't<00:00:23.850> find<00:00:24.090> mine

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and squirt it in there I can't find mine

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.660 
and squirt it in there I can't find mine
so<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.600> took<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.410> top<00:00:25.619> off<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.279> filled<00:00:26.580> it

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
up with a with a little cup so I'm gonna

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.030 
up with a with a little cup so I'm gonna
the<00:00:32.460> last<00:00:32.940> video<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> showed<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.890> using<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the last video I showed you using the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.250 
the last video I showed you using the
vaporized<00:00:35.579> kerosene<00:00:36.300> by<00:00:36.750> opening<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.200> valve

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
vaporized kerosene by opening this valve

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.290 
vaporized kerosene by opening this valve
now<00:00:38.160> we're<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.730> second<00:00:39.120> way

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
now we're going to do this second way

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.860 
now we're going to do this second way
with<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> denatured<00:00:41.070> alcohol<00:00:41.600> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.719> get

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
with the denatured alcohol you can get

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.350 
with the denatured alcohol you can get
the<00:00:42.989> denatured<00:00:43.410> alcohol<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:44.100> any<00:00:45.030> hardware

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the denatured alcohol in any hardware

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.450 
the denatured alcohol in any hardware
store<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.829> gonna<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> plain

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
store so I'm just gonna get a plain

00:00:47.460 --> 00:01:02.250 
store so I'm just gonna get a plain
there<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.320> light<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.500> alcohol

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.390 

now<00:01:03.130> you<00:01:03.250> can<00:01:03.430> see<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.790> that<00:01:03.940> alcohol<00:01:04.600> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
now you can see that that alcohol is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.020 
now you can see that that alcohol is
heating<00:01:06.400> up<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:09.010> gonna<00:01:09.310> heat<00:01:09.520> up<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.790> top

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
heating up it's gonna heat up the top

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:28.340 
heating up it's gonna heat up the top
valve<00:01:10.750> area<00:01:11.260> where<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.310> kerosene<00:01:12.760> comes<00:01:13.119> from

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.930 

and<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.100> we're<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.580> is<00:01:29.760> we're<00:01:29.909> just

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
and what we're going to do is we're just

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.200 
and what we're going to do is we're just
going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> wait<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.200> alcohol<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:33.000> burn

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
going to wait for that alcohol to burn

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:42.130 
going to wait for that alcohol to burn
off

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.360 

and<00:01:42.860> once<00:01:43.730> it's<00:01:43.970> almost<00:01:44.650> burn<00:01:45.650> off<00:01:45.860> completely

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
and once it's almost burn off completely

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.370 
and once it's almost burn off completely
then<00:01:47.300> we'll<00:01:47.450> open<00:01:47.480> the<00:01:47.840> valve<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
then we'll open the valve to the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.130 
then we'll open the valve to the
kerosene<00:01:48.950> heater<00:01:49.190> I<00:01:49.630> keep<00:01:50.630> on<00:01:50.690> saying<00:01:50.900> heater

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
kerosene heater I keep on saying heater

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.160 
kerosene heater I keep on saying heater
I<00:01:51.260> mean<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.470> kerosene<00:01:51.830> lantern<00:01:53.020> should<00:01:54.020> be

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
I mean the kerosene lantern should be

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.560 
I mean the kerosene lantern should be
hot<00:01:54.350> enough<00:01:54.620> to<00:01:54.680> turn<00:01:55.460> on<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.940> activate<00:01:58.570> the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
hot enough to turn on and activate the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.290 
hot enough to turn on and activate the
idea<00:01:59.840> is<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.080> get<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.830> kerosene<00:02:01.550> in<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.120> line

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
idea is to get that kerosene in the line

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:29.860 
idea is to get that kerosene in the line
heat<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.840> up<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.620> it<00:02:03.770> burns<00:02:03.950> nice<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.580> clean

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.540 

okay<00:02:30.680> I'm<00:02:30.739> gonna<00:02:30.860> go<00:02:31.010> ahead<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.310> open<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
okay I'm gonna go ahead and open the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.250 
okay I'm gonna go ahead and open the
valve<00:02:31.580> now<00:02:32.060> hopefully<00:02:32.599> it's<00:02:32.900> heated<00:02:33.140> up

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
valve now hopefully it's heated up

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.910 
valve now hopefully it's heated up
enough<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.709> where<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.920> will<00:02:33.980> turn<00:02:34.220> on<00:02:34.370> nice

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.570 

there<00:02:43.550> we<00:02:43.670> go

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.550 

compared<00:02:50.240> to<00:02:50.270> my<00:02:50.420> last<00:02:50.450> video<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.110> didn't<00:02:51.470> have

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
compared to my last video I didn't have

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.330 
compared to my last video I didn't have
all<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.860> flames<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.640> smoke<00:02:53.090> because<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:54.340> let

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
all the flames and smoke because I let

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.270 
all the flames and smoke because I let
it<00:02:55.460> heat<00:02:55.580> up<00:02:55.640> enough<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.120> time<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:57.280> that's

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
it heat up enough this time so that's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.710 
it heat up enough this time so that's
how<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:58.520> light<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.790> using<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.330> denatured

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
how you light it using the denatured

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.840 
how you light it using the denatured
alcohol
