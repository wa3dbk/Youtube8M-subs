00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.339
 I like that this is there were also all provinces 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.690
 I do not use it, but what kind of thing 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.640
 At the same time, it doubles as a review 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.640
 I think I will do it 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.130
 Something recently 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.570
 It has become a habit for the video 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.570
 There is a habit of taking a video 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.360
 Because I'm stuck 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.590
 Tei by saying yes 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.190
 Spock 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.370
 Large magnet type 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.560
 eh 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.809
 Pom 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.579
 Ne 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.780
 With such a deck case 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.780
 I have a formula 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:02.200
 Hm 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:04.949
 There is no child of each entry column that Aai dinner has a paku name 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.970
 Connection name and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.630
 This game Di's sure for the love of this unofficial tournament 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.630
 It is two 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.509
 It will be fine even if it contains nim 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.740
 This size will be rated 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.740
 I will receive 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.540
 I can not be a member 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.079
 Ah 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.610
 It is up to 12 breathing 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.970
 eh 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.670
 92 since become a little tough was Ayatsu 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.840
 Oh 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.840
 When I would put or the kana 192 double to 90 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.049
 It is stinking not enter 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.860
 Nameko now 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.130
 It is tough if you care about this 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.130
 Snack 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.400
 Per guy hard looks bad 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.709
 Already 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.709
 Agreement 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.190
 It's about here- 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.849
 That's why line size sleeves for snacks 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.140
 Not one time 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.620
 Only 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:58.069
 A little big moon 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.069
 I think if you suddenly enter the following 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.470
 It's good to get rid of it 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.470
 I think I can buy a ticket but I like it 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.770
 I can not handle the formula vertically 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.980
 It is use 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.129
 It struck to hear 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.600
 May I use this space 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.320
 Hmm 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.790
 Four days 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.989
 I'm sharing the design, but it's easy to use 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.989
 Subtle kana 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.480
 Well, say something limited 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.099
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.099
 It looks a little like yp 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.920
 Yes it is more than
