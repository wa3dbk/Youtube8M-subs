00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.250
 hello in this little video let's see how sir martin 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.830
 after a ride downtown on his 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.419
 al-attiyah 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:09.919
 midday 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.929
 gets to put it in the trunk of his citroën saxo 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:17.399
 so you see yourself walking around to avoid what 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.380
 erick is now approaching his car 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.899
 are wandered ap 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.050
 simply by arresting shareholders then he rotates 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.410
 his seat 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 the main thing facing the little maëlle ricker on the left side 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.600
 he does not remove the battery 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.050
 the cotter team 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.180
 so you noticed no tool no hookup 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.560
 it is true that the first 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 very easily 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.130
 the North 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.230
 it secures the front wheels 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.230
 to be able to transport it without difficulty 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.460
 he unscrews the wheel to be able to strike is 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.250
 the Titan 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.200
 serves the wheel so could be used as a wrist tool 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.070
 and now 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.369
 and that's one of the peculiarities of the useless theater palace 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.030
 he manages to detect laughter at the prayer of the Palestinians 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.370
 it was the revelations get a unique patent 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.930
 then thanks to the handle at the front of the walk afp 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.070
 he raises 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.550
 the front of the body of the palatinate 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.550
 and just puts it in the trunk of his car 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 he makes sure he is in place 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.710
 then 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.900
 and a drifting low 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 the rear wheels and the engine 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.890
 and he does place 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.560
 the couple 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.109
 in the trunk 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:11.109
 at the back of the body of the not the TV 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:15.249
 then 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.089
 thanks to the handle 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.089
 and the father relocate the motherland 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.989
 in fact he had pulled out so that the front of the body is as light as possible 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.740
 for the era 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.740
 but even offering them inside 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.829
 we do not see here 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.829
 the battery no longer has a risk of clogging 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.409
 So here is still room in the trunk 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.039
 but Mr. Martin takes the basket 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.459
 the post has so long still as you see there 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.379
 the place to be eventually races 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.379
 mourinho other things 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.539
 then the seat will be placed 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.079
 the car eventually he could have put himself in the backseat 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:16.909
 may 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.700
 possible to do here that sir martin 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.179
 and secure it 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.179
 with the seatbelt 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.239
 the mythical team entirely 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.319
 the car of monsieur martel
