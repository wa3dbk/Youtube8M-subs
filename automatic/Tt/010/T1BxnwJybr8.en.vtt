00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:15.030
 This is unprecedented and personal. 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.390
 sure that if today's squad 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.330
 proudly presents smooth breaker 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.439
 revealed is before talking about the inciting gap 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.109
 Let me tell you something is the function 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.820
 production for track stage brasilia fame 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.429
 Thank you, you have to read is to know who 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.900
 It is seriously expensive and you will enjoy not too 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.360
 It matters to me if I speak from 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 now the law is simply read good 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.350
 basic information this phase she 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.989
 started to be published in 2001 in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.730
 magazine of the demolisher and lasted until 2006 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 she written by brian michael bendis 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.190
 this nice chubby and 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.960
 Bulgarian alex mali I will see you in the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 comic with this system if the legal is that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.940
 even being year long is lasted years 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.829
 holanda band on the lovely breaker 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.800
 managed to keep the same creative team 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.690
 by various issues the 61 team forms 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.789
 creative 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530
 so they complete perfectly 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.030
 while he was ahead of the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 meter title 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.020
 the magazine not several awards to him that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.750
 I competed for so many others better 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.670
 best series writer improve kuhn and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.830
 you should also know that this is one of the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.659
 the character's most acclaimed 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 all the times so together when frank 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.590
 miller if you are a fan or what you know of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.090
 engine is one of the phases that have to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 read knows how good this chained that I 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.840
 I have here in the hands of the bound 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.150
 American but he's good the crash will 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.130
 practically based on it the difference 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.829
 that the chained looks da panini will 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 have fewer e -extras compared to that 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.350
 compiles from issues 16 and says until 19 and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 26-40 American magazine 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 demolisher while the panini is going to be going 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.979
 have only 26 to 40 in case they will 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.110
 cut the first bow of good says at least 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.090
 demolisher is a file called the screen and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.189
 This is a negative point so it is one of the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.659
 My favorite stories 2002 all 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.579
 It's very cool times. 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.680
 she is drawn by the mac is a 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.840
 incredible artist I do not know if he 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.710
 won if it competed online for these 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.810
 issues 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.610
 It's okay that it's not an arch that does 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.399
 difference in the next stories 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.410
 after they knew it is not mentioned in the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.910
 stories that follow but I 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.490
 I think it's the phase of good that says 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.920
 public face everything knows there from extra a 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.600
 panini edition only has a gallery of 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.700
 cover is has nothing too do not have 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.920
 scripts a sketch or anything of them now 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.290
 Let's talk about history itself and yes 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.990
 bound my friends have two bows 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.090
 so they are amazing was amazing 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.950
 and do not have additives for 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.870
 expressing the good says what is the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.910
 writer he was at high level the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.400
 first of them is the forest andrÃ© is 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.770
 2001 showing the king of crime suffering 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.660
 an assassination attempt and it is very 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.280
 cool having a reference saal julius 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.950
 the way he died and at the same time 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.500
 time mac says he 's being hunted 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.940
 by various bounty hunters and 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.260
 you have no idea what it is 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.940
 happening he keeps asking himself 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.740
 during the story is because someone 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.630
 would keep the meth that is alright the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.760
 faces get tired of rodent but because 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.290
 why his civil identity and he's going to 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.850
 behind the king of crime is because the king of 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.070
 exposed crime does not know he has the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.540
 knowledge of who is the demolisher this 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.060
 since the fall of demand from here frank 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.130
 miller already the second bow the alt that 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.870
 would be revealed is that the incarnate title 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.910
 of the worksheet is one of the most 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.750
 important of the character of the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.310
 years 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.900
 the studio beyond the monitor some time 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.330
 know that in the marvel universe 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.100
 his identity is public people 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.700
 know who the demolisher is and this 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.800
 happened here my friends and the way 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.620
 incredible repercussions this promises 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.959
 move is too much because thinking and 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.970
 leaked is the identity of the super hero is 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.910
 It's okay, now people will find 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.370
 he is wonderful, legally not good 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.980
 home saved me that day and not the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.410
 mate he starts to turn his face is because 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.330
 it's very down to earth the journalists know 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.209
 go after him begins to chase bomb 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.390
 or the paparazzi his life becomes a 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.280
 Chaos is simply chaos and the gang is the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.989
 kiss here he was on a high level 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.670
 so she in the United States in 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.220
 The comics industry he is known for 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.350
 how the cry mingas knows the guy who 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.450
 writes stories about the underworld of 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.430
 crime and here he hits a lot in 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.170
 dialogues between criminals or even 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.180
 between the police is also very much 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.920
 which is very credible and other 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.320
 stories they are very down to earth 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.060
 It's also me I'm enjoying the series the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.100
 Horto team will last this, you know. 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.330
 he seeks to follow the same line of 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.340
 reasoning that frank miller and 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.940
 has established know-how from 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.160
 urban 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.960
 but anyway it does not have so many colorful villains 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.700
 abel is the demolisher dealing more with 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.680
 crime has already left 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.530
 about the art of a free and can 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.630
 express all anguish of the character 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.640
 because the things the doctor 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.140
 happens to change the life of the guy he 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.360
 ends up getting a new love here in 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.630
 story everything that ends up happening 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.020
 with him it is all very well expressed by the 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.650
 art know everything looks the picture and can 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.420
 realizing the distress of the demolisher is 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.130
 impeccable and to conclude I think 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.360
 hit there is that point he is 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.700
 convinced that it is a picture on Sunday 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.500
 it's worth a pound it's not 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.360
 a convict who has so many pre 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.890
 requirements you can read and 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.020
 to understand everything has the least knowledge 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.210
 character will not understand but it would 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.280
 cool tour the fall so that it has 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.960
 certain things that are taken back here 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.880
 It would be nice if you had this reading. 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.500
 prior but nothing that will change your 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.240
 experience has nothing too much 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.400
 anyway it was not that very cool power 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.140
 get here on the channel tell you 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.720
 one thing I like so much I know 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:31.150
 host more secure and complete it is 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.250
 ending another 12 comic books 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.990
 the last programs here of the channel that a 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.060
 video dp fields with comics 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.710
 June the video about the ant man where 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.690
 I do not comment in practice is a warming 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.620
 for the marvel film is coming in 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.850
 brief in theaters 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.530
 I think the result was pretty cool. 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.260
 of the watch to watch and also a trailer 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.360
 Batman commented on the 1st verse that what 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.400
 me and carol I comment on our 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.880
 small theories humble choices 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.880
 she is
