00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.530
 hello to all playstation friends 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.610
 I am marc marquez hello I am alimarket and I 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.449
 I want to send one of all the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.449
 friends of the station 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.950
 erase the frogs the truth is that at 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.650
 principle especially since I remember in 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.140
 2008 also that the first engine came out 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.310
 my first year in the world and good 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.830
 so he played a lot and the truth is that 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.990
 It would be weird but not good but now 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.390
 Well, because you get used to it but 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.100
 still a lot of pretty good time I 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.940
 the first time I go out in a 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.509
 video game and good always because 77 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.890
 special they always catch me I'm lame 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.300
 myself always whenever I can 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.300
 It is very special 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.130
 it was the ps1 so it was the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.470
 playstation and I do not remember the years 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.560
 I had but I do remember 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:01.110
 Well, you played alcohol in my 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.370
 brain to soccer but yes that the ps1 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.370
 have already entered our house 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.800
 if I always take her on a trip 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.420
 also and well we do not travel always 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.040
 together to the circuits so no 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.930
 we can picket but but always 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.270
 that we arrived at a circuit that time 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.700
 you have done and if a little we are always 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.590
 well but but good the truth is that with 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.050
 the ps vita trips are made more 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.720
 entertaining they get better all the 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.840
 hours that you are you are between airplane plane 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.880
 not waiting for the plane so it's another 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.440
 way to spend good time to me as 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.970
 console what I like the most is that you 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.100
 you can carry everywhere you do not go 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.190
 to the pool to spend the beach you go to 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.890
 the airports and you can always 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.590
 carry does not occupy little and apart as it has 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.530
 greatly improved the screen is great 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.040
 it's tactile has good graphics so 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.590
 It is very entertaining and I tell you what 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.730
 more what stands out badly is that you can 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.730
 play everywhere 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.230
 not for now we have played between 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.650
 we know they were organizing something 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.560
 what they wanted to do between pilots 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.440
 hang the times or play then for 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.959
 internet or something but but hey it would be 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.090
 interesting not also to see to see who 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.200
 must have more hours on the beach to see 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.200
 who trains less too 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.500
 Well sure it will be a bit of a 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.920
 revolution whenever a place comes out 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.990
 new then you block to buy right away 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.810
 so I'm really looking forward to that 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.370
 come out and be able to taste it I do not know with 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.680
 what else will surprise us not because every 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.840
 they do more things, so I 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.030
 they will surely surprise us but 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.469
 yes it will be interesting to see also that 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.019
 It evolved is tremendous 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.510
 good friends, hello and see you 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.750
 playing in ps3 and I started seeing 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.750
 motogp
