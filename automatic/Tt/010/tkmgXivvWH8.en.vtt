00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
playing card kind of knock off with the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.200 
playing card kind of knock off with the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
version and then the negative version of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.459 
version and then the negative version of
the<00:00:32.700> robot<00:00:33.480> there<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.960> was<00:00:34.110> probably<00:00:34.200> my

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
the robot there this was probably my

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.370 
the robot there this was probably my
favorite<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.010> print<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.809> we<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:36.989> got<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> ton

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
favorite to print and we just got a ton

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.840 
favorite to print and we just got a ton
of<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.860> I'm<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> go<00:00:38.670> through

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
of here so I'm not going to go through

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.119 
of here so I'm not going to go through
exact<00:00:39.210> quantities<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:39.989> uh<00:00:40.050> there's<00:00:40.950> like

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
exact quantities but uh there's like

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.860 
exact quantities but uh there's like
just<00:00:41.340> two<00:00:41.520> sets<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.940> there<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.600> some

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
just two sets in there just some

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.400 
just two sets in there just some
standard<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.210> guess<00:00:45.210> shadowed<00:00:45.899> love<00:00:46.140> bots

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
standard just I guess shadowed love bots

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.819 
standard just I guess shadowed love bots
on<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:47.340> two<00:00:48.090> stacks<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.510> those<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.840> well<00:00:48.989> cut

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
on here two stacks of those as well cut

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.209 
on here two stacks of those as well cut
down<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.460> each<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.680> individual<00:00:52.680> then

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
down so each of them is individual then

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.700 
down so each of them is individual then
we've<00:00:53.340> got<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.820> heart<00:00:54.360> design<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
we've got the heart design in a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.439 
we've got the heart design in a
basically<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> negative<00:00:57.120> version

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
basically like a negative version

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.930 
basically like a negative version
there's<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.899> positive<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.440> later<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.800> well<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
there's a positive one later as well the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.680 
there's a positive one later as well the
three<00:01:00.180> loves<00:01:00.949> there<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.359> negative

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
three loves there then the negative

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.590 
three loves there then the negative
version<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.820> then<00:01:05.820> here's<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
version of that and then here's that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.320 
version of that and then here's that
heart<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:07.049> talking<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.820> just<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.180> red

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
heart I was talking about just the red

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.000 
heart I was talking about just the red
heart<00:01:09.540> there<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> had<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> lot<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> fun

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
heart there and then I had a lot of fun

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.340 
heart there and then I had a lot of fun
printing<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.490> two<00:01:11.700> colors<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> did<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
printing these two colors so I did the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
printing these two colors so I did the
red<00:01:13.500> first<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> did<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> black<00:01:14.640> overlay

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
red first and then I did a black overlay

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
red first and then I did a black overlay
so<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.500> got<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> red<00:01:16.890> heart<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
so you just got the red heart in the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.730 
so you just got the red heart in the
circle<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.939> then<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> black<00:01:19.080> border<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
circle and then the black border and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
circle and then the black border and
then<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.580> love<00:01:21.390> switches<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> red<00:01:24.270> on

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
then the love switches to be the red on

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.969 
then the love switches to be the red on
this<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:24.900> opposed<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> where<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.619> black<00:01:25.830> on

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this one opposed to where it's black on

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.219 
this one opposed to where it's black on
here<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> huge<00:01:27.210> order<00:01:27.450> from<00:01:27.570> love<00:01:27.780> bot<00:01:27.990> can't

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
here so a huge order from love bot can't

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
here so a huge order from love bot can't
thank<00:01:28.409> him<00:01:28.470> enough<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> those<00:01:30.090> will

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
thank him enough for that and those will

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.300 
thank him enough for that and those will
be<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.750> him<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> rest

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.609 
be going out to him and on to the rest
of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> print<00:01:32.729> update<00:01:33.320> next<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.439> we've<00:01:34.590> got

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
of the print update next up we've got

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.280 
of the print update next up we've got
300<00:01:35.220> 4<00:01:35.400> by<00:01:35.549> 4<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.150> actually<00:01:36.299> also<00:01:36.780> vectored

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
300 4 by 4 and I actually also vectored

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.289 
300 4 by 4 and I actually also vectored
this<00:01:37.439> design<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:38.040> made<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> nice<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> clean

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
this design up made it nice and clean
