this<00:00:09.870> magic<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> very<00:00:10.679> deliberate<00:00:11.219> process

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
this magic is a very deliberate process

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.610 
this magic is a very deliberate process
it's<00:00:12.059> something<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.630> requires<00:00:12.990> focus<00:00:13.230> and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
it's something that requires focus and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.250 
it's something that requires focus and
attention<00:00:13.710> however<00:00:14.580> there's<00:00:14.940> one<00:00:15.000> aspect<00:00:15.389> one

small detail concerning this in the show
that<00:00:18.660> confuses<00:00:19.230> me<00:00:19.380> how<00:00:19.890> does<00:00:20.130> takes

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
that confuses me how does takes

that confuses me how does takes
propeller<00:00:20.820> work<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.359> seems<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.930> run<00:00:22.109> off<00:00:22.260> magic

this

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.979 

first<00:00:36.760> let's<00:00:37.120> see<00:00:37.300> what<00:00:37.450> we<00:00:37.540> can<00:00:37.720> figure<00:00:37.870> out

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
first let's see what we can figure out

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.540 
first let's see what we can figure out
using<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.530> color<00:00:38.739> of<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.010> match<00:00:39.160> will<00:00:39.400> glow

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
using the color of the match will glow

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.250 
using the color of the match will glow
yellow<00:00:39.940> is<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.270> color<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.660> snails<00:00:40.989> match

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
yellow is the color of snails match

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.470 
yellow is the color of snails match
karora<00:00:41.710> but<00:00:42.070> I<00:00:42.100> think<00:00:42.460> you'll<00:00:42.640> agree<00:00:42.730> he's<00:00:43.210> not

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
karora but I think you'll agree he's not

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.420 
karora but I think you'll agree he's not
likely<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:44.020> be<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.320> source<00:00:44.590> instead<00:00:45.220> let's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
likely to be the source instead let's

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.799 
likely to be the source instead let's
look<00:00:45.610> at<00:00:45.700> another<00:00:45.970> much<00:00:46.270> more<00:00:46.300> plausible

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
look at another much more plausible

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.590 
look at another much more plausible
candidate<00:00:47.559> Princess<00:00:48.190> Celestia<00:00:48.730> yes<00:00:49.300> the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
candidate Princess Celestia yes the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.390 
candidate Princess Celestia yes the
colours<00:00:49.989> match<00:00:50.290> but<00:00:50.590> we<00:00:50.710> still<00:00:51.010> have<00:00:51.220> that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
colours match but we still have that

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.160 
colours match but we still have that
initial<00:00:51.610> problem<00:00:52.210> we've<00:00:52.449> never<00:00:52.690> seen<00:00:52.930> magic

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
initial problem we've never seen magic

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.680 
initial problem we've never seen magic
used<00:00:53.530> quite<00:00:53.949> like<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.730> spell<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.449> can<00:00:55.570> be

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
used quite like this a spell that can be

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.689 
used quite like this a spell that can be
used<00:00:55.930> constantly<00:00:56.350> even<00:00:57.070> when<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.309> horn<00:00:57.550> of

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
used constantly even when the horn of

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.700 
used constantly even when the horn of
the<00:00:57.730> pony<00:00:58.000> casting<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.570> spell<00:00:58.660> isn't<00:00:59.050> lit<00:00:59.440> if

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
the pony casting the spell isn't lit if

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.410 
the pony casting the spell isn't lit if
anyone<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.250> capable<00:01:00.400> of<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.820> spell<00:01:01.059> like<00:01:01.210> this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
anyone is capable of a spell like this

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.780 
anyone is capable of a spell like this
it<00:01:01.629> would<00:01:01.780> be<00:01:01.809> Celestia<00:01:02.530> but<00:01:02.920> still<00:01:03.400> it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
it would be Celestia but still it

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.760 
it would be Celestia but still it
doesn't<00:01:04.089> seem<00:01:04.420> right<00:01:04.629> looking<00:01:05.259> at<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.470> actual

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
doesn't seem right looking at the actual

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.560 
doesn't seem right looking at the actual
mechanism<00:01:06.310> of<00:01:06.430> tanks<00:01:06.700> helicopter<00:01:07.240> thing<00:01:07.420> it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
mechanism of tanks helicopter thing it

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.790 
mechanism of tanks helicopter thing it
doesn't<00:01:08.020> look<00:01:08.110> like<00:01:08.229> it's<00:01:08.380> anything<00:01:08.649> more

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
doesn't look like it's anything more

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.530 
doesn't look like it's anything more
than<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.190> fancy<00:01:09.460> axle<00:01:09.970> with<00:01:10.119> a<00:01:10.149> spinning

than a fancy axle with a spinning

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.270 
than a fancy axle with a spinning
propeller<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:11.229> magic<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.710> probably<00:01:12.040> just

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
propeller the magic is probably just

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.530 
propeller the magic is probably just
responsible<00:01:12.729> for<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.060> circular<00:01:13.479> motion

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
responsible for the circular motion

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.810 
responsible for the circular motion
which<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.320> pretty<00:01:14.560> simple<00:01:14.860> because<00:01:15.250> spinning

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
which is pretty simple because spinning

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.950 
which is pretty simple because spinning
over<00:01:15.940> and<00:01:16.149> over<00:01:16.330> again<00:01:16.509> isn't<00:01:16.780> that

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
over and over again isn't that

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.930 
over and over again isn't that
complicated<00:01:17.410> perhaps<00:01:17.890> it's<00:01:18.190> possible<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.789> put

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
complicated perhaps it's possible to put

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.340 
complicated perhaps it's possible to put
that<00:01:19.119> magic<00:01:19.570> on<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:19.780> loop

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
that magic on a loop

if replaying the same spell as possible

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.550 
if replaying the same spell as possible
then<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.479> spout<00:01:22.810> would<00:01:22.960> have<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.170> be<00:01:23.289> cast

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
then the spout would have to be cast

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.560 
then the spout would have to be cast
just<00:01:23.890> once<00:01:24.250> until<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.759> either<00:01:24.850> runs<00:01:25.210> out<00:01:25.420> or

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
just once until it either runs out or

gets put out now there's another

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.770 
gets put out now there's another
possibility<00:01:27.729> that<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.060> think<00:01:28.300> is<00:01:28.420> actually

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
possibility that I think is actually

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.450 
possibility that I think is actually
better<00:01:28.990> than<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.259> whole<00:01:29.470> magic<00:01:29.770> loop<00:01:30.160> thingy

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
better than the whole magic loop thingy

better than the whole magic loop thingy
