00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.030
 my hummer hello everyone with you jagernaut 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.070
 in this video I want to tell 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.540
 effective use of hover tank 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.029
 drove with this orton rode and it will be hard 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.400
 Well, the appeal to the normal version is not so 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 crossed but about in him I noticed 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.769
 plus and even advantage over conventional 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.019
 tanks, the first advantage can be noted 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.359
 crap everywhere like hover so not 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.329
 rides and soars on the ground he can calmly 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.450
 climbing on high ground practically 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.829
 without loss of speed you can even climb 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.290
 on almost responsible bias second 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.149
 plus is maneuverability cover tank 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 can move in all 3 160 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.379
 directions if normal tank boundaries 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 moving forward backward 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.289
 the power tank can drive sideways all 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.109
 he himself is capable of performing straight these 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.570
 chalk can compare infantry if you want 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.079
 quicker helps let's say so dodge 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.539
 from bullets 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.330
 the higher tank it helps to dodge 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:11.100
 shells if you really want something you can 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.650
 dodge compared ptr and also have 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.990
 and minus for example the vision of the highest 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.759
 only five speeds wrong hour 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.780
 pretty slow even compared 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.299
 from Abrams 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.820
 but a significant drawback Hammer tank 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 is a mouse control 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.869
 is it possible on the gamepad or on the joystick 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.090
 it doesnâ€™t have one 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.000
 mouse acceleration think everyone knows what it is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.579
 this of course makes it possible to drastically 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 turn towards the enemy but if 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.470
 try to build infantry especially 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.970
 running or long range 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.970
 shooting becomes spain home 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.150
 hover tank has several features 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.830
 he has no tower by that 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.020
 the whole machine turns I see in this 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.120
 one more plus since when confronted with 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.300
 enemy technique or engineer forehead in 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.610
 forehead 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.280
 you will always supply weak rays 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.400
 machine goal itself getting on smaller 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.990
 damage 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.040
 I think now many players know the focus 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.680
 since bf3 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.600
 after rice posted a video about 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.450
 how can you blow a tank in the forehead with 2 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.090
 hits and decided to try doing 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.310
 this shame tank thanks to my friend 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.640
 Denis for helping to test 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.830
 The trick of this focus is that 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.150
 the projectile flies through the turret of the tank and 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.670
 falls does not touch the back of the box 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.020
 green fixes it and tells sk to you 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.060
 caused damage to the engine 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.100
 maybe you can't capture this 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.420
 moment since my friend see what 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.300
 projectile flies higher 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.190
 I want to draw attention to one fact he 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.570
 sees that the projectile flies through the tower 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.680
 that is, getting into the tower itself is not 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.780
 going to the hover trials tonka 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.140
 it turned out that with a cut tank is not 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.030
 roll a direct collision condition 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.580
 when he sits down player tank gets 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.760
 rises 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.810
 because of this, the hit is not recorded 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.180
 the only way to get poop 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.930
 tank to that way it be at least 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.930
 just above him 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:20.360
 but I watched you get a crucian she 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.580
 flew over it from the body a little bit 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.650
 hit the back of the bark 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.380
 which tank people night play pretty 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.910
 hard but if you have a friend with communication 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.120
 you can keep pretty good 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.340
 opponents of constant voltage up to 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.710
 simplify your life outwardly chose yourself 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.110
 a main assembly of the shell I 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.420
 There is no additional caliber 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.420
 machine guns as for the infantry to get 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.530
 very hard therefore it is better to take myself 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.950
 I hope all the rockets 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.560
 world map is worth actively protection module 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.050
 their active armor and magnifying 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.940
 the optics of the arrow must be labeled with 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.200
 flama 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.230
 target missile damage 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.950
 shoots increase 10 units by 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.470
 aviation 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.260
 they are very common or just not 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.360
 register or are they so slow 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.880
 so you can just scare 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.260
 such an assembly is effective against technology and 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.830
 designed to fight for big 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.410
 distances 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.090
 Well, you can come up with all sorts of charges 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.959
 relying on the pros of a tank cover 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.600
 for example put explosive shells 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.510
 spin the usual tank or btr kept in 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.990
 sight and deliver frontal part for 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:35.550
 his back shot back but it's already clear 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.190
 what consequences can be put 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.750
 armor-piercing and ride on infantry but 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.610
 You can be caught in the crossfire and 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.680
 vpg after hover tank lead to 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.180
 critical condition he cannot 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.160
 turn summarize 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.860
 hu and tank as I said heavy 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.900
 appeal but if you have a friend 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.360
 bend well for besides 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.530
 get a lot of fun and indeed you 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.449
 nobody forbids to engage 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.449
 vandalism and turn over btr and 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.760
 come on 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.590
 come on 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.110
 thank you all for watching rate 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.030
 video write comments and 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.030
