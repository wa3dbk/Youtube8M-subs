 Among other things, he has a josef mock 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.860
 up presented here that the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.570
 The basic idea was that a few google 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.090
 Employees of their character fans of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.739

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.480
 oculus wanted to make a hit yes 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.579
 Like glass, this project also has 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.879
 a simple but 100% fitting 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.530
 name carport to german the cardboard glasses 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.789
 you can order online soon gets 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.010
 He then the corresponding lenses and 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.660
 is ready to package himself falling in it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.430
 then simply secure with ted 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 You 're missing that lock now 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.490
 then you can pack a smartphone 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.380
 there is also already in the app in 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.080
 the one as well as the rift one 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.570
 test flight a trip through Paris or 360 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.979
 degree take photos directly into the retina 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.320
 Can you make such a template too 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.000
 print yourself that is then without 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.710
 But lenses still somehow ne 'horny 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.250
 Idea something like that just publicly 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 do 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.700
 Pictures are then unfortunately one 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.770
 a little blurred but not even 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 shit and also developer can 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.040
 Free kids from the side 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.290
 draw and own applications and games 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.270
 Design a thing for everyone 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.710
 fall and then there are so cheap 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.240
 definitely in any case 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.280
 how do you find the idea and become her 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.750

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.920

 the enjoyment of mainstream film but 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.750
 also gets pearls and trash to see 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.000
 even you might not come across it 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.680
 such as blue in a movie 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.270
 worldwide a driver of the skin 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.860
 lives in his rusty car and 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.450
 no goal in sight has until the murderer 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.720
 his parents from the prison 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.910
 is dismissed and a vendetta 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.680
 starts or at four teams in the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.870
 it is a highly indebted one 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.400
 the possibility has its debts 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.620
 get rid of when the 13 brutal and 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.120
 bloody tasks are solved or even campbell 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.350
 in which a reckless and not 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.760
 Schneider had to owe people 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.090
 eats and blame göbel over him 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.100
 So get to know a woman 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.820
 or wolf corp the name betrays everything 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.770
 just a werewolf and so policeman 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.300

 with the roxy meter 2014 we have the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.770
 probably realistic the insight into the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.540
 life of a stone before the three 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.240

 full rock experience in more than 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.270
 five different levels whether on 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.730
 a glade clearing one 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.860
 romantic beach or one 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.280
 dried river bed of this game 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.900
 dives deep into the world of the device 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.480
 Man gets his stone in shape and color 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.530
 can also personalize the 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.490
 surface structure can be customized 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.980
 evaluate 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.350
 yes and through integrated kilo meets 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.090
 Support will be even stronger in 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.860
 torn this exciting game 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.210
 that with its incredibly high 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.000
 Reality probably a 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.270
 putting milestone in the gaming scene 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.340
 becomes 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.890
 the game now has its complete in 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.990

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.930
 also appear steam 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.330
 if you're worried about them 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.220
 maybe not enough in the 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.150
 The game will be a free 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.390
 So you do not have to play titles 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.470
 be rocky to play it anyway 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.320
 Captain your best blockplayer too 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.640
 the curb and this game in the 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.640
 comments interested us 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.830
 why do people enter around 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.060
 watching others at play dota 2 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.949
 no idea 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.570
 That's a question you often ask now 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.400
 had to read when it comes to the following story 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.949
 went on the weekend was namely there has 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.389
 branches clique in the context of esl when in 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.460
 The Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.910
 announced there dueled eight 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.220
 teams live before about 12.500 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.080
 spectators entering ranged from 20 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.600
 and 180 open and the teams could 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.850
 more than 200,000 euros in prize money 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.740
 win that is already blatant or 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.660
 the people's media were scratching now 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.400
 heads and wonder how that is 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.350
 Many people can go to the stadium 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.030
 while in the same breath by the way 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.500
 she will already be reporting about the wm 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.780
 because differences are in the process of being straight 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.970
 dota and other at &amp; s games absolutely 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.160
 perfect for such events such games 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.550
 are action-packed it is constant what 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.990
 going on and the community is huge for 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.780
 for example, just such games 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.000
 to watch a veritable mee and 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.039
 in korea so in the southern part 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.740
 Incidentally, e sports are almost already 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.449
 In addition to that, there is still plenty of popular sports 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.039
 just like a football game commented 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.840
 will and the basic rules 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.530
 as understandable as the leather 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.300
 are loaded 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.130
 There are 2 and 3 you can do as well 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.870
 play for free and yourself 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.130
 single to throw directly into the fight 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.570
 You can buy your own if you like 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.240
 But you do not want that 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.889
 However, you probably will get a flyer 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.910
 Never on the quality of the teams 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.139
 come this weekend 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.539
 competed against each other 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.400
 because so easy are the basic rules 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.800
 its like the perfect timing 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.419
 proper skills and other aspects must 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.940
 you train yourself properly Hartan 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.039

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.229
 already crass in an exciting finale 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.690

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.660

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.650
 So my next is not sport 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.240
 event but that is a normal one 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.849
 football event that's the same now 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.630
