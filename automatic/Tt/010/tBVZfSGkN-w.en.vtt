00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.639
 well it's him everyone today 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.420
 we find ourselves in a new video 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.269
 on farming simulator 2015 for a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 trick how well started and good 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 easily put a lot of money into 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.300
 the pocket on farming simulator 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.070
 then for those you must already be born 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.340
 in the farming simulator career and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 puts in easy mode and take anything 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.720
 which maps but I advise you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.570
 diary that's because are you okay 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.670
 here it is I prefer this map so 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.550
 you there you expect the launch that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.620
 all his load 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.670
 so here's once this does you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 start the world 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 so that's going to put you as what 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.070
 you can visit you do have 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.110
 alas from the very beginning you and made arrow 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.390
 from right or left for ashore in 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.770
 this tractor that is right next to 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 market for their donations to withdraw from 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.670
 money 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.250
 so go do it after so here's hop 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.689
 and there you borrow and so carey you 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.360
 to spend the maximum 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.040
 so I say 200 miles after that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 you will see you can repay them 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.750
 has suffered once this is done 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.580
 pili if you teleport into the tractor 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.040
 there and then there you go in the market 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.470
 you go into objects to place and you 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.570
 take the hives so that's why 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.220
 hives rocking i'm going to show you 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.540
 that right away so wanted to place 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.049
 any place I place them 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.170
 here that's because the hives gives 60 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.430
 per hour so here we go we will buy 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.080
 still about 8 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.259
 so what will give us anyway 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.580
 a lot of money and maintenance that 8 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.800
 euros the day 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.380
 so it's pretty good so go 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.380
 it's gone we buy the maximum 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:15.750
 so here we have bought full 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.730
 so in all 2 4 including 4 2 4 6 8 sees 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.970
 so the hives that produce 60 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.690
 euros per hour is so where you have 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.490
 you do 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.390
 option you go in the settings 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.830
 you put time lapse x 120 is so 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.480
 there the day will pass faster and 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.390
 so because it brings you 60 by 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.350
 hour so x 8 so look up at 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.240
 right here is more 480 euros 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.130
 so frankly to start it's 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.410
 super good so afterwards you 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.650
 can you pause and everything and 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.180
 you come back into the world of some 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.470
 hours later in real life and there 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.420
 you will see that you will have won at 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.320
 less in the ten thousand here I hope 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.320
 that this video will have pleased you
