problem which I spent the last half hour

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.960 
problem which I spent the last half hour
digging<00:03:11.030> out<00:03:11.950> pieces<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:15.070> styrofoam<00:03:16.070> packing

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970

peanuts<00:03:18.760> inside<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.600> amp<00:03:21.100> as<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.280> can<00:03:22.430> see<00:03:22.670> I

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
peanuts inside the amp as you can see I

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.990 
peanuts inside the amp as you can see I
got<00:03:23.420> most<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:23.990> out<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:25.190> you'll<00:03:25.700> notice

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
got most of it out but you'll notice

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.570 
got most of it out but you'll notice
inside<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.110> speaker<00:03:27.910> our<00:03:28.910> styrofoam<00:03:29.600> peanuts

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
inside the speaker our styrofoam peanuts

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.600 
inside the speaker our styrofoam peanuts
which<00:03:31.580> are<00:03:32.120> not<00:03:32.300> easy<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.720> get<00:03:32.900> out<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.610> could

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
which are not easy to get out and could

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.940 
which are not easy to get out and could
actually<00:03:34.790> damage<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.720> cone<00:03:35.990> if<00:03:36.350> I<00:03:36.650> tried

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
actually damage the cone if I tried

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.710 
actually damage the cone if I tried
digging<00:03:37.370> them<00:03:37.700> out<00:03:37.990> so<00:03:38.990> to<00:03:39.950> get<00:03:40.160> those<00:03:40.520> out<00:03:40.820> I'm

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
digging them out so to get those out I'm

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.220 
digging them out so to get those out I'm
gonna<00:03:41.870> have<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.290> remove<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.830> speaker<00:03:44.230> which

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
gonna have to remove the speaker which

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.570 
gonna have to remove the speaker which
is<00:03:45.260> clearly<00:03:45.739> not<00:03:46.480> something<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.600> wanted<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:47.989> do

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
is clearly not something I wanted to do

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.160 
is clearly not something I wanted to do
now<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:50.630> real<00:03:50.930> fun<00:03:51.230> begins<00:03:52.390> as<00:03:53.390> we<00:03:53.750> can<00:03:53.959> see

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
now the real fun begins as we can see

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.170 
now the real fun begins as we can see
and<00:03:54.410> I'll<00:03:54.500> start<00:03:54.830> at<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.130> bottom<00:03:55.310> I've

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
and I'll start at the bottom I've

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.570 
and I'll start at the bottom I've
already<00:03:56.540> taken<00:03:56.780> photos<00:03:57.620> but<00:03:57.950> now<00:03:58.160> we'll<00:03:58.430> get

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
already taken photos but now we'll get

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.620 
already taken photos but now we'll get
the<00:03:58.760> VIS<00:03:59.000> visual<00:03:59.780> by<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.650> way<00:04:00.800> this<00:04:01.130> is<00:04:01.370> the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
the VIS visual by the way this is the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.680 
the VIS visual by the way this is the
bag<00:04:02.630> of<00:04:03.700> packing<00:04:04.700> peanuts<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.300> can<00:04:05.450> see<00:04:05.660> I

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
bag of packing peanuts you can see I

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.430 
bag of packing peanuts you can see I
filled<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.770> up<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:08.510> was<00:04:08.660> also<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:09.020> half<00:04:09.260> hour

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.020 
filled it up that was also a half hour
of<00:04:09.590> time<00:04:09.800> I<00:04:09.860> really<00:04:10.280> didn't<00:04:10.550> want<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.760> spend

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
of time I really didn't want to spend

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.250

kind of discoloration which could have
been<00:04:44.190> on<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.370> app<00:04:44.580> before<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.300> don't<00:04:45.720> know<00:04:46.250> I'll

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
been on the app before I don't know I'll

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.290 
been on the app before I don't know I'll
give<00:04:47.460> you<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.639> benefit<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.150> doubt

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
indentation right there I'll actually

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.980 
indentation right there I'll actually
run<00:05:05.520> my<00:05:05.669> finger<00:05:05.970> along<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.419> so<00:05:06.599> you<00:05:06.660> can<00:05:06.810> see

I'll go to the front later but there's

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.670 
I'll go to the front later but there's
still<00:05:20.400> plenty<00:05:20.669> to<00:05:20.940> see<00:05:21.120> back<00:05:21.330> here<00:05:21.690> not<00:05:22.470> the

that<00:05:25.710> is<00:05:26.690> a<00:05:27.949> transformer<00:05:29.180> very<00:05:30.180> important<00:05:30.659> for

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
that is a transformer very important for

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.409 
that is a transformer very important for
the<00:05:31.229> amp

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
the amp

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.810

important<00:05:41.490> not<00:05:42.479> very<00:05:42.840> good<00:05:43.139> that<00:05:43.169> it's<00:05:43.560> just

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
important not very good that it's just

hanging<00:05:44.039> by<00:05:44.400> a<00:05:44.669> single<00:05:45.210> screw<00:05:45.539> and<00:05:45.840> as<00:05:46.289> we<00:05:46.590> can

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
hanging by a single screw and as we can

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.850 
hanging by a single screw and as we can
see<00:05:47.180> it<00:05:48.180> was<00:05:48.360> damaged<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.139> point<00:05:49.380> where<00:05:49.590> I

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
see it was damaged to the point where I

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.450 
see it was damaged to the point where I
can't<00:05:50.099> even<00:05:50.280> get<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:50.669> flush<00:05:50.940> now<00:05:51.000> because<00:05:52.460> it

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
can't even get it flush now because it

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.730 
can't even get it flush now because it
was<00:05:53.990> totally<00:05:54.990> hanging<00:05:55.470> loose<00:05:56.900> so<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:58.440> means

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
was totally hanging loose so that means

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.779 
was totally hanging loose so that means
there<00:05:59.310> would<00:05:59.430> be<00:05:59.460> a<00:05:59.580> screw<00:06:00.060> missing<00:06:00.800> Dom<00:06:01.800> right

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
there would be a screw missing Dom right

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.640 
there would be a screw missing Dom right
there<00:06:03.060> that<00:06:03.810> screw<00:06:04.259> is<00:06:04.530> gone<00:06:04.860> cannot<00:06:05.669> find<00:06:06.000> it

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
there that screw is gone cannot find it

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.879 
there that screw is gone cannot find it
