00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
topcoat in the tray lid just so that I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
topcoat in the tray lid just so that I
can<00:01:20.009> go<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.729> pick<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.090> these<00:01:21.240> glitters<00:01:21.750> so

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
can go in and pick up these glitters so

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.690 
can go in and pick up these glitters so
I'm<00:01:23.009> gonna<00:01:23.100> pick<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:24.020> medium<00:01:25.020> hex<00:01:25.320> glitter

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
I'm gonna pick up a medium hex glitter

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.070 
I'm gonna pick up a medium hex glitter
and<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> apply<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> around<00:01:27.720> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
and I'm going to apply it around this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.440 
and I'm going to apply it around this
small<00:01:28.500> line<00:01:31.520> just<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> row<00:01:32.970> around<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
small line just in a row around the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.910 
small line just in a row around the
small<00:01:33.750> line<00:01:36.409> because<00:01:37.409> we're<00:01:37.560> putting<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
small line because we're putting the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.590 
small line because we're putting the
straight<00:01:38.220> into<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> inhibition<00:01:39.030> layer<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
straight into the inhibition layer it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.469 
straight into the inhibition layer it
actually<00:01:40.020> sticks

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.190 

and<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:48.689> are<00:01:48.930> really<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.500> fine<00:01:51.200> I'm

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and these are really really fine I'm

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
and these are really really fine I'm
just<00:01:52.259> gonna<00:01:52.530> go<00:01:52.799> around<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.490> place<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> few<00:01:54.330> of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
just gonna go around and place a few of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:11.190 
just gonna go around and place a few of
these<00:01:55.580> larger<00:01:56.580> ones<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:58.190> couple<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.460> rows

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.350 

just<00:02:11.890> around<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.370> perimeter<00:02:12.819> that<00:02:12.849> smile<00:02:13.330> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
just around the perimeter that smile and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:23.280 
just around the perimeter that smile and
I've<00:02:13.780> created

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.020 

pick<00:02:24.290> up<00:02:24.470> some<00:02:24.650> little<00:02:24.980> kite<00:02:25.250> because<00:02:25.700> I'm

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
pick up some little kite because I'm

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.700 
pick up some little kite because I'm
stopped<00:02:26.360> picking<00:02:26.810> up<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.230> many<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.500> gonna

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
stopped picking up so many and I gonna

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:47.220 
stopped picking up so many and I gonna
go<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.520> do<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.790> third<00:02:35.090> row

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.619 

you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.370> move<00:02:48.640> them<00:02:48.819> around<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.599> don't

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
you can move them around if you don't

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:57.539 
you can move them around if you don't
want<00:02:49.959> if<00:02:50.140> they're<00:02:50.349> in<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.560> wrong<00:02:50.680> place<00:02:56.549> and

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
want if they're in the wrong place and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
then I'm not so happy with the amount of

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.850 
then I'm not so happy with the amount of
rice<00:03:00.129> I've<00:03:00.430> got<00:03:00.700> I'm<00:03:01.450> gonna<00:03:01.599> go<00:03:01.870> into<00:03:02.230> my<00:03:02.409> small

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
rice I've got I'm gonna go into my small

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:27.920 
rice I've got I'm gonna go into my small
hex<00:03:03.280> glitter

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.750 

just<00:03:28.930> go<00:03:29.170> into<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.470> small<00:03:29.890> way<00:03:30.130> around<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.640> edge

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
just go into a small way around the edge

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:39.390 
just go into a small way around the edge
and<00:03:34.560> then<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:36.490> finish<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:37.030> design<00:03:38.190> I'm<00:03:39.190> going

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
and then to finish the design I'm going

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.730 
and then to finish the design I'm going
to<00:03:39.460> place<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.700> few<00:03:39.990> random<00:03:40.990> small<00:03:41.290> hex<00:03:41.530> glitters
