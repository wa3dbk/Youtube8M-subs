00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.259
 to a new video of game with more 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.420
 childrens toys I have today from the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.880
 playmobil city life series service 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.670
 toy shop for you with the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 serial number 5 488 for those who 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.820
 this is interesting for the toy 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.020
 for children from 5 years to about 12 years 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.019
 Of course, too 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.529
 and this toy shop has a few 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.750
 shelves with their own playmobil toys 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.329
 So, as I see right now, that's pretty much 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.840
 cool idea so to speak of playmobil in 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.540
 the toy store single playmobil 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.649
 to sell assets 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.480
 In addition to toy shock you can 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.879
 of course also toy store or 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.500
 toy shops to say if you 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.059
 This concept is not so common 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.309
 I would say we pack this now 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.969
 Just take a look and see us 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.969
 more closely 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:35.039
 here before their grains or 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:39.289
 I do not have to declare a shelf yet 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.289
 but say that real change right away 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.200
 everyone still small parts theirs already 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.299
 a figure a little redhead 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.600
 girl with freckles another 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600
 shelf 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:04.619
 that here is a part of the counter are 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:13.830
 here are a few stickers the instructions 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:19.069
 and lots of toys and the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:22.770
 Playable salesman with checkout 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.540
 and a few small parts 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.910
 that's it too, the carton is 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.700
 empty here you see what summer everything 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.940
 so it has been from a football 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.340
 a doll about vegan two figures 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.360
 sticker of any which roll 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.410
 probably for a wagon 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.690
 are meant 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.790
 I would say we build the whole thing in the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.590
 next video together on me 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.240
