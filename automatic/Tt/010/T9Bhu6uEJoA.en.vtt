00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
hey Rachel I'm ready to make games I

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.260 
hey Rachel I'm ready to make games I
have<00:00:17.830> a<00:00:17.890> leg<00:00:18.099> or<00:00:18.250> installed<00:00:18.640> by<00:00:18.880> having<00:00:19.150> some

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
have a leg or installed by having some

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.359 
have a leg or installed by having some
problems<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.800> are<00:00:20.890> you<00:00:20.980> having<00:00:21.130> trouble

problems what are you having trouble

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.810 
problems what are you having trouble
with<00:00:21.730> I<00:00:22.169> want<00:00:23.169> to<00:00:23.200> make<00:00:23.289> a<00:00:23.349> file<00:00:23.680> that<00:00:24.009> has<00:00:24.789> a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
with I want to make a file that has a

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.109 
with I want to make a file that has a
function<00:00:25.300> that's<00:00:25.480> raw<00:00:25.990> as<00:00:26.050> my<00:00:26.199> games<00:00:26.699> ok<00:00:27.699> what

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
function that's raw as my games ok what

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.810 
function that's raw as my games ok what
is<00:00:28.239> your<00:00:28.270> classes<00:00:28.810> name<00:00:29.050> I<00:00:29.640> haven't<00:00:30.640> made<00:00:30.759> that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
is your classes name I haven't made that

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.020 
is your classes name I haven't made that
yet<00:00:31.270> I<00:00:31.540> try<00:00:31.930> to<00:00:31.989> bag<00:00:32.739> a<00:00:32.950> lot<00:00:33.160> of<00:00:33.219> errors<00:00:33.370> so<00:00:33.969> i

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
yet I try to bag a lot of errors so i

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.260 
yet I try to bag a lot of errors so i
got<00:00:34.210> confused<00:00:35.100> well<00:00:36.100> what<00:00:36.489> are<00:00:36.550> you<00:00:36.640> going<00:00:37.120> to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
got confused well what are you going to

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.360 
got confused well what are you going to
name<00:00:37.420> your<00:00:37.570> class<00:00:38.760> draw<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:41.500> more<00:00:42.070> of<00:00:42.250> a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
name your class draw that's more of a

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.850 
name your class draw that's more of a
function<00:00:42.910> named<00:00:43.320> functions<00:00:44.320> tend<00:00:44.649> to<00:00:44.739> be

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
function named functions tend to be

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.489 
function named functions tend to be
verbs<00:00:45.219> and<00:00:45.520> classes<00:00:45.909> tend<00:00:46.120> to<00:00:46.239> be<00:00:46.359> nouns<00:00:46.600> draw

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.499 
verbs and classes tend to be nouns draw

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:54.450 
verbs and classes tend to be nouns draw
as<00:00:47.679> a<00:00:47.710> verb<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:50.170> drawing<00:00:51.159> plus<00:00:51.760> then<00:00:52.949> no<00:00:53.949> it'd

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
as a verb so drawing plus then no it'd

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.279 
as a verb so drawing plus then no it'd
be<00:00:54.640> something<00:00:54.850> more<00:00:55.149> like<00:00:55.329> a<00:00:55.390> player<00:00:55.809> class

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
be something more like a player class

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:03.700 
be something more like a player class
with<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.679> draw<00:00:57.069> function<00:00:57.460> AA<00:00:59.460> +<00:01:00.460> drawing<00:01:01.239> then

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.789 

this<00:01:04.549> is<00:01:04.760> just<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.239> guess<00:01:05.570> but<00:01:06.049> I<00:01:06.440> think<00:01:06.500> that

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
this is just a guess but I think that

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.680 
this is just a guess but I think that
you<00:01:07.010> may<00:01:07.220> need<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:07.580> review<00:01:07.880> more<00:01:08.150> of<00:01:08.210> your<00:01:08.330> C++

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
you may need to review more of your C++

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.060 
you may need to review more of your C++
before<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.530> can<00:01:09.650> make<00:01:09.770> games<00:01:11.260> no<00:01:12.260> I<00:01:12.619> have

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
before you can make games no I have

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.010 
before you can make games no I have
estancia's<00:01:13.640> plus<00:01:13.909> I<00:01:14.150> just<00:01:14.570> call<00:01:14.720> my<00:01:14.869> can

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
estancia's plus I just call my can

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
estancia's plus I just call my can
e-file<00:01:16.000> well<00:01:17.000> go<00:01:17.840> read<00:01:18.110> up<00:01:18.259> on<00:01:18.380> some<00:01:18.650> object

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
e-file well go read up on some object

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.749 
e-file well go read up on some object
oriented<00:01:19.460> programming<00:01:20.119> I<00:01:21.340> understand<00:01:22.340> object

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
oriented programming I understand object

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.340 
oriented programming I understand object
or<00:01:22.909> in<00:01:23.000> your<00:01:23.090> programming<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.690> can't<00:01:24.200> like

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
or in your programming I can't like

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.460 
or in your programming I can't like
functions

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.190 

I<00:01:29.700> always<00:01:30.700> tell<00:01:30.940> people<00:01:30.970> in<00:01:31.450> my<00:01:31.570> guides<00:01:31.810> to

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
I always tell people in my guides to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.350 
I always tell people in my guides to
understand<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.770> basics<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.220> C++<00:01:33.940> before

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
understand the basics of C++ before

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.690 
understand the basics of C++ before
tackling<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.900> library<00:01:35.320> like<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> leg<00:01:35.890> row<00:01:36.070> sdl

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
sfml or opengl usually I will include a

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.480 
sfml or opengl usually I will include a

list of topics most people will follow

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.520 
list of topics most people will follow
it<00:01:42.760> a<00:01:42.910> lot<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.180> people<00:01:43.420> still<00:01:43.810> try<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.080> jump<00:01:44.380> in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
it a lot of people still try to jump in

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.770 
it a lot of people still try to jump in

without any C++ or programming

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.460 
without any C++ or programming
experience<00:01:48.330> it's<00:01:49.330> really<00:01:49.600> hard<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.990> tell<00:01:50.200> what

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
experience it's really hard to tell what

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.380 
experience it's really hard to tell what
you<00:01:50.590> do<00:01:50.800> or<00:01:51.040> don't<00:01:51.250> understand<00:01:51.940> just<00:01:52.240> from

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
you do or don't understand just from

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.540 
you do or don't understand just from
reading<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.750> list<00:01:52.930> so<00:01:53.770> I've<00:01:54.040> come<00:01:54.250> up<00:01:54.310> with<00:01:54.430> a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
reading a list so I've come up with a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
bunch of little test programs that you

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.630 
bunch of little test programs that you
can<00:01:56.140> write<00:01:56.470> in<00:01:56.710> order<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.070> see<00:01:57.220> if<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.400> have<00:01:57.520> an

adequate knowledge of C++ these tests

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.580 
adequate knowledge of C++ these tests
are<00:02:00.820> also<00:02:00.970> good<00:02:01.270> for<00:02:01.390> Java<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:01.869> C<00:02:02.020> sharp<00:02:02.290> too

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
are also good for Java and C sharp too

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.620 
are also good for Java and C sharp too
though<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.369> last<00:02:03.580> part<00:02:03.850> deals<00:02:04.090> with<00:02:04.270> pointers
