00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
are some comparables it's nothing

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.820

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
similar to Chanel's Bella Goose which is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.580 
similar to Chanel's Bella Goose which is
the<00:04:45.980> number<00:04:46.310> 667<00:04:47.230> because<00:04:48.230> this<00:04:48.740> is<00:04:49.040> more<00:04:49.580> of<00:04:49.910> a

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
the number 667 because this is more of a

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.810 
the number 667 because this is more of a

blue with shimmer in it very iridescent

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.150 
blue with shimmer in it very iridescent
shimmer<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.540> it's<00:04:56.780> more<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.320> royal<00:04:57.830> blue

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.740 
shimmer so it's more of a royal blue
with<00:04:59.380> shimmer<00:05:00.380> then<00:05:01.160> I<00:05:01.400> also<00:05:01.700> compared<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.720> to

with shimmer then I also compared it to

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.130 
with shimmer then I also compared it to
the<00:05:03.290> YSL<00:05:04.040> blur<00:05:04.550> mozzarell<00:05:05.390> which<00:05:05.750> is<00:05:05.930> one<00:05:06.110> of

nothing alike you can see that the blur

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.730 
nothing alike you can see that the blur
measure<00:05:12.200> L<00:05:12.410> is<00:05:12.650> more<00:05:12.980> of<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.520> bright<00:05:13.940> blue<00:05:14.210> and
