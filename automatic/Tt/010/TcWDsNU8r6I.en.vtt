really like it so far and I'm looking

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.860 
really like it so far and I'm looking
forward<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.819> reading<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.479> rest<00:05:11.599> of<00:05:11.780> the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
forward to reading the rest of the

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.749 
forward to reading the rest of the
series<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:12.349> guess<00:05:12.530> there's<00:05:12.740> five<00:05:13.069> books<00:05:13.460> in

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
series I guess there's five books in

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.390 
series I guess there's five books in
that<00:05:13.940> series<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:14.740> like<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:15.860> said<00:05:16.039> I'm<00:05:16.159> on<00:05:16.280> the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
that series so like I said I'm on the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.730 
that series so like I said I'm on the
third<00:05:16.639> one<00:05:16.849> and<00:05:17.150> I<00:05:17.389> should<00:05:17.900> be<00:05:18.050> finished<00:05:18.409> with

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
third one and I should be finished with

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.110 
third one and I should be finished with
it<00:05:18.889> by<00:05:19.099> the<00:05:19.130> end<00:05:19.460> of<00:05:19.610> October<00:05:20.150> I<00:05:20.180> am<00:05:20.479> guessing
