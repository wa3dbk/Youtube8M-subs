00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.840
 well that's it everyone knows this 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.010
 that she is today we find ourselves 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.420
 for a new life of both shots 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.860
 on call of duty cost so first of all 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.120
 to start you will take the 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.450
 same common benchmarks in the video 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.190
 that is, to look at the corner of the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.559
 tile underneath the green to be able 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.150
 so chained to a series of 10 parcels 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.250
 that you are going to have to get back to you 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.140
 go back to the old balcony that was at 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.550
 side of the ti cats rom that was patched 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.140
 so if I see this video the watch 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.030
 each and do I hope first that he 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.650
 complain about it and then it's also for 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.620
 show you a series of spots in 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.030
 height plus an outlet tomorrow so 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.979
 once you're on that roof 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.260
 you will launch two parcels as I 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.450
 do with his benchmarks there finally any case 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.190
 to stack them and to be able to climb 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.880
 above and to be able to raise the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.950
 two players 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.750
 excuse me if I'm in split screen 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.250
 but these days I did not have 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.380
 a lot of connections that's why 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.020
 I was late on my channel and I 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.610
 so I apologize for it so I took advantage of 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.560
 my sister yes it is she who helped me and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.570
 I thank her even if there is the tail 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.450
 in front but well it may be a 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.979
 future guicheuse so brief once 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.149
 you did the colic method 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.070
 you have made your two players 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.590
 you then place a series of 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.170
 six parcels on the veranda so there you have 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.880
 launched two then you have on the small 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.490
 white robot and green eye a small 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.009
 little so that parcels are piled up at 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.210
 same place once you have 100 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.549
 wounded sticks to it and you will be able to 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.060
 ride on it again for 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.149
 to arrive on the species of 6 Cretans we are going 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.340
 say that like that to your left 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.079
 so once you'll be on you 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.369
 will see that the soil is really 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.990
 very white it looks like the 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.180
 developers did not do the 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.070
 luminescence of this roof where they have it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.800
 left to the shortest we do not care 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.420
 a little more since we did not there 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.330
 do something here 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.460
 so once you'll be here this is 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.290
 not finished to go to the maximum of 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.310
 roof of this turn france and for power 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.600
 go out of the map 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.160
 you still have one last 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.500
 step you will have to use your 22 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.420
 last parcels then you stack them 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.360
 so as to get on the roof 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.770
 so I spend the day 22 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.120
 show a few to show you 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.560
 even though you must not do it near 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.760
 from the edge otherwise your packages go directly 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.340
 fell on the left 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.200
 because once you're in semi a 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.110
 safe map the hills are no longer up 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.390
 in any case, they do not bounce 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.830
 on the ground let's say see who are 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.660
 directly put on the ground that's why 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.970
 so we see them once we are 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.870
 arrived at 22nd coli as you can 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.570
 see on the bottom screen 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.130
 we are directly at the top and there 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.670
 you just have to jump on the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.000
 glass that will serve as the floor surface and 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.070
 there you will be on the most 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.200
 high of the roof finally after there is still 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.420
 a spot in height I showed you there 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.140
 it still requires seven hills 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.180
 seems so it's a spot even more 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.100
 high but I'm not amused was going 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.050
 really on the roof I'm afraid of falling 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.000
 in the middle of falling in the cik-fia 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.220
 early troubles so there as you the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.840
 see we are two on the roof but 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.910
 after you see where they are 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.850
 were going to be in front of 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.670
 the player's screen bah I tried to 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.040
 do I try to make sure that the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.570
 high player on it but it's not 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.760
 textures and so suddenly we fall 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.500
 down there so as you could 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.660
 see I'm piling up seven 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.950
 parcels which blow is we start 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.510
 it's the grass that ensures the green 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.040
 and then once you have 100 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.739
 injured seven parcels you will be able 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.840
 ride and land on a last spot 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.190
 in height as I wanted to said and to 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.350
 From that moment on you will be 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.970
 really at the highest point 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.950
 definitely 2 call of duty 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.720
 in any case for now I guess 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.070
 that this is the highest place after 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.200
 certainly with the god mode you 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.419
 can reach even more spots 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.979
 up and through the viewer mode the mode 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.250
 free we can see that apart from the 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.169
 map 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.790
 there are some buildings that are 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.229
 even higher than that and who are 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.120
 textures and so will know why 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.950
 they made another very big choice 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.200
 like this one without them being 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.210
 necessarily textures and he only had that 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.410
 to do I think so I do not know there 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.450
 as you see I'm trying to 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.890
 go around so that's why this 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.390
 is not useful to go on the last 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.610
 spot in height so just like that 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.620
 a little more and as you could see 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.400
 on the right there was a reverse path 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.900
 so there 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.509
 as we see on the screen here is 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.949
 I am there and when you go very far 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.810
 like there I'll do it you go 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.310
 fall down so at the beginning I got 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.550
 said oh no I fell into a hole 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.930
 black 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.120
 but there no I see that I'm standing 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.940
 and there I was quite happy 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.919
 to have found the top top map of the amap 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.500
 stormfront so I leave you on this 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.830
 little video and finally you'll see 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.440
 the Peugeot 206 to hide from the amap 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.759
 stormfront so I hope this video 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.080
 youtube will please you if it's the case 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.669
 do not hesitate to like comment and 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.320
 why not subscribe if not 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.310
 not already done and then I tell you to 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.310
 the next and batum
