00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.180
 fast ride on the stones leave than 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.490
 faster you drive on a rocky slope 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.150
 the less you notice any of it 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.099
 irregularities 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.380
 the speed should be such that you 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:26.369
 touched only the tops of stones 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:28.050
 then you ride without problems you 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.599
 must firmly figure out what is most important 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.070
 In this case, this is the speed of many 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 bicyclists try the opposite 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.450
 slow down but lose control for that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.059
 simple reason that the bike rides 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.460
 in front of them collecting all the stones on the way 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.680
 instead of quickly and discreetly them 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.600
 fly in order to absorb all 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
 irregularities that you meet on 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.920
 ways you should actively use your 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.399
 hands and never loosen 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.590
 grip 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.980
 since releasing the steering wheel you are great 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.980
 risk 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.010
 here and generally forget about the brakes 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.290
 know in my cooler this just 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.970
 nothing can be I participated in 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.860
 many races and talk not only about 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.260
 bikes since acted and on 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.590
 motorcycle but what you have to do 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.190
 here it's just a thrill I never 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.080
 experienced such adrenaline adore it 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.080
 case I recommend who wants to tickle 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.360
 I can't tell myself that my nerves 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.880
 there is some special technique that 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.979
 i stick to passing this 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.140
 tracks I just do my hands and 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.840
 kicking and concentrating all my attention 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.000
 on the road I make sure that the speed is not 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.190
 fell and only occasionally gently 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.930
 slow down on a rocky road 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.240
 cyclists behavior should be no 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.180
 such as on ordinary tracks especially 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.440
 hard here are sharp turns 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.300
 because on them actually not 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.800
 brakes involved driving them 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.990
 necessary at full speed 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.030
 hence you cannot deploy 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.729
 bike as you usually do 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.860
 so the turn is exactly with 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.490
 barely noticeable tilt and going 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.000
 solely by steering and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.000
 weight distribution wheels
