00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
because basically was overpowering the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.610 
because basically was overpowering the
other<00:03:02.180> ones<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.629> now<00:03:03.079> she's<00:03:03.290> going<00:03:03.409> to<00:03:03.469> be<00:03:03.590> a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
other ones so now she's going to be a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:14.490 
other ones so now she's going to be a
backlight

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.980 

because<00:03:15.640> this<00:03:16.640> one<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:16.970> now<00:03:17.120> backlight<00:03:17.720> I

because this one is now backlight I

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.260 
because this one is now backlight I
wanted<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.710> be<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.860> bit<00:03:19.040> more<00:03:19.160> directional<00:03:19.700> so

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
wanted to be a bit more directional so

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.970
