just a little odd for using the camera
sideways<00:04:55.610> like<00:04:55.789> this<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.990> just<00:04:57.379> found<00:04:57.500> it<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:57.770> be

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
sideways like this I just found it to be

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.640 
sideways like this I just found it to be
a<00:04:57.889> little<00:04:58.039> bit<00:04:58.159> awkward<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:59.360> reach<00:04:59.539> to<00:05:00.050> to

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
a little bit awkward to to reach to to

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.490 
a little bit awkward to to reach to to
use<00:05:01.330> but<00:05:02.330> otherwise<00:05:02.509> the<00:05:02.840> camera<00:05:03.199> works

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
use but otherwise the camera works

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.369 
use but otherwise the camera works
decent<00:05:04.009> although<00:05:04.400> for<00:05:05.150> some<00:05:05.300> reason<00:05:05.719> LG<00:05:06.199> and

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:06.379
