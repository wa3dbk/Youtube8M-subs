okay the hard part but not really that
much<00:03:30.260> harder<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.830> this<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.459> pinking

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
much harder is this is the pinking

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.870

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
picking pattern is a little bit

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.600 
picking pattern is a little bit
different<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.470> don't<00:03:36.530> usually<00:03:36.770> use<00:03:36.980> all<00:03:37.430> my

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
different I don't usually use all my

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.040 
different I don't usually use all my
fingers<00:03:37.850> it's<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.180> good<00:03:38.300> practice<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.810> actually

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
fingers it's a good practice to actually

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.740 
fingers it's a good practice to actually
use<00:03:39.730> more<00:03:40.730> than<00:03:40.880> two<00:03:41.060> fingers<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.450> play<00:03:41.600> this

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
use more than two fingers to play this

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.110 
use more than two fingers to play this
song<00:03:41.959> but<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.530> guess<00:03:43.340> I'm<00:03:43.459> just<00:03:43.550> lazy<00:03:43.819> and

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
song but I guess I'm just lazy and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.220 
song but I guess I'm just lazy and
sometimes<00:03:44.480> they<00:03:44.569> only<00:03:44.690> like<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:44.959> use<00:03:45.080> two

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
sometimes they only like to use two

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.960 
sometimes they only like to use two
