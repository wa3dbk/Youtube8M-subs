somewhere<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> crosswalk<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.909> send<00:01:54.479> an

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
somewhere like a crosswalk and send an

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.990 
somewhere like a crosswalk and send an
audio<00:01:55.079> alert<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> user<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.820> are

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
audio alert to the user if they are

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.450 
audio alert to the user if they are
someone<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.600> impaired<00:01:58.290> vision<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:59.189> just

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
someone with impaired vision this just

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.819 
someone with impaired vision this just
sounds<00:01:59.579> crazy<00:01:59.969> awesome<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:01.259> only<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.530> patent

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
sounds crazy awesome it's only a patent

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.590 
sounds crazy awesome it's only a patent
application<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> real<00:02:03.060> product

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
application and it's not a real product

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.260 
application and it's not a real product
just<00:02:03.869> yet<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.430> really<00:02:05.430> maybe<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.880> should<00:02:06.090> just

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
just yet so really maybe you should just

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.660 
just yet so really maybe you should just
buy<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> Google<00:02:06.930> glass<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.409> your<00:02:07.500> refund<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.250 
jumping on this and you guys are
developing<00:02:32.730> your<00:02:33.000> own<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.450> Google<00:02:34.019> glass

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
developing your own of Google glass

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.839 
developing your own of Google glass
application<00:02:34.590> correct<00:02:35.340> correct

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
application correct correct

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.490 
application correct correct
yeah<00:02:36.030> glass<00:02:36.269> wearin<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.840> really<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.410> an

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
yeah glass wearin and really it's an

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.890 
yeah glass wearin and really it's an
extension<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.190> our<00:02:38.580> mobile<00:02:38.880> app<00:02:39.000> again<00:02:39.720> being

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
extension of our mobile app again being

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.449 
extension of our mobile app again being
in<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.080> Bay<00:02:40.200> Area<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.980> probably<00:02:41.190> have<00:02:41.430> more

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
in the Bay Area we probably have more

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.400 
in the Bay Area we probably have more
adopters<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.120> Google<00:02:42.480> glass<00:02:42.540> than<00:02:42.930> most

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
adopters of Google glass than most

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.590 
adopters of Google glass than most
markets<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.580> we<00:02:44.610> want<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.910> make<00:02:45.269> sure<00:02:45.300> we're

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
markets so we want to make sure we're

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.330 
markets so we want to make sure we're
ahead<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> curve<00:02:45.900> again<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.980> bring<00:02:47.220> that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
ahead of the curve again and bring that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.220 
ahead of the curve again and bring that
experience<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.480> platform<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
experience to to this platform and the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.900 
experience to to this platform and the
thing<00:02:49.350> about<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.430> not<00:02:50.700> going<00:02:50.850> to

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
thing about this is this is not going to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.699 
thing about this is this is not going to
be<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.209> isolated<00:02:51.750> at<00:02:51.870> any<00:02:51.989> section<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.440> want
