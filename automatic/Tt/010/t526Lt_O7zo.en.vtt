you can see I have a 100 or 1,000 pixel
width<00:00:26.220> container<00:00:26.789> centered<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.590> down

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
width container centered if I get down

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.540

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
see no changes apply and that would be

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.280 
see no changes apply and that would be
way<00:00:35.070> too<00:00:35.130> big<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.820> mobile<00:00:36.110> mobile<00:00:37.110> phone

media rule it's going to change up the
default<00:00:55.410> styling<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.640> default<00:00:57.149> styling

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
default styling this default styling

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
default styling this default styling
here<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.050> changed<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.620> inside<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
here can be changed up inside of this

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
here can be changed up inside of this
rule<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.719> our<00:01:00.809> media<00:01:01.079> rule<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.410> targeting

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
rule so our media rule is targeting

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.030 
rule so our media rule is targeting
screen<00:01:02.250> type<00:01:02.550> devices<00:01:03.229> with<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.439> feature<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
screen type devices with the feature of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.380 
screen type devices with the feature of
max<00:01:05.580> width<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.470> 768<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.640> screens<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.330> are

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
max width of 768 so all screens that are

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.560 
max width of 768 so all screens that are
768<00:01:10.380> pixels<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.950> less<00:01:11.189> will<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> changes

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
768 pixels and less will get the changes

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.070 
768 pixels and less will get the changes
applied<00:01:12.960> let's<00:01:13.680> take<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> look<00:01:14.100> let's<00:01:15.080> shrink

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
applied let's take a look let's shrink

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.719 
applied let's take a look let's shrink
down<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.759> 768<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:18.930> what<00:01:19.080> happens<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
down to 768 and you see what happens and

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.010 
down to 768 and you see what happens and
I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.270> make<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> padding<00:01:22.140> 1%<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:24.020> fix

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I think I can make the padding 1% to fix

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.870 
I think I can make the padding 1% to fix
that<00:01:25.170> vertical<00:01:25.650> scroll<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.340> size<00:01:26.580> let's

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that vertical scroll at that size let's

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.480 
that vertical scroll at that size let's
see<00:01:27.060> yep<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.579> mean<00:01:29.880> horizontal<00:01:30.240> scroll

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you see the way I had the padding set

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.390 
you see the way I had the padding set
before<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> horizontal<00:01:34.799> scrollbar

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
before there was a horizontal scrollbar

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
there's no horizontal scroll when you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.359 
there's no horizontal scroll when you
get<00:01:39.360> down<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.720> size<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.250> I'm

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
right here changing the h2 to 0.9 am

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.249 
right here changing the h2 to 0.9 am

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
changing the P to 0.7 am that way my

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.440 
changing the P to 0.7 am that way my
content<00:01:55.770> fits<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.219> there<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
content fits in there and it's not the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.510 
content fits in there and it's not the
words<00:01:57.689> aren't<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.079> giant<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> tiny

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
words aren't so giant on the tiny

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120 
words aren't so giant on the tiny
smartphone<00:02:00.090> screen<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.500> see<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:02.009> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
smartphone screen so you can see that is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.459 
smartphone screen so you can see that is
the<00:02:02.399> simplest<00:02:02.969> way<00:02:03.240> because<00:02:04.079> you'll<00:02:04.259> have

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the simplest way because you'll have

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.980 
the simplest way because you'll have
your<00:02:04.649> default<00:02:05.130> CSS<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.420> also<00:02:06.570> go<00:02:06.869> in

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
your default CSS and this can also go in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.889 
your default CSS and this can also go in
your<00:02:07.140> external<00:02:07.770> stylesheet<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.750> have

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
your external stylesheet so you can have

I've seen some developers they'll have

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.810 
I've seen some developers they'll have
one<00:05:06.300> media<00:05:06.660> query<00:05:07.050> for<00:05:07.500> their<00:05:07.740> normal<00:05:08.070> desktop

one media query for their normal desktop

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.090 
one media query for their normal desktop
users<00:05:09.420> then<00:05:10.050> they'll<00:05:10.230> have<00:05:10.350> another<00:05:10.710> media

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
users then they'll have another media

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.330

for desktop users on top and then under

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.160 
for desktop users on top and then under
that<00:05:20.280> just<00:05:21.030> put<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.210> media<00:05:21.510> query<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:22.050> will

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
that just put a media query that will

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.840 
that just put a media query that will
change<00:05:22.500> that<00:05:22.920> default<00:05:23.640> CSS<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:25.440> CSS<00:05:26.430> styling

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
change that default CSS to CSS styling

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.060 
change that default CSS to CSS styling
that's<00:05:27.060> more<00:05:27.410> compatible<00:05:28.410> for<00:05:28.800> smaller

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
that's more compatible for smaller

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.830 
that's more compatible for smaller
screens<00:05:29.400> that's<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:29.910> and<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.390> can<00:05:30.540> have<00:05:30.720> as

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
screens that's it and you can have as

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.780 
screens that's it and you can have as
many<00:05:31.020> media<00:05:31.470> queries<00:05:31.920> that<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.220> like<00:05:32.400> inside

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
many media queries that you like inside

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.410 
many media queries that you like inside
of<00:05:32.850> your<00:05:33.120> styling<00:05:34.550> now<00:05:35.550> I<00:05:35.580> have<00:05:35.940> some<00:05:36.120> handy

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
of your styling now I have some handy

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.630 
of your styling now I have some handy
tips<00:05:36.570> and<00:05:36.840> tip<00:05:37.440> number<00:05:37.470> one<00:05:37.920> is<00:05:37.950> consider

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
tips and tip number one is consider

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.390 
tips and tip number one is consider
using<00:05:38.940> percentage<00:05:39.840> widths<00:05:40.320> instead<00:05:40.800> of<00:05:40.950> pixel

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
using percentage widths instead of pixel

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.280 
using percentage widths instead of pixel
widths<00:05:41.610> you'll<00:05:42.300> have<00:05:42.540> different<00:05:43.050> size

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
widths you'll have different size

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.890 
widths you'll have different size
smartphone<00:05:44.100> screens<00:05:44.670> so<00:05:45.450> you<00:05:45.540> don't<00:05:45.720> want<00:05:45.840> to

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
smartphone screens so you don't want to

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.870 
smartphone screens so you don't want to
have<00:05:46.020> pixel<00:05:46.440> width<00:05:46.650> because<00:05:47.460> different

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
have pixel width because different

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.820 
have pixel width because different
people<00:05:48.150> on<00:05:48.420> different<00:05:48.540> smartphones<00:05:49.140> will<00:05:49.650> see

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
people on different smartphones will see

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.080 
people on different smartphones will see
things<00:05:50.070> differently<00:05:50.490> so<00:05:50.520> you<00:05:50.670> want<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:50.970> have

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
things differently so you want to have

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.180 
things differently so you want to have
percentage<00:05:51.630> widths<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.170> make<00:05:52.560> sure<00:05:52.740> that<00:05:53.010> the

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
percentage widths and make sure that the

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.360 
percentage widths and make sure that the
container<00:05:53.580> is<00:05:53.820> centered<00:05:54.810> using<00:05:55.340> margin<00:05:56.340> zero

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
container is centered using margin zero

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.690 
container is centered using margin zero
pixel<00:05:57.120> Auto<00:05:57.360> so<00:05:57.990> you<00:05:58.110> put<00:05:58.350> margin<00:05:58.800> CSS

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
pixel Auto so you put margin CSS

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.630 
pixel Auto so you put margin CSS
property<00:06:00.180> with<00:06:00.330> zero<00:06:00.570> pixel<00:06:01.080> Auto<00:06:01.320> and<00:06:01.860> then

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
property with zero pixel Auto and then

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.480 
property with zero pixel Auto and then
it'll<00:06:03.060> Center<00:06:03.600> that<00:06:03.860> container<00:06:04.860> and<00:06:05.160> if<00:06:05.340> you

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
it'll Center that container and if you

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.430 
it'll Center that container and if you
have<00:06:05.670> a<00:06:05.700> percentage<00:06:06.240> width<00:06:06.690> it<00:06:06.900> will<00:06:06.990> take<00:06:07.260> up

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
have a percentage width it will take up
