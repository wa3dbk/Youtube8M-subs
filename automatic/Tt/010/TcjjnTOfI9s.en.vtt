to<00:01:00.200> set<00:01:00.440> myself<00:01:00.590> apart<00:01:01.450> my<00:01:02.450> dad's<00:01:03.050> dad<00:01:03.350> used<00:01:03.710> to

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
to set myself apart my dad's dad used to

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.590 
to set myself apart my dad's dad used to
race<00:01:03.980> cars<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.700> then<00:01:04.820> my<00:01:04.910> mom's<00:01:05.150> dad<00:01:05.330> used<00:01:05.570> to

race boats so I think there's speed in
the<00:01:08.150> bloodline<00:01:08.360> somewhere<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.290> then<00:01:09.710> once<00:01:09.920> I
