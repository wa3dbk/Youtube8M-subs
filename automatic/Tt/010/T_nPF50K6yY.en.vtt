standing switched you're standing up oh

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410 
standing switched you're standing up oh
it's<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> same<00:00:46.890> thing<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.000> write<00:00:48.239> like

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it's the same thing so like I write like

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.110 
it's the same thing so like I write like
this<00:00:48.600> right<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.370> would<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> switch<00:00:50.850> sides

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
this right I would have to switch sides

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.119 
this right I would have to switch sides
and<00:00:51.739> I<00:00:52.739> honestly<00:00:53.309> cannot<00:00:53.969> heal<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:54.480> Vienna

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
and I honestly cannot heal with Vienna

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.389 
and I honestly cannot heal with Vienna
I've<00:00:56.129> never<00:00:56.340> tried<00:00:56.670> them<00:00:56.820> yet<00:00:56.930> but<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.399> can

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
I've never tried them yet but I can

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.540 
I've never tried them yet but I can
switch<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.710> which<00:01:01.710> doesn't<00:01:02.039> make<00:01:02.100> sense<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
switch you which doesn't make sense to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.950 
switch you which doesn't make sense to
me<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:04.409> actually<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.519> easier<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
me but it's actually a lot easier and I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.990 
me but it's actually a lot easier and I
think<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.830> only<00:01:07.860> reason<00:01:08.430> why<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
think the only reason why is because I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.320 
think the only reason why is because I
can<00:01:12.000> throw<00:01:12.420> my<00:01:13.080> left<00:01:13.590> foot<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.790> heel<00:01:15.150> with

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
can throw my left foot and heel with

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.590 
can throw my left foot and heel with
motion<00:01:16.189> but<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.549> some<00:01:17.700> reason<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.090> can't<00:01:18.330> throw

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
motion but for some reason I can't throw

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.320 
motion but for some reason I can't throw
my<00:01:18.750> right<00:01:18.930> foot<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> he<00:01:19.650> walks<00:01:19.799> motion<00:01:20.330> don't

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
my right foot as a he walks motion don't

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.109 
my right foot as a he walks motion don't
know<00:01:21.420> why<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.960> um<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.610> would<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.970> go

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
know why but um you would want to go

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.700 
know why but um you would want to go
like<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:25.520> okay<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.409> when<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> throw

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
like this right okay and when you throw

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.120 
like this right okay and when you throw
it<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.960> want<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> catch<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.650> how'd<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.060 

see<00:01:51.810> always<00:01:52.810> see<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.259> little<00:01:53.409> more<00:01:53.560> speed<00:01:53.829> so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
see always see it a little more speed so

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:01.170 
see always see it a little more speed so
I<00:01:54.130> can<00:01:54.280> actually<00:01:54.579> do<00:01:55.240> them<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:59.970> do<00:02:00.970> it

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
I can actually do them like that do it

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.590 
I can actually do them like that do it
one<00:02:01.360> more<00:02:01.420> time<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:04.090> they<00:02:04.270> look<00:02:04.299> really

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
one more time see they look really

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.820 
one more time see they look really
sketchy<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:07.080> can<00:02:08.080> still<00:02:08.229> do<00:02:08.440> them<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.769> I

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
sketchy but I can still do them and I

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.150 
sketchy but I can still do them and I
can<00:02:08.979> do<00:02:09.099> them<00:02:09.250> over<00:02:09.369> things<00:02:09.700> but<00:02:10.800> whenever<00:02:11.800> you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
can do them over things but whenever you

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.630 
can do them over things but whenever you
go<00:02:12.700> switch<00:02:13.269> which<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.780> needs<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:15.250> my<00:02:15.400> left

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
go switch which for needs to my left

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.930 
go switch which for needs to my left
side<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.620> want<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.950> go<00:02:18.099> like<00:02:18.340> this<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:18.790> you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
side you want to go like this and you

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.940 
side you want to go like this and you
want<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.150> jump<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.349> want<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.620> kick<00:02:20.830> it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
want to jump up and you want to kick it

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.570 
want to jump up and you want to kick it
out<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:22.150> catch<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.810> length<00:02:23.350> but<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.130> like<00:02:24.400> I

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
out and catch it length but I like I

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.090 
out and catch it length but I like I
said<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.880> catch<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.780> landed<00:02:25.959> sex<00:02:26.410> change<00:02:26.709> so

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100
