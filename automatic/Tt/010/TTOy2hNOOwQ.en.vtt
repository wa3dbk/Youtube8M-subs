00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.820
 although the postelse can be laced 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.090
 anything paripi can sit too I know him say 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.930
 something 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.530
 And yes that is just very complicated 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.160
 because that rain must stop now I think 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.530
 the more 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.760
 first and the second just that bieke 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.200
 I have to find to order the rest 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.970
 deliver or perhaps sit bowl 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.970
 or so for axel 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.360
 light 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.360
 see him that someone from also shoot and 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.350
 Jasper he apparently 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.189
 So 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.340
 what was what ago yes what are you doing here 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.710
 yes search name peaks 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.000
 why after a peak yes to everyone 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.299
 We can free you from every island 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.299
 not from 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.899
 what what what he must miss you and then you 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.539
 I just know I could once 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.049
 just with that other jan stuff 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.850
 was bypassed by the job and suddenly 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.340
 although it's here 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.100
 teleported lives with the house 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.300
 built as shelter yes fireplace since then 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.509
 I'm sitting here 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.190
 Jan a grater is a parsi 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.380
 Then you should not ask me who can here 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.539
 You can also sit in the same forest 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.600
 sit somewhere else I don't know 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:04.399
 he has that god is ultimately mine 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.350
 So brother just told me five here 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.470
 islands were or several he then none 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.830
 exactly I think on just 5 with it there 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.299
 already rear are scattered about and there 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.920
 sitting on this island can't appear 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.840
 broken and then can now 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.940
 only when opening differently from the island 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.450
 at a number eventually 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.420
 OK so it's our first goal now so 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.070
 break those peaks and then continue 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.150
 search for other people 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.180
 yes I already have some other people 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.250
 found well it is beautiful anyway 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.540
 yes name i will say maybe you should 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.520
 then go around looking for something or something 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.830
 because time is ticking away 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.650
 yes apparently can walk outside and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.000
 then we will just search for it 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.990
 those peaks and we go smooth 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.400
 direction 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.800
 you know about talking about old things 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.270
 is yes yes is he must come in both 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.690
 as about as i am on this side on each 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.690
 own life 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.920
 psv okay we arrived here 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.670
 which are put behind them so 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.140
 actually stopped once 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.660
 bills are 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.260

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.310
 all bit yes aah here and car 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.440
 curious 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.810
 request collins oh you are already up 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.700

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.580

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.230

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.260
 we are only three of us so that 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.849
 have to do some searching so yes unfortunately 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.849
 I think the 16 pi can already 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.530
 more important is certainly useful because 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.989
 the cane or a go and pass along 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.829

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:54.370
 fox me maybe another island can 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:57.340
 also looked yes because that they would 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.579
 the supreme god topper yes but I agree 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.819
 over top material 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.810
 yes the pitch yo there is that everyone 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.340
 always island 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.090

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.530
 look around with beautiful that is in 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.360
 it is convenient to go to sleep afterwards 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.800
 yes just rest a bit and then we leave 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.960
 8 again 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.300
 towards scientists in the wicks yes 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.520
 Then then we can find it openly 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.520
 because we just want to get in here
