00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 in 1926 a woman named 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.069
 those of the ç were accused of killing two men 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.870
 and sequenced to death she was the last 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.690
 person in Iceland to receive this 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.280
 sentence this book is based on facts 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:30.869
 real 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:33.120
 day god rites soon after the sticker is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.450
 hot the author chose a theme and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.940
 heavy for her first novel she did 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.590
 a deep research on the case 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.680
 of aggression write a book that is 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.510
 both biography and fiction and was 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.270
 super well rewarded for this choice 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.120
 since this book is a blood and 10 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.739
 cited several literature awards 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.620
 both the synopsis cover account already give a tone 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.199
 of the narrative the book overcoming colic 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.340
 How sad is it quite loaded with 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.590
 sadness 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.350
 and the snow that we see here on the cover and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.299
 which is the common scenario for Iceland is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.549
 the mayor to talk so much in history 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.010
 the characters in the book that are 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.799
 absurdly cold and distant 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.390
 after the sentence that defined its destiny 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.240
 Thank you for living on a farm. 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.159
 that direction by johnny marr customer and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.130
 I do not even need to talk they have it too 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.659
 two daughters went people say that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.180
 they are not one bit happy 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.009
 house a criminal in the most laws there is a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.340
 month they are forced to accept it 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.200
 farm and as spiritual advisor 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.299
 until the day in their execution they have the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.400
 figure of priest totti who is a priest 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.470
 super new that does not even know why it was 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.899
 chosen by her and that was the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.840
 responsible for creating a bridge between the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.369
 reader and history is through him that the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.600
 people know about the life story 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.549
 from ags and it is also 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.520
 has given greater mission of the narrative 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.140
 It's the crime I said committed or 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.690
 Did not commit the daughter there. 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.670
 guilty or not this mystery, but there 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.460
 also background to the narrative 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.909
 delivery deals with an invitation book as well 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.830
 slow almost have day 11 some points 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.630
 focus even talking relationship of 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.080
 agnes with family members who are 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.180
 fighting to the face that cliché that 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.030
 it's basically characters that I gave a 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.040
 another character with more prejudice 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.170
 that with time they know this 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.670
 character they hate and will 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.709
 learning to enjoy it 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.170
 I do not say the hurt because the love in that 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.269
 book is dead almost literally and the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.450
 existence of this cliché is a problem 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.670
 it's not at all because he was super 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.050
 well used in this book and a time 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.390
 that we were coming so much to talk to 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.100
 respect for justice with the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.100
 own hands and even that case 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.959
 nonsense of the guarujá witch that 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.730
 girl who was killed by lynching 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.220
 after accused she broke today the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.049
 Cute website with absurdity to this book 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.420
 raises several points and does not reader 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.519
 reflect on the prejudice that people 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.400
 has and builds with those people who 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.410
 are considered to be criminals 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.390
 the law or by our own 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.880
 moral compass and each one has his 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.700
 own history and the girl's 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.709
 People like this can be distorted. 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.019
 according to gossip or because in 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.850
 counts so much that recently we have 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.280
 seen a torrent of false news 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.000
 which are shared at the speed of 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.290
 light by people who read what they want 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.510
 let others know what the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.269
 example of the history that the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.090
 salt taken and interpreting the martel dollar 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.320
 in the oak season I was in the front people 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.030
 it does not cost anything 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.980
 search if you share the news 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.870
 Let's have good sense, right? 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.299
 Anyway, the book raises questions 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.060
 very pertinent fact that made me reflect and 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.980
 this is always a great merit 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.140
 any narrative the chapters of the book 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.140
 are divided into two parts which 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.880
 complete the third person very well 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.280
 when you are showing some documents 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.500
 officers who are really documents 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.390
 the case or when there are other 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.250
 people who are speaking in their 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.410
 respect for ags in the first person 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.290
 when the area was giving its own 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.090
 life or making a new one in the reflections 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.920
 about the whole situation she is 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.050
 living the parts that she's doing 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.180
 their monologues and control of their lives 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.130
 are by far the most interesting 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.680
 more than sometimes also the most 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.760
 boring and asks does not come from meals 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.880
 of ufrgs and only sold type of 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.800
 language that the author used at the time 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.900
 of writing a book in the case obviously 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.450
 English style was translated into Portuguese 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.490
 but obviously keeps if all these 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.860
 holy metaphors that were used 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.200
 and I 'm not against metaphor is true 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.210
 but when the author uses the most 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.160
 metaphor behind metaphor gets a little 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.380
 problematic, especially when the 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.940
 You are bound to man and not even 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.610
 to make sure that 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.810
 understood it was totally nude more with 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.650
 exception of Father Totti who is too 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.860
 stereotyped all characters 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.200
 undergoes transformations as well by parents 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.630
 during the narrative and however much 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.360
 said the book is super super 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.640
 sad melancholy is it possible for you to take 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.979
 a positive thing in this sea of ​​solitude 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.020
 which is precisely what comes from the 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.450
 development of these characters a 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.080
 small ray of light in the darkness 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.419
 of sadness can not stand easy but the 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.610
 effort is rewarding 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.190
 among the Jews to take 4 porpoises 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.000
