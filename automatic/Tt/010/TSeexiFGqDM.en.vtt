00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.869
 critical 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.909
 hi to all i mean you criticize 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:18.119
 you find it more serious since the armistice of 1940 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.109
 over a century ago 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.039
 Friday, June 18th, more and more victims of phlebitis 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.769
 fror george freche 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.990
 I am talking to you 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.410
 so 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.390
 we're going back quickly on the mixing is from techniques particularly 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.100
 more complicated than basic techniques 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.650
 these juices this material which on the other hand evolved on some that some 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.390
 mixing desks bubbles and special effects trains ran 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.320
 would be much needed 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.330
 in any case what would censorship want the musicality on the framing 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.690
 first I make you a little demonstration for already ferrals 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.840
 recap d of what we had seen his lot on the first stadium this is 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.420
 base 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 fused message and mix that was scratched 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.490
 normal we'll confess it's all about capella actually it's 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.270
 since that summer 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 what is needed is sure of ideas the musicality 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.020
 and oven seems not to worry the progression of a mask instrument 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.680
 for capelle care 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.570
 so it's a lot of research 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.540
 what I would like you to show yourself is mainly how to save time 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.010
 for example in the evening 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.710
 for this evening 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.710
 he has very little time to make sure people do not realize 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.280
 of what you're doing so here I have a little for that 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.670
 so it's like a normal tax message it takes that piece of 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.470
 social base 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.070
