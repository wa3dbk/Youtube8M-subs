xt60<00:00:15.240> connector<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.170> could<00:00:16.289> just

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
xt60 connector on it so I could just

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.320

and I'm kind of glad I did it because
every<00:00:39.120> cell<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.110> 3.8<00:00:40.680> volts<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.579> far<00:00:41.760> so

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
every cell is it 3.8 volts so so far so

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.069 
every cell is it 3.8 volts so so far so
good<00:00:42.110> all<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.440> packs<00:00:43.710> there's<00:00:44.190> no<00:00:44.460> dead<00:00:44.700> cells

all right well luckily it looks like I
have<00:01:03.210> enough<00:01:03.449> adapters<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.070> hook<00:01:05.189> up

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
have enough adapters I can just hook up

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
have enough adapters I can just hook up
my<00:01:05.460> parallel<00:01:05.909> charging<00:01:06.450> board<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.170> gonna

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
my parallel charging board and I'm gonna

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.100 
my parallel charging board and I'm gonna
try<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> charge<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:08.460> five<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> these<00:01:09.750> four

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
try to charge all five of these four

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440 
try to charge all five of these four
cell<00:01:10.409> packs<00:01:10.680> at<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> same<00:01:11.310> time<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:12.180> all

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
cell packs at the same time because all

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.260 
cell packs at the same time because all
their<00:01:12.600> voltages<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.200> exactly<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.130> 3.8<00:01:14.790> there

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
their voltages are exactly at 3.8 there

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.460 
their voltages are exactly at 3.8 there
may<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.630> 0.03<00:01:16.470> off<00:01:17.130> worst-case<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:19.380> I'm

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
may be 0.03 off worst-case I think I'm

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.960 
may be 0.03 off worst-case I think I'm
gonna<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.740> no<00:01:19.890> problem<00:01:20.220> doing<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.909> I'm

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
gonna have no problem doing this so I'm

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.789 
gonna have no problem doing this so I'm
just<00:01:21.090> gonna<00:01:21.180> top<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:21.659> off<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
just gonna top them all off with the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.679 
just gonna top them all off with the
balanced<00:01:23.130> charger<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.150> put<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.600> in

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
balanced charger then I can put them in

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.859 
balanced charger then I can put them in
series<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.640> get<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> discharge<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.540> them<00:01:27.659> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
series and get a discharge on them and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.420 
series and get a discharge on them and
then<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.259> start<00:01:28.500> charging<00:01:29.430> with<00:01:29.579> my<00:01:29.729> PSU

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
then I can start charging with my PSU

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.910 
then I can start charging with my PSU
I'm<00:01:32.430> also<00:01:32.579> gonna<00:01:32.790> solder<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.750> four<00:01:34.590> cell

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I'm also gonna solder up my four cell

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.340 
I'm also gonna solder up my four cell

one of these packs and if I find one of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.600 
one of these packs and if I find one of
them<00:01:40.140> has<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> runt<00:01:40.619> cell<00:01:40.920> I'll<00:01:41.130> probably<00:01:41.369> put

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
them has a runt cell I'll probably put

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.050 
them has a runt cell I'll probably put
it<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.909> pack<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.659> know

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060

balance charge and look at this
connector<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.090> could<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.290> plug<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.710> in

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
connector I could have just plug this in

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.660 
connector I could have just plug this in
and<00:01:53.280> things<00:01:53.549> would<00:01:53.700> weren't<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.390> wrong

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
and things would weren't really wrong

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.660 
and things would weren't really wrong
all<00:01:56.670> my<00:01:56.729> other<00:01:57.090> ones<00:01:57.299> are<00:01:57.450> Dean<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:59.100> bullet

bullet<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:04.310> look<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:06.200> positive<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
bullet and look at that positive and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.690 
bullet and look at that positive and
negative<00:02:07.649> or<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.459> side

if<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.569> just<00:02:10.780> hook<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.080> up<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.470> board

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
if I just hook that up to this board

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.140 
if I just hook that up to this board
with<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.130> rest<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.459> them<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.910> would<00:02:13.060> have

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
with the rest of them that would have

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.420 
with the rest of them that would have
been<00:02:13.270> bad<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:14.860> one<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.010> them<00:02:15.160> things<00:02:15.340> you

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
been bad so it's one of them things you

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.880 
been bad so it's one of them things you
get<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.610> check<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:17.170> gonna<00:02:17.290> cross<00:02:17.680> this

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
get a check I'm gonna cross this

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.100 
get a check I'm gonna cross this
polarity<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.819> they're<00:02:19.450> gonna<00:02:19.569> look<00:02:19.870> like

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
polarity so they're gonna look like

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.110 
polarity so they're gonna look like
they're<00:02:20.319> different<00:02:20.739> but<00:02:21.099> it'll<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.700> right

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.940 

okay<00:02:25.120> we<00:02:25.360> have<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> rat's<00:02:25.780> nest<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.260> wires<00:02:26.470> but

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950

little charging port so I can plug it to
my<00:03:05.620> balanced<00:03:05.950> leads<00:03:06.660> okay<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.810> first<00:03:07.930> thing<00:03:08.080> I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
my balanced leads okay the first thing I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.170 
my balanced leads okay the first thing I
did<00:03:08.410> was<00:03:08.590> cut<00:03:09.160> two<00:03:09.340> little<00:03:09.580> pieces<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.940> heat

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
did was cut two little pieces of heat

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.970 
did was cut two little pieces of heat
shrink<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.780> I'm<00:03:11.260> gonna<00:03:11.410> slip<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.769> over<00:03:11.830> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
shrink and I'm gonna slip it over the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.370 
shrink and I'm gonna slip it over the
wiring<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:12.790> after<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.299> solder<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.840> can<00:03:14.140> heat<00:03:14.350> it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
wiring so after I solder I can heat it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.789 
wiring so after I solder I can heat it
down<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.980> cover<00:03:15.549> up<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.820> contacts<00:03:16.709> there<00:03:17.709> you

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
down and cover up the contacts there you

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.890 
down and cover up the contacts there you
have<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.100> easy<00:03:18.220> enough<00:03:18.510> two-second<00:03:19.510> job<00:03:19.540> we're

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
have it easy enough two-second job we're

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.599 
have it easy enough two-second job we're
done<00:03:20.049> I'm<00:03:20.320> gonna<00:03:20.440> slip<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.070> heat<00:03:21.220> shrink<00:03:21.489> over

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
done I'm gonna slip the heat shrink over

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.180 
done I'm gonna slip the heat shrink over
it<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.030> eat<00:03:22.329> it<00:03:22.359> down<00:03:22.570> real<00:03:22.750> quick<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.290> we're

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
it and eat it down real quick and we're

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.479 
it and eat it down real quick and we're
on<00:03:24.280> our<00:03:24.459> way<00:03:25.709> all<00:03:26.709> right<00:03:26.769> it's<00:03:26.980> still<00:03:27.220> waiting

it<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.150> I'm<00:03:34.209> gonna<00:03:34.359> start<00:03:34.600> using<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.140> to

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
it and I'm gonna start using it to

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.569 
it and I'm gonna start using it to
solder<00:03:36.280> with<00:03:36.579> see<00:03:37.420> how<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.600> works<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:39.040> there

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
solder with see how it works and there

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.729 
solder with see how it works and there

them I'm gonna heat it down now these
are<00:03:48.160> easier<00:03:48.609> to<00:03:48.670> work<00:03:48.850> with<00:03:49.090> them<00:03:49.269> Dean<00:03:49.450> so

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
are easier to work with them Dean so

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.060 
are easier to work with them Dean so
it's<00:03:49.870> for<00:03:50.049> sure

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
it's for sure

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.250 
it's for sure
still<00:03:51.880> not<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.209> easiest<00:03:52.480> thing<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.810> solder

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
still not the easiest thing to solder

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.780 
still not the easiest thing to solder
especially<00:03:53.980> for<00:03:54.160> somebody<00:03:54.430> that's<00:03:54.519> got<00:03:54.730> a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
especially for somebody that's got a

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.009 
especially for somebody that's got a
cheap<00:03:55.329> tiny<00:03:55.989> little<00:03:56.200> iron<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.859> I<00:03:57.989> kind<00:03:58.989> of

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
cheap tiny little iron and I kind of

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.750 
cheap tiny little iron and I kind of
have<00:03:59.140> like<00:03:59.170> a<00:03:59.319> little<00:03:59.530> jerry-rigged<00:04:00.310> set<00:04:00.640> up

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
have like a little jerry-rigged set up

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.599 
have like a little jerry-rigged set up
it's<00:04:00.910> not<00:04:01.090> really<00:04:01.299> professional<00:04:01.799> but<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:03.130> got

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
it's not really professional but I got

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.970 
it's not really professional but I got
it<00:04:03.700> done<00:04:03.819> and<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.540> works<00:04:04.690> well<00:04:05.470> I<00:04:05.530> was<00:04:05.709> planning

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
it done and it works well I was planning

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.800 
it done and it works well I was planning
on<00:04:06.010> heat<00:04:06.250> shrinking<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:06.850> pack<00:04:07.180> but<00:04:07.480> my<00:04:07.630> heat

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
on heat shrinking this pack but my heat

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.509 
on heat shrinking this pack but my heat
shrink<00:04:08.109> was<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.290> little<00:04:08.530> too<00:04:08.709> large<00:04:09.040> so

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
shrink was a little too large so

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.910 
shrink was a little too large so
wouldn't<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.030> shrunk<00:04:10.480> down<00:04:10.690> all<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.959> way<00:04:11.079> so<00:04:11.889> I

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
wouldn't a shrunk down all the way so I

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.289 
wouldn't a shrunk down all the way so I
just<00:04:11.980> lightly<00:04:12.340> taped<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.970> up<00:04:13.060> with<00:04:13.180> some

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
just lightly taped it up with some

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.910 
just lightly taped it up with some
electrical<00:04:13.720> tape<00:04:13.780> I'm<00:04:14.380> not<00:04:14.500> too<00:04:14.650> worried

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
electrical tape I'm not too worried

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.349 
electrical tape I'm not too worried
about<00:04:14.980> this<00:04:15.220> pack<00:04:15.459> because<00:04:15.730> it's<00:04:15.940> kind<00:04:16.150> of<00:04:16.209> a

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
about this pack because it's kind of a

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.860 
about this pack because it's kind of a
recovered<00:04:17.079> pack<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.880> got<00:04:19.120> some<00:04:19.330> puff<00:04:19.539> cells

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
recovered pack it's got some puff cells

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.529 
recovered pack it's got some puff cells
in<00:04:20.080> it<00:04:20.229> that<00:04:20.620> are<00:04:20.799> still<00:04:21.220> working<00:04:22.060> they're

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
in it that are still working they're

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.310 
in it that are still working they're
just<00:04:22.750> like

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
just like

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.680 
just like
we<00:04:23.410> puffed<00:04:23.710> but<00:04:24.520> they<00:04:25.120> can<00:04:25.210> probably<00:04:25.390> still

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
we puffed but they can probably still

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.070 
we puffed but they can probably still
get<00:04:25.810> about<00:04:25.990> six<00:04:26.320> or<00:04:26.470> eight<00:04:27.420> months<00:04:28.420> out<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.990> it

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
get about six or eight months out of it

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.190 
get about six or eight months out of it
maybe<00:04:29.340> let's<00:04:30.340> see<00:04:30.490> how<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.640> goes

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
maybe let's see how it goes

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.540 
maybe let's see how it goes
all<00:04:32.200> right<00:04:32.470> batteries<00:04:32.980> are<00:04:33.130> just<00:04:33.580> about<00:04:33.790> done

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
all right batteries are just about done

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.760 
all right batteries are just about done
and<00:04:36.660> look<00:04:37.660> at<00:04:37.720> this<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:38.050> have<00:04:38.080> my<00:04:38.350> soldering

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
and look at this I have my soldering

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:54.499 
and look at this I have my soldering
iron<00:04:38.830> plugged<00:04:39.430> in<00:04:40.770> see<00:04:41.770> if<00:04:41.890> it's<00:04:42.070> getting<00:04:42.250> hot

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.700 

my<00:04:55.050> packs<00:04:55.319> pretty<00:04:55.620> much<00:04:55.800> dead<00:04:56.129> but<00:04:57.559> I'm<00:04:58.559> gonna

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
my packs pretty much dead but I'm gonna

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.439 
my packs pretty much dead but I'm gonna
try<00:04:58.979> and<00:04:59.129> solder<00:04:59.340> something<00:04:59.819> with<00:04:59.969> it<00:05:00.120> oh<00:05:00.210> yeah

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
try and solder something with it oh yeah

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:01.999 
try and solder something with it oh yeah
it's<00:05:00.629> eaten<00:05:00.809> up<00:05:00.930> now<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.409> works<00:05:01.590> pretty<00:05:01.740> good

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
it's eaten up now that works pretty good

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.070 
it's eaten up now that works pretty good
so<00:05:02.639> I've<00:05:02.759> been<00:05:02.849> plugged<00:05:03.150> in<00:05:03.240> for<00:05:03.419> maybe<00:05:03.719> 20

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
so I've been plugged in for maybe 20

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.799 
so I've been plugged in for maybe 20
seconds<00:05:05.749> okay<00:05:06.749> I<00:05:06.779> have<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.139> four<00:05:07.830> cell<00:05:08.129> packs

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:08.809 
seconds okay I have the four cell packs

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:13.429 
seconds okay I have the four cell packs
all<00:05:09.809> wired<00:05:10.529> up<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.069> I<00:05:11.960> broke<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.139> bullet

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:13.439 
all wired up and I broke the bullet

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.320 
all wired up and I broke the bullet
housings<00:05:13.889> and<00:05:14.189> plugged<00:05:14.939> them<00:05:15.089> all<00:05:15.150> together

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
housings and plugged them all together

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.309 
housings and plugged them all together
in<00:05:15.629> series

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
in series

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.279 
in series
I<00:05:16.490> throw<00:05:17.490> two<00:05:17.699> zip<00:05:18.120> ties<00:05:18.360> around<00:05:18.599> them<00:05:18.990> and

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
I throw two zip ties around them and

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.989 
I throw two zip ties around them and
then<00:05:19.499> I<00:05:19.529> just<00:05:19.620> put<00:05:20.009> some<00:05:20.039> tape<00:05:20.339> over<00:05:20.520> those<00:05:20.789> zip

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:20.999 
then I just put some tape over those zip

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:22.369 
then I just put some tape over those zip
ties<00:05:21.029> so<00:05:21.419> they<00:05:21.539> kind<00:05:21.749> of<00:05:21.809> stay<00:05:21.990> in<00:05:22.050> place<00:05:22.349> and

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
ties so they kind of stay in place and

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.459 
ties so they kind of stay in place and
they're<00:05:22.740> all<00:05:22.860> flat<00:05:23.309> laying<00:05:23.819> together<00:05:23.999> and<00:05:24.779> as

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
they're all flat laying together and as

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.040 
they're all flat laying together and as
you<00:05:25.559> can<00:05:25.680> see<00:05:25.740> they're<00:05:26.129> all<00:05:26.569> just<00:05:27.569> around<00:05:27.810> four

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
you can see they're all just around four

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.439 
you can see they're all just around four
point<00:05:28.289> one<00:05:28.409> volts<00:05:28.439> per<00:05:28.979> cell<00:05:29.219> I<00:05:29.520> didn't<00:05:30.330> want

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
point one volts per cell I didn't want

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.920 
point one volts per cell I didn't want
to<00:05:30.509> top<00:05:30.659> them<00:05:30.810> off<00:05:30.870> too<00:05:31.080> much<00:05:32.599> well<00:05:33.599> don't<00:05:33.810> ask

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
to top them off too much well don't ask

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.869 
to top them off too much well don't ask
me<00:05:34.080> how<00:05:34.319> but<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:34.830> made<00:05:35.129> it<00:05:35.159> all<00:05:35.339> the<00:05:35.490> way<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.639> work

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:35.879 
me how but I made it all the way to work

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.320 
me how but I made it all the way to work
