00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
point of view I think that one of the

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.919 
point of view I think that one of the
things<00:01:33.429> that<00:01:33.700> Michael<00:01:33.939> Patrick<00:01:34.270> did<00:01:34.630> when<00:01:34.840> he

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
things that Michael Patrick did when he

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.050 
things that Michael Patrick did when he
took<00:01:35.049> over<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.500> show<00:01:35.710> was<00:01:36.039> he<00:01:36.250> started<00:01:36.490> hiring

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
took over the show was he started hiring

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.779 
took over the show was he started hiring
a<00:01:37.119> lot<00:01:37.240> of<00:01:37.299> female<00:01:37.689> writers<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.229> we<00:01:38.380> had<00:01:38.590> I<00:01:38.890> kept

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
a lot of female writers so we had I kept

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.090 
a lot of female writers so we had I kept
six<00:01:40.149> or<00:01:40.390> seven<00:01:40.780> female<00:01:41.259> writers<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.799> he<00:01:41.950> was

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
six or seven female writers and he was

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.120 
six or seven female writers and he was
the<00:01:42.219> only<00:01:42.250> male<00:01:42.700> writer<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.359> I<00:01:44.140> think<00:01:44.799> even

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
the only male writer and I think even

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.249 
the only male writer and I think even
though<00:01:45.490> outrageous<00:01:46.329> things<00:01:46.600> would<00:01:46.840> happen<00:01:47.020> on

though outrageous things would happen on

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.929 
though outrageous things would happen on
the<00:01:47.350> show<00:01:47.380> people<00:01:47.979> are<00:01:48.070> surprised<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.789> hear

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
the show people are surprised to hear

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.989 
the show people are surprised to hear
this<00:01:49.119> but<00:01:49.329> they<00:01:49.899> were<00:01:49.929> all<00:01:50.320> taken<00:01:51.009> from<00:01:51.429> things

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
this but they were all taken from things
