00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.590 

it's<00:04:43.980> called<00:04:44.310> perani's<00:04:44.910> Thai<00:04:45.150> food<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.540> I

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
it's called perani's Thai food and I

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.120 
it's called perani's Thai food and I
would<00:04:45.780> assume<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.380> lady<00:04:46.590> who<00:04:46.740> runs<00:04:46.890> its

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
would assume that the lady who runs its

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.100 
would assume that the lady who runs its
name<00:04:47.280> is<00:04:47.430> prani<00:04:47.760> but<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.090> never<00:04:48.270> actually<00:04:48.390> asked

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
name is prani but I never actually asked

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.870 
name is prani but I never actually asked
and<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.560> guess<00:04:49.830> it's<00:04:50.040> possible<00:04:50.220> that<00:04:50.640> means

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
and I guess it's possible that means

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.960 
and I guess it's possible that means
some<00:04:51.150> other<00:04:51.450> word<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.020> tie<00:04:52.230> oh<00:04:55.490> nice<00:04:56.490> day<00:04:56.700> and
