hey guys. so today want to make a video about

00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:12.351
how to clean and flatten your whetstonesso

00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:12.851
so what I use to clean and flatten my whetstones 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.640
is this glass plate 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.700
its notmal float glass, its 8 mm thick 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.240
and you can buy it at any glass store

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:27.962
what I also use is this carborundum powder

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:32.698
Carbonpowder is used for polishing and grinding natural stone

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:33.198
like this one.

00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:36.956
you can buy it on an online webshop

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:37.456
that's what I did

00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:41.773
But maybe if your lucky you can find it at a local store. 

00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:47.174
so you just pore some of the powder on the glass plate.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.020
not to much

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.680
this is about enough...

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:54.578
you also add some water

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.700
and then I like to spread out the water first. 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.180
then you can start grinding.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.654
When you start grinding, its important that you use the complete surface of the glass

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:13.709
because If you only use the middle.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:14.953
It will only wear in the middle.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.960
and that will cause your glass to wear in a concave shape.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.797
so use the complete surface of the glass for the best result over time

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.020
you can apply quite some pressure to your whetstone. 

00:01:37.473 --> 00:01:41.393
press it down good so that your stone will get nice and flat. 

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:51.333
there you go, you can already see a big difference.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.833
its getting lighter, but the deep groove is still there. 

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.806
and we want the groove to be gone. 

00:01:56.806 --> 00:01:57.306
so we just continue grinding. 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.519
and there you have it guys, a clean, ready to use whetstone / sharpening stone.

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.020
that was my video, I hope you've enjoyed watching.
