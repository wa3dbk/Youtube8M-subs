00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.390 
going down bad paths but with Sammy
they've<00:04:07.019> been<00:04:07.200> able<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.500> see<00:04:07.709> someone<00:04:07.980> who<00:04:08.250> has

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
they've been able to see someone who has

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.819 
they've been able to see someone who has
made<00:04:08.609> bad<00:04:08.849> decisions<00:04:08.879> and<00:04:09.690> then<00:04:10.049> come<00:04:10.799> back

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
made bad decisions and then come back

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.640 
made bad decisions and then come back
from<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:12.569> it's<00:04:12.900> really<00:04:13.140> torn<00:04:13.470> down

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
from that and so it's really torn down

from that and so it's really torn down
some<00:04:13.890> walls<00:04:14.099> for<00:04:14.579> them<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:16.079> think<00:04:16.139> having
