speaker number nine number nine number

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.590 
speaker number nine number nine number
nine

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
nine

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
nine
yeah<00:02:35.930> Yoko<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.680> other<00:02:36.830> speaker<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.580> know

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
yeah Yoko and the other speaker you know

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.560 
yeah Yoko and the other speaker you know
doing<00:02:39.620> whatever<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.850> hated<00:02:41.300> the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
doing whatever I so I hated the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.330 
doing whatever I so I hated the
isolation<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.380> their<00:02:42.560> early<00:02:42.950> stereo

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
isolation of their early stereo

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.960 
isolation of their early stereo
recordings<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.320> think<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.980> model<00:02:46.250> set<00:02:46.730> is

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
recordings so I think the model set is

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.660 
recordings so I think the model set is
just<00:02:47.209> amazing<00:02:47.840> in<00:02:48.530> terms<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.980> its<00:02:49.130> fidelity

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
just amazing in terms of its fidelity

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.460 
just amazing in terms of its fidelity
and<00:02:49.880> in<00:02:50.660> terms<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.230> want<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.620> get<00:02:53.320> true<00:02:54.320> to

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
and in terms of you want to get true to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.670 
and in terms of you want to get true to
the<00:02:54.590> source<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.100> what<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.430> was<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:57.170> just<00:02:57.440> lets

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
the source of what it was it just lets

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.320 
the source of what it was it just lets
you<00:02:57.770> relive<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.400> especially<00:02:58.910> for<00:02:59.060> older

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
and I think we alluded to that in our

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.509 
and I think we alluded to that in our
first<00:03:20.390> vinyl<00:03:20.810> versus<00:03:21.470> city<00:03:21.709> video<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.400> know

yeah I think there's something to be
said<00:03:24.290> about<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.860> experience<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.700> actually
