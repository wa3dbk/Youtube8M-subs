to<00:00:54.210> negate<00:00:54.629> magic<00:00:54.930> damage<00:00:55.050> than<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to negate magic damage than there is and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.630 
to negate magic damage than there is and
it<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.070> physical

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880 
any kill is played the reason why I
prefer<00:01:39.270> execution<00:01:40.020> over<00:01:40.079> killers<00:01:40.500> played<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
prefer execution over killers played is

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.889 
prefer execution over killers played is
because<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.820> try<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.030> execute<00:01:42.420> someone

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
because if you try to execute someone

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.539 
because if you try to execute someone
who<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.560> twenty<00:01:43.860> seven<00:01:44.130> percent<00:01:44.250> or

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
who is that twenty seven percent or

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.560 
who is that twenty seven percent or
twenty<00:01:44.759> six<00:01:44.909> percent<00:01:45.030> health<00:01:45.390> with

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
twenty six percent health with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
twenty six percent health with
executioner<00:01:46.259> you'll<00:01:46.799> probably<00:01:47.100> kill<00:01:47.520> them

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
executioner you'll probably kill them

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.490 
executioner you'll probably kill them
but<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.390> try<00:01:48.600> executing<00:01:48.899> someone<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
but if you try executing someone that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.520 
but if you try executing someone that
26.7%<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.549> killers<00:01:50.820> blade<00:01:51.350> kills<00:01:52.350> blade

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
26.7% with killers blade kills blade

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.639 
26.7% with killers blade kills blade
will<00:01:52.710> not<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.759> damage<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.840> ante<00:01:55.259> execute

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
will not do the damage the ante execute

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.020 
will not do the damage the ante execute
damage<00:01:55.890> you'll<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> initial<00:01:56.640> two<00:01:56.790> four

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
damage you'll do the initial two four

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.240 
damage you'll do the initial two four
five<00:01:57.180> eight<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.140> might<00:01:58.259> crit<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.159> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
five eight and it might crit but it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.160 
five eight and it might crit but it
won't<00:01:59.490> kill<00:01:59.729> your<00:01:59.939> opponent<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.930> really

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
won't kill your opponent so it really

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.380 
won't kill your opponent so it really
requires<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> skill<00:02:02.790> shot<00:02:03.090> with

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
requires you to have a skill shot with

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.270 
requires you to have a skill shot with
killers<00:02:03.689> blade<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.439> where<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> time

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
killers blade to where you have to time

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.639 
killers blade to where you have to time
it<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.520> where<00:02:05.729> they're<00:02:05.909> under<00:02:06.119> 25%<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.380> thing

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
it to where they're under 25% the thing

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.290 
it to where they're under 25% the thing
about<00:02:07.860> today's<00:02:08.129> meta<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.580> people<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.119> lower

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
about today's meta is people have lower

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
about today's meta is people have lower
health<00:02:09.569> nowadays<00:02:10.110> they<00:02:10.619> lowered<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> health

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
health nowadays they lowered the health

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.650 
health nowadays they lowered the health
pool<00:02:11.400> people<00:02:11.640> are<00:02:11.730> running<00:02:11.910> around<00:02:11.970> 20k

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
pool people are running around 20k

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.490 
pool people are running around 20k
health<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:13.020> average

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
health on average

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.700 
health on average
so<00:02:13.860> when<00:02:14.340> someone<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.760> at<00:02:14.880> 25%<00:02:15.720> health<00:02:15.870> most<00:02:16.530> of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
so when someone is at 25% health most of

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.160 
so when someone is at 25% health most of
the<00:02:16.800> time<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.300> actually<00:02:18.420> kill<00:02:18.780> them<00:02:19.020> with

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the time you can actually kill them with

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.540 
the time you can actually kill them with
a<00:02:19.200> surprise<00:02:19.560> attack<00:02:19.740> instead<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.490> me

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
a surprise attack instead of a me

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
gonna pick one that allows me to execute

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.510 
gonna pick one that allows me to execute
them<00:02:30.690> outside<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.440> 25%<00:02:31.950> range<00:02:32.310> at<00:02:32.490> least

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
them outside of the 25% range at least

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.040 
them outside of the 25% range at least
be<00:02:32.820> able<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:33.120> some<00:02:33.360> execute<00:02:33.780> damage

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
because at that point it's no longer a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.220 
because at that point it's no longer a
skill<00:02:37.890> shot<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.400> you're<00:02:39.060> able<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.660> kind<00:02:40.140> of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
overshoot it by a little bit and if you

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.460 
overshoot it by a little bit and if you
miss<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.780> execute<00:02:43.020> again<00:02:43.290> they're<00:02:43.410> gonna

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
miss you can execute again they're gonna

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.230 
miss you can execute again they're gonna
be<00:02:43.650> really<00:02:43.860> low<00:02:43.950> health<00:02:44.160> by<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.340> time<00:02:44.610> if<00:02:44.940> you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.460 
if you like try to execute them at 33%
health<00:02:47.490> they'll<00:02:47.970> drop<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.330> 5%<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.380> they're
