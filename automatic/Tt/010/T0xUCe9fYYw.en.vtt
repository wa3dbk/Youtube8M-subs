00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.020 
some some other activity I guess white
the<00:01:52.649> video<00:01:52.920> away<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.729> how<00:01:53.759> it's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the video away and you can see how it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.429 
the video away and you can see how it's
still<00:01:54.240> running<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:54.689> I'm<00:01:54.810> swiping<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
still running when I'm swiping it the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.300 
still running when I'm swiping it the
way<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.790> can

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
way and then I can

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.730 
way and then I can
I<00:01:58.369> can<00:01:58.970> find<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.299> video<00:01:59.600> in<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.960> in<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.619> in

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
I can find the video in the in the in

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.120 
I can find the video in the in the in
the<00:02:01.009> last<00:02:01.310> urban<00:02:02.240> applications<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:03.890> i<00:02:03.979> was

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
the last urban applications that i was

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.179 
the last urban applications that i was
using<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:05.570> is<00:02:05.689> basically<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:07.039> very

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
using so this is basically the very

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.309 
using so this is basically the very
basics<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.909> opening<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.780> UI<00:02:09.020> it's

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
basics of the opening of the UI it's

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.220 
basics of the opening of the UI it's
very<00:02:09.979> intuitive<00:02:10.399> very<00:02:11.360> easy<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.810> learn<00:02:11.989> it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
very intuitive very easy to learn it

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.720 
very intuitive very easy to learn it
takes<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.530> like<00:02:12.650> five<00:02:12.920> seconds<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.400> figure<00:02:13.550> it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
takes you like five seconds to figure it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.809 
takes you like five seconds to figure it
out<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.680> once<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.830> get<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.069> idea<00:02:16.099> of<00:02:16.370> swiping

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
out and once you get the idea of swiping

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.330 
out and once you get the idea of swiping
it<00:02:16.970> comes<00:02:17.209> very<00:02:17.450> naturally<00:02:18.080> with<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> device

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
it comes very naturally with the device

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.290 
it comes very naturally with the device
so

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
so

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.570 
so
I<00:02:21.390> think<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:22.530> are<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:23.190> be<00:02:23.280> using

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
I think you know we are to be using

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.610 
I think you know we are to be using
authority<00:02:24.060> quite<00:02:24.630> some<00:02:24.840> time<00:02:24.990> internally

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
authority quite some time internally

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.300 
authority quite some time internally
we've<00:02:25.710> been<00:02:25.860> polishing<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.400> making<00:02:26.670> food<00:02:26.910> and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
we've been polishing and making food and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.760 
we've been polishing and making food and
we<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.580> love
