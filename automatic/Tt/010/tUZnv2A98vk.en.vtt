00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:10.890
 Hey-this time a and b and stroke empty pick Hen introduction video of it 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.280
 I think that I want to do explanatory video 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:17.610
 so 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.610
 The rhythm I should aim for is yeah 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.690
 The rhythm 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.980
 To 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.670
 here 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.779
 It is a pick because it is a theme 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.070
 It is necessary to say that the handle pick is empty 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.070
 It is to say to 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:45.100
 First of all I'd have an appointment it is because er first person to draw the 8 beat 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.300
 8 This I pump 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.250
 For example 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.650
 Eighth note schools I call you worked rhythm of you that are playing now Te side-by-side 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.710
 Facing the only one 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.690
 Have the previous sound twice 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.490
 Dow at 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.810
 To the back of the Application 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.100
 I'll back up and go up 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.990
 so 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.170
 It is based on this 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.560
 Suddenly 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 Yup 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.400
 Up day 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.650
 The basic arm swing of 8 beats 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:30.000
 I will complete it from here 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.000
 Depending on the take off the sound to pick from 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620
 Yup 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.430
 And so 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 To the fact that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.400
 That -the rhythm 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.400
 I tried writing on the whiteboard 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.030
 Talk about picking down 1 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.280
 Turn up and go 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.520
 I said that I would like to 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:07.070
 I thought it was a sound that I thought was down and the back was up, etc. 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.130
 It is only this pump 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.840
 It's in water , my fault and that thing 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.130
 How is this picking so big and how big is it? 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.850
 For example, down up down down up down up 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.950
 It becomes picking of junkari 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.920
 You 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.920
 There are people who will answer, but that is a mistake 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.080
 The notes hidden here 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.080
 There is a reason 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:56.140
 I think that I did not draw that I wrote here with the dotted line in 2.3 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.950
 Cuffed notes go to 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.460
 Located on the back of the first night and the head of the third night 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:08.670
 And a down-up-down-up-down up turn up by adding this 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.569
 Become a regular inset rhythm 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.700
 so 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.480
 These 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.580
 Is it a pickled animal? 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.780
 Does the swaying of the sky give rise to the previous rhythm ? 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.780
 Well then 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.980
 Pick from 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:35.350
 I can not play while saying that I should be aware of the pick and play 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:41.810
 It is better than being aware of the pick 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:43.500
 Force the order of picking where the actual draw 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.110
 If you pull 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.780
 If you say 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:54.120
 I think I will be able to play relatively quickly 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.850
 For example, if this is down down up up town up 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.520
 The rhythm also called Janjajaja 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:07.630
 This is already done if it is ticked, but I'm already conscious-down-up up-down 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.580
 Because it is in the up, it is not 100 point perfect score yet 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.880
 It is not possible to play 8 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:18.560
 You are doing it gradually and it is already money 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:22.500
 I will remember already Oh here I am picking now empty 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:27.120
 It is understood that it is empty picking here and there 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.300
 When we bring awareness to pick from thing which we did when we understood 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.300
 so 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:38.380
 For example , empty picking in various places 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:43.849
 You can play or create various rhythms by bringing it 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:48.249
 An empty picking it is that What 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:51.339
 It's time to play It's the first time you play 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:56.769
 Instead of consciousness - 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:59.610
 Down-down up-down Up-down up-down order to play in this rhythm 

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:04.669
 Speaking of doing it 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.669
 About that often works well 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:13.279
 Please try doing it to practice with us 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:13.279
 Yes this time thank you for being more than
