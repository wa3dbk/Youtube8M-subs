00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:16.320
 good the next set by the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.830
 which is a counterpoint for teeth 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.340
 sir which allows to administer the network 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.340
 internal 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.359
 thanks to the user can also 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.829
 work with the microsoft filters of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.350
 web pages to civilize power and good 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.350
 next we have for example 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.390
 well in this video we will see what is a 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.430
 firewall 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.040
 for windows clients 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.680
 we have set the fret network one 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.659
 good job in coming out makes internet 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.549
 in the flashlight 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.590
 we must also assign the address 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.020
 ip and the name of the pseudo 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.020
 that constellation of outside 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.869
 but we're not going 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.869
 to the disk and we execute 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.820
 there we have the main menu suddenly 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.619
 administration which we will start with 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.900
 for easy installation to run 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.690
 the windows 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.850
 of this crisis and we will move on to the second 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.750
 vassilis run the tool 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.800
 release to help next 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.760
 we accept the license 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.150
 next next and we hope that 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.110
 finish installing the requirements 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.370
 specific for the installation of 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.030
 inside 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.230
 good studies will be based on two parts 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.850
 a workshop during installation 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.130
 we will have to start the series the table 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.780
 we would look to show it and then 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.270
 installation by the deputation week 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.290
 about half an hour 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.190
 in the report also in asia for 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.190
 present it in the video 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.800
 the good one was a fund we downloaded from the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.990
 microsoft page 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.730
 no one we all want the moon is primary 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.960
 At least we have the possibility of 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.950
 download it 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.590
 download the startup version 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.849
 well start to set up good versus 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.420
 you see them on the network firewall between 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:44.380
 attractive internal 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.739
 with the owner of the internet network for 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.739
 rollerblading 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.300
 and everyone 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.980
 extremely safe floor 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.030
 and you can keep several technologies 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.130
 for the good firewall we put it 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.510
 start the existing attraction of a 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.510
 efficient way and we are 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.900
 we hope that in that habitat 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.650
 As you can see, it takes a while 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.040
 in our installation 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.810
 we're 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.370
 installation assistant inside 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.780
 for this we give next 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.780
 they accepted the losses 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.410
 good the product of a small cut 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.280
 to show the heras 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.280
 we give you next 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.740
 and says specify the interval 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.160
 address they use for the internal network 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:07.030
 but we are not going to add 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.850
 long in that the internal network that is 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.470
 bad 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:16.280
 today we select it, we accept it 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.950
 We accept and following 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.950
 next install 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:30.680
 the next nothing more with the 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.690
 relevant configuration for each 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.400
 we will live in the video what 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.430
 we will enjoy because the collections 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.990
 ready is to emulate your rest so 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.259
 We would return won when 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.259
 all finished
