00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
alright now this is news to me because I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.630 
alright now this is news to me because I
was<00:00:37.050> under<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> impression<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.770> HBO<00:00:38.370> had

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
was under the impression that HBO had

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.900 
was under the impression that HBO had
this<00:00:38.820> deal<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.420> Donna<00:00:39.719> Stevenson<00:00:40.700> but<00:00:41.700> in

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
this deal with Donna Stevenson but in

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.450 
this deal with Donna Stevenson but in
the<00:00:42.059> deal<00:00:42.239> he<00:00:42.450> would<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.930> fight<00:00:43.469> Koval<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the deal he would have to fight Koval of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.459 
the deal he would have to fight Koval of
I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.570> part<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> deal<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I think that was part of the deal and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.500 
I think that was part of the deal and
then<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:47.789> mistaken<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.980> guess<00:00:50.510> he

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
then if I'm not mistaken so I guess he

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.600
