watching the Canadiens in the 70s and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400 
watching the Canadiens in the 70s and
you<00:00:11.400> know<00:00:11.519> even<00:00:12.330> though<00:00:12.599> Vancouver<00:00:13.110> had<00:00:13.230> come

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
you know even though Vancouver had come

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.779 
you know even though Vancouver had come
into<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.889> league<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:16.400> it<00:00:17.400> was<00:00:17.609> pretty

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
into the league in it it was pretty

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.359 
into the league in it it was pretty
difficult<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.779> kind<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.140> identify<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:20.340> that

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
difficult to kind of identify with that

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.580 
difficult to kind of identify with that
when<00:00:20.820> you'd<00:00:20.970> grown<00:00:21.240> up<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.840> much<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.470> know

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
identifying with that team in that era

and I guess really I just kind of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
and I guess really I just kind of
remained<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.119> Habs<00:00:30.330> fan<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:31.019> whole<00:00:31.170> life
