00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.053
Holding a date in my hand, my mouth its destination

00:00:13.053 --> 00:00:18.005
Realizing the feeling - humility, appreciation

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.062
The date is such a mercy

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:23.019
Created by Allah only for us

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:29.023
Like the dew at dawn, my heart unfurls to infinity

00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:39.003
Your Love lifts me to the greatest of heights

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.002
and the sun shining from your Eyes is never setting

00:01:59.027 --> 00:01:59.077
Grant me more rizq (sustenance)

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.030
And make me be more like

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.029
Those who believe

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:07.055
Even though my efforts aren't up to par

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:09.087
Missed my prayers a couple times

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:13.049
When the devil whispers to my heart

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.045
So I get high off this world

00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:17.001
But I will still/always return (to Your path)

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.093
The courteous one is lucky

00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:22.074
The discourteous is unlucky

00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:25.005
Holding my hands up high, the sky I'm facing

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:28.059
Only Allah on my mind, the only one judging

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:32.060
For mercy I'm begging for all that I do

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.018
Because only Allah gives mercy to you
