00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
of software and I use a lot for creating

of software and I use a lot for creating
plans<00:00:46.230> before<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.649> go<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:46.860> into<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> shop

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
now that mark is working on a steamer

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
now that mark is working on a steamer
trunk<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.280> based<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.640> some<00:00:53.699> plants

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
trunk that it was based on some plants

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.049 
trunk that it was based on some plants
he<00:00:54.210> got<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:54.570> Rockler<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.800> plans<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.910> they

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
he got from Rockler the plans as they

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.420 
he got from Rockler the plans as they
came<00:00:57.210> from<00:00:57.390> Rockler<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> curved<00:00:58.680> top<00:00:58.980> on

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
came from Rockler have a curved top on

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.549 
came from Rockler have a curved top on
the<00:00:59.850> top<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> trunk<00:01:00.449> Mark's<00:01:01.289> actually

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the top of the trunk Mark's actually

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
the top of the trunk Mark's actually
going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> change<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> little<00:01:02.160> bit<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
going to change that a little bit and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.369 
going to change that a little bit and
have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> flat<00:01:03.300> top<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.840> thought<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
have a flat top so I thought it was a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.920 
have a flat top so I thought it was a
good<00:01:04.589> opportunity<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.630> sort<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.750> show<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
good opportunity to sort of show a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
good opportunity to sort of show a
little<00:01:07.110> bit<00:01:07.260> about<00:01:07.320> Sketchup<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:08.100> gonna

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
little bit about Sketchup I'm gonna

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.270 
little bit about Sketchup I'm gonna
model<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.810> new<00:01:10.409> top<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.100> whole

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
model the the new top not the whole

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.450 
model the the new top not the whole
trunk<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> top<00:01:13.010> at<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> end<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
trunk but just the top at the end of the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.890 
trunk but just the top at the end of the
exercise<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:15.540> should<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
exercise we should have all the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
details that we would need to actually

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.330 
details that we would need to actually
go<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.380> into<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> chef's<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.009> make<00:01:20.159> the

just going to trace the top of this
trunk<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.619> create<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> rectangle<00:01:53.490> that's<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
trunk and create a rectangle that's the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.510 
trunk and create a rectangle that's the
the<00:01:54.210> right<00:01:54.420> size<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.070> spirit<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the right size you know in the spirit of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
the right size you know in the spirit of
getting<00:01:56.850> rid<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.090> your<00:01:57.240> tape<00:01:57.450> measure<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.930> Mark

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
getting rid of your tape measure as Mark

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.160 
getting rid of your tape measure as Mark
puts<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.820> we<00:01:59.820> want<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> trace<00:02:00.270> things<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.020> use

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
puts it we want to trace things and use

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.200 
puts it we want to trace things and use
use<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> Sketchup<00:02:01.920> model<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:02.579> much<00:02:03.090> as

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
use the Sketchup model as much as

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.300 
use the Sketchup model as much as
possible<00:02:03.530> using<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> move<00:02:04.799> tool<00:02:05.040> I'll

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
possible using the move tool I'll

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.809 
possible using the move tool I'll
actually<00:02:05.759> grab<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:07.220> rectangle<00:02:08.220> move<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
actually grab that rectangle move it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.639 
actually grab that rectangle move it
over<00:02:08.970> here<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> side<00:02:09.569> where<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.530> work

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
over here to the side where we can work

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.050 
over here to the side where we can work
with<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.129> without<00:02:11.370> worrying<00:02:11.670> about<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
with on it without worrying about the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.430 
with on it without worrying about the
rest<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
rest of the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.630 
rest of the
so<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.830> footprint<00:02:15.250> for<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.430> top<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
so this is the footprint for the top of

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.910 
so this is the footprint for the top of
the<00:02:15.790> trunk<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.360> dimensions<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.380> we'll<00:02:17.530> use

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the trunk the dimensions that we'll use

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.450 
the trunk the dimensions that we'll use
it<00:02:18.130> will<00:02:18.310> be<00:02:18.340> two<00:02:18.910> inches<00:02:19.150> tall<00:02:20.070> I'll<00:02:21.070> use<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
it will be two inches tall I'll use the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.530 
it will be two inches tall I'll use the
offset<00:02:21.610> tool<00:02:22.090> now<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:23.820> select<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:24.910> face<00:02:25.210> and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
offset tool now to select that face and

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.850 
offset tool now to select that face and
the<00:02:26.050> offset<00:02:26.320> tool<00:02:26.500> draws<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:28.290> parallel<00:02:29.290> line

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
the offset tool draws a parallel line

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.230 
the offset tool draws a parallel line
around<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> inside<00:02:30.670> or<00:02:30.880> actually<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
around the inside or actually the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.800 
around the inside or actually the
outside<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.170> face<00:02:33.130> or<00:02:33.460> another<00:02:33.880> shape<00:02:34.120> I'll

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
outside of a face or another shape I'll

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.020 
outside of a face or another shape I'll
bring<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.170> inside<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:36.040> type<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.310> 3/4

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
bring it inside and just type in 3/4

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.610 
bring it inside and just type in 3/4
because<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.500> outside<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:41.260> trunk<00:02:41.500> lid

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
because the outside of the the trunk lid

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.980 
because the outside of the the trunk lid
is<00:02:41.770> going<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.340> be<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.460> 3/4<00:02:42.880> inch<00:02:42.910> by<00:02:43.240> by<00:02:43.660> 2<00:02:43.720> inch

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
is going to be a 3/4 inch by by 2 inch

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.940 
is going to be a 3/4 inch by by 2 inch
high<00:02:44.490> frame<00:02:45.930> before<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.140> pull<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.710> all<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
high frame before I pull that all the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.150 
high frame before I pull that all the
way<00:02:48.040> up<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.340> what<00:02:48.670> I'll<00:02:48.760> do<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.980> get<00:02:50.980> rid<00:02:51.070> of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
way up the what I'll do is get rid of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.180 
way up the what I'll do is get rid of
that<00:02:51.310> inside<00:02:51.990> hit<00:02:52.990> delete<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.560> have<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:54.070> a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
that inside hit delete so we have just a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.670 
that inside hit delete so we have just a
sort<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.490> frame<00:02:54.730> here<00:02:55.290> I'll<00:02:56.290> go<00:02:56.440> ahead<00:02:56.500> and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
sort of a frame here I'll go ahead and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.380 
sort of a frame here I'll go ahead and
get<00:02:56.740> a<00:02:57.010> head<00:02:57.250> start<00:02:57.460> on<00:02:57.580> some<00:02:57.640> joinery<00:02:58.150> that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
get a head start on some joinery that

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.630 
get a head start on some joinery that
front<00:02:59.170> edge<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.830> going<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.070> be<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.220> separate

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
front edge is going to be a separate

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.470 
front edge is going to be a separate
piece<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:02.020> I<00:03:02.050> use<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.380> pencil<00:03:02.620> tool<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.010> draw<00:03:03.480> a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
piece so I use the pencil tool to draw a

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.710 
piece so I use the pencil tool to draw a
couple<00:03:04.810> lines<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:06.240> separate<00:03:07.240> us<00:03:07.330> now<00:03:07.480> if<00:03:07.630> I

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
couple lines and separate us now if I

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.880 
couple lines and separate us now if I
use<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.020> push/pull<00:03:08.230> tool<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:10.450> pull<00:03:11.260> up<00:03:11.500> to

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
use the push/pull tool and pull up to

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.570 
use the push/pull tool and pull up to
inches<00:03:12.340> it's<00:03:12.940> just<00:03:13.240> that<00:03:13.390> front<00:03:13.660> rail<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:15.490> can

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
inches it's just that front rail you can

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.550 
inches it's just that front rail you can
see<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.910> there's<00:03:16.060> some<00:03:16.270> extra<00:03:17.110> lines<00:03:17.260> left

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
see that there's some extra lines left

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.680 
see that there's some extra lines left
over<00:03:17.710> usually<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.250> would<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.460> problem<00:03:19.000> in

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
over usually that would be a problem in

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.580 
over usually that would be a problem in
this<00:03:19.810> case<00:03:19.990> they're<00:03:20.140> actually<00:03:20.170> kind<00:03:20.560> of

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
this case they're actually kind of

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.990 
this case they're actually kind of
useful<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:21.870> front<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.760> trunk<00:03:24.760> will<00:03:24.910> be

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
useful the front of the trunk will be

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.400 
useful the front of the trunk will be
joined<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.480> sides<00:03:25.690> with<00:03:25.930> with<00:03:26.260> some

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
joined to the sides with with some

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.360 
joined to the sides with with some
rabbits

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
rabbits

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.360 
rabbits
I'll<00:03:28.000> pull<00:03:28.330> in<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.510> rabbit<00:03:28.840> that's<00:03:29.130> 1/2<00:03:30.130> inch

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
I'll pull in a rabbit that's 1/2 inch

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.700 
I'll pull in a rabbit that's 1/2 inch
using<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.850> push<00:03:31.030> tool<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.750> then<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
using the push tool and then on the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
using the push tool and then on the
second<00:03:33.160> end<00:03:33.340> over<00:03:33.700> here<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.240> can<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.470> can<00:03:36.250> grab<00:03:36.490> it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
second end over here I can I can grab it

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.940 
second end over here I can I can grab it
so<00:03:37.600> I've<00:03:37.690> got<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.200> then<00:03:38.620> actually<00:03:38.740> just

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
so I've got it and then actually just

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.730 
so I've got it and then actually just
reference<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:40.390> other<00:03:40.600> face<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.350> know<00:03:41.500> it's

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
reference this other face so I know it's

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.650 
reference this other face so I know it's
it's<00:03:42.040> going<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:42.970> be<00:03:43.060> brought<00:03:43.240> in<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.450> same

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
it's going to be brought in the same

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.630 
it's going to be brought in the same
dimension<00:03:43.960> I<00:03:44.350> know<00:03:44.830> I'm<00:03:44.950> spinning<00:03:45.580> around

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
dimension I know I'm spinning around

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.600 
dimension I know I'm spinning around
here<00:03:46.000> quite<00:03:46.210> a<00:03:46.330> bit<00:03:46.390> sorry<00:03:46.810> about<00:03:46.990> that

coming out and then I'll make it a

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.000 
coming out and then I'll make it a
component<00:04:03.280> I'll<00:04:03.550> call<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.440> lid<00:04:05.440> front<00:04:06.540> and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
component I'll call it the lid front and

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.650 
component I'll call it the lid front and
always<00:04:09.010> replace<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.090> selection<00:04:10.510> with<00:04:10.630> the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
always replace the selection with the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.320 
always replace the selection with the
component<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.590> hit<00:04:12.070> create<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:13.000> now<00:04:13.150> we've

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
component and hit create so now we've

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.110 
component and hit create so now we've
got<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.560> separate<00:04:14.560> component<00:04:14.850> called<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:15.940> lid

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
got a separate component called a lid

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.360 
got a separate component called a lid
front<00:04:16.390> that's<00:04:16.720> got<00:04:17.040> some<00:04:18.040> of<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.220> right

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
front that's got some of the right

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.060 
front that's got some of the right
joinery<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:19.200> rabbit<00:04:20.200> will<00:04:20.350> will<00:04:20.620> chant<00:04:20.859> we'll

is is copy that
the<00:04:26.440> move<00:04:26.590> tool<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:26.919> actually<00:04:27.069> great<00:04:27.340> with

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
the move tool is actually great with

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.850 
the move tool is actually great with
coffee<00:04:27.699> you<00:04:28.360> just<00:04:28.680> pretend<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.740> you're

the<00:04:37.030> move<00:04:37.180> tool<00:04:37.360> still<00:04:37.659> I'll<00:04:37.960> hover<00:04:38.199> over<00:04:38.650> one

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the move tool still I'll hover over one

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.270 
the move tool still I'll hover over one
of<00:04:38.860> these<00:04:38.949> little<00:04:39.129> plus<00:04:39.430> signs<00:04:41.159> rotate<00:04:42.159> it

of these little plus signs rotate it

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.300 
of these little plus signs rotate it
around<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:44.050> 180<00:04:44.530> degrees<00:04:45.330> now<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.479> is<00:04:46.780> the

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
know the good thing about components is

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.700 
know the good thing about components is
if<00:06:14.949> you<00:06:15.069> edit<00:06:15.340> one<00:06:15.580> they<00:06:16.360> all<00:06:16.509> change<00:06:16.960> but<00:06:17.680> I

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
if you edit one they all change but I

would hate for you know a rabbit to show
up<00:06:20.020> on<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.199> wrong<00:06:20.379> side<00:06:20.620> of<00:06:20.889> a<00:06:21.039> of<00:06:21.940> a<00:06:22.090> component

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
up on the wrong side of a of a component

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.869 
up on the wrong side of a of a component
so<00:06:22.659> I'll<00:06:23.199> show<00:06:23.349> you<00:06:23.440> that<00:06:23.560> in<00:06:23.620> a<00:06:23.680> second<00:06:24.039> so<00:06:24.159> now

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
we have the roughed in top our frame at

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.670 
we have the roughed in top our frame at
the<00:06:29.139> top

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
the top

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.640 
the top
and<00:06:31.680> that's<00:06:31.920> all<00:06:32.040> we<00:06:32.160> need<00:06:33.020> this<00:06:34.020> is<00:06:34.260> just<00:06:34.470> one

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
and that's all we need this is just one

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.770 
and that's all we need this is just one

part of a three-part series on Sketch up
basics<00:06:37.350> but<00:06:37.920> if<00:06:38.040> you've<00:06:38.160> never<00:06:38.400> used<00:06:38.640> the

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
basics but if you've never used the

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.730 
basics but if you've never used the
program<00:06:39.030> before<00:06:39.240> you<00:06:39.960> might<00:06:40.170> need<00:06:40.350> a<00:06:40.410> more

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
program before you might need a more

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.710 
program before you might need a more
in-depth<00:06:41.220> introduction<00:06:42.000> for<00:06:42.570> that<00:06:42.690> I

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
in-depth introduction for that I

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.300 
in-depth introduction for that I
recommend<00:06:43.290> going<00:06:43.470> to<00:06:43.680> Sketchup<00:06:44.130> for

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
recommend going to Sketchup for

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.060 
recommend going to Sketchup for
woodworkers<00:06:44.730> comm<00:06:45.590> Rob<00:06:46.590> will<00:06:46.770> take<00:06:46.950> you

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
woodworkers comm Rob will take you

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.410 
woodworkers comm Rob will take you
through<00:06:47.100> the<00:06:47.340> basics<00:06:47.760> of<00:06:47.880> setting<00:06:47.940> up<00:06:48.330> a

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
through the basics of setting up a

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.450 
through the basics of setting up a
project<00:06:48.660> from<00:06:48.990> a<00:06:49.140> woodworkers<00:06:49.740> perspective

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
project from a woodworkers perspective

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.550 
project from a woodworkers perspective
so<00:06:50.880> I<00:06:50.910> highly<00:06:51.330> recommend<00:06:51.780> checking<00:06:51.870> his<00:06:52.320> site

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
so I highly recommend checking his site

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.210 
so I highly recommend checking his site
