00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
in the making so a long time coming but

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.760 
in the making so a long time coming but
I'm<00:00:37.970> really<00:00:38.420> happy<00:00:38.720> it's<00:00:38.840> finally<00:00:38.989> here<00:00:39.650> I

I'm really happy it's finally here I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.280 
I'm really happy it's finally here I
actually<00:00:40.040> moved<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:41.330> be<00:00:41.510> closer<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.080> light

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
actually moved to be closer to the light

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.530 
actually moved to be closer to the light
rail<00:00:42.500> in<00:00:42.920> anticipation<00:00:43.580> of<00:00:43.790> it<00:00:43.940> opening

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
other American light rail systems is the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.520 
other American light rail systems is the
quality<00:00:50.360> of<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.540> great<00:00:50.720> separation<00:00:51.379> there

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
quality of the great separation there

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.590 
quality of the great separation there
are<00:00:51.590> significant<00:00:52.100> stretches<00:00:52.580> of<00:00:52.760> link<00:00:52.970> that

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
are significant stretches of link that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.380 
are significant stretches of link that
are<00:00:53.720> in<00:00:53.989> tunnels<00:00:54.500> or<00:00:54.739> elevated<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.059> you

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
are in tunnels or elevated so that you

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.700 
are in tunnels or elevated so that you
actually<00:00:56.510> get<00:00:56.750> higher<00:00:56.930> operating<00:00:57.290> speeds

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
actually get higher operating speeds

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.560 
actually get higher operating speeds
that<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:57.920> might<00:00:58.160> see<00:00:58.340> in<00:00:58.460> say<00:00:58.640> Portland<00:00:59.149> so

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
that you might see in say Portland so

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.729 
that you might see in say Portland so

stress-free you can multitask you know
in<00:02:06.500> ways<00:02:06.709> that<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.009> can't<00:02:07.310> as<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:07.670> drive<00:02:07.970> I

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
in ways that you can't as you drive I

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.630 
in ways that you can't as you drive I
just<00:02:08.660> think<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.050> connection<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.770> ease<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.399> use

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
just think the connection is ease of use

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.790 
just think the connection is ease of use

out<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.209> us<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.900> feed<00:02:50.140> into<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.409> process<00:02:50.890> and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
out to us we feed into the process and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.729 
out to us we feed into the process and
we<00:02:51.459> give<00:02:51.760> design<00:02:52.480> recommendations<00:02:52.659> we<00:02:53.530> work

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
we give design recommendations we work

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.009 
we give design recommendations we work
on<00:02:53.920> policy<00:02:54.400> policy<00:02:55.120> wise<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.540> can<00:02:55.659> put<00:02:55.810> four

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
on policy policy wise you can put four

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.319 
on policy policy wise you can put four
bikes<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.650> each<00:02:56.829> car<00:02:57.129> every<00:02:57.670> train<00:02:57.909> has<00:02:58.150> two

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
bikes on each car every train has two

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.569 
bikes on each car every train has two
cars<00:02:58.599> so<00:02:59.260> we've<00:02:59.409> got<00:02:59.590> hooks<00:02:59.829> for<00:03:00.040> two<00:03:00.190> bikes<00:03:00.430> on

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
cars so we've got hooks for two bikes on

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.949 
cars so we've got hooks for two bikes on
each<00:03:00.730> car<00:03:00.970> then<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:01.269> can<00:03:01.480> stand<00:03:01.750> with<00:03:01.930> two

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
each car then you can stand with two

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.899 
each car then you can stand with two
more<00:03:02.260> bikes<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.709> think<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.099> was<00:03:03.220> fundamental<00:03:03.879> to

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
more bikes I think it was fundamental to

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.000 
more bikes I think it was fundamental to
have<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.720> bicycling<00:03:05.109> community<00:03:05.230> involved<00:03:05.920> in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
have the bicycling community involved in

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.099 
have the bicycling community involved in
these<00:03:06.129> decisions<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.879> people<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.299> are<00:03:07.870> out

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
these decisions and people that are out

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.349 
these decisions and people that are out
there<00:03:08.319> every<00:03:08.349> day<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:09.010> use<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.430> system<00:03:09.849> and

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
there every day that use the system and

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.140 
there every day that use the system and
are<00:03:11.109> able<00:03:11.409> to<00:03:11.440> speak<00:03:11.680> for<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:12.790> can<00:03:12.940> really

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
are able to speak for and you can really

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.940 
are able to speak for and you can really
say<00:03:13.359> what<00:03:13.659> the<00:03:13.780> concerns<00:03:14.200> are<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.650> what<00:03:14.829> the
