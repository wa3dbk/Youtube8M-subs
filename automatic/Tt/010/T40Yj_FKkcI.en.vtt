00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 2 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.960
 we really wanted to open the palace 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.110
 galliera the fashion museum of the city 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.700
 of Paris by offering the possibility to 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.509
 Mr. al hayya to present all 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.910
 his creations 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.970
 because I wanted to repair a 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.350
 some form of injustice gentlemen 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.359
 there was no exposure to 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.210
 paris gold is one of the biggest if this 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.650
 is the greatest designer in my opinion 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.199
 today 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.620
 and then because I found that 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.330
 welcoming to the ja hailed a force 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.790
 of autonomy in creating a 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:50.830
 sovereignty of creation at the ja is 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:54.159
 an independent designer who does not have 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.460
 hesitated to give up certain forms of 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.699
 system for always placed at the idea of 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.699
 creation 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.400
 we wanted to focus 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.160
 on the most nervous models the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.340
 most important iconic in 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.690
 the trajectory of azzedine alaia doc on 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.960
 prepared a selection of 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.550
 unavoidable that sir to the ja has 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.930
 commented add edit as and when 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.260
 measure of this year's work with 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.260
 him 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.890
 the inevitable dahlia there is a 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.470
 particular dress the dress said to clear way 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.780
 or the dress strips all white that 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.910
 is inspired the strips of the mummies 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.220
 and who has become an iconic dress 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.640
 high at the end of the twentieth century because 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.490
 that she was infinitely copying seldom 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.700
 matched there is another very iconic dress 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.920
 that wore john greece are 86 to a 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.080
 award of the Oscars which I think if we 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.870
 had to one day make an exhibition of 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.650
 dresses absolutely monument of history 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.650
 of fashion 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:26.080
 this one should be there it's very 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.840
 fun that alaÃ¯a coming from tunisia 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.390
 embodies at this point the Parisian chic but 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.430
 because in my opinion it was really 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.470
 trained with great operas mans like 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.600
 arletty and louise de vilmorin who was 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.570
 both customers and friends so 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.450
 the bet became what was a 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.120
 exoticism at the base for azzedine alaia 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.320
 has become second nature a 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.310
 automatic writing 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.590
 so he writes better still with a 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.260
 very Parisian ink what a pure 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.350
 Parisian could do so indeed 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.350
 is a very very Parisian chic 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.739
 I think he was moved when it was 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.860
 invited to come for a retrospective 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.720
 certainly but inaugurated the palace 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.790
 galliera the palace was closed since 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.910
 four years so it's a reopening 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.060
 it's like we're leaving a little bit of 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.510
 blank page and siala there been I think 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.300
 touch of being able to usher in what he 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.370
 consider very respectful 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.269
 that is, the history of fashion and 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.269
 the history of museums
