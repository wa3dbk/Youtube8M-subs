00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
so now we're going to add our camera and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.140 
so now we're going to add our camera and
a<00:00:08.870> null<00:00:09.170> object<00:00:09.680> so<00:00:10.250> you<00:00:10.309> can<00:00:10.549> move<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:10.879> camera

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
a null object so you can move the camera

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.919 
a null object so you can move the camera
around<00:00:11.299> using<00:00:11.900> the<00:00:12.139> null<00:00:12.320> object<00:00:13.450> okay<00:00:14.450> so<00:00:14.809> if

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
around using the null object okay so if

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.990 
around using the null object okay so if
you<00:00:15.019> go<00:00:15.170> back<00:00:15.290> on<00:00:15.349> composition<00:00:15.830> one<00:00:18.940> go<00:00:19.940> to

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
you go back on composition one go to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.320 
you go back on composition one go to
layer<00:00:20.510> new<00:00:21.250> camera<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:25.520> default

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
layer new camera and the default

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.410 
layer new camera and the default
settings<00:00:26.689> should<00:00:26.779> be<00:00:26.900> fine<00:00:27.140> just<00:00:27.410> make<00:00:27.949> sure

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
settings should be fine just make sure

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.790

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
depth of field isn't enabled because we

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.220 
depth of field isn't enabled because we
don't<00:00:33.980> need<00:00:34.070> that<00:00:34.190> right<00:00:34.250> now<00:00:34.870> okk<00:00:35.870> cocaine

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
don't need that right now okk cocaine

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.729 
don't need that right now okk cocaine
and<00:00:36.760> layer<00:00:37.840> new<00:00:39.040> null<00:00:40.040> object<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:42.500> now<00:00:42.620> we're

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
and layer new null object and now we're

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.369 
and layer new null object and now we're
going<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:43.300> parent<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.600> null<00:00:44.780> object<00:00:45.140> with<00:00:45.290> the

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
going to parent the null object with the

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.330 
going to parent the null object with the
camera<00:00:46.210> so<00:00:47.210> if<00:00:47.270> we<00:00:47.469> click<00:00:48.469> on<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:48.890> icon<00:00:49.039> here

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
camera so if we click on this icon here

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.119 
camera so if we click on this icon here
and<00:00:50.200> drag<00:00:51.200> it<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.829> null<00:00:52.100> object<00:00:54.129> the

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
and drag it to the null object the

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.660 
and drag it to the null object the
camera<00:00:55.579> layer<00:00:56.300> is<00:00:56.539> now<00:00:56.719> linked<00:00:57.199> or<00:00:58.129> parented

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
camera layer is now linked or parented

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.220 
camera layer is now linked or parented
to<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.270> null<00:00:59.510> layer<00:01:01.629> okay<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:02.690> now<00:01:02.899> we<00:01:02.989> can<00:01:03.079> go

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
to the null layer okay so now we can go

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.740 
to the null layer okay so now we can go
into<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.559> null<00:01:03.770> layer<00:01:04.399> press<00:01:05.270> p<00:01:07.570> we'll<00:01:08.570> make<00:01:08.689> a

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
into the null layer press p we'll make a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.480 
into the null layer press p we'll make a
3d<00:01:09.290> object<00:01:09.320> for<00:01:09.770> it<00:01:11.049> again<00:01:12.049> like<00:01:12.439> by<00:01:12.590> clicking

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
3d object for it again like by clicking

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:22.630 
3d object for it again like by clicking
these<00:01:13.610> icons<00:01:14.090> will<00:01:14.240> make<00:01:14.360> a<00:01:14.390> 3d<00:01:14.900> object<00:01:21.640> okay

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
these icons will make a 3d object okay

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:33.580 
these icons will make a 3d object okay
so<00:01:23.210> I<00:01:23.240> want<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.509> zoom<00:01:23.720> right<00:01:24.290> into<00:01:24.520> ICU<00:01:29.290> so<00:01:32.590> if

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
so I want to zoom right into ICU so if

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.039 
so I want to zoom right into ICU so if
you<00:01:34.000> drag<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.840> one<00:01:36.640> on<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.880> far<00:01:38.720> right<00:01:39.020> of

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
you drag this one on the far right of

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.789 
you drag this one on the far right of
position<00:01:39.729> your<00:01:40.729> zoom<00:01:41.030> in<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.270> out<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:42.530> middle

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
position your zoom in and out the middle

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.880 
position your zoom in and out the middle
one<00:01:42.920> will<00:01:43.130> take<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:43.909> up<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.060> down<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.650> then

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
one will take you up and down and then

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.010 
one will take you up and down and then
left<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.610> first<00:01:47.299> one<00:01:47.479> will<00:01:47.630> take<00:01:47.780> your<00:01:47.899> left

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
left the first one will take your left

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:59.800 
left the first one will take your left
and<00:01:48.170> right

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.090 

okay<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:00.869> we're<00:02:01.109> going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.289> add<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> keyframe<00:02:01.710> on

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
okay so we're going to add a keyframe on

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.649 
okay so we're going to add a keyframe on
position<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.729> we're<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> start<00:02:06.240> up

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
position so we're going to start up

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.400 
position so we're going to start up
there<00:02:06.929> I<00:02:09.200> wanted<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.319> go<00:02:10.470> over<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.769> driving<00:02:12.410> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
there I wanted to go over to driving to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:25.180 
there I wanted to go over to driving to
get<00:02:13.530> add<00:02:13.680> another<00:02:13.890> keyframe<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:17.959> zoom<00:02:18.959> out<00:02:19.080> so

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.069 

we<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.310> see<00:02:26.489> driving<00:02:26.910> let's<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> quick

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
we can see driving let's have a quick

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:37.390 
we can see driving let's have a quick
preview<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.680> see<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.099> okay<00:02:32.840> no<00:02:33.840> okay

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.100 

so<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.610> want<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.819> zoom<00:02:38.940> straight<00:02:39.269> into<00:02:39.540> icy<00:02:39.900> so

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
so I want to zoom straight into icy so

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.420 
so I want to zoom straight into icy so
there<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:40.349> go<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.590> wanted<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.980> pause<00:02:44.190> there

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
there we go and I wanted to pause there

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.500 
there we go and I wanted to pause there
for<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.640> second<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.120> I'm<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.329> add<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
for a second so I'm going to add a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.610 
for a second so I'm going to add a
keyframe<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.910> then<00:02:47.910> as<00:02:48.329> driving<00:02:49.110> comes<00:02:49.470> up

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
keyframe and then as driving comes up

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.380 
keyframe and then as driving comes up
i'm<00:02:49.769> going<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> add<00:02:50.040> another<00:02:50.310> keyframe<00:02:50.690> and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
i'm going to add another keyframe and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:04.819 
i'm going to add another keyframe and
zoom<00:02:54.390> over<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.250> driving<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.380> quick<00:03:04.590> look

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
zoom over to the driving so a quick look

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.210 
zoom over to the driving so a quick look
at<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.100> see<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.430> okay<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:05.910> done<00:03:07.220> yeah

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
at that see if it's okay this done yeah

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.520 
at that see if it's okay this done yeah
that's<00:03:08.400> okay<00:03:12.079> so<00:03:13.079> I'm<00:03:13.170> going<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.319> add<00:03:13.410> another

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
that's okay so I'm going to add another

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.720 
that's okay so I'm going to add another
keyframe<00:03:13.889> at<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> end<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.639> that<00:03:14.730> one<00:03:16.579> so<00:03:17.579> then

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
keyframe at the end of that one so then

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.770 
keyframe at the end of that one so then
we<00:03:17.819> can<00:03:17.970> move<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.329> to<00:03:18.510> round<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:21.510> round

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
we can move on to round so this round

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.629 
we can move on to round so this round
comes<00:03:22.079> up<00:03:22.459> add<00:03:23.459> another<00:03:23.519> keyframe<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:26.220> focus

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
comes up add another keyframe and focus

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:44.280 
comes up add another keyframe and focus
your<00:03:26.669> camera<00:03:27.090> onto<00:03:27.209> that

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.899 

okay<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:45.349> look<00:03:45.769> at<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.040> again<00:03:48.190> that's<00:03:49.190> okay

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.009 

i'm<00:03:52.909> going<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.090> add<00:03:53.180> another<00:03:53.420> keyframe<00:03:53.629> at<00:03:53.959> the

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
i'm going to add another keyframe at the

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.009 
i'm going to add another keyframe at the
end<00:03:54.140> of<00:03:54.200> this<00:03:54.290> again<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.299> keeps<00:03:56.780> everything

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
end of this again so it keeps everything

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.190 
end of this again so it keeps everything
the<00:03:57.260> same<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:58.069> when<00:03:58.220> we<00:03:58.280> go<00:03:58.400> on<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.700> do<00:03:58.849> with<00:03:59.200> we

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
the same so when we go on to do with we

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.660 
the same so when we go on to do with we
can<00:04:00.379> do<00:04:00.500> what<00:04:00.650> we<00:04:00.680> like<00:04:05.200> so<00:04:06.200> there's<00:04:06.409> with<00:04:06.670> so

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
can do what we like so there's with so

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:22.150 
can do what we like so there's with so
let's<00:04:07.879> add<00:04:08.030> under<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.329> keyframe<00:04:10.959> zoom<00:04:11.959> in<00:04:21.160> add

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
let's add under the keyframe zoom in add

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.100 
let's add under the keyframe zoom in add
another<00:04:22.220> keyframe<00:04:22.639> after<00:04:23.419> with<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:23.960> keeps

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
another keyframe after with so it keeps

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.010 
another keyframe after with so it keeps
it<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.590> camera<00:04:24.919> steady<00:04:25.130> where<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.729> is<00:04:26.020> and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
it the camera steady where it is and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.140 
it the camera steady where it is and
then<00:04:27.500> as<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.949> comes<00:04:28.340> up<00:04:28.490> add<00:04:29.090> another

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
then as the comes up add another

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:40.220 
then as the comes up add another
keyframe<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.199> zoom<00:04:30.830> in<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.160> thee

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:49.660 

you

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.420 

okay<00:04:50.230> let's<00:04:51.230> have<00:04:51.410> a<00:04:51.440> ram<00:04:51.830> preview<00:04:52.070> of<00:04:52.310> this

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
okay let's have a ram preview of this

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:16.990 
okay let's have a ram preview of this
now<00:04:52.640> see<00:04:53.630> if<00:04:53.690> it's<00:04:53.810> all<00:04:53.930> okay<00:05:13.870> okay<00:05:15.970> I'm<00:05:16.970> just

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
now see if it's all okay okay I'm just

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.250 
now see if it's all okay okay I'm just
going<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.270> go<00:05:17.330> over<00:05:17.420> quickly<00:05:17.660> with<00:05:17.930> you<00:05:18.050> head

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
going to go over quickly with you head

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.560 
going to go over quickly with you head
to<00:05:18.410> export<00:05:18.890> your<00:05:19.190> video<00:05:19.940> once<00:05:20.240> you've<00:05:20.360> done<00:05:20.510> it

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
to export your video once you've done it

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.990 
to export your video once you've done it
obviously<00:05:21.470> you<00:05:21.680> can<00:05:21.860> do<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.310> whole<00:05:22.460> song<00:05:22.700> go

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
obviously you can do the whole song go

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.560 
obviously you can do the whole song go
wherever<00:05:23.810> you're<00:05:24.050> doing<00:05:24.320> and<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:25.390> just<00:05:26.390> want<00:05:26.540> to

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
wherever you're doing and I just want to

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.860 
wherever you're doing and I just want to
show<00:05:26.720> you<00:05:26.810> how<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:26.990> render<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:28.540> okay<00:05:29.540> so<00:05:29.600> making

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
show you how to render it okay so making

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.540 
show you how to render it okay so making
sure<00:05:30.310> you've<00:05:31.310> checked<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:33.550> continuous

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
sure you've checked the continuous

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.470 
sure you've checked the continuous
rasterization<00:05:35.470> on<00:05:36.470> or<00:05:36.830> everything<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:37.480> the

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
rasterization on or everything and the

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.770 
rasterization on or everything and the
motion<00:05:38.660> blur<00:05:38.990> and<00:05:39.230> the<00:05:40.100> 3d<00:05:40.610> layers<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:44.660> it

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
motion blur and the 3d layers so it

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:54.310 
motion blur and the 3d layers so it
gives<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:45.020> a<00:05:45.080> nice<00:05:45.560> sharp<00:05:45.950> finish<00:05:48.340> go<00:05:49.340> to<00:05:53.290> cut<00:05:54.290> a

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
gives it a nice sharp finish go to cut a

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.050 
gives it a nice sharp finish go to cut a
composition<00:05:55.100> and<00:05:55.280> add<00:05:56.180> to<00:05:56.420> render<00:05:56.600> queue<00:05:58.060> this

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
composition and add to render queue this

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.160 
composition and add to render queue this
will<00:05:59.210> give<00:05:59.240> you<00:05:59.390> a<00:05:59.450> few<00:05:59.630> settings<00:05:59.990> you<00:06:00.140> can

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
will give you a few settings you can

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.280 
will give you a few settings you can
change<00:06:00.910> click<00:06:01.910> on<00:06:02.030> best<00:06:02.360> settings<00:06:02.750> and<00:06:03.080> it

change click on best settings and it

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.760 
change click on best settings and it
will<00:06:03.380> change<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.980> quality<00:06:04.190> of<00:06:05.770> everything

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
will change the quality of everything

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.680 
will change the quality of everything
you<00:06:06.860> can<00:06:07.010> use<00:06:07.250> you<00:06:07.790> can<00:06:07.910> change<00:06:08.180> a<00:06:08.270> frame<00:06:08.480> rate

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
you can use you can change a frame rate

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.560 
you can use you can change a frame rate
to<00:06:08.870> 30<00:06:09.140> if<00:06:09.380> you<00:06:09.440> need<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:10.240> but<00:06:11.240> we're<00:06:11.390> going<00:06:11.510> to

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
to 30 if you need to but we're going to

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.480 
to 30 if you need to but we're going to
keep<00:06:11.630> it<00:06:11.870> as<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.260> default<00:06:12.530> to<00:06:13.130> best<00:06:13.430> fall<00:06:15.490> and

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
keep it as the default to best fall and

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.940 
keep it as the default to best fall and
everything<00:06:16.880> else<00:06:17.030> should<00:06:17.120> be<00:06:17.270> fine<00:06:17.600> click<00:06:18.200> OK

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.820 

actually<00:06:21.950> for<00:06:22.100> that<00:06:22.220> you<00:06:22.370> can<00:06:22.580> also<00:06:22.760> go<00:06:23.240> and

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
actually for that you can also go and

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.850 
actually for that you can also go and
change<00:06:25.090> how<00:06:26.090> much<00:06:26.600> of<00:06:26.870> your<00:06:27.050> competition<00:06:27.380> it

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
change how much of your competition it

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.770 
change how much of your competition it
will<00:06:28.010> render<00:06:28.340> so<00:06:28.910> in<00:06:29.060> this<00:06:29.180> case<00:06:29.390> I've<00:06:29.660> only

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
will render so in this case I've only

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.470 
will render so in this case I've only
done<00:06:29.990> like<00:06:30.050> 10<00:06:30.410> seconds<00:06:30.860> of<00:06:30.980> the<00:06:31.640> Sun<00:06:31.850> so<00:06:32.420> I'm

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
done like 10 seconds of the Sun so I'm

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.520 
done like 10 seconds of the Sun so I'm
going<00:06:32.600> to<00:06:32.660> go<00:06:32.750> into<00:06:32.900> here<00:06:33.200> and<00:06:35.380> make<00:06:36.380> the

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
going to go into here and make the

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:44.920 
going to go into here and make the
render<00:06:36.830> end<00:06:37.010> at<00:06:37.960> one<00:06:38.960> minute<00:06:41.620> okay<00:06:43.750> then<00:06:44.750> click

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
render end at one minute okay then click

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.540 
render end at one minute okay then click
ok<00:06:45.230> on<00:06:45.260> that<00:06:45.440> one<00:06:45.560> so<00:06:46.430> now<00:06:46.550> you<00:06:46.610> output<00:06:47.600> module

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
ok on that one so now you output module

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.850 
ok on that one so now you output module
you'll<00:06:49.550> need<00:06:49.670> to<00:06:49.790> click<00:06:49.910> on<00:06:50.120> this<00:06:50.270> because

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
you'll need to click on this because

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.650 
you'll need to click on this because
audio<00:06:51.860> isn't<00:06:52.510> checked<00:06:53.510> by<00:06:54.140> default<00:06:55.000> so<00:06:56.000> we'll

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
audio isn't checked by default so we'll

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.530 
audio isn't checked by default so we'll
check<00:06:56.870> audio<00:06:57.230> output<00:06:58.160> and<00:06:58.400> the<00:06:59.150> default

check audio output and the default

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.839 
check audio output and the default
should<00:06:59.750> be<00:06:59.810> fine

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:01.849 
should be fine
