00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.769
 Hi everyone, today I want to do with 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.390
 you a picture I will use crayons a 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.430
 wax like these 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.890
 I took them from my nephew but you 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.079
 you can very well use maybe 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.000
 scraps of wax or paint brushes 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.720
 however buy them in the in 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.250
 stationeries and then a canvas I am 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.460
 also using the baby because 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.390
 I don't want to make a very big picture e 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.109
 the pile can be found in the DIY stores 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.480
 you even maybe water then we need it 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.170
 hot gun and she too always in 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.149
 DIY stores immediately began to 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.469
 place the wax crayons 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.149
 he decides the drawing a little bit 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.379
 I want to do in this case I want 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:05.960
 place everyone here below and by 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:09.290
 I do use the hot glue will put 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.730
 a little hot glue on the pastel a 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.770
 wax and then I'll go to apply 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.620
 I will try to put them all with it 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.340
 same with the same with the same 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.020
 drawing facing the same position 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.990
 but if you have wax crayons 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.040
 we say different also of different brands 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.040
 it is not a problem 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.030
 sticking all the wax crayons 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.970
 obviously I check that they are all well 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.230
 balances after which turn the canvas and crush 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.230
 however the security 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.410
 I also decided to leave the card 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.209
 of the casteller has it but wanting then yes 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.020
 can also take away these are are 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.900
 tastes dr to use a lighter e 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:39.480
 place the flame under the tip of the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:49.590
 my wax crayon until it falls 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:52.220
 precisely of the drops such a way to have 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.220
 this effect 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.120
 it is certainly a project that requires 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.990
 lots of attention because you need to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.410
 obviously use fire then it 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.590
 do not recommend to young people or in any case the 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:19.220
 people not a bit kamal of dexterity 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:25.030
 let's say also inclining the canvas way 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.030
 such as to drop the wax 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:45.030
 then you decide of course until that 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:48.140
 point to get the color and here is the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.140
 final results 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.350
 if you want you can leave it like this or 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:58.530
 continue to customize it using 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.210
 of rhinestones and vilely Rome is always the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.950
 photo of the final result 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.800
 I hope you like the idea let me know 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.900
 if you do maybe maybe put the photos on 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.270
 on facebook facebook page 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.260
 I hope we can help there 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.260
