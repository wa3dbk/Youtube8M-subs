cabbage all at the same time all today
you'll<00:00:51.050> get<00:00:51.320> them<00:00:51.500> in<00:00:51.649> succession<00:00:52.129> okay

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
you'll get them in succession okay

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.670 
you'll get them in succession okay
yeah<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:53.390> from<00:00:53.510> one<00:00:53.720> sowing<00:00:54.079> you'll<00:00:54.350> have<00:00:54.530> them

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
yeah so from one sowing you'll have them

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.460 
yeah so from one sowing you'll have them
ready<00:00:54.890> from<00:00:55.129> July<00:00:55.510> onwards<00:00:56.510> until<00:00:56.930> January

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
ready from July onwards until January

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.380 
ready from July onwards until January
the<00:00:57.500> following<00:00:57.769> year<00:00:58.189> so<00:00:58.820> they<00:00:58.939> don't<00:00:59.119> need<00:00:59.269> to

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
the following year so they don't need to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.420 
the following year so they don't need to
be<00:00:59.540> succession<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:00.320> if<00:01:00.589> you<00:01:00.710> choose<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.250> right

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
be succession so if you choose the right

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.280 
be succession so if you choose the right
varieties<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:02.269> look<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.629> way<00:01:02.750> we<00:01:02.780> sow<00:01:03.110> the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
varieties so look the way we sow the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.140 
varieties so look the way we sow the
seeds<00:01:03.500> is<00:01:03.769> we<00:01:03.949> have<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.129> modular<00:01:04.640> tray<00:01:04.879> and

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
seeds is we have a modular tray and

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.289 
seeds is we have a modular tray and
finds<00:01:05.720> he<00:01:05.810> come<00:01:06.110> first<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.590> then<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.369> village

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
finds he come first and then the village

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.789 
finds he come first and then the village
of<00:01:08.810> five<00:01:09.970> rubbing<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.119> lumps<00:01:11.420> away<00:01:11.780> nice<00:01:12.560> and

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
of five rubbing the lumps away nice and

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.569 
of five rubbing the lumps away nice and
full<00:01:12.920> overfill<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.490> first<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:15.070> then<00:01:16.070> don't

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
full overfill it first and then don't

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.910 
full overfill it first and then don't
compress<00:01:17.329> the<00:01:17.600> modules<00:01:18.140> with<00:01:18.409> your<00:01:18.530> fingers

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
compress the modules with your fingers

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.880 
compress the modules with your fingers
the<00:01:19.130> only<00:01:19.430> firming<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:19.909> need<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.240> do<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.890> two

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
the only firming you need to do is two

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.420 
the only firming you need to do is two
three

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
three

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.550 
three
firm<00:01:22.640> banks<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.390> that'll<00:01:23.869> settle<00:01:24.350> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
firm banks and that'll settle the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.830 
firm banks and that'll settle the
compost<00:01:24.979> nicely<00:01:25.400> into<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:26.390> course<00:01:26.570> when<00:01:26.810> we

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
compost nicely into it of course when we

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.249 
compost nicely into it of course when we
cut<00:01:27.289> off<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.979> excess<00:01:28.399> compost<00:01:28.999> we<00:01:29.840> saw<00:01:30.049> them

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
cut off the excess compost we saw them

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.550 
cut off the excess compost we saw them
about<00:01:30.469> fingernails<00:01:31.039> depth<00:01:31.369> or<00:01:31.609> about<00:01:32.439> one<00:01:33.439> and

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
about fingernails depth or about one and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.440 
about fingernails depth or about one and
a<00:01:33.649> half<00:01:33.679> to<00:01:34.009> two<00:01:34.189> centimeters<00:01:34.579> deep<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:35.420> you

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
a half to two centimeters deep so you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.410 
a half to two centimeters deep so you
make<00:01:35.719> little<00:01:36.319> holes<00:01:36.880> indentations<00:01:37.880> into<00:01:38.270> the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
make little holes indentations into the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.559 
make little holes indentations into the
cells<00:01:39.139> I<00:01:39.469> find<00:01:40.100> it's<00:01:40.249> the<00:01:40.399> easiest<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.149> put

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
cells I find it's the easiest is to put

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.679 
cells I find it's the easiest is to put
seeds<00:01:42.289> onto<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.249> piece<00:01:43.639> of<00:01:43.670> paper<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:44.329> with<00:01:44.659> a

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
seeds onto a piece of paper and with a

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.580 
seeds onto a piece of paper and with a
pencil<00:01:45.200> or<00:01:45.350> pen<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:46.759> put<00:01:47.030> one<00:01:47.359> seed<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:47.990> each

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
pencil or pen you put one seed in each

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.120 
pencil or pen you put one seed in each
cell<00:01:48.889> when<00:01:49.579> you<00:01:49.670> finished<00:01:49.999> you<00:01:50.600> put<00:01:50.899> fine<00:01:51.770> seed

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
cell when you finished you put fine seed

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.359 
cell when you finished you put fine seed
compost<00:01:52.670> all<00:01:53.060> fill<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.630> again<00:01:53.749> and<00:01:54.369> then

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
compost all fill it again and then

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.969 
compost all fill it again and then
scrape<00:01:55.819> it<00:01:55.969> off<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.420> that's<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.319> that's<00:01:57.679> ready

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
scrape it off and that's it that's ready

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.910 
scrape it off and that's it that's ready
it<00:01:58.850> just<00:01:59.060> water<00:01:59.359> it<00:01:59.569> in<00:01:59.719> gently<00:02:00.139> don't

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
it just water it in gently don't

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.459 
it just water it in gently don't
overwater<00:02:01.549> over<00:02:02.329> watering<00:02:02.719> is<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:03.139> as<00:02:03.259> bad

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
overwater over watering is just as bad

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.349 
overwater over watering is just as bad
as<00:02:03.679> under<00:02:04.009> watering<00:02:04.399> because<00:02:04.579> to<00:02:04.909> see<00:02:05.060> it's<00:02:05.209> me

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
as under watering because to see it's me

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.510 
as under watering because to see it's me
rot<00:02:05.569> away<00:02:05.749> and<00:02:06.200> that's<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.829> probably<00:02:07.429> about

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
rot away and that's it probably about

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.120 
rot away and that's it probably about
four<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.149> six<00:02:08.179> weeks<00:02:08.569> all<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.410> cabbages

butterfly caterpillars so you just check
underneath<00:03:47.099> either<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.670> cluster<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.330> yellow

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
underneath either a cluster of yellow

underneath either a cluster of yellow
eggs<00:03:48.900> or<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.620> catabolism<00:03:50.340> cabbage<00:03:51.180> shrewd

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
eggs or the catabolism cabbage shrewd

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.270 
eggs or the catabolism cabbage shrewd
fly<00:03:51.599> would<00:03:51.780> be<00:03:51.959> another<00:03:52.170> one<00:03:52.440> yeah<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.950> but

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280
