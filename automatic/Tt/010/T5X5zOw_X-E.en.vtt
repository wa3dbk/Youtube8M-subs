00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.900
 classes and tells the students that they 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.660

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.479
 teacher was handing out the sheet of 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.880
 examination with the front side down 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.240
 so that they did not see what it contained 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.680
 until he said that the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.180
 test 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.700
 Once all the leaves gave them 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.210
 asked them to turn the page and see the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.420
 content to everyone's surprise 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.780
 it was a blank sheet that he had in 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.310
 half a black dot watching the face of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.800
 surprise of all his students the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.490
 Professor told him now they are going to write 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.770
 an essay about what they are seeing 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.800
 I want you to do an essay on what 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.489
 are looking at the sheet was a sheet in 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.770
 white with a black dot in the middle 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.360
 all confused young people are 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.330
 they put to think and write about what 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.610
 they saw the time finished 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.320
 the teacher collects the leaves he places them 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.900
 in front of the desk and it starts at 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.200
 read the newsrooms aloud all 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.690
 without exception they referred to the black point 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.500
 in different ways finished the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.880
 reading 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.300
 the professor started talking about the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.510
 next way this test is not for 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.630
 give them a note students will serve you as 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.319
 life lesson nobody talked about the leaf 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.519
 blank all focused all 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.540
 they put their attention on the black point 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.150
 this same thing happens with life 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.579
 we have an entire blank sheet for 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.569
 see and take advantage but we focus on 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.499
 the black dots that life contains 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.480
 life is a gift of nature 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:22.340
 He is giving us with affection and love always 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.489
 we have plenty of reasons to celebrate 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.980
 for its renewal by the friends that we 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.950
 support the job that sustains us 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.680
 the miracles that happen daily and 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.659
 however, we insist on looking at the point 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.810
 black either the health problem that 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.120
 the lack of money affects us the difficult 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.090
 relationship with a family member disappointment 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.639
 with a friend the black dots are 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.680
 minimal compared to everything 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:51.349
 daily we get from life but 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.710
 they occupy our mind in everything 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.170
 moment 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.900
 since in your attention points 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.290
 blacks of life take advantage of each 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:06.630
 blessing every moment that the creator 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:10.110
 it gives us reassure they are happy to give 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:14.569
 a hug shake hands a cute 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.540
 word a kiss from your son from your mother 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.630
 a thousand moments of the blank sheet 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.770
 let's take the points out of our lives 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:28.600
 black and focus on the happiness of 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.600
 our white part of life
