on a more consistent basis I definitely

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.410

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.409 
and right here if I had another weapon
ready<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.979> go<00:04:23.159> I<00:04:23.370> might<00:04:23.849> have<00:04:23.970> been<00:04:24.060> able<00:04:24.240> to

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
ready to go I might have been able to

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.080

I don't get a style chopper at this game

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.320 
I don't get a style chopper at this game
but<00:04:28.949> I<00:04:29.010> think<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.340> could<00:04:29.550> have<00:04:29.639> gotten<00:04:29.880> an<00:04:30.060> even

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
but I think I could have gotten an even

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.939 
but I think I could have gotten an even
better<00:04:30.540> score<00:04:30.720> if<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.110> ran<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.350> lower<00:04:31.620> score

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
better score if I ran a lower score

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.800 
better score if I ran a lower score
streak<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> UAV<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.120> think<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.510> could<00:04:33.720> have

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
streak like a UAV I think I could have

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.510

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
better if I had awareness unlocked and

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.379 
better if I had awareness unlocked and
heard<00:05:32.250> his<00:05:32.370> footsteps<00:05:32.820> from<00:05:32.970> farther<00:05:33.240> away

when I get killed here I should have

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.450 
when I get killed here I should have
crouched<00:05:37.139> and<00:05:37.320> gotten<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:37.800> safer<00:05:38.160> area
