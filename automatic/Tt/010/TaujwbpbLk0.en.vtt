00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
completely new platform for mobile but

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.119 
completely new platform for mobile but
we<00:00:39.540> want<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> take<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.930> platform<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.920> use

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
we want to take a platform that we use

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.950 
we want to take a platform that we use
already<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.579> web<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.149> fill<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> few<00:00:42.780> gaps

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
already the web and fill in a few gaps

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.660 
already the web and fill in a few gaps
to<00:00:43.260> make<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.980> everything<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.460> would

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to make it do everything that we would

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.130 
to make it do everything that we would
need<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> run<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> phone<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.050> an

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
need to have it run a phone so an

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.020 
need to have it run a phone so an
example<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> dialer<00:00:47.789> here

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
example of that is in the dialer here

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.180 
example of that is in the dialer here
right<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.350> dialer<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:49.980> too

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
right this is a this is a dialer not too

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
right this is a this is a dialer not too
surprising<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> phone<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:52.020> built<00:00:52.199> as

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
surprising on a phone but it's built as

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.860 
surprising on a phone but it's built as
a<00:00:52.379> web<00:00:52.530> app<00:00:52.710> using<00:00:53.129> html5<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.180> CSS<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
a web app using html5 and CSS and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.020 
a web app using html5 and CSS and
JavaScript<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> web<00:00:56.699> app<00:00:56.850> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
JavaScript but this is a web app that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
JavaScript but this is a web app that
can<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> radio<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.989> device<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> make

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
can use the radio on this device to make

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.349 
can use the radio on this device to make
a<00:00:58.530> phone<00:00:58.770> call<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.699> new<00:00:59.879> right<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> web

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
a phone call which is new right the web

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.610 
a phone call which is new right the web
the<00:01:00.570> web<00:01:00.600> didn't<00:01:00.930> use<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.109> able<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the web didn't use to be able to do that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.340 
the web didn't use to be able to do that
and<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.600> we're<00:01:03.750> doing<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> same

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and it's what we're doing is the same

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800 
and it's what we're doing is the same
way<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.710> Android<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.700> iOS<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.330> system

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
way that on Android or iOS the system

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.140 
way that on Android or iOS the system
exposes<00:01:07.439> api's<00:01:07.920> too<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.729> native<00:01:09.000> apps

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
exposes api's too so that native apps

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
exposes api's too so that native apps
can<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:09.510> advantage<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.960> things<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
can take advantage of things like the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.390 
can take advantage of things like the
dialer<00:01:11.600> contacts<00:01:12.860> that's<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> mask<00:01:14.159> things

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
dialer contacts that's the mask things

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.770 
dialer contacts that's the mask things
like<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.640> we're<00:01:15.030> exposing<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.689> those

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
like that we're exposing all of those

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359 
like that we're exposing all of those
things<00:01:15.840> through<00:01:16.200> JavaScript<00:01:16.680> API<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.250> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
things through JavaScript API so that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.039 
things through JavaScript API so that
web<00:01:17.580> apps<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.390> advantage<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> all<00:01:18.869> those

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
web apps can take advantage of all those

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.380 
web apps can take advantage of all those
things<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.950> another<00:01:20.220> example<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.880> mentioned<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
things so another example I mentioned is

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.390 
things so another example I mentioned is
SMS<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.439> send<00:01:22.619> an<00:01:22.680> SMS<00:01:22.830> through

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
SMS right we can send an SMS through

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.289 
SMS right we can send an SMS through
what<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.850> basically<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> web<00:01:24.509> page<00:01:26.150> contacts<00:01:27.150> as

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
what is basically a web page contacts as

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.550 
what is basically a web page contacts as
well<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.869> remember<00:01:28.110> these<00:01:28.259> things<00:01:28.409> that

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
well there remember these things that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
well there remember these things that
are<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.310> already<00:01:29.490> existed<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.119> also

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
are all have already existed but also

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.730 
are all have already existed but also
work<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.750> well<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.140> context<00:01:31.560> like

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
work really well in this context like

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
work really well in this context like
using<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.640> camera<00:01:32.850> right<00:01:33.270> web<00:01:33.659> developers

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
using the camera right web developers

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.179 
using the camera right web developers
have<00:01:34.229> already<00:01:34.530> been<00:01:34.619> able<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> use<00:01:34.979> those

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
have already been able to use those

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.069 
have already been able to use those
things<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.610> JavaScript<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.750> obviously

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
things for JavaScript but obviously

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.890 
things for JavaScript but obviously
they're<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.350> useful<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.009> well<00:01:38.900> so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
they're very useful here as well so

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.289 
they're very useful here as well so
other<00:01:40.590> things<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.009> show<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.909> like

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
other things I can show you are like

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.760 
other things I can show you are like

what<00:02:26.610> we've<00:02:26.760> found<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.150> mean<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.360> surprised<00:02:27.630> me

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
what we've found I mean it surprised me

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.800 
what we've found I mean it surprised me
but<00:02:28.799> that<00:02:29.220> because<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.970> are<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.269> much<00:02:30.510> flatter

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810

but that because we are a much flatter
stack<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.610> hardware<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
stack right it's just the hardware and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000 
stack right it's just the hardware and
then<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> web<00:02:33.390> rendering<00:02:33.569> engine<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.319> then<00:02:34.470> the

then a web rendering engine and then the

then a web rendering engine and then the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
web on top of that where we we've sort

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.289 
web on top of that where we we've sort
of<00:02:38.040> done<00:02:38.099> away<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.459> lot<00:02:38.519> of<00:02:38.640> overhead<00:02:39.090> that

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
of done away with a lot of overhead that

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.660 
of done away with a lot of overhead that
you<00:02:39.420> find<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.019> heavier<00:02:40.680> system<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.099> one

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you find on a heavier system like one

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.880 
you find on a heavier system like one
that<00:02:41.760> has<00:02:41.910> an<00:02:42.030> OS<00:02:42.420> like<00:02:42.599> Android<00:02:42.989> or<00:02:43.170> something

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that has an OS like Android or something

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.610 
that has an OS like Android or something
else<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.090> fact<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.569> actually<00:02:45.599> runs<00:02:46.110> really

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
else so in fact it actually runs really

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.530 
else so in fact it actually runs really
fast<00:02:46.950> there's<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.610> lot<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.849> optimization<00:02:48.420> we

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
fast there's a lot of optimization we

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.970 
fast there's a lot of optimization we
have<00:02:48.630> yet<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.840> do<00:02:48.930> here<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.260> already<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.890> a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
have yet to do here but already it's a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.430 
have yet to do here but already it's a
really<00:02:50.250> performance<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.930> fact<00:02:52.139> works

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
really performance and in fact works

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.110 
really performance and in fact works
really<00:02:52.709> well<00:02:52.799> on<00:02:52.950> lower<00:02:53.280> end<00:02:53.519> devices<00:02:53.819> as<00:02:54.090> well

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
really well on lower end devices as well

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.720 
really well on lower end devices as well
so<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:55.139> can<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.799> bring<00:02:55.980> smartphone

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
so you can you can bring smartphone

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
so you can you can bring smartphone
experience<00:02:56.970> using<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.840> web<00:02:57.989> on<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.410> much<00:02:58.769> lower

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
experience using the web on a much lower

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.830 
experience using the web on a much lower
end<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.430> much<00:02:59.609> lower<00:02:59.790> end<00:02:59.940> hardware<00:03:00.299> okay<00:03:00.780> so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
end on much lower end hardware okay so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.150 
end on much lower end hardware okay so
you<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.049> basically<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.590> not<00:03:01.739> depend<00:03:02.010> upon

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
you can basically it's not depend upon

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.860 
you can basically it's not depend upon
like<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.430> dual-core<00:03:02.790> processors<00:03:03.450> right<00:03:03.750> i<00:03:03.780> mean

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
like a dual-core processors right i mean

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.110 
like a dual-core processors right i mean
this<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.380> very<00:03:04.560> high-end<00:03:05.010> device<00:03:05.519> but<00:03:05.910> i

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
this is a very high-end device but i

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.220 
this is a very high-end device but i
know<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.569> some<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.780> our<00:03:06.840> partners<00:03:07.139> are

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
know that some of our partners are

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.449 
know that some of our partners are
interested<00:03:07.530> because<00:03:07.829> they<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.190> take<00:03:08.400> a

community<00:03:23.639> robot<00:03:24.420> models<00:03:24.810> but<00:03:24.930> they<00:03:25.049> were

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
community robot models but they were

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.620 
community robot models but they were
able<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.440> like<00:03:25.889> side<00:03:26.160> load<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:27.180> as<00:03:27.510> well

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630

until<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.079> can<00:03:28.230> android<00:03:28.500> colonel<00:03:28.920> well<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.700> I

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
until I can android colonel well so I

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.089 
until I can android colonel well so I
know<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.209> some<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.510> our<00:03:30.660> developers<00:03:31.170> are<00:03:31.470> can

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
know that some of our developers are can

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.039 
know that some of our developers are can
dual<00:03:32.340> boot<00:03:32.519> into<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.060> into<00:03:33.299> Android<00:03:33.660> but

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
dual boot into this and into Android but

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.629 
dual boot into this and into Android but
certainly<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.769> guys<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.160> been<00:03:35.220> working<00:03:35.280> on

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
certainly the guys have been working on

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.290 
certainly the guys have been working on
this<00:03:35.790> building<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.540> run<00:03:36.750> on

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
this building it to run on

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.870 
this building it to run on
Android<00:03:37.810> hardware<00:03:38.490> but<00:03:39.490> again<00:03:39.580> there's

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
Android hardware but again there's

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.250 
Android hardware but again there's
there's<00:03:40.240> no<00:03:40.360> android<00:03:40.660> on<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:40.900> phone<00:03:41.080> right

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
there's no android on this phone right

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.950 
there's no android on this phone right
now<00:03:41.500> it's<00:03:41.800> it's<00:03:42.430> been<00:03:42.640> you<00:03:43.120> know<00:03:43.210> it's<00:03:43.630> running

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
now it's it's been you know it's running

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.720 
now it's it's been you know it's running
boot<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:44.920> gecko<00:03:44.950> instead<00:03:45.660> okay<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.500> mean

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
boot to gecko instead okay and I mean

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.610 
boot to gecko instead okay and I mean
it's<00:03:48.730> basically<00:03:48.850> java-based<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:50.470> that

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
it's basically java-based is that

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.220 
it's basically java-based is that
correct<00:03:50.950> like<00:03:51.130> they're<00:03:51.280> like<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.240> so<00:03:52.660> the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
correct like they're like that so the

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.820 
correct like they're like that so the

mean our apps built using that set of
technologies

00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:08.249 
technologies

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:09.919 
technologies
they're<00:05:08.399> these<00:05:08.489> open<00:05:08.849> web<00:05:09.359> tech<00:05:09.509> toys<00:05:09.719> but

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:09.929 
they're these open web tech toys but

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:11.479 
they're these open web tech toys but
there's<00:05:10.709> nothing<00:05:10.949> in<00:05:11.039> that<00:05:11.069> that<00:05:11.279> implies

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:11.489 
there's nothing in that that implies

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:12.529 
there's nothing in that that implies
they<00:05:11.699> have<00:05:11.819> to<00:05:11.939> be<00:05:12.029> on<00:05:12.119> a<00:05:12.149> server<00:05:12.419> somewhere

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
they have to be on a server somewhere

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.029 
they have to be on a server somewhere
they<00:05:12.929> can<00:05:12.959> be<00:05:13.199> locally<00:05:13.559> installed<00:05:13.829> on<00:05:14.009> your

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
they can be locally installed on your

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.529 
they can be locally installed on your
phone<00:05:14.159> because<00:05:14.549> there's<00:05:14.699> not<00:05:14.789> like<00:05:14.939> a<00:05:14.969> google

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
phone because there's not like a google

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:16.789 
phone because there's not like a google
chromebook<00:05:15.659> where<00:05:16.109> you're<00:05:16.289> not<00:05:16.409> back<00:05:16.559> to<00:05:16.709> the

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:16.799 
chromebook where you're not back to the

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:18.859 
chromebook where you're not back to the
webview<00:05:17.069> right<00:05:17.459> i<00:05:17.699> mean<00:05:17.729> the<00:05:18.419> line<00:05:18.689> is

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:18.869 
webview right i mean the line is

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:20.179 
webview right i mean the line is
blurring<00:05:19.079> there<00:05:19.319> over<00:05:19.529> a<00:05:19.559> few<00:05:19.709> apps<00:05:19.919> i<00:05:20.039> can

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189 
blurring there over a few apps i can

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.799 
blurring there over a few apps i can
think<00:05:20.279> of<00:05:20.399> that<00:05:20.609> have<00:05:20.849> no<00:05:21.119> component<00:05:21.479> for

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:21.809 
think of that have no component for

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:22.969 
think of that have no component for
which<00:05:21.929> you<00:05:22.049> need<00:05:22.079> an<00:05:22.589> internet<00:05:22.919> connection

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
which you need an internet connection

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.409 
which you need an internet connection
right<00:05:23.429> a<00:05:23.519> lot<00:05:23.639> of<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.789> content<00:05:24.119> comes<00:05:24.269> to<00:05:24.329> the

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
right a lot of the content comes to the

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.449 
right a lot of the content comes to the
web<00:05:24.539> but<00:05:24.659> yeah<00:05:24.989> certainly<00:05:25.229> these<00:05:26.129> can<00:05:26.339> be

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:26.459 
web but yeah certainly these can be

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.189 
web but yeah certainly these can be
locally<00:05:26.879> installed<00:05:27.179> you<00:05:27.479> can<00:05:27.509> use<00:05:27.779> them<00:05:27.989> while

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
locally installed you can use them while

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.499 
locally installed you can use them while
offline<00:05:28.879> but<00:05:29.879> of<00:05:29.939> course<00:05:30.089> everything<00:05:30.359> gets

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
offline but of course everything gets

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:31.699 
offline but of course everything gets
more<00:05:30.659> interesting<00:05:30.839> once<00:05:31.199> it's<00:05:31.349> connected<00:05:31.529> to

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:31.709 
more interesting once it's connected to

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:33.949 
more interesting once it's connected to
the<00:05:31.859> Internet<00:05:32.159> yeah<00:05:32.369> okay<00:05:33.119> and<00:05:33.449> is<00:05:33.719> there<00:05:33.809> any
