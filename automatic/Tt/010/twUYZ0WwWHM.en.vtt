00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello, I'm Carlos, the professional player 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.060
 of baseball and today we're going to talk about 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.700
 some tips on how subsidiaries flight 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.720
 one of the most important steps to 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.000
 catch a flag is the position in which 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.490
 we're going to catch them we should always 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.770
 be in a good position the foot 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.060
 left forward right foot back 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.880
 if you're right if you're left - handed foot 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.960
 right forward and left back 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.660
 depends on the position in which you 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.820
 you are and you have left right always the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.190
 position the glove hand with the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.760
 leg should be forward since it gives you 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.920
 ease 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.050
 to flex 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.780
 and lift the glove and have a good 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.260
 base in the legs is very important 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.059
 very very important not to cover the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.179
 visibility of the ball with the glove 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.649
 we always want to have the visibility of 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.299
 the ball wants to move when the ball 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.229
 enter the glove that is the most important thing 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:04.920
 and secure it with the other hand so that 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.409
 will not fall that is very important 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.860
 the other thing we can talk about is 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.180
 how to go back with the batazos 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.490
 elevated 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.090
 ok we are in ready ready position 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.149
 for for the hit then I want 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.460
 we come if the ball on the left ok 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.429
 we come, we are on our left foot 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.740
 back and we look to run up 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.640
 where will the ball be if the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.009
 launch or the elevated is towards the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.920
 right side now we come and we throw the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.770
 right leg backwards and we rotate and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.690
 we prepare the same left leg 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.770
 front by right back and watching 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.229
 always the ball entering the glove 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.640
 make a small demonstration of how 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.740
 I would do it 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.580
 and left high leg left in front 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.130
 right back flexible always watching the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.950
 ball entering the glove and securing 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.170
 the with both hands we search 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.200
 always seeing in remember very 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.879
 important not to obstruct the view to the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.750
 ball with the glove always keeping 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.690
 the glove on one side watching as the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.250
 ball comes in we always want to do that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.040
 now let's do a little bit towards 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.490
 left that we come backwards we 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.470
 we locate and we take it 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.420
 remember to the left foot 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.270
 left back 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.300
 and from the left we are located and grabbed 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.340
 the ball that goes to the right 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.390
 just now right back 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.480
 we locate them and grab 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.480
 I always remember the visibility always 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.730
 we want to see the ball entering the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.580
 glove these are one of the most steps 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.100
 important since we do not want when 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.410
 let's go back running this way 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.090
 because it's a bit uncomfortable and many 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.950
 Sometimes we can fall and we do not take 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.099
 control of our body 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.340
 so remember we always want 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.319
 maintain a good position and always 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.590
 see the ball entering the glove so I 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.590
 I would
