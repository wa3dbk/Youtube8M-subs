because it is sparkly and I was afraid

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.610 
because it is sparkly and I was afraid
that<00:06:30.880> it<00:06:31.090> would<00:06:31.240> peel<00:06:31.630> some<00:06:31.870> of<00:06:32.080> the<00:06:32.259> glitter

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
that it would peel some of the glitter

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.580 
that it would peel some of the glitter
off<00:06:32.889> once<00:06:33.880> again<00:06:34.030> I<00:06:34.300> also<00:06:34.539> added<00:06:34.900> one<00:06:35.050> of<00:06:35.229> my
