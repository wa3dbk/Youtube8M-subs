00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
basra first i want to address the hydra

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.060 
basra first i want to address the hydra
not<00:00:19.480> being<00:00:19.779> in<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:20.020> game<00:00:20.230> I<00:00:20.500> know<00:00:20.590> a<00:00:20.770> lot<00:00:21.039> of

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
not being in the game I know a lot of

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.800 
not being in the game I know a lot of
people<00:00:21.460> were<00:00:21.550> looking<00:00:21.700> forward<00:00:22.119> to<00:00:22.450> it<00:00:22.630> and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
people were looking forward to it and

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.330 
people were looking forward to it and
there<00:00:22.990> was<00:00:23.110> some<00:00:23.289> youtubers<00:00:23.950> giving

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
there was some youtubers giving

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.549 
there was some youtubers giving
speculation<00:00:25.210> which<00:00:25.450> added<00:00:26.050> a<00:00:26.110> lot<00:00:26.290> of<00:00:26.380> hype

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:26.559 
speculation which added a lot of hype

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.859 
speculation which added a lot of hype
for<00:00:26.950> it<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:27.309> I'm<00:00:27.969> sure<00:00:28.029> some<00:00:28.630> of<00:00:28.660> you<00:00:28.779> were

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
for it and I'm sure some of you were

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.229 
for it and I'm sure some of you were
disappointed<00:00:29.619> but<00:00:29.860> honestly<00:00:30.340> this<00:00:30.669> jet<00:00:30.939> is

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
disappointed but honestly this jet is

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.569 
disappointed but honestly this jet is
awesome<00:00:31.809> in<00:00:32.020> its<00:00:32.169> own<00:00:32.320> right<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:33.070> first<00:00:33.309> thing

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
awesome in its own right the first thing

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.520 
awesome in its own right the first thing
that<00:00:33.700> I<00:00:33.730> noticed<00:00:34.210> was<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.540> acceleration<00:00:34.870> it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
that I noticed was the acceleration it

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.049 
that I noticed was the acceleration it
seems<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:36.129> lot<00:00:36.340> better<00:00:36.550> than<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.879> laser

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
seems a lot better than the laser

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.240 
seems a lot better than the laser
although<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.899> top<00:00:38.110> speed<00:00:38.410> seems<00:00:38.770> very<00:00:39.070> very

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
although the top speed seems very very

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.669 
although the top speed seems very very
similar<00:00:39.760> on<00:00:40.120> top<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.749> the<00:00:40.839> acceleration<00:00:41.649> the

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
similar on top of the acceleration the

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.860 
similar on top of the acceleration the
other<00:00:41.980> controls<00:00:42.460> are<00:00:42.699> very<00:00:42.910> responsive<00:00:43.660> too

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
other controls are very responsive too

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.739 
other controls are very responsive too
so<00:00:44.260> for<00:00:44.469> example<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.129> rudders<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.789> AR<00:00:46.149> on<00:00:46.359> the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:46.749 
so for example the rudders the AR on the

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.079 
so for example the rudders the AR on the
elevators<00:00:47.499> they<00:00:47.890> all<00:00:48.159> respond<00:00:48.730> very<00:00:48.940> quickly

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
elevators they all respond very quickly

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.660 
elevators they all respond very quickly
allowing<00:00:49.929> it<00:00:50.199> to<00:00:50.379> turn<00:00:50.679> and<00:00:51.039> maneuver<00:00:51.190> very

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
allowing it to turn and maneuver very

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.660 
allowing it to turn and maneuver very
easily<00:00:52.359> a<00:00:52.809> lot<00:00:53.260> better<00:00:53.530> than<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.890> laser<00:00:54.100> its

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
easily a lot better than the laser its

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.149 
easily a lot better than the laser its
maneuverability<00:00:55.480> makes<00:00:56.019> this<00:00:56.260> plane<00:00:56.559> awesome

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
maneuverability makes this plane awesome

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.309 
maneuverability makes this plane awesome
for<00:00:57.339> doing<00:00:57.370> Stinson<00:00:58.089> and<00:00:58.329> aerobatics<00:00:59.140> the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
for doing Stinson and aerobatics the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:02.579 
for doing Stinson and aerobatics the
only<00:00:59.829> downside<00:01:00.399> is<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:00.699> huge<00:01:01.479> tail<00:01:01.839> it<00:01:02.199> seems

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
only downside is that huge tail it seems

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.500 
only downside is that huge tail it seems
to<00:01:02.800> stick<00:01:03.069> up<00:01:03.280> a<00:01:03.429> lot<00:01:03.699> more<00:01:03.940> when<00:01:04.120> you're<00:01:04.269> doing

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
to stick up a lot more when you're doing

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.780 
to stick up a lot more when you're doing
stunts<00:01:04.809> than<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.199> lasers<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.520> catches

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
stunts than the lasers and it catches

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.000 
stunts than the lasers and it catches
quite<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.390> bit<00:01:07.630> on<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.290> flip<00:01:08.530> side<00:01:08.560> though<00:01:08.979> the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
quite a bit on the flip side though the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.280 
quite a bit on the flip side though the
wingspan<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:09.909> slightly<00:01:10.240> smaller<00:01:10.690> and<00:01:10.960> the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
wingspan is slightly smaller and the

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.530 
wingspan is slightly smaller and the
length<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.800> plane<00:01:12.040> is<00:01:12.310> massively<00:01:13.119> smaller

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
length of the plane is massively smaller

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.929 
length of the plane is massively smaller
if<00:01:13.840> you're<00:01:14.350> wanting<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:14.920> buy<00:01:15.189> this<00:01:15.250> jet<00:01:15.700> it

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
if you're wanting to buy this jet it

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.450 
if you're wanting to buy this jet it
cost<00:01:16.180> 1.15<00:01:17.170> million<00:01:17.469> although<00:01:18.040> I<00:01:18.070> would

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
cost 1.15 million although I would

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.969 
cost 1.15 million although I would
recommend<00:01:19.149> using<00:01:19.540> content<00:01:20.200> creator<00:01:20.560> or

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
recommend using content creator or

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.429 
recommend using content creator or
single<00:01:21.430> player<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.880> access<00:01:22.090> at<00:01:22.570> first<00:01:22.869> just<00:01:23.259> to

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
single player to access at first just to

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.289 
single player to access at first just to
make<00:01:23.619> sure<00:01:23.649> that<00:01:23.979> you<00:01:24.100> definitely<00:01:24.670> like<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.149> I

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
make sure that you definitely like it I

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.209 
make sure that you definitely like it I
test<00:01:25.780> it<00:01:25.990> out<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.170> bunch<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.740> tricks<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.100> I

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
test it out a bunch of tricks that I

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.310 
test it out a bunch of tricks that I
used<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.670> use<00:01:27.700> in<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.149> laser<00:01:28.390> such<00:01:28.930> as<00:01:29.170> the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
used to use in the laser such as the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.770 
used to use in the laser such as the
reverse<00:01:29.590> takeoff<00:01:30.219> and<00:01:30.520> hover<00:01:30.759> flight<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.509> I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
reverse takeoff and hover flight and I

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.060 
reverse takeoff and hover flight and I
can<00:01:31.990> tell<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.289> right<00:01:32.469> now<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.710> reverse

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
can tell you right now the reverse

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.969 
can tell you right now the reverse
takeoff<00:01:33.880> doesn't<00:01:34.360> work<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.899> same<00:01:34.930> way<00:01:35.170> at<00:01:35.649> all

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
takeoff doesn't work the same way at all

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.429 
takeoff doesn't work the same way at all
just<00:01:36.399> simply<00:01:36.759> because<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.090> that<00:01:37.240> giant<00:01:37.840> thin

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
just simply because of that giant thin

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.099 
just simply because of that giant thin
it's<00:01:39.219> still<00:01:39.640> going<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.149> be<00:01:40.270> possible<00:01:40.899> I<00:01:41.079> think

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
it's still going to be possible I think

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.080 
it's still going to be possible I think
but<00:01:41.799> it's<00:01:42.100> going<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.609> be<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:42.759> lot<00:01:42.969> more

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
but it's going to be a lot more

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.270 
but it's going to be a lot more
challenging<00:01:43.719> the<00:01:44.109> hover<00:01:44.409> flight<00:01:44.829> however

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
challenging the hover flight however

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.999 
challenging the hover flight however
works<00:01:45.700> incredibly<00:01:46.450> nicely<00:01:47.049> it<00:01:47.259> is<00:01:47.289> exactly

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
works incredibly nicely it is exactly

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.099 
works incredibly nicely it is exactly
the<00:01:48.250> same<00:01:48.490> as<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.000> laser<00:01:49.240> from<00:01:49.689> what<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:49.960> could

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
the same as the laser from what I could

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.340 
the same as the laser from what I could
tell<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:51.039> yeah<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.880> mean<00:01:51.969> have<00:01:52.719> a<00:01:52.750> look<00:01:53.079> it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
tell and yeah I mean have a look it
