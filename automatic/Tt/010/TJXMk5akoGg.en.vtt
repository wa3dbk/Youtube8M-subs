00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.440
 to make it more graceful and in 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.290
 As a result, I want to get beautiful 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.629
 thin strips of zucchini I'll 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:46.660
 use ordinary vegetables cleaning 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:49.480
 cut off the ass and removing the top 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 skin layer remove it 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.460
 we start to cut zucchini 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.679
 thin ribbons right in the salad bowl 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.399
 first on one side and then 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:07.240
 go to the other side so we get 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:11.170
 to the core of the seeds which 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.580
 we will no longer need to follow the salad bowl 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.930
 need to chop 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.940
 chili peppers removing seeds from it to 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.690
 don't burn your tongue we cut it 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.690
 thin stripes 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:34.649
 the next ingredient is mint leaves 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:37.740
 they also need to be ground well. 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.179
 tear hands can do it with 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.929
 using a knife 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:48.619
 someone like more and send 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:57.869
 sprinkle it all with lime juice seasoned 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.989
 salad with salt and pepper 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:06.619
 olive oil and stir not 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:08.369
 hesitating at home handles it all 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.280
 You can serve such a salad 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.629
 yourself but you can for example fish and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.359
 or to seafood 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.879
