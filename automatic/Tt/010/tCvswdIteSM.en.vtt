00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.270
 how about three months have passed 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.500
 since we operate open-heartedly to 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.110
 our orchid infested with 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.360
 pillbugs as you can see the 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.249
 the results are unbeatable 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.539
 Pillbugs have not reappeared and 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.539
 we already have a new sheet 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.730
 what we have done during all this time 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.649
 well, very little apart from the risks 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.930
 we just re-applied the anti 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.570
 mealybugs after 15 days of 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.879
 his first treatment this we did 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.850
 simply for making sure we eradicate 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.559
 completely plague in our case and 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.479
 since the orchid has not returned to its 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.089
 original owner where there may be 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.350
 other plants with woodlice we do not have 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.899
 thought to apply again the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.610
 phytosanitary but in our case it would be 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.509
 good idea to do another treatment 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.309
 preventive just before flowering 

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:06.680
 for now and taking advantage of the plant 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.900
 is growing we are going to use a fertilizer 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.799
 foliar every two weeks during the 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.799
 next three months 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.549
 we have opted for this system 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.829
 since the roots of this orchid still 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.450
 they have not grown enough and it would be a 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.539
 waste using a root fertilizer 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.820
 in this case we used foliar fertilizer 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.799
 Activator that is ready for use 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.750
 but as there are other 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.329
 alternatives that do not come prepared 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.250
 like the platinum fertilizer of flower os 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.380
 We are going to show you how to make the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.110
 dosages efficiently 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.539
 this brand recommends using medium 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.210
 stopper for every 4 liters of water for your 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.509
 application via foliar but like us 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.819
 we will only use 0.05 liters of water each 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.890
 two weeks we will use the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.750
 Dosing calculator is that we have 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.620
 created for you in botany and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.620
 dotcom gardens 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.960
 on the website you have instructions 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.570
 detailed how to use said 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.600
 calculator but basically we will do 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.190
 this we pour the platinum subscription in the 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.190
 plug to fill half 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.459
 we extract all the liquid with the help of 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.420
 a syringe and we point the amount of 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.420
 cubic centimeters 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.240
 and then we go to the website 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.210
 we enter in the first field the 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.420
 amount that we have extracted with the 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.610
 syringe in the second field we introduce 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.310
 4 what is the amount of liters 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.650
 recommended by flower in the third 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.700
 field we put the amount of water that 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.260
 we have planned to use about 0.05 liters and 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.260
 we click on the send button 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.970
 now we empty the syringe in the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.100
 fertilizer container until you reach the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.010
 final amount that we have obtained as 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.150
 result in this case one centimeter 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.200
 cubic and the rest we pour it in 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.200
 our sprayer 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.410
 finally we dilute it with water 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.090
 be possible distilled and we apply it 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.090
 as shown above 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.520
 maybe you are wondering why not 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.310
 We completely fill the sprayer and 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.350
 so we save ourselves work because 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.240
 once the fertilizer is diluted and enters 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.390
 contact sunlight can 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.490
 degrade losing effectiveness stay in 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.170
 account that the calculations have been made 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.870
 to deal with an activity with a 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.270
 spray every two weeks then 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.790
 we would have to repeat the whole process 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.040
 If you want to make the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.739
 procedure with more orchids by 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.290
 example 4 you would have to use the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.960
 amount of 0.2 liters of water 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.520
 approximately a glass of nocilla in the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.520
 third box of our calculator 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:35.059
 it's been clear, remember that in 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:37.129
 botany and gardens dotcom 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.629
 you can read a summary of this chapter 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.029
 along with some little tricks 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:43.009
 Additional and we also have to 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.809
 your layout a dedicated section 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:49.209
 to the videos in our forum 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:49.209
 questions and answers until next time 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.520
