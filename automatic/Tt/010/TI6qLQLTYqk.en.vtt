00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello today i will show how 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:12.519
 to establish 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:17.009
 I will cross the bathroom for a curtain before 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.009
 I had such a crossbar 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.590
 changes its length 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.289
 inside this spring is somehow 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.160
 I hung it for some 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.769
 the number of years is quite successful but then 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.640
 beginnings 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:44.100
 I did not like to periodically fall 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:49.059
 I decided to buy a new well, why looked 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:53.340
 the store that same cost them from 500 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:58.059
 rubles and up to one and a half even 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:03.600
 2000 I saw well and extremely design 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:07.299
 unreliable I gave such a buy and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.720
 bought went the other way he bought just 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:17.250
 such a pipe with a wall diameter of 25 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.670
 millimeter made of steel 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.900
 chromed have different lengths in 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.900
 the store such pipes 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:34.900
 specifically, it cost one and a half meters 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.670
 only 197 rubles plus me bought such 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:44.590
 here are two pipe holders 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.460
 each at 18 rubles first 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.030
 designs will be much safer 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:58.840
 secondly, the price is almost at least 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:01.090
 2 times lower , so let's get started 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 directly to install i'm here 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:17.110
 marked the point where our center will be 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:20.700
 rungs so now mark the places 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.700
 where are our holes 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:38.670
 so now we will drill drill 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:44.849
 special drill bit on tile 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.609
 my wall allows me to drill everything 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.689
 hole with this drill if not allowed 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:58.639
 then first we drill the tiles we pass 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:03:01.470
 here is a special drill then with the topic 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:04.980
 Drill the usual drill and and be sure 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.730
 check that she was standing on the drill 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.359
 normal mode they are on a blow not so 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.359
 let's get started 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:47.689
 so drill a hole insert 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:50.049
 dowels and the same thing is done on the other 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.049
 parties 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:59.480
 then immediately we put in fasteners 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:06.069
 fixed there is a cog so they 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.069
 hang out and then we can not wear them 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.579
 so do not forget to wear 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:27.340
 rings 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:27.340
 gas hinge immediately fixture 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:47.190
 and strictly speaking fasten our 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:58.530
 crossbar first baited with 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:05:11.400
 one country but it certainly is not very 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:17.370
 convenient to do well and then from another country 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:38.090
 and so baited now everyone else 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:41.370
 screws twist everything is ready so for 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.910
 short time and for very small 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.940
 money can be set like this 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.150
 wonderful crossbar for curtains 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:55.520
