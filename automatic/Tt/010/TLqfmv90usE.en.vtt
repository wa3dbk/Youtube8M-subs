with the tag we do this from three to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.770 
with the tag we do this from three to
six<00:01:47.350> times<00:01:47.650> now<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:49.090> depends<00:01:49.480> on<00:01:49.660> the

six times now that depends on the

six times now that depends on the
breaking<00:01:50.170> strain<00:01:50.410> will<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.650> thickness<00:01:51.010> of

they're<00:01:53.680> more<00:01:53.860> flexible<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.550> so<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.970> more

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
they're more flexible it is so the more

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.780 
they're more flexible it is so the more
reps<00:01:55.330> we<00:01:55.540> use<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.710> heavy<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.130> line<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.670> use

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
reps we use the heavy of the line we use

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.220 
reps we use the heavy of the line we use
less<00:01:58.000> wraps<00:01:58.270> because<00:01:58.480> there's<00:01:58.870> more<00:01:59.020> friction

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
less wraps because there's more friction

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.050 
less wraps because there's more friction
in<00:01:59.620> forming<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.130> nut<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:00.580> we<00:02:00.730> reduce<00:02:00.880> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
in forming the nut so we reduce the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.990 
in forming the nut so we reduce the
number<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:01.480> reps<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:03.280> go<00:02:03.430> around<00:02:03.670> once

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
number of reps so we go around once

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.920 
number of reps so we go around once
twice<00:02:04.950> three<00:02:05.950> times<00:02:05.980> and<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:07.180> line<00:02:07.420> being<00:02:07.810> in

twice three times and this line being in

twice three times and this line being in

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.660 
the middle of the range big around four
times<00:02:09.759> okay<00:02:10.569> then<00:02:11.230> we<00:02:11.470> thread<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.890> line<00:02:12.099> right

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
times okay then we thread the line right

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.080 
times okay then we thread the line right
through<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.060> center<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.629> configuration

through the center of this configuration

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.149 
through the center of this configuration
hold<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.420> hold<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.110> tag<00:02:17.349> of<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> line<00:02:17.860> between

hold it hold the tag of the line between

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
the middle finger and the thumb and we

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.100 
the middle finger and the thumb and we
simply<00:02:21.580> close<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:21.940> knot<00:02:22.269> up<00:02:22.420> like<00:02:22.659> that<00:02:22.840> and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
simply close the knot up like that and

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.800 
simply close the knot up like that and
there<00:02:24.040> we<00:02:24.129> have<00:02:24.159> a<00:02:24.519> perfect<00:02:24.909> example<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.659> a
