00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
here and maybe part 2 will be

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.500 
here and maybe part 2 will be
reassembling<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.489> computer<00:02:34.879> if<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.330> can

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
reassembling the computer if I can

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.170 
reassembling the computer if I can
remember<00:02:35.780> how<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.110> put<00:02:36.349> together<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.830> laptop

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
remember how to put together this laptop

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.400 
remember how to put together this laptop
now<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.239> bolts<00:02:38.540> close<00:02:38.750> here<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.110> here<00:02:39.319> and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
now the bolts close here and here and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.440 
now the bolts close here and here and
there<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.709> wiring<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:41.030> plugged<00:02:41.299> into

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
there and wiring it's plugged into

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.619 
there and wiring it's plugged into
certain<00:02:41.750> places<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.379> as<00:02:43.160> we<00:02:43.310> wrote<00:02:43.519> it<00:02:43.670> in<00:02:44.480> a

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
certain places and as we wrote it in a

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.410 
certain places and as we wrote it in a
proper<00:02:44.840> way<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.349> guess<00:02:45.530> by<00:02:45.560> trial<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.099> error

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
proper way so I guess by trial and error

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.119 
proper way so I guess by trial and error
took<00:02:47.420> me<00:02:47.569> about<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.780> half<00:02:47.870> hour<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.500> disassemble

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
took me about a half hour to disassemble

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.479 
took me about a half hour to disassemble
the<00:02:49.849> laptop<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.269> what<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.450> see<00:02:50.629> now<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.489> should

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
the laptop to what you see now I should

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.990 
the laptop to what you see now I should
remove<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:52.940> board<00:02:53.239> by<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.450> way<00:02:53.769> but<00:02:55.000> I've

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
remove this board by the way but I've

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.150 
remove this board by the way but I've
realized<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.599> can<00:02:56.799> access<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.040> know

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
realized that I can access the you know

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.830 
realized that I can access the you know
do<00:02:58.579> I<00:02:58.609> just<00:02:58.879> put<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.150> bit<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.359> strain<00:02:59.569> here

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
do I just put in a bit of strain here

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.860 
do I just put in a bit of strain here
and<00:03:00.489> lift<00:03:01.489> them<00:03:01.640> up<00:03:01.819> and<00:03:02.030> already<00:03:02.329> solder<00:03:02.750> this

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
and lift them up and already solder this

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.640 
and lift them up and already solder this
area<00:03:03.140> here<00:03:03.379> here<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:05.410> remember<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.530> last

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
area here here is the remember the last

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.420 
area here here is the remember the last
video<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.950> did<00:03:07.099> here<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:09.799> battery<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.310> I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
video I did here is the battery that I

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.970 
video I did here is the battery that I
replaced<00:03:10.880> by<00:03:11.569> prying<00:03:12.139> up<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:12.470> remember<00:03:12.650> what

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
replaced by prying up on I remember what

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.830 
replaced by prying up on I remember what
I<00:03:13.040> did<00:03:13.069> last<00:03:13.220> time<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.090> last<00:03:14.450> video<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:14.780> did

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
I did last time in the last video I did

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.259 
I did last time in the last video I did
on<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:15.560> one<00:03:15.620> anyway<00:03:16.010> there's<00:03:16.790> no<00:03:16.970> problem

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
on this one anyway there's no problem

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.449 
on this one anyway there's no problem
getting<00:03:17.420> access<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:17.930> battery<00:03:18.349> ground<00:03:18.620> as

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
getting access to that battery ground as

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.890 
getting access to that battery ground as
you<00:03:19.670> can<00:03:19.849> see<00:03:20.109> widel<00:03:21.489> anyway<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:23.660> will<00:03:23.810> be

here's<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.830> remnants<00:03:37.190> of<00:03:37.250> where<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.400> just

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
here's the remnants of where I just

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.020 
here's the remnants of where I just
pulled<00:03:37.820> out<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:39.590> laptop<00:03:39.980> it's<00:03:40.550> in<00:03:40.730> several

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
pulled out of the laptop it's in several

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.420 
pulled out of the laptop it's in several
pieces<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.420> uh<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:42.050> know<00:03:42.830> what<00:03:42.980> kind<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.190> solder

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
pieces and uh I know what kind of solder

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.270 
pieces and uh I know what kind of solder
to<00:03:43.580> use<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.060> wasn't<00:03:44.740> very<00:03:45.740> difficult<00:03:46.190> to

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
to use but it wasn't very difficult to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.020 
to use but it wasn't very difficult to
melt<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:48.100> very<00:03:49.100> difficult<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.640> remove<00:03:49.880> with

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
melt and very difficult to remove with

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.940 
melt and very difficult to remove with
the<00:03:50.120> solder<00:03:50.330> sucker<00:03:51.850> anyway<00:03:52.850> that's<00:03:53.950> that's

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
the solder sucker anyway that's that's

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.150 
the solder sucker anyway that's that's
it<00:03:55.130> for<00:03:55.280> part<00:03:55.310> 1<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:56.500> get<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.530> try<00:03:57.740> to<00:03:57.800> remove<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
it for part 1 I get a try to remove the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.530 
it for part 1 I get a try to remove the
rest<00:03:58.250> of<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.430> solder<00:03:58.610> note<00:03:58.820> of<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.000> holes<00:03:59.210> as

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
rest of the solder note of the holes as

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.530 
rest of the solder note of the holes as
best<00:03:59.810> I<00:03:59.930> can<00:03:59.990> and<00:04:00.370> wait<00:04:01.370> for<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.580> part<00:04:01.730> thanks

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
best I can and wait for the part thanks

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:11.860 
best I can and wait for the part thanks
for<00:04:02.660> watching
