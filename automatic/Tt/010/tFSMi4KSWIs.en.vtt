00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:15.420
 hello you just finished concerts 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.550
 how can you hardly say what kind of 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.420
 between Russian and European and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.420
 american audience 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:33.329
 it's very hard to tell the audience like me 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.329
 seems beef or 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.460
 you have no contact during the concert 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.870
 it depends more like musicians than 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.660
 which vitoria 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.289
 if you managed to catch her during 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.030
 concert 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.210
 it means she 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.530
 grateful sushi 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.530
 if the concert is unsuccessful 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.830
 such a mini mouse. 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.830
 than 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.690
 how often do you update the program 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.450
 there will be a very difficult question and you will burn 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.900
 plus all include some new ones 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.900
 works 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.060
 actually at about twice 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.060
 will be 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.299
 you play a lot of method you still to them 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.900
 I fill up in Moscow 3 festivals about 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.729
 the doctors 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:37.530
 he is your favorite composer 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:42.280
 it you believe the matter is that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.310
 field with the composer red for 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.039
 life changes first love one 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:56.140
 then puke and other courses change 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:59.819
 living and thinking about him fell in love 15 back 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.819
 Yandex is stored until now 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.159
 I just think that the composer is German for 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.019
 Besides 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.550
 company thieves are very undervalued 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:16.180
 8th you too little 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.950
 it is unique in many of ours 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.660
 my modesty 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.220
 in their singularity and of course 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.239
 belonging directly to two cultures 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.769
 short to german it is absolutely 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.140
 Russian spirit and pens had this very 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.340
 clear german structure german form 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.700
 and German craftsmanship 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.700
 so said 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.580
 the main thing is very difficult to say this is mine 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.650
 probably should be applied to the largest 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.320
 love 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.170
 together with a very famous pianist 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.630
 Boris Berezovsky is not an oligarch small 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.100
 leaf boris 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.850
 who pointed out together went to school 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.880

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.190

 we performed thrice invites successfully 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.500
 here is a musician Kondratovich 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.319
 first of all 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.740
 unique noise plan 100 gold and 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.540
 which 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.540
 true simulator general is what we 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.090

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.920
 model from germany snowflake on each we 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.630
 To many leagues, others means them 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:49.510
 there is a Russian slightly soprano 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:52.209
 You can wrap list musician we 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.130
 glad we did it but it seems that 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.300
 it somehow contributed to popularization i 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.660
 tell you another steve to fly and cunning 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.880
 and made for firm nikkor pussy pants 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.420
 dedicated to the anniversary there only stopped 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.240
 matt horrible broader russian theme 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.870
 music in exile since this too 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.479
 Russian migration 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.479
 we will try them in Russia through 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.479
 same germany in france there baths 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.509
 it was generally so central 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.630
 festival every concert memorable but 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:38.259
 besides there they played and sang skull 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.259
 Rakhmani of course 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.090
 many other Russian composers 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.090
 which their lizatsii 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.710
 Russian school introduced as Russian 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.610
 Ballet school is considered one of the most 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:00.270
 the best in the world how do you nod anything 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.979
 changed or what difference can still 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:09.139
 be between russian american or 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:09.139
 another school I think Russian school and 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.430
 so different russian pianists 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:23.830
 so slow pages cue rihter 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:27.780
 different from each other what you say 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:31.380
 some kind of single school i just countries 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.380
 it's all just 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.750
 There is a lot of pianist in Russia 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.550
 big country 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.040
 Nashensky pianist flooded remembered 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.960
 of America that gives to talk 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.960
 where's the cooler luxury i think you're not 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:56.970
 what is the most important event in your 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:56.970
 artistic life of their blog 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:07.779
 after it is difficult to say it is very difficult 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:07.779
 the question is because life is daily so 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.139
 depending on what you mean now 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.979
 Minaki 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:25.180
 my kind of professional life or 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:27.279
 my inner life is everything 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.340
 We also professionally professionally 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:32.039
 no there will be a simple question because 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.050
 probably still a big role 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:40.259

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.259
 Navarre 92 year 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.420
 then 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.090
 minutes 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:51.759
 began to develop the so-called Korea 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:00.650
 it served just became points because 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:06.040
