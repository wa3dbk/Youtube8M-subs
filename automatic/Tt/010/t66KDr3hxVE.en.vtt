 daily of this mode of transport 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.259
 it allows to apprehend without fear the car traffic

 to you to believe that they are today 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.990
 but not strictly speaking but she adds 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.420
 however manny edmonds not it's free 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.150
 of this size in urban traffic this is not acceptable to an easier 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.070
 for example when traveling the shortest distances widely 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 for fear of destabilizing cyclists for the fraudster 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.060
 before leaving his stop the driver will give sufficient time to 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.860
 cyclists 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 for montpellier 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
 cyclists will clearly express their intentions 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 he will ensure the safety of travelers 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.510
 traveler who me

 world got off the bus 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:13.399
 in any case, visual contact is often a guarantee of security while 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.169
 like the ability to put oneself in the other's shoes 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.169
 and besides if we changed point of view 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.869
 do you check the cyclists in our image too cruel experience 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:38.979
 by bike still quite at the world panting pace 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.050
 worse some things that I noticed that 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.050
 I did not have to do 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.109
 others might be more courteous to cyclists 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.109
 they are still still two floors is low 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.669

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.169
 either to 6 seats the fantastic line experience that I understand better 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.539
 now the position of the Swiss driver who must drive a machine 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:09.619
 huge next to the little bike I think with a little respect 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:13.459
 reciprocal and a little good will it is possible to live together 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.119
 harmoniously in this big city 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.219
