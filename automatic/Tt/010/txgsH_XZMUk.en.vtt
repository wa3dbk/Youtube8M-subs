00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
smaller than it actually is this is the

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.219 
smaller than it actually is this is the
same<00:01:08.799> size<00:01:09.009> as<00:01:09.369> that<00:01:09.400> huge<00:01:10.150> new<00:01:10.450> Honda<00:01:10.840> Accord

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.480 
same size as that huge new Honda Accord
and<00:01:11.590> yet<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.689> looks<00:01:13.750> like<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.439> much<00:01:14.770> smaller<00:01:15.070> car

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
and yet it looks like a much smaller car

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.929 
and yet it looks like a much smaller car
now<00:01:16.030> part<00:01:16.450> of<00:01:16.540> that<00:01:16.720> looking<00:01:17.020> smaller<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:18.640> this

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
now part of that looking smaller is this

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.149 
now part of that looking smaller is this
rear<00:01:19.240> end<00:01:19.479> which<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:19.869> cut<00:01:20.110> off<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.740> little

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
rear end which is cut off and a little

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.880 
rear end which is cut off and a little
bit<00:01:21.369> concave<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.119> then<00:01:23.110> somehow<00:01:23.590> these

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
bit concave and then somehow these

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.420 
bit concave and then somehow these
taillights<00:01:24.190> that<00:01:25.620> they<00:01:26.620> don't<00:01:26.860> relate<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.340> the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
taillights that they don't relate to the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.980 
taillights that they don't relate to the
front<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.790> car<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.450> think<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.840> they

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
front of the car and you think that they

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.250 
front of the car and you think that they
would<00:01:29.140> be<00:01:29.200> strange<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.220> yet<00:01:30.520> somehow<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.960> all

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
would be strange and yet somehow it all

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.340 
would be strange and yet somehow it all
does<00:01:32.560> work<00:01:32.800> together<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:34.000> you<00:01:34.060> have<00:01:34.240> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
does work together then you have that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.490 
does work together then you have that
