00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 so early in the season but that's why 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.170
 this is no less the Bruges burenduel 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.610
 intensely interesting or surprisingly certain 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.990
 if you like michel 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.880
 preud'homme view 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.860
 there is room again in front of rear by t 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.630
 replace them with mechelen and dresses 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.699
 soap midfield is only 8 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.279
 minutes the plays in the competition and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.390
 with vazquez and storm on paper as a flank 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.220
 attackers 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 bitch uncle said that idea last weekend 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.199
 expect his flanks well Sobotta 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.910
 and the lesbians are sitting on the couch 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.560
 We have stronger Lorenzo Staelens on 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.300
 the midfield and the offensive 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.250
 compartment modified 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.230
 the german composer sukuta gets them the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.390
 is the base place just like thibaut van 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.489
 acker against his former club 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.980
 the dutch codee is back after its 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.390
 red card on none and this is the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.260
 tonight's referee 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.260
 yuri van de velde 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.840
 20 played in half a minute before then 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.360
 dominican club with some more 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.629
 pace the last minutes a good one 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.030
 combinations occasionally but it is tight 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.729
 and well close in the back at cercle brugge 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.150
 and i had such now here is vazquez 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.900
 with them offense of course from Joey 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.660
 goodness 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.890
 first yellow card of the match and them 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.090
 clear 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.910
 victor vazquez aside what can for the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.960
 left of the laurens the bock are whole 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.180
 leave 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.369
 the ball sticks work in the corner 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.020
 Anne looked at it 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.460
 nicolas excellent free kick 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.440
 castillo 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.479
 rotated exactly in the corner around the wall 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.100
 but it was always excellent 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.750
 opportunity for flat 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.750
 we are almost as fast as week d 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.560
 hour and english the bridges that circle 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.110
 drink the big chances all the way back 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.229
 are certainly not there yet on that free kick 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 from the castillo just after it 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.539
 There is no doubt that field supremacy is there 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.100
 club with the bok nikola cross 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.070
 storm is not coming 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.500
 burg j with a half kick and then were 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.740
 he held true storm thereby 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.280
 permission that you do do with the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.310
 put another castillo in the post 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.310
 the phosphoric for got broken after 28 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.780
 almost 29 minutes footballer 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.870
 cercle got harder and harder 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.300
 more difficult and yet more nicolas castillo 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.450
 third goal in the competition 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.480
 plus the two in europe 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.549
 good paul of wage j and then the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.290
 Kastiop anyway on I because the stef 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.510
 wils just too small to straighten the ball 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.870
 buy here we'll see that again 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.379
 give holy and there is commandment 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.379
 noble pants 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.670
 and good English ball in by 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.519
 Nikola storm you can also amount 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.610
 he can so we are there and the dial 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.549
 then for the to the corner just that exactly 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.590
 enough and I had that 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.090
 you send them forward and then you control them 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.819
 also a long ball to castillo good 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.260
 control of the sled and the rescue of 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.450
 mememe 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.459
 in the added time of the first 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.409
 half was close to his second 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.090
 goal 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.099
 nicolas castillo what a handsome build 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.909
 was that from a fernando him and I had 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.980
 so and so it is not second omar but one 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.359
 goal at rest 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.359
 earned lead carrots Brugge 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.120
 after standing deep basses with it 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.099
 slightly more than at the start of the second half 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.379
 6 minutes played corner kick for cercle 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:40.139
 Brugge it calls him to the second pole 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:42.629
 and there is, and so comes again 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.669
 and now with the promotion 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.510
 possibly then light outside because 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:50.819
 there is the cross possible and the cabal 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.790
 and no so call if you have it 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.930
 try the first big chance for cercle 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.500
 Brugge that goes looking for the one here 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.060
 a 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.060
 at the start of the second half 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.670
 victor vazquez on the left 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.900
 vazquez passes through the goal line and 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.900
 the tot americas so is just about 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.709
 a club Brugge also has one like that 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.139
 good chance at the start of the second 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.600
 half eighth are me now 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.580
 Paske is sometimes more kakarot of roses 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.560
 has been on the pitch for less than half a minute 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.110
 as a replacement for cornelis then the 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.880
 you work away then I am so could have been 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.650
 header not good enough to point as 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.470
 poorly played and therefore easy 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.550
 picked up by type bustling is the kroaat 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:47.150
 and there is kabananga water it slides 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.979
 the ball through the legs of mathew ryan and 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.960
 given away ball in midfield 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.960
 Club Brugge and this is the result 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.289
 second goal against Club Brugge 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.970
 this competition 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.520
 for the first time in-house and 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.560
 of course no offside came junior 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.570
 kabananga 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.570
 against a pass 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.340
 by mamma mia scoop the ball up to 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.169
 nikola storm but i hit the axial too 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.380
 goal line but try twice 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.039
 now seems back for voskes that's that 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.039
 dresses together 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.580
 and storm the ball is beautiful foil 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.710
 she dresses it is english that gets in the way 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.560
 state 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.030
 vazquez puts the ball at the bin that 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.979
 corner kick 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.539
 cross to the second post and there is 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.370
 the where t 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.160
 and it must be picked up by a 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.410
 Castillo still enters that wooden lane 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.030
 and then a low cross with no one 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.050
 can 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.400
 that must not have been the intention 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.669
 I guess but it was best 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.669
 dangerous 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.349
 to the annoyance of and michel preud'homme 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.169
 you want with the header where is castillo 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.920
 who may prepare the 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:11.430
 sports stars may as place 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.430
 globe by nicolas castillo 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.030
 precede unique outbreak possibility 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.980
 club Brugge 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.110
 the last chance of the competition and this 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.340
 is of course the reaction of the michel 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.380
 preud'homme 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.530
 suddenly it went fast and suddenly the 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.240
 walk all the way for picking around that nervous 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.730
 game in the end still too 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.420
 but can studio master the master 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.850
 about this is the very last chance for 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.550
 club brugge without a doubt free kick 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:43.510
 victor vazquez 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.450
 with orgy tsja and with werner 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:49.120
 it can't be long now where he is 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.820
 caught me out and there she is with your 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.230
 eyes' with the head coming out of his eyes 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.420
 end of the game end of one 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.480
 fiercely fought very nervous 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.130
 match and what a frustrating one 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.140
 a michel preud'homme an entire club 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.840
 Brugge they had everything under control 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.540
 but then gave that lead 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.160
 bowled second point loss open 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.280
 two match days become club for it 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.110
 first at home and for cycling this is it 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.790
 third draw of the season 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.190
 a point near the neighborhood that I feel here 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.150
 well as a win of course one 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.150
