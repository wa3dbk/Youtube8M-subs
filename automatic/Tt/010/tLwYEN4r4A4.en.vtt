 theme song from the reporter and I will search 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.520
 then I want to talk here here 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.530
 down 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.159
 Well, you do not want to know what you're lonely. 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.829
 I put it on the site and you can 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.810
 listen if you invest for the middle 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.329
 then gave you click here in this 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.210
 rush in this option here 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.850
 in this different time he pressed on it 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.430
 will have power and you start it or follow 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.590
 he will convert but his commission is 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.610
 fast and begins to download 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.730
 that's when 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.820
 is he he can already put the artist 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.550
 name of the song and he's already on the 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.770
 end of the negotiation is already decided is that 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.240
 it then I case of connection failure 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:31.020
 but it is already available to the NGO is 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.810
 the paid version of this app is more 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.290
 for you to take away the essence of these 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.040
 advertisements things because that's what 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.080
 It's almost a captive blow to me, it's just the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.459
 advertisements that have the advertisements 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.160
 it's very difficult not 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.800
 already collected the odds, but I walked 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.950
 here the download on the link is to harvest when 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.110
 he complete a whole round like 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.250
 he will complete 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.590
 so he can finish completing me 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.770
 back 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.230
 remembering that energy is this method 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.610
 works not only for music but 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.340
 would it be to download a report of all you read 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.100
 it's not 7 it does not matter 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.030
 music he can download from rio 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.299
 in the second one there is 10 thousand volts 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.610
 It's more so then you do not need to 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.239
 worry about time only you see there 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.690
 We chose it and put it for a day. 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.230
 still quite high county in the then a 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.980
 at 50 milliwatts some productions are 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.190
 ending 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.680
 they will finish it by the sixth 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.000
 Here the focus was on how it is she 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.670
 even there the title you can is the type and the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.670
 Business number only as a low one 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.090
 music that did not say if I did not 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.209
 I know when I'm in luck if not this one. 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.670
 artist leaving for what for power could only 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.220
 the artist button again reads 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.930
 back to that artist background 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.290
 so it's cool, you're trying 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.840
 this is here there is 17 death in portugal 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.890
 much more stuff here is just in the 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.489
 paid version 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.729
 So this is what is different is the one that has 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.490
 Here you have the upson option and the 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.070
 third, that's what you are, that's how 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.320
 you just save 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.070
 will open it will already put too much 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.470
 I'll leave 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:38.120
 I noticed is in the top 30 here does not 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:42.170
 You already know how to play the song it does not contain 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:46.100
 gluten could not open the deal 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:51.640
 here then the music and never succeeding 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:05:00.710
 note on twitter a bit vulgar but oo 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:05:03.440
 Sorry, guys. It's not that way. 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.210
 here is collective download this theme is 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.040
 chatinha ChÃ¡vez a long time ago 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.390
 put another name can not save two 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.490
 goals with the same sound 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.970
 we are going to put the hypothesis of a 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:18.290
 artist who did not register there is a 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:26.420
 I will not attack Harry Potter either. 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:29.780
 attack and attack alone there you have to 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:34.310
 go well here is where the third in 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:40.190
 herrera so who will take a 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:42.440
 A little is still playing this option is 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:46.130
 practical you want to buy the app 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:51.050
 of the Portuguese clown that cancel but here already 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.900
 tava of the song is already six in dispute 6 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.520
 I will mount the attack volume harry 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.800
 potter jk 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.140
 so there's the look on harry's music 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.130
 real potter withdraw rights 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.830

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.140
 so that's it galera the big part for 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.040
 to have existed until here gives a liquid 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.680
