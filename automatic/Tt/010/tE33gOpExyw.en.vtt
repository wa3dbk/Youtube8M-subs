I mean God is still guided with Miller
has<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:15.780> been<00:01:16.020> playing<00:01:16.259> us<00:01:16.470> where<00:01:16.799> does<00:01:16.920> he

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
has not been playing us where does he

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.200 
has not been playing us where does he
used<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.380> how

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
used to be then if you think about how

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
used to be then if you think about how
the<00:01:21.210> defense<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.439> opposing<00:01:23.130> teams

concentrate<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.210> Gary<00:01:24.420> DeWitt<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:25.259> they'd

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
concentrate on Gary DeWitt now they'd

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.300 
concentrate on Gary DeWitt now they'd
have<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.189> about<00:01:26.390> Miller<00:01:27.390> there<00:01:27.750> yeah

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
have to think about Miller there yeah

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.300 
have to think about Miller there yeah
good<00:01:29.310> work<00:01:29.549> Charlie<00:01:30.420> put<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> Pixlr<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
good work Charlie put the Pixlr at the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:44.539 
good work Charlie put the Pixlr at the
same<00:01:32.549> game<00:01:42.020> no<00:01:43.020> no<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.950> I'm<00:01:44.070> saying<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.369> it's

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
same game no no what I'm saying is it's

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.149 
same game no no what I'm saying is it's
very<00:01:44.610> difficult<00:01:44.820> because<00:01:45.450> they're<00:01:45.810> both<00:01:46.159> on

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
very difficult because they're both on

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.700 
very difficult because they're both on
the<00:01:47.579> ball<00:01:47.850> scorers<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.869> mean<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.320> least<00:01:49.380> with

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the ball scorers I mean at least with

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.499 
the ball scorers I mean at least with
Gary<00:01:49.979> Moore<00:01:50.280> he's<00:01:50.520> he's<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.390> know

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
Gary Moore he's he's really you know

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.740 
Gary Moore he's he's really you know
create<00:01:51.869> his<00:01:51.990> own<00:01:52.079> shot<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> ball<00:01:52.860> ganyan

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
create his own shot of the ball ganyan

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.389 
create his own shot of the ball ganyan
runs<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> screens<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:55.829> very<00:01:55.920> important

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
runs the screens but it's very important

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.859 
runs the screens but it's very important
for<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> guy<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> point<00:01:57.630> guard

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
for a guy to actually have a point guard

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.340 
for a guy to actually have a point guard
that<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.130> create<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.759> himself<00:01:59.880> okay

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
that that can create for himself okay

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.550 
that that can create for himself okay
really<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.159> can't<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.350> don't

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
really we really can't do it but I don't

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.429 
really we really can't do it but I don't
know<00:02:05.040> who<00:02:05.579> we've<00:02:06.030> seen<00:02:06.360> already<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.079> think<00:02:07.140> this

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
know who we've seen already I think this

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.800 
know who we've seen already I think this
experiment<00:02:07.860> Tamiya<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.910> comparable<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
experiment Tamiya is comparable to the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.850 
experiment Tamiya is comparable to the
experiment<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:11.959> Kagawa<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.140> Miller

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
experiment of Kagawa and Miller

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
experiment of Kagawa and Miller
can<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.580> compared<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.510> they<00:02:15.690> failed

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
can be compared to that that they failed

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.130 
can be compared to that that they failed

that failed maybe button pair has

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.840 
that failed maybe button pair has

are scoring chunks it's something we

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.520 
are scoring chunks it's something we
just<00:03:14.670> have<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.970> figure<00:03:15.120> out<00:03:15.240> how<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.510> we<00:03:16.320> we

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
just have to figure out how to we we

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.260

have no choice but to make it work you
know<00:03:18.300> at<00:03:19.170> least<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.650> believe<00:03:19.920> Gary<00:03:20.250> and

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
know at least I believe Gary and

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.190 
know at least I believe Gary and
weedeater<00:03:20.970> there<00:03:21.270> towards<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.750> end<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:21.990> their

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
weedeater there towards the end of their

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.900 
weedeater there towards the end of their
careers<00:03:22.590> they're<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:22.770> bit<00:03:22.950> older<00:03:23.310> right<00:03:23.520> now<00:03:23.730> so

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
careers they're a bit older right now so

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.660 
careers they're a bit older right now so
hopefully<00:03:24.330> they<00:03:24.720> understand<00:03:25.290> more<00:03:26.250> than<00:03:26.490> just

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
hopefully they understand more than just

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.520 
hopefully they understand more than just
scoring<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.150> course<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.510> know<00:03:27.570> Gary<00:03:27.960> he<00:03:28.260> wants

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
scoring of course I know Gary he wants

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.500 
scoring of course I know Gary he wants
to<00:03:28.650> win<00:03:28.770> first<00:03:29.010> year<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.250> think<00:03:29.850> really<00:03:30.330> also

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
to win first year I think really also

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.840 
to win first year I think really also
does<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.020> they<00:03:31.530> just<00:03:31.710> have<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.980> find<00:03:32.220> ways<00:03:32.820> to

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
does so they just have to find ways to

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.090 
does so they just have to find ways to
it's<00:03:33.690> always<00:03:34.020> about<00:03:34.140> scoring<00:03:34.590> if<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.950> other

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
it's always about scoring if the other

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.660 
it's always about scoring if the other
guys<00:03:35.370> had<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.610> let's<00:03:36.480> go<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.720> him<00:03:36.870> um<00:03:37.670> what

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
guys had that let's go to him um what

00:03:38.670 --> 00:04:15.960

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
then there are games that they actually

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.830 
then there are games that they actually
coexist<00:04:31.370> then<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.760> actually<00:04:32.180> looks<00:04:32.390> nice

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
coexist then it actually looks nice
