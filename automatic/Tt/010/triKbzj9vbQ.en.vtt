and snowing again
so<00:01:41.310> let's<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.909> how<00:01:42.030> she<00:01:42.090> operates<00:01:42.720> so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so let's see how she operates so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830 
so let's see how she operates so
basically<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.340> put<00:01:44.369> your<00:01:44.790> propane<00:01:45.299> tank<00:01:45.630> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
basically you put your propane tank in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.929 
basically you put your propane tank in
the<00:01:45.990> stand<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.470> comes<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.700> screw

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the stand that it comes with you screw

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.480 
the stand that it comes with you screw
the<00:01:48.060> burner<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> tank<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:50.310> has<00:01:50.460> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the burner on to the tank it has a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.530 
the burner on to the tank it has a
little<00:01:50.729> knob<00:01:51.000> here

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
little knob here

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.800 
little knob here
it's<00:01:52.049> on/off<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.580> has<00:01:53.700> got<00:01:53.909> two<00:01:54.360> settings

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
it's on/off now it has got two settings

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.399 
it's on/off now it has got two settings
low<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.560> high<00:01:55.850> like<00:01:56.850> your<00:01:57.090> regular<00:01:57.409> stove

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
low and high like your regular stove

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.679 
low and high like your regular stove
burners<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.670> an<00:01:59.790> electric<00:02:00.180> stove<00:02:00.210> so

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
burners now I have an electric stove so

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.429 
burners now I have an electric stove so
if<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.900> lose<00:02:01.079> power<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.799> can't<00:02:02.579> cook<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.299> my<00:02:04.170> first

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
if I lose power I can't cook so my first

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.590 
if I lose power I can't cook so my first
option<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.040> cook<00:02:05.340> outside<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
option is to cook outside with this and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.569 
option is to cook outside with this and
I'll<00:02:07.380> probably<00:02:07.560> keep<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.459> my<00:02:09.530> FJ<00:02:10.579> bug-out

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
I'll probably keep this in my FJ bug-out

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.880 
I'll probably keep this in my FJ bug-out
vehicle<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.440> want<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> give<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.860> a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
vehicle but I just want to give it a
quick<00:02:14.070> test<00:02:14.280> now<00:02:14.579> so<00:02:14.850> basically<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.390> turn<00:02:15.630> it

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810

is very strong for a full pot of water
and<00:02:33.120> let's<00:02:34.120> see<00:02:34.239> how<00:02:34.299> long<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.569> takes<00:02:34.599> her<00:02:35.080> to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
and let's see how long it takes her to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.610 
and let's see how long it takes her to
come<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> boil<00:02:36.640> now<00:02:37.629> this<00:02:37.810> pot<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.349> little

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
come to a boil now this pot is a little

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.770 
come to a boil now this pot is a little
more<00:02:38.739> than<00:02:38.860> half<00:02:39.040> full<00:02:39.310> with<00:02:39.700> ice-cold<00:02:40.450> water

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
more than half full with ice-cold water

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.580 
more than half full with ice-cold water
from<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.110> tap

from the tap

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.920 
from the tap
I<00:02:41.620> wish<00:02:42.159> use<00:02:42.310> ice-cold<00:02:42.790> water<00:02:43.120> when<00:02:43.329> I<00:02:43.360> test

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
I wish use ice-cold water when I test

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.569 
I wish use ice-cold water when I test
those<00:02:44.230> because<00:02:44.709> it's<00:02:44.890> kind<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.129> replicating

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
those because it's kind of replicating
