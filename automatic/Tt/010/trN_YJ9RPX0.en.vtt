00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.440
 save more tip here for you one 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.110
 little faster than was part of the l 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.330
 the two layers made the cross over 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.670
 left all the yellow corners 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.460
 now you will do is put the four 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 in the place and then we use that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.740
 that I called him 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.380
 Oh and to start doing it without looking 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:35.090
 two corners that have the same thing 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.090
 here for example two oranges behind 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.730
 I could accept 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:51.149
 only you must remember that sometimes 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:01:00.750
 You need to do it again. 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:03.719
 all yellow yellow does not have two 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.150
 corners with the same color 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.119
 and then you put it anyway does the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.060
 l will fall again 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.360
 because there is a way you already accept 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.580
 so here once more does not make it 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.369
 You do the one that changes everything I 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.990
 call utah is the call you 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.909
 is learning here at the beginning 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.509
 in fact to sell that method is 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.479
 the faster the free has another name is the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.290
 m and another thing but I speak only you 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.549
 remember the moment you are going to do 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.500
 letting Marelli not have two 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.329
 corners of the same color that will do this 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.130
 movement that I say is what is the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.930
 Next I'll start with this. 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.939
 piece on the right can be 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.670
 any hot afternoon because they do not even have 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.710
 right order here everything is wrong even from 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.130
 Anyways, I 'll start with this. 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.079
 ask her and she will do 11 here for the course 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.049
 to this movement here 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.560
 I'll bring it over here and move it to the right. 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.640
 There the spin on the top take over there. 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.300
 and then I leave here on the left with 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.310
 Is everything okay there? 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.600
 I'll get this piece here and I'll take it. 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.760
 there on the other side it generates twice as much 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.270
 and now I'm going to make another use 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.580
 do one here so get out there 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.470
 Back to the guys to see that the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:34.620

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.130
 I brought her here I did a revealing 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:50.490
 on the other hand and there I made another so 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:54.120

00:02:50.490 --> 00:03:00.200

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.200
 from the top turn turns twice 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:18.420
 now the ore engine 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:31.920
 Good, nothing's changed 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:40.380
