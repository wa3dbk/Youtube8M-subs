00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.200
 hello this time we're going to decorate a letter 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.880
 the frame of a letter to write 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.220
 what are we going to do the star 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.630
 main will be here so let's go 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.050
 to make space to make a great 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.419
 heart 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.430
 without much being near the shore but 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.430
 more focused on being a heart 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.420
 we fill it up 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.420
 Celeste took a thick 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.300
 and having that we are going to do with pen 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.300
 dwelling 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.160
 a contour of curls we are going to take it out 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.960
 from the center we are going to do 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.040
 curls inwards 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.040
 following the path 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.680
 and then we're going to meet some common 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.440
 we are going to draw styles from 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.400
 middle of these 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:11.880
 something elongated and so 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:16.579
 some twisted backwards 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.579
 some rolled up and longer 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 today we are going to do more for example with 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.399
 this turquoise color we have to look 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.650
 some but it does not matter that they cross 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:37.690
 it separates thus crossed 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.690
 and that they go around where they want 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.010
 and finally we complete with a green 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.720
 take out some in small media and some 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.720
 longer as it is clearer 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.880
 and we have this is the king the king of the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.890
 sheet 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.349
 then the outline that goes from here here 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:11.110
 and here they take out the east contour by the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.580
 bevel that is wide is not about 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.580
 make a straight line 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.069
 up there a bit so it comes out more 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.769
 very big 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.549
 and the same here and a little step towards the 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.549
 other side 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.330
 and this one 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.330
 a piece 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.300
 all the edge we are going to make some 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.430
 little ones with the purple 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.430
 well some bandits 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.829
 mild 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.520
 then with the flow of moles and with 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.540
 all the other two colors with these 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.710
 polka dots as they are spheres and more 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.810
 little ones like 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.810
 as well in a random sense 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.420
 that elevates matching this you want 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.120
 detach the heart and here the end 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:27.490
 they are not so lonely and so sad to be 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:30.750
 like these Chinese little ones 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.250
 well a chinese 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.250
 and the pistils 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.659
 I'm going to say 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.659
 a boy here 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.780
 minerals as well as with a 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.780
 explosion 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.090
 a water conduit happiness 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.910
 and good after 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.030
 there we have 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.030
 our cake outline 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.030
 A) Yes
