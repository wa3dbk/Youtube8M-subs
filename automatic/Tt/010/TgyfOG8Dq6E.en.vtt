00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.360
 Time is the scissors There are no people here. 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.060

 even those who already use the chemical 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.350
 at the time of retouching that as I said is 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.510
 two to three months must do the 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.940
 trade test because for some reason 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.830
 the hair may be weak and there 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.590

 passes during the day arrived of curls he 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.389
 I'll talk a little bit about him, he's the one 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.600
 item sold in the permanent line 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.700
 Afro is great and everyone should use it 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.200
 should use because it really is 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.060
 perfect for not only curly hair 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.360
 chemically treated but also videos 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.410
 and he keeps the hair with the curls 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.220
 defined 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.440
 it reduces the volume to reduce frizz 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.140
 So it was done because my hair is to 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.840
 me, theorge is and even for example 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.000
 No, there are no permanent classes that have 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.550
 more curly hair can use the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.080

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.919
 curly and for having written Afro I think 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.310

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.710

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.169

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.090
