going to show you how to survive after a

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.849 
going to show you how to survive after a
nuclear<00:00:04.980> explosion<00:00:05.660> in<00:00:06.660> your<00:00:06.870> city<00:00:07.080> as<00:00:07.290> you

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
nuclear explosion in your city as you

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.410 
nuclear explosion in your city as you
can<00:00:07.980> see<00:00:08.189> i<00:00:08.400> have<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.639> city<00:00:08.910> here<00:00:09.120> with<00:00:09.300> at

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
can see i have a city here with at

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.370 
can see i have a city here with at
95,000<00:00:10.820> population<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.120> it's<00:00:13.110> fairly

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
95,000 population and it's fairly

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.230 
95,000 population and it's fairly
beautiful<00:00:13.830> at<00:00:13.920> night<00:00:13.950> because<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.610> can't<00:00:14.969> see

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
beautiful at night because you can't see

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.810 
beautiful at night because you can't see
tia<00:00:15.560> nuclear<00:00:16.560> fallout<00:00:16.859> if<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.310> will<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
tia nuclear fallout if you will on the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.330 
tia nuclear fallout if you will on the
ground<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.330> yet<00:00:18.920> you<00:00:19.920> notice<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
ground just yet you notice in the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.509 
ground just yet you notice in the
horizon<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:20.939> finally<00:00:21.600> build<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.990> solar<00:00:22.769> farm<00:00:23.220> on

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
horizon we finally build a solar farm on

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.570 
horizon we finally build a solar farm on
my<00:00:23.670> wife<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:25.830> won't<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.130> building

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
my wife and I so we won't be building

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.220 
my wife and I so we won't be building
any<00:00:26.699> more<00:00:26.820> nuclear<00:00:26.970> power<00:00:27.359> plants<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.960> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
any more nuclear power plants in this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.529 
any more nuclear power plants in this
region<00:00:28.500> map<00:00:28.830> now<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.760> most<00:00:29.910> people<00:00:30.330> if<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
region map now for most people if a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.089 
region map now for most people if a
nuclear<00:00:30.720> explosion<00:00:31.080> happens<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.769> their<00:00:31.890> map

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
nuclear explosion happens on their map

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.370 
nuclear explosion happens on their map
they<00:00:32.460> would<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.850> basically<00:00:33.260> abandon<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
they would just basically abandon the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.830 
they would just basically abandon the
map<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.890> play<00:00:35.790> another<00:00:36.149> city<00:00:36.450> or<00:00:36.540> play

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
map and play another city or play

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
map and play another city or play
another<00:00:36.989> region<00:00:37.440> well<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.739> my<00:00:37.770> case<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.430> really

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
another region well in my case I really

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
another region well in my case I really
didn't<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> option<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.780> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
didn't have the option to do that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.389 
didn't have the option to do that
because<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.410> playing<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.710> my<00:00:40.770> wife<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
because I'm playing with my wife and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.720 
because I'm playing with my wife and
this<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> region<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> develop

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
this is a region that we want to develop

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.389 
this is a region that we want to develop
on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> horizon<00:00:45.030> there<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.660> her<00:00:45.899> city<00:00:46.399> this

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
on the horizon there is her city this

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.970 
on the horizon there is her city this
city<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.360> city<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> had<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> nuclear

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
city is my city now I had a nuclear

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.040 
city is my city now I had a nuclear
power<00:00:50.129> plant<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.730> very<00:00:51.090> early<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> game

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
power plant a very early on in the game

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.860 
power plant a very early on in the game
are<00:00:52.500> located<00:00:52.980> right<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
are located right about here and as you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.479 
are located right about here and as you
can<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> dark<00:00:55.949> areas<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> map

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
can see from the dark areas on the map

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.029 
can see from the dark areas on the map
it<00:00:57.149> exploded<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:58.559> why<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.859> still

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it exploded that's why you can still

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
it exploded that's why you can still
kind<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.670> haze<00:01:00.289> probably<00:01:01.289> caused<00:01:01.469> by

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
kind of see this haze probably caused by

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200 
kind of see this haze probably caused by
nuclear<00:01:01.800> fallout<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.730> pollution<00:01:03.180> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
nuclear fallout and the pollution that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.140 
nuclear fallout and the pollution that
my<00:01:03.510> factories<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.470> generating<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.060> we

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
my factories are generating so if we

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.820 
my factories are generating so if we
look<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> radiation<00:01:07.049> map<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.530> pretty

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
look at the radiation map it's pretty

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.100 
look at the radiation map it's pretty
bad<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> basically<00:01:10.130> half<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.520> map<00:01:11.729> has<00:01:12.030> been

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
bad so basically half of my map has been

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.640 
bad so basically half of my map has been
unusable<00:01:13.700> basically<00:01:14.700> after<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.810> year<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.380> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
unusable basically after a year for in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.700 
unusable basically after a year for in
the<00:01:16.830> game<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.280> I'm<00:01:17.460> currently<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.000> year<00:01:18.390> 16<00:01:18.869> so

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the game and I'm currently in year 16 so

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.280 
the game and I'm currently in year 16 so
basically<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.810> been<00:01:21.869> able<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.110> use

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
basically I have not been able to use

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.289 
basically I have not been able to use
this<00:01:22.409> map<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> vast<00:01:23.580> majority<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
this map for the vast majority of the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.080 
this map for the vast majority of the
time<00:01:24.540> I've<00:01:24.960> been<00:01:24.990> playing<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> city<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:26.759> how

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
time I've been playing the city so how

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.080 
time I've been playing the city so how
do<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.270> survive<00:01:27.600> from<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> nuclear<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.970> know

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
do you survive from a nuclear you know

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.120 
do you survive from a nuclear you know
fallout<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:30.869> nuclear<00:01:31.200> winter<00:01:31.770> whatever<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
fallout or nuclear winter whatever you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980 
fallout or nuclear winter whatever you
want<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> call<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.490> first<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> all<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.659> got<00:01:33.900> to

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
want to call it first of all you got to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.800 
want to call it first of all you got to
secure<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.500> water<00:01:35.310> source<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.600> watch<00:01:36.780> my

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
secure your water source if you watch my

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.390 
secure your water source if you watch my
previous<00:01:37.200> video<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.680> showed<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.100> how<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
previous video I showed you how to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.210 
previous video I showed you how to
create<00:01:39.119> unlimited<00:01:39.689> water<00:01:40.049> source<00:01:40.380> within

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
create unlimited water source within

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
create unlimited water source within
your<00:01:41.400> city<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.570> technique<00:01:43.020> works

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
your city and that technique works

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.200 
your city and that technique works
whether<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.890> ground<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.430> polluted<00:01:45.000> or

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
whether the ground is polluted or

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.700 
whether the ground is polluted or
radioactive<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.040> particular<00:01:47.189> case

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
radioactive so in this particular case

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
radioactive so in this particular case

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
my water treatment plant and my sewage

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.910 
my water treatment plant and my sewage
plant<00:01:51.750> are<00:01:51.869> right<00:01:52.049> next<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.409> each<00:01:52.500> other<00:01:52.710> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
plant are right next to each other you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
plant are right next to each other you
can<00:01:53.040> see<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.250> very<00:01:53.610> heavily<00:01:54.000> polluted<00:01:54.570> it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
can see is very heavily polluted it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.520 
can see is very heavily polluted it's
probably<00:01:55.110> radioactive<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.530> sewage

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
probably radioactive but my sewage

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.709 
probably radioactive but my sewage
treatment<00:01:58.680> plant<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.340> all<00:01:59.909> using<00:02:00.329> filtered

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
treatment plant here all using filtered

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.340 
treatment plant here all using filtered
pumps<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.450> filter<00:02:03.719> out<00:02:03.750> all<00:02:03.899> those

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
pumps and it can filter out all those

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.459 
pumps and it can filter out all those
radiation<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.479> pollution<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
radiation and pollution so that's the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
radiation and pollution so that's the
first<00:02:07.649> thing<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.890> need<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.220> need<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
first thing you need to do need to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.339 
first thing you need to do need to
ensure<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.789> your<00:02:08.910> water<00:02:09.119> supply<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.780> safe

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
ensure that your water supply is safe

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.520 
ensure that your water supply is safe

thing<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.680> want<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.890> do

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
thing you want to do

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.770 
thing you want to do

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
that the CPU into television so you take

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.780 
that the CPU into television so you take
the<00:02:54.780> CPU<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.560> alloy<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.010> plastic<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.670> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the CPU the alloy in the plastic and you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.840 
the CPU the alloy in the plastic and you
produce<00:02:56.970> television<00:02:58.250> what<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.430> ends<00:02:59.790> up

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
produce television what that ends up

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.880 
produce television what that ends up
resulting<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.870> end<00:03:01.080> up<00:03:01.230> making<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.710> lot<00:03:01.860> of

resulting is you end up making a lot of

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.370 
resulting is you end up making a lot of
money<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:03.120> end<00:03:03.300> up<00:03:03.420> making<00:03:03.750> usually<00:03:04.110> anywhere

this city long enough say a few hours
this<00:03:15.690> 26<00:03:16.200> million<00:03:16.410> will<00:03:16.740> actually<00:03:17.100> become<00:03:17.450> 30

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
this 26 million will actually become 30

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.180 
this 26 million will actually become 30
million<00:03:18.810> 40<00:03:19.140> mil<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.500> at<00:03:19.590> some<00:03:19.800> point<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.130> was

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
million 40 mil and at some point it was

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.640 
million 40 mil and at some point it was
actually<00:03:20.520> 57<00:03:21.000> million<00:03:21.209> before<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.320> started

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
actually 57 million before I started

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.530 
actually 57 million before I started
giving<00:03:22.890> away<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.370> money<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.850> my<00:03:24.000> other<00:03:24.120> cities

giving away on money to my other cities

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.030 
giving away on money to my other cities
so<00:03:25.260> as<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.530> see<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.860> monthly

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
so as you can see in the monthly

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.740 
so as you can see in the monthly
transactions<00:03:26.640> here<00:03:26.910> I'm<00:03:27.090> making<00:03:27.510> pretty<00:03:27.660> good

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.080 
you can see my population is located on
the<00:03:42.180> better<00:03:42.780> half<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.590> city<00:03:43.850> you<00:03:44.850> can<00:03:44.970> see

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
the better half of the city you can see

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.699 
the better half of the city you can see
they're<00:03:45.209> basically<00:03:45.540> all<00:03:45.750> mostly<00:03:46.200> high-rise

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
they're basically all mostly high-rise

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.110 
they're basically all mostly high-rise
buildings<00:03:47.220> that's<00:03:47.459> how<00:03:47.550> you<00:03:47.610> can<00:03:47.820> cram

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
buildings that's how you can cram

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.570 
buildings that's how you can cram
ninety-five<00:03:48.660> thousand<00:03:48.989> people<00:03:49.110> in<00:03:49.500> only<00:03:49.890> half

ninety-five thousand people in only half
of<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.910> map<00:03:51.350> another<00:03:52.350> thing<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.590> can<00:03:52.709> do<00:03:52.920> is

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
of the map another thing you can do is

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.770 
of the map another thing you can do is
you<00:03:53.370> can<00:03:53.400> also<00:03:53.610> use<00:03:53.730> believe<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.390> or<00:03:54.480> not<00:03:54.600> are

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
you can also use believe it or not are

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.130 
you can also use believe it or not are
radioactive<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.709> polluted<00:03:56.160> ground<00:03:56.580> as

current<00:04:01.320> system<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:02.070> SimCity<00:04:02.430> but<00:04:02.700> as<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.330> can

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
current system in SimCity but as you can

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.910 
current system in SimCity but as you can
see<00:04:03.600> i<00:04:03.630> built<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.050> sears<00:04:04.290> tower<00:04:04.350> or<00:04:04.830> the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
see i built the sears tower or the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.130 
willis tower you can see the land value
is<00:04:07.530> as<00:04:07.920> high<00:04:08.220> as<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.550> can<00:04:08.670> get<00:04:08.959> there's<00:04:09.959> also

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
is as high as it can get there's also

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.050 
is as high as it can get there's also

to play also radioactive ground or
polluted<00:04:57.699> ground<00:04:57.910> it's<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.150> perfect<00:04:58.360> grand

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750

for<00:04:59.110> your<00:04:59.320> University<00:05:00.750> one<00:05:01.750> of<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.900> things

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
for your University one of the things

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.589 
for your University one of the things
you<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:03.220> will<00:05:03.520> need<00:05:03.789> when<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.419> have<00:05:04.570> a

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
you you will need when you have a

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.620 
you you will need when you have a
nuclear<00:05:04.990> fallout<00:05:05.199> is<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.650> hospital<00:05:06.639> so<00:05:07.330> my

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
nuclear fallout is a hospital so my

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.839 
nuclear fallout is a hospital so my
particular<00:05:08.080> city<00:05:08.289> here<00:05:08.710> since<00:05:09.460> i<00:05:09.550> have<00:05:09.669> a<00:05:09.699> very

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
particular city here since i have a very

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.339 
particular city here since i have a very
beefed<00:05:10.270> up<00:05:10.449> hospital<00:05:11.020> i<00:05:11.340> have<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:13.780> emergency

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
beefed up hospital i have the emergency

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.779 
beefed up hospital i have the emergency
center<00:05:14.740> i<00:05:15.009> have<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:16.120> surgical<00:05:16.690> center<00:05:17.789> that

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
center i have the surgical center that

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.390 
center i have the surgical center that
the<00:05:18.880> diagnostics<00:05:19.660> lab<00:05:19.870> so<00:05:20.500> basically<00:05:21.009> even<00:05:21.310> if

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
the diagnostics lab so basically even if

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.400 
the diagnostics lab so basically even if
my<00:05:21.520> entire<00:05:21.759> city<00:05:22.180> gets<00:05:22.449> sick<00:05:22.720> from<00:05:22.900> this

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
my entire city gets sick from this

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.600 
my entire city gets sick from this
radiation<00:05:23.800> which<00:05:24.130> a<00:05:24.220> lot<00:05:24.340> of<00:05:24.370> them<00:05:24.490> are

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
radiation which a lot of them are

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.939 
radiation which a lot of them are
getting<00:05:24.849> sick<00:05:25.060> my<00:05:25.410> hospital<00:05:26.410> can<00:05:26.590> keep<00:05:26.800> up

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
getting sick my hospital can keep up

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.400 
getting sick my hospital can keep up
with<00:05:27.099> it<00:05:27.389> so<00:05:28.389> that's<00:05:28.570> how<00:05:28.720> i<00:05:28.750> can<00:05:29.050> maintain<00:05:29.199> a

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
with it so that's how i can maintain a

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.879 
with it so that's how i can maintain a
population<00:05:29.620> of<00:05:30.070> 95,000<00:05:30.880> even<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.180> half<00:05:31.449> of<00:05:31.510> my

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
population of 95,000 even the half of my

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.920 
population of 95,000 even the half of my
city<00:05:32.889> map<00:05:33.159> is<00:05:33.430> radioactive<00:05:34.389> and<00:05:34.570> highly

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
city map is radioactive and highly

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.700 
city map is radioactive and highly
highly<00:05:35.199> polluted<00:05:37.139> you<00:05:38.139> know<00:05:38.260> you<00:05:38.320> can

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
highly polluted you know you can

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.250 
highly polluted you know you can
research<00:05:39.070> how<00:05:39.370> to<00:05:39.479> improve<00:05:40.479> the<00:05:40.659> ground<00:05:40.900> such

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
won't cut it I mean I planted trees here

won't cut it I mean I planted trees here
many<00:05:54.729> many<00:05:54.820> many<00:05:55.120> times<00:05:55.419> but<00:05:55.570> basically<00:05:55.870> given

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
many many many times but basically given

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.200 
many many many times but basically given
up<00:05:56.229> on<00:05:56.380> it<00:05:56.560> I<00:05:56.710> know<00:05:57.250> somebody<00:05:57.669> on<00:05:57.759> the<00:05:57.849> internet

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
up on it I know somebody on the internet

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.240 
up on it I know somebody on the internet
road<00:05:58.389> that<00:05:58.570> it<00:05:58.659> takes<00:05:58.840> 34<00:05:59.289> years<00:05:59.530> maybe<00:06:00.099> it

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
road that it takes 34 years maybe it

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.670 
road that it takes 34 years maybe it
does<00:06:00.430> i'm<00:06:00.669> only<00:06:00.820> in<00:06:01.080> you<00:06:02.080> know<00:06:02.199> technically

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
does i'm only in you know technically

does i'm only in you know technically
year<00:06:03.009> 12<00:06:03.400> since<00:06:03.759> my<00:06:03.970> nuclear<00:06:04.750> reactor

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
year 12 since my nuclear reactor

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.409 
year 12 since my nuclear reactor
exploded<00:06:05.650> so<00:06:06.039> I've<00:06:06.520> got<00:06:06.699> quite<00:06:06.849> a<00:06:06.970> ways<00:06:07.210> to<00:06:07.240> go

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
exploded so I've got quite a ways to go

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.050 
exploded so I've got quite a ways to go
so<00:06:07.810> perhaps<00:06:08.590> at<00:06:08.889> a<00:06:08.919> later<00:06:09.130> time<00:06:09.220> I'll<00:06:09.520> replant

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
so perhaps at a later time I'll replant

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.689 
so perhaps at a later time I'll replant
those<00:06:10.720> trees<00:06:11.020> but<00:06:11.650> as<00:06:11.740> you<00:06:11.800> can<00:06:11.919> see<00:06:12.099> my<00:06:12.370> city

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
those trees but as you can see my city

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.629 
those trees but as you can see my city
is<00:06:12.789> driving<00:06:13.530> got<00:06:14.530> lots<00:06:14.889> of<00:06:15.159> high-rise

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
is driving got lots of high-rise

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.719 
is driving got lots of high-rise
buildings<00:06:16.180> I<00:06:17.159> basically<00:06:18.159> research

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
buildings I basically research

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.159 
buildings I basically research
everything<00:06:19.210> that<00:06:19.240> can<00:06:19.449> be<00:06:19.509> research<00:06:19.930> in<00:06:20.050> the

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
everything that can be research in the

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:21.779 
everything that can be research in the
game<00:06:20.380> as<00:06:20.590> far<00:06:20.740> as<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:20.949> university<00:06:21.280> goes<00:06:21.610> so

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
game as far as the university goes so

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.550 
game as far as the university goes so
there's<00:06:21.970> really<00:06:22.090> nothing<00:06:22.539> for<00:06:22.750> me<00:06:23.259> to<00:06:23.380> do

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
there's really nothing for me to do

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.560 
there's really nothing for me to do
other<00:06:23.740> than<00:06:23.800> collect<00:06:24.340> money<00:06:24.580> in<00:06:25.150> this<00:06:25.330> city

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
other than collect money in this city

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.510 
other than collect money in this city
and<00:06:25.659> transfer<00:06:26.349> it<00:06:26.380> to<00:06:26.500> my<00:06:26.680> other<00:06:27.070> cities

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
and transfer it to my other cities

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.640 
and transfer it to my other cities
anyway<00:06:28.419> this<00:06:28.570> in<00:06:28.870> just<00:06:29.199> showing<00:06:29.500> you<00:06:29.530> that

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
anyway this in just showing you that

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.070 
anyway this in just showing you that
there<00:06:30.220> is<00:06:30.340> indeed<00:06:30.520> life<00:06:30.820> after<00:06:31.810> a<00:06:31.840> nuclear

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
there is indeed life after a nuclear

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.500 
there is indeed life after a nuclear
explosion
