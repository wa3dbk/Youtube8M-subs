have three plants that are participating

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.850 
have three plants that are participating
each<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.119> small<00:01:21.860> cryogenic

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
each one will get small cryogenic

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.219 
each one will get small cryogenic
freezers<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.610> cabinet<00:01:24.060> freezers<00:01:24.509> for

less expensive obviously than the very
expensive<00:02:27.320> cans<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.040> think<00:02:28.370> there's<00:02:28.850> you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
expensive cans so I think there's you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.630 
expensive cans so I think there's you
know<00:02:29.120> there's<00:02:29.330> many<00:02:29.570> good<00:02:29.840> reasons<00:02:30.050> for<00:02:30.320> this

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
know there's many good reasons for this

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.540 
know there's many good reasons for this
change<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.770> marketing<00:02:33.770> of<00:02:34.010> our<00:02:34.130> product

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
change in the marketing of our product

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.670 
change in the marketing of our product
to<00:02:34.670> take<00:02:34.790> place<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.390> we<00:02:36.170> obviously<00:02:36.440> think

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
to take place and we obviously think

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.250 
to take place and we obviously think
that<00:02:37.070> down<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.700> road<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.390> marilyn<00:02:39.110> crab

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
that down the road that the marilyn crab

meat processing industry is going to be
a<00:02:40.910> big<00:02:41.209> beneficiary<00:02:41.630> from<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.140> for<00:02:43.130> 27<00:02:43.970> years

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
a big beneficiary from this for 27 years

a big beneficiary from this for 27 years
I<00:02:44.360> was<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.540> crab<00:02:45.260> processor<00:02:46.120> like<00:02:47.120> these

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
I was a crab processor like these

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.020 
I was a crab processor like these
fellows<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:47.990> I<00:02:48.709> pasteurized<00:02:49.310> during<00:02:49.880> that

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
fellows and I pasteurized during that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.990 
fellows and I pasteurized during that
time<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:51.040> pasteurization<00:02:52.040> was<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.550> very<00:02:52.820> good

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
time and pasteurization was a very good

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.040 
time and pasteurization was a very good
way<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.390> extend<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.050> life<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.440> crabmeat<00:02:56.050> since

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
way to extend the life of crabmeat since

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.960 
way to extend the life of crabmeat since
I<00:02:57.140> left<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.470> business<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.100> came<00:02:58.489> back<00:02:58.520> and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
I left the business and came back and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.630 
I left the business and came back and
looked<00:02:59.300> at<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.570> freezer<00:02:59.870> project<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.680> didn't

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
looked at this freezer project I didn't

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.370 
looked at this freezer project I didn't
realize<00:03:01.970> how<00:03:02.150> much<00:03:02.270> things<00:03:02.570> had<00:03:02.750> changed<00:03:02.780> and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
realize how much things had changed and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.380 
realize how much things had changed and
the<00:03:03.620> pasteurization<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.520> not<00:03:04.700> as<00:03:04.880> efficient

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
the pasteurization is not as efficient

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.930 
the pasteurization is not as efficient
and<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:06.140> practical<00:03:06.709> as<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.280> freezers<00:03:07.700> are

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
and it's practical as the freezers are

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.080 
and it's practical as the freezers are
and<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:09.850> without<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:11.470> project<00:03:13.090> these

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
and the without this project these

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.910 
and the without this project these
smaller<00:03:14.480> companies<00:03:14.959> would<00:03:15.170> not<00:03:15.320> be<00:03:15.470> able<00:03:15.590> to

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
smaller companies would not be able to

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.620 
smaller companies would not be able to
afford<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:18.700> large-scale<00:03:19.700> freezing<00:03:20.150> operation

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
afford a large-scale freezing operation

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:31.470 
afford a large-scale freezing operation
like<00:03:20.750> this

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.090 

we<00:03:32.480> just<00:03:32.660> tried<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.410> works<00:03:33.650> great<00:03:33.769> you

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
we just tried it and it works great you

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:44.830 
we just tried it and it works great you
know<00:03:34.220> just<00:03:34.989> that

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.900
