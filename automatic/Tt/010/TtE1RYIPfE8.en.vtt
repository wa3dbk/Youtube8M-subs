on so if you're an out for example you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.130 
on so if you're an out for example you
can<00:01:16.890> connect<00:01:17.369> these<00:01:17.549> probes<00:01:17.909> easily<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.930> other

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
can connect these probes easily to other

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.920 
can connect these probes easily to other
probes<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> two<00:01:20.100> plots<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.330> will<00:01:21.540> tangle

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
probes and two plots and it will tangle

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.679 
probes and two plots and it will tangle
these<00:01:22.350> informational<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.640> while<00:01:24.270> you're<00:01:24.479> not

these informational you while you're not
there<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.380> temperature<00:01:26.009> raise<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.700> means

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
there the temperature raise that means

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.270 
there the temperature raise that means
you<00:01:27.270> won't<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.110> fan<00:01:28.500> running<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.130> will

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you won't have the fan running you will

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520 
you won't have the fan running you will
have<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> chiller<00:01:30.030> running<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.900> will<00:01:31.110> maybe

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
have the chiller running you will maybe

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.980 
have the chiller running you will maybe
shut<00:01:31.860> off<00:01:32.040> your<00:01:32.250> light<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:33.030> thing<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.659> guide

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
shut off your light this thing can guide

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.469 
shut off your light this thing can guide
rules<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.490> set<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.909> roots<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
rules so that you set up the roots and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.510 
rules so that you set up the roots and
it<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.170> handle<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> rules<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.280> all

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it will handle the rules for you all

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.300 
it will handle the rules for you all
know<00:01:38.729> you're<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:39.479> why<00:01:40.380> notice<00:01:40.740> it's

almost like a computer in itself most of
controllers<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.670> need

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
controllers out there you need

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.760 
controllers out there you need
computer<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.730> set<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.150> up<00:01:46.270> or<00:01:46.690> fumbling<00:01:47.650> around

tank returns going which means your

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.280 
tank returns going which means your
filtration<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:36.280> active<00:02:37.090> but<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:38.020> could<00:02:38.260> be

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
filtration is active but you could be

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.590 
filtration is active but you could be
possibly<00:02:38.890> saving<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.640> other<00:02:39.880> pump<00:02:40.239> from

additional<00:02:41.020> damage<00:02:41.709> as<00:02:41.890> well<00:02:41.920> but<00:02:42.459> maybe

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
additional damage as well but maybe

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.600 
additional damage as well but maybe
shutting<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.330> off<00:02:43.480> exactly<00:02:44.310> imagine<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.340> you

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
shutting it off exactly imagine that you

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.720 
shutting it off exactly imagine that you
have<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.790> flow<00:02:46.630> level<00:02:46.870> sensor<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.709> your<00:02:48.160> flow

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
have a flow level sensor and your flow

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.759 
have a flow level sensor and your flow
level<00:02:48.940> sensor<00:02:49.450> indicates<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:50.110> that's<00:02:50.320> your

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
level sensor indicates you that's your

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.860 
level sensor indicates you that's your
water<00:02:50.950> level<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.400> pretty<00:02:51.700> low<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.239> then<00:02:52.690> there

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
water level is pretty low and then there

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.580 
water level is pretty low and then there
is<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.019> issue<00:02:53.440> with<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.890> reader<00:02:54.100> with<00:02:54.459> the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
is a issue with the reader with the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.220 
is a issue with the reader with the
sorry<00:02:56.590> with<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.269> return<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.299> some<00:02:58.870> fresh

sorry with the return of some fresh

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.009 
sorry with the return of some fresh
water<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.100> water<00:03:00.130> level<00:03:00.670> goes<00:03:00.700> down<00:03:01.019> yeah

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
water so the water level goes down yeah

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.050 
water so the water level goes down yeah
something<00:03:02.500> like<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.580> case<00:03:03.850> you

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
can tell this guy like if the flow

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.160 
can tell this guy like if the flow
leather<00:03:06.220> goes<00:03:06.459> too<00:03:06.820> much<00:03:07.030> low<00:03:07.330> please<00:03:07.989> shut

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
leather goes too much low please shut

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.070 
leather goes too much low please shut
off<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.530> pump<00:03:08.769> instead<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.340> dry<00:03:09.640> run

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
off the pump instead of dry run

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.990 
off the pump instead of dry run
you<00:03:11.440> have<00:03:11.680> some<00:03:11.950> settings<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.460> can<00:03:12.490> curry<00:03:12.910> up

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
you have some settings you can curry up

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.880 
you have some settings you can curry up
but<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.780> show<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.050> here<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:14.530> device

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
but I can show you here on this device

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.320 
but I can show you here on this device
for<00:03:15.160> example<00:03:15.670> shortly

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.660 

because<00:03:20.110> what<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.650> can<00:03:20.860> do<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.550> the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
because what you can do and this is the

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.910 
because what you can do and this is the
pretty<00:03:21.940> new<00:03:22.180> feature<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.750> one<00:03:23.050> you<00:03:23.680> go<00:03:23.890> on

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
pretty new feature in this one you go on

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.250 
pretty new feature in this one you go on
and<00:03:24.160> for<00:03:24.370> example<00:03:24.430> for<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> temperature<00:03:25.540> probe

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.470 

you<00:03:29.769> know<00:03:29.890> I've<00:03:30.010> got<00:03:30.189> far<00:03:30.430> more<00:03:30.459> fingers

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
you know I've got far more fingers

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.229 
you know I've got far more fingers
so<00:03:33.080> we<00:03:33.500> get<00:03:33.709> this<00:03:33.890> new<00:03:34.069> assignment<00:03:34.700> wheel<00:03:34.849> that

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
so we get this new assignment wheel that

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.910 
so we get this new assignment wheel that
means<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.720> have<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.870> temperature<00:03:36.290> probe<00:03:36.709> and

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
means you have a temperature probe and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.600 
means you have a temperature probe and
you<00:03:37.220> want<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.489> assign<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.909> temperature<00:03:38.450> probe

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
you want to assign the temperature probe

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.850 
you want to assign the temperature probe
to<00:03:40.610> one<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.879> your<00:03:41.060> plugs<00:03:41.450> for<00:03:41.629> example<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.650> take

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
to one of your plugs for example to take

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.399 
to one of your plugs for example to take
care<00:03:43.099> about<00:03:43.310> sometimes<00:03:43.819> so<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:44.540> go<00:03:45.049> on<00:03:45.230> this

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
care about sometimes so you go on this

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.280 
care about sometimes so you go on this
task<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.459> get<00:03:46.640> rules<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:47.840> can<00:03:48.110> make

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
task and you get rules so you can make

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.350 
task and you get rules so you can make
set<00:03:48.620> up<00:03:48.739> your<00:03:48.920> roots<00:03:49.310> know<00:03:49.549> what<00:03:49.790> should<00:03:49.970> be<00:03:50.000> an

that you have the green LED light system

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.170 
that you have the green LED light system
as<00:04:24.289> well<00:04:24.440> does<00:04:24.919> that<00:04:24.949> mean<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.310> if<00:04:26.060> the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
as well does that mean that if the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.670 
as well does that mean that if the
temperatures<00:04:26.630> are<00:04:26.840> finis<00:04:27.260> it's<00:04:27.470> going<00:04:27.620> to

the<00:04:41.810> screen<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.229> may<00:04:42.410> be<00:04:42.470> off<00:04:42.770> but<00:04:43.340> you're

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
the screen is may be off but you're

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.940 
the screen is may be off but you're
looking<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:43.970> filtration<00:04:44.450> system<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.710> red

looking a filtration system and the red

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.800 
looking a filtration system and the red
LED<00:04:46.160> on<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.580> temperature<00:04:47.240> indicates

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
LED on the temperature indicates

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.570 
LED on the temperature indicates
directly<00:04:48.320> that<00:04:48.500> something<00:04:48.860> is<00:04:48.979> wrong<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.460> you

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
directly that something is wrong and you

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.940 
directly that something is wrong and you
have<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.820> take<00:04:50.000> care<00:04:50.210> maybe<00:04:50.389> about<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:51.470> you

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
have to take care maybe about it so you

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.670 
have to take care maybe about it so you
have<00:04:52.099> directly<00:04:52.639> more<00:04:53.150> visible<00:04:53.780> possibilities

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
have directly more visible possibilities

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.890 
have directly more visible possibilities
to<00:04:54.889> see<00:04:55.160> that<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.550> take<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.270> have<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.720> take

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
to see that you take it have to take

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.990 
to see that you take it have to take

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.760 
will also show you not the pros if you
replug<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.510> probe<00:05:33.510> to<00:05:33.870> get<00:05:34.050> a<00:05:34.080> back<00:05:34.470> or<00:05:34.710> even

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
replug the probe to get a back or even

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.310 
replug the probe to get a back or even
some<00:05:35.460> other<00:05:35.640> things<00:05:36.000> it<00:05:36.330> will<00:05:36.510> recognizing

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
some other things it will recognizing

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.470 
some other things it will recognizing
all<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.590> possibilities<00:05:38.040> what<00:05:38.820> is<00:05:39.000> connected

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
all the possibilities what is connected
