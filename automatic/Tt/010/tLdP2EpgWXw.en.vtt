00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.830
 good afternoon dear sleep water 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.690
 today we talk about the underground 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.050
 vegetable crop connectors 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.190
 what can be planted in the fall and what is needed for 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.430
 underground liabilities 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.560
 let's talk about gardeners 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.250
 they usually plant parsley in the fall 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.059
 carrots beet beaten with dill salad 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.620
 Spinach plant finely onions Sevok diameter 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.570
 up to 1 centimeter garlic underground crops 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.020
 allow us to get a harvest in two 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.030
 weeks earlier than when spring crops 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.280
 free us from many works which 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.860
 you have to spend the spring and 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.710
 it is in the spring that we lack this 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.950
 precious time and one more 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.780
 the advantage of autumn planting I like 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.700
 obvious many gardeners in the spring on 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.440
 I have the opportunity to return before only 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.350
 weekends 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.689
 happens to be sown seeds polish and if 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.140
 the weather is sunny ground fast you 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.470
 plays 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.920
 and the seeds lay in the ground as well 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.680
 when underground crops melt water for us 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.710
 moisten the soil and when we come 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.430
 early spring returns 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.680
 We already see the first shoots, but if I have you 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.760
 convinced in the advantage of autumn plantings 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.510
 then we act 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.780
 about garlic, we have already spoken in detail 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.330
 the film planting winter garlic will remind 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.970
 just the best time to land 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.820
 winter garlic in the Leningrad region 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.570
 this is the end of September or the very beginning 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.590
 October 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.580
 well now about the onions onions we will plant in 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.000
 late October 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.490
 the fact is that the bulbs as well as 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.830
 winter garlic must take root in the ground 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.830
 have time to give the roots until 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.630
 the earth will not freeze 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.330
 for the winter landing is best 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.240
 fit chalk bow power 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.100
 diameter less than one centimeter 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.500
 plants grown from such sevka not 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.570
 boom forge 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.890
 place for planting sevka choose on 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.440
 areas well lit by the sun 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.890
 the bed must be made in advance of the week 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.470
 two or three before digging 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.590
 we bring a floor of a bucket of rotted compost and 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.690
 one glass each is square 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.209
 meter 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.540
 then we make grooves with a depth of 34 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:43.320
 a centimeter at a distance of 12 centimeters 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.320
 apart and plant sevok 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.720
 3-4 onion distance 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.340
 centimeter 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:57.680
 well and then we dig in a bed we mulch 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.870
 peat crumb or leaf cover 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.720
 if onions and garlic must take root before 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.690
 frost then vegetable seeds 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.920
 crops must lie down until spring as it were 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.010
 for canning 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.400
 so we will plant when it comes 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.560
 frost but the bed must be done in the middle 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.890
 October, when the bed will be freezing cold 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.530
 will already do late soil 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.650
 digging 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:32.810
 fertilize leveling we make ridges and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.330
 cut the groove depth of 3 centimeters 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.080
 prepared ridges we cover or 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:44.120
 film or roofing material from we cover 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:48.970
 unnecessary piece of plywood to not grooves 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:52.310
 showered in a bucket or in another container 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.610
 we harvest the land and take it to 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.530
 indoors so that it does not turn into 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:03.440
 a piece of ice and when in November the family 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.090
 freezes even let the snow fall 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.959
 we will only have to remove our shelters 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.170
 sow the seeds and the seeding rate communication 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.979
 with extreme conditions we will increase 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.040
 20 percent and fill the grooves earlier 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.419
 cooked ground and necessarily 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.880
 grumble atschi 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.750
 and how to look after further 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.240
 landings 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.690
