00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
you're going to have a nice square 36

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.700 
you're going to have a nice square 36
inches<00:00:41.190> that's<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.940> about<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.719> width<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
inches that's the about the width and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.920 
inches that's the about the width and
length<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.280> need<00:00:44.309> because<00:00:45.090> anything

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
more than that it's going to be too

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.220 
more than that it's going to be too
brittle<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> fall<00:00:48.180> apart

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
hold of Pico elastic and pico Tex okay

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.670 
hold of Pico elastic and pico Tex okay
that's<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> two-part<00:00:54.960> solution<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.559> you're

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that's a two-part solution that you're

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.470 
that's a two-part solution that you're
going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> mix<00:00:56.070> together<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:57.360> going

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
going to mix together and you're going

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
going to mix together and you're going
to<00:00:57.539> pour<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.260> reservoir<00:00:58.710> which<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to pour into your reservoir which is a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.270 
to pour into your reservoir which is a
nice<00:00:59.760> square<00:01:00.239> pain<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.100> you've

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
nice square pain of that you that you've

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
nice square pain of that you that you've
poured<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> could<00:01:03.870> pull<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.229> glass

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
poured so that you could pull your glass

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
poured so that you could pull your glass
out<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.070> silicone<00:01:05.610> mold<00:01:05.939> now<00:01:06.630> you're

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
out of that silicone mold now you're

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.510 
out of that silicone mold now you're
going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> make<00:01:07.680> sure<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.220> pour

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
going to want to make sure that you pour

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
going to want to make sure that you pour
this<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> real<00:01:09.210> steady<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.930> smooth<00:01:10.260> rate

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
this at a real steady and smooth rate

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.170 
this at a real steady and smooth rate
after<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> mix<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> together<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
after you mix it together so that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050 
after you mix it together so that
bubbles<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:13.049> form<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> window<00:01:14.250> okay

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
bubbles don't form in the window okay

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
bubbles don't form in the window okay
once<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.840> stuff<00:01:16.259> sets<00:01:16.619> up<00:01:16.860> you're<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.820 
once that stuff sets up you're going to
pull<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:17.610> silicone<00:01:18.270> mold<00:01:18.570> apart<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.439> you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
pull your silicone mold apart and you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.969 
pull your silicone mold apart and you
will<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.220> your<00:01:20.430> 36<00:01:21.119> inch<00:01:21.390> pain<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.080> breakaway

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
will have your 36 inch pain of breakaway

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.850 
will have your 36 inch pain of breakaway
glass<00:01:23.189> now<00:01:24.180> that's<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:25.110> technique<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.830> use

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
glass now that's one technique to use

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.310 
glass now that's one technique to use
okay<00:01:26.490> another<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.960> take

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
okay another one is you can take

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.069 
okay another one is you can take
tempered<00:01:29.280> glass<00:01:29.460> which<00:01:30.180> shatters<00:01:30.750> very

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
tempered glass which shatters very

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.240 
tempered glass which shatters very
easily<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.860> get<00:01:32.400> yourself<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:33.509> sort<00:01:33.780> of

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
easily and get yourself some sort of

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.130 
easily and get yourself some sort of
explosive<00:01:35.250> mechanism<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.930> real

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
explosive mechanism now in a real

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.469 
explosive mechanism now in a real
production<00:01:37.530> you'd<00:01:38.040> use<00:01:38.250> real<00:01:38.460> pyro<00:01:38.790> guys<00:01:39.180> that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
production you'd use real pyro guys that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
production you'd use real pyro guys that
know<00:01:39.600> how<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.750> blow<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> stuff<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
know how to blow this stuff up so I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.380 
know how to blow this stuff up so I
don't<00:01:41.040> recommend<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.820> doing<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.360> your

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
don't recommend you doing this on your

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.080 
don't recommend you doing this on your
own<00:01:42.720> okay<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:44.399> they're<00:01:44.579> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
own okay and what they're going to do is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.120
