Gundam this is an older Master Grade
made<00:00:16.500> all<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.980> way<00:00:17.070> back<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.460> 1999<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.600> it

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
made all the way back in 1999 and it

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.790 
made all the way back in 1999 and it
sold<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.160> still<00:00:20.430> sells<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:20.970> price<00:00:21.180> of

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.929 
4,000 Japanese yen as with most older
boxes<00:00:25.439> there's<00:00:25.619> nothing<00:00:25.980> too<00:00:26.160> unusual<00:00:26.189> about

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
boxes there's nothing too unusual about

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.730 
boxes there's nothing too unusual about
this<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.720> anyway<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.260> get<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> front

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
this one but anyway you do get a front

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.439 
this one but anyway you do get a front
view<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> double<00:00:29.369> Zeta<00:00:29.550> Gundam<00:00:29.730> including

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
view of the double Zeta Gundam including

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.139 
view of the double Zeta Gundam including
its<00:00:30.779> seals<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.800> decals<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.309> there<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:33.030> also

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
its seals and decals on there it also

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.810 
its seals and decals on there it also
shows<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> rear<00:00:33.870> view<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.710> also<00:00:34.860> shows<00:00:35.280> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
shows a rear view and it also shows this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850 
shows a rear view and it also shows this
is<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> transforming<00:00:36.750> Gundam<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> course

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
is a transforming Gundam so of course

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.560 
is a transforming Gundam so of course
the<00:00:38.100> top<00:00:38.340> half<00:00:38.610> will<00:00:38.820> transform<00:00:39.239> into<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the top half will transform into the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600 
the top half will transform into the
core<00:00:39.750> top<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.559> legs<00:00:40.829> will<00:00:41.070> turn<00:00:41.250> into<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
core top the legs will turn into the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.000 
core top the legs will turn into the
core<00:00:41.850> block<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.680> different<00:00:43.860> from

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
core block and this is different from

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.770 
core block and this is different from
the<00:00:44.250> Zeta<00:00:44.460> Gundam<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> Zeta<00:00:45.570> Gundam

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the Zeta Gundam because the Zeta Gundam

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.470 
the Zeta Gundam because the Zeta Gundam
only<00:00:46.559> transforms<00:00:47.100> into<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> Waverider<00:00:47.610> but

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
only transforms into the Waverider but

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
only transforms into the Waverider but
you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.719> combine<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.289> top<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.890> core<00:00:50.100> top<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you can combine the top the core top and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
you can combine the top the core top and
the<00:00:50.520> core<00:00:50.700> base<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.090> make<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.449> huge<00:00:51.870> G

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the core base to make the huge G

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.830 
the core base to make the huge G
fortress<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.879> also<00:00:54.030> comes<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> core

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
fortress and it also comes with a core

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.600 
fortress and it also comes with a core
fighter<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.649> course<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:56.070> transform

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
fighter which of course can transform

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
fighter which of course can transform
into<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.239> core<00:00:57.449> block<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.500> inside<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
into the core block and go inside the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
into the core block and go inside the
double<00:00:59.309> Zeta<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.510> other<00:01:00.629> side<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> box

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
double Zeta on the other side of the box

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900 
double Zeta on the other side of the box
the<00:01:01.440> first<00:01:01.590> thing<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:01.920> wary<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.609> if<00:01:02.760> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the first thing to be wary of is if you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.759 
the first thing to be wary of is if you
look<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> double<00:01:03.780> beam<00:01:03.960> rifle<00:01:04.379> 8<00:01:04.589> it's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
look at the double beam rifle 8 it's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.859 
look at the double beam rifle 8 it's
huge<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.280> look<00:01:05.489> how<00:01:05.640> awkwardly<00:01:06.180> he's<00:01:06.510> holding

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
huge but look how awkwardly he's holding

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
huge but look how awkwardly he's holding
that<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.229> remember<00:01:07.979> boxes<00:01:08.400> always<00:01:08.549> show<00:01:08.790> off

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that and remember boxes always show off

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.730 
that and remember boxes always show off
the<00:01:09.060> best<00:01:09.299> aspects<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.900> ammonal<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.619> that's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the best aspects of ammonal so if that's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.399 
the best aspects of ammonal so if that's
the<00:01:10.890> best<00:01:11.070> pose<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.850> well<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.930> don't

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the best pose they can do well I don't

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.050 
the best pose they can do well I don't
have<00:01:13.530> very<00:01:13.590> high<00:01:13.950> expectations<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> pose

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

get an idea there you already saw that
the<00:01:36.270> beam<00:01:36.450> rifle<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.869> pretty<00:01:37.079> big<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.619> get

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the beam rifle is pretty big but you get

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.340 
the beam rifle is pretty big but you get
huge<00:01:38.189> beam<00:01:38.579> sabers<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> those<00:01:40.049> are<00:01:40.259> pretty

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
huge beam sabers and those are pretty

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.929 
huge beam sabers and those are pretty
cool<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.680> you've<00:01:40.829> ever<00:01:40.979> played<00:01:41.040> G<00:01:41.400> generations

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939

jewel here on the double Zeta which is

jewel here on the double Zeta which is

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
actually a weapon sort of gives us an

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.710 
actually a weapon sort of gives us an
indication<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> lines<00:01:53.909> might<00:01:54.210> not<00:01:54.450> be

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
indication that the lines might not be

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.300 
indication that the lines might not be
and<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> channels<00:01:55.439> might<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.100> that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and the channels might not be all that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
and the channels might not be all that
good<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.390> then<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.630> also<00:01:57.780> show<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.229> some

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
good but then they also show up some

other mekanikle details you can see the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.719 
other mekanikle details you can see the
core<00:02:01.170> fighter<00:02:01.439> there<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.280> they're<00:02:02.430> talking

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
view of the double Zeta Gundam then it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080 
view of the double Zeta Gundam then it
shows<00:02:17.290> off<00:02:17.470> all<00:02:17.710> of<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> name<00:02:18.190> etc<00:02:18.430> written

shows off all of the name etc written
down<00:02:19.210> there<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:20.170> otherwise<00:02:20.410> they've<00:02:20.890> stopped

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
down there but otherwise they've stopped

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.010 
down there but otherwise they've stopped
putting<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.610> into<00:02:21.910> master<00:02:22.480> grade<00:02:22.660> kits<00:02:22.900> I

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
putting this into master grade kits I

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.680 
putting this into master grade kits I
guess<00:02:23.230> they<00:02:23.380> figured<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:24.100> cost<00:02:24.690> just

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
guess they figured that the cost just

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.480 
guess they figured that the cost just
wasn't<00:02:26.080> worth<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.560> manual<00:02:26.920> itself<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.370> very

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
wasn't worth the manual itself is very

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.580 
wasn't worth the manual itself is very
standard<00:02:27.970> for<00:02:28.150> $19.99<00:02:28.840> but<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.200> doesn't

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
standard for $19.99 but that doesn't

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.110 
standard for $19.99 but that doesn't
necessarily<00:02:30.280> mean<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:30.490> it's<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.850> good<00:02:30.880> thing

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
necessarily mean that it's a good thing

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.090 
necessarily mean that it's a good thing
so<00:02:31.630> inside<00:02:31.990> you<00:02:32.110> get<00:02:32.230> some<00:02:32.410> cool<00:02:32.620> line<00:02:32.860> art

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
so inside you get some cool line art

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.430 
so inside you get some cool line art

unlike<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.810> gpo<00:03:11.200> 2a<00:03:11.560> which<00:03:12.040> was<00:03:12.250> really<00:03:12.640> it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
unlike the gpo 2a which was really it

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.150 
unlike the gpo 2a which was really it
had<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.959> quite<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.170> few<00:03:14.260> bit<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.680> confusing

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
had it quite a few bit of confusing

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.440 
had it quite a few bit of confusing
parts<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.760> have<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:15.940> be<00:03:16.120> careful

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
parts in it so you have to be careful

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.920 
parts in it so you have to be careful
with<00:03:16.570> that

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
with that

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.390 
with that
otherwise<00:03:17.530> you'll<00:03:17.739> notice<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.070> there<00:03:18.220> are<00:03:18.370> a

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
otherwise you'll notice that there are a

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.610 
otherwise you'll notice that there are a
lot<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.730> large<00:03:19.120> parts<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.780> here<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:20.380> here

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
lot of large parts in here and so here

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.770 
lot of large parts in here and so here
we<00:03:20.709> go<00:03:20.830> back<00:03:21.010> into<00:03:21.220> story<00:03:21.580> in<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.480> middle

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
we go back into story in the middle

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.840 
we go back into story in the middle
they're<00:03:22.930> just<00:03:23.170> rehashing<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:24.010> same<00:03:24.040> splat<00:03:24.610> or

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
they're just rehashing the same splat or

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.310 
they're just rehashing the same splat or
pictures<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.510> we've<00:03:25.630> already<00:03:25.810> seen<00:03:26.049> on<00:03:26.200> the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
pictures that we've already seen on the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.080 
pictures that we've already seen on the
side<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.650> box<00:03:26.860> which<00:03:27.160> again<00:03:27.459> goes<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.790> show

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
side of the box which again goes to show

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.460 
side of the box which again goes to show
that<00:03:28.239> there's<00:03:28.420> not<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.600> lot<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.930> possibility

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
that there's not a lot of possibility

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.020 
that there's not a lot of possibility
and<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.250> back<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.580> manual<00:03:30.760> we're

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
and in the back of the manual we're

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.670 
and in the back of the manual we're
going<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.209> have<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.480> transformation<00:03:31.959> here

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
going to have the transformation here

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.949 
going to have the transformation here
which<00:03:32.890> takes<00:03:33.280> up<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.700> couple<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.269> pages<00:03:34.570> and

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
which takes up a couple of pages and

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.699 
which takes up a couple of pages and
that's<00:03:35.620> truly<00:03:36.269> 1980s<00:03:37.269> style<00:03:37.600> let's<00:03:38.500> make

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
that's truly 1980s style let's make

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.830 
that's truly 1980s style let's make
everything<00:03:39.040> transform<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.180> again<00:03:40.660> on<00:03:40.750> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
everything transform and again on the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.000 
everything transform and again on the
back<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.140> shows<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.380> where<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.560> put<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:41.830> all

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
back it shows you where to put on all

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.670 
back it shows you where to put on all
the<00:03:42.130> marking<00:03:42.489> seals<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.000> decals<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.680> because

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
the marking seals and decals and because

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.140 
the marking seals and decals and because
you<00:03:44.769> get<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.010> cardboard<00:03:45.459> insert<00:03:45.760> showing

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
you get that cardboard insert showing

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150 
you get that cardboard insert showing
off<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.450> front<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.930> double<00:03:47.200> Zeta<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.620> guess

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
off the front of the double Zeta I guess

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.330 
off the front of the double Zeta I guess
they<00:03:48.370> want<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.640> show<00:03:48.820> off<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.150> back<00:03:49.330> here

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.430 

very<00:03:54.060> few<00:03:54.390> colored<00:03:54.720> stickers<00:03:55.110> but<00:03:55.290> you'll

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
very few colored stickers but you'll

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.900 
very few colored stickers but you'll
notice<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.770> there<00:03:55.950> are<00:03:56.069> two<00:03:56.280> separate<00:03:56.760> eyes

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
notice that there are two separate eyes

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.670 
notice that there are two separate eyes
so<00:03:57.180> usually<00:03:57.599> you<00:03:57.720> just<00:03:57.750> get<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.080> single<00:03:58.380> band

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
so usually you just get a single band

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.800 
so usually you just get a single band
that<00:03:58.890> goes<00:03:59.010> across<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.489> eyes<00:03:59.610> but<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.540> terms

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
that goes across the eyes but in terms

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.420 
that goes across the eyes but in terms
of<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.080> clear<00:04:01.319> decals<00:04:01.860> there's<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.220> lot<00:04:02.340> of

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
of the clear decals there's a lot of

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.680 
of the clear decals there's a lot of
different<00:04:02.640> things<00:04:02.730> because<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.660> a

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
different things because this is a

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.680 
different things because this is a
number<00:04:04.260> ten<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.800> series<00:04:05.160> MSX<00:04:05.790> zero<00:04:06.270> ten

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
number ten in the series MSX zero ten

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.540 
number ten in the series MSX zero ten
you<00:04:07.230> can<00:04:07.290> put<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.680> sticker<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:08.280> can<00:04:08.370> put

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
you can put on that sticker you can put

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.100 
you can put on that sticker you can put
on<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.730> double<00:04:09.000> Zeta<00:04:09.180> stickers<00:04:09.599> it's<00:04:09.810> got<00:04:09.989> the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
on the double Zeta stickers it's got the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.160 
on the double Zeta stickers it's got the
Waverider<00:04:10.290> things<00:04:10.830> anaheim<00:04:11.430> electronics<00:04:11.459> etc
