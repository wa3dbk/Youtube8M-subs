what looks the best and what size is the
best<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.910> cut<00:01:05.299> about<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.900> sighs<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.530> don't

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
best I cut about that that sighs I don't

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.539 
best I cut about that that sighs I don't
I<00:01:07.979> don't<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.789> how<00:01:09.119> long<00:01:09.719> that<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.549> but

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I don't really know how long that is but

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.749 
I don't really know how long that is but
once<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:11.969> that<00:01:13.219> you're<00:01:14.219> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.609> to

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
once you do that you're going to want to

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.749 
once you do that you're going to want to
sand<00:01:15.329> the<00:01:15.509> edges<00:01:17.810> until<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.429> flat<00:01:20.429> you<00:01:20.609> can

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
sand the edges until it a flat you can

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.919 
sand the edges until it a flat you can
even<00:01:20.820> around<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.329> edges<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.710> rolling<00:01:23.189> pin

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
even around the edges of the rolling pin

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.950 
even around the edges of the rolling pin
focuses<00:01:24.929> all<00:01:25.079> by<00:01:25.229> itself<00:01:26.149> as<00:01:27.149> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
focuses all by itself as you can see the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.649 
focuses all by itself as you can see the
edges<00:01:28.140> are<00:01:28.729> somewhat<00:01:29.729> round<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.179> out<00:01:30.270> so

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
edges are somewhat round it out so

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.550 
edges are somewhat round it out so
they're<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.170> straight<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:34.289> next<00:01:34.469> thing

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
they're not so straight the next thing

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.130 
they're not so straight the next thing
you<00:01:34.649> want<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.340> work<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.509> handles<00:01:36.899> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you want to do is work on the handles I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.459 
you want to do is work on the handles I
have<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.189> smaller<00:01:38.490> dowel<00:01:38.789> for<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.289> what<00:01:40.289> I<00:01:40.319> do

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
have a smaller dowel for that what I do

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.630 
have a smaller dowel for that what I do
is<00:01:40.619> before<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.189> even<00:01:41.429> cut<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> handle<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:42.479> I

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
is before I even cut the handle off I

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.169 
is before I even cut the handle off I
sand<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.869> until<00:01:45.869> has<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> rounded<00:01:47.069> edge<00:01:47.280> like

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
sand it until has a rounded edge like

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.779 
sand it until has a rounded edge like
this<00:01:48.619> one<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.889> stand<00:01:53.069> it<00:01:53.280> until<00:01:53.609> it's

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
this one so just stand it until it's

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.349 
this one so just stand it until it's
rounded<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:55.380> even<00:01:55.679> ask<00:01:55.859> you

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
rounded out I'm you're even ask you

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:03.060 
rounded out I'm you're even ask you
wanted<00:01:57.359> to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.010 

okay<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.130> once<00:02:04.609> you<00:02:04.729> have<00:02:04.820> your<00:02:04.939> handles<00:02:05.329> your

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
okay so once you have your handles your

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.770 
okay so once you have your handles your
two<00:02:06.170> handles<00:02:06.560> roughly<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.280> same<00:02:07.460> size<00:02:07.780> you're

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
two handles roughly the same size you're

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.960 
two handles roughly the same size you're
going<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.959> want<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.200> glue<00:02:09.470> them<00:02:09.649> on<00:02:09.830> each<00:02:10.550> end

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
going to want to glue them on each end

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.140 
going to want to glue them on each end
and<00:02:11.239> I<00:02:11.750> use<00:02:12.910> craft<00:02:13.910> bond<00:02:14.150> Elmer's<00:02:14.629> glue<00:02:16.150> so

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
and I use craft bond Elmer's glue so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.869 
and I use craft bond Elmer's glue so
just<00:02:18.459> sit<00:02:19.459> one<00:02:20.090> side<00:02:20.390> up<00:02:20.599> right<00:02:20.870> if<00:02:21.049> it<00:02:21.200> will<00:02:21.879> do

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
just sit one side up right if it will do

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:29.080 
just sit one side up right if it will do
a<00:02:22.910> little<00:02:23.090> glue<00:02:24.760> on<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.090> end<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.420> your<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.700> I

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
a little glue on the end of your and I

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.170 
a little glue on the end of your and I
do<00:02:29.150> recommend<00:02:29.629> wood<00:02:29.959> glue<00:02:30.200> because<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:31.180> well

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
do recommend wood glue because it well

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.789 
do recommend wood glue because it well
it's<00:02:32.360> wood<00:02:32.540> glue<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:33.080> works<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.440> best<00:02:33.590> it

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
it's wood glue it works the best it

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.550 
it's wood glue it works the best it
bonds<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.220> best<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.579> wood<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.349> then<00:02:36.349> just

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
bonds the best to wood and then just

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.949 
bonds the best to wood and then just
place<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:36.829> as<00:02:37.250> close<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.420> middle<00:02:38.720> as<00:02:38.840> you

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
place it as close to the middle as you

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.280 
place it as close to the middle as you
