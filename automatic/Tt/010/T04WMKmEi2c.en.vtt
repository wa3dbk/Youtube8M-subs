here so if you share if you have your
internet<00:00:44.739> via<00:00:45.700> ethernet<00:00:46.570> so<00:00:47.140> it's<00:00:47.290> like<00:00:47.410> a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
internet via ethernet so it's like a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.049 
internet via ethernet so it's like a
wide<00:00:47.739> connection<00:00:48.250> you'll<00:00:48.670> have<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:48.910> select

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
wide connection you'll have to select

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.630 
wide connection you'll have to select
that<00:00:49.329> however<00:00:50.200> if<00:00:50.320> you<00:00:50.410> want<00:00:50.590> to<00:00:50.680> use<00:00:50.920> this<00:00:51.160> to

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
that however if you want to use this to

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.860 
that however if you want to use this to
increase<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:53.379> range<00:00:53.649> of<00:00:53.890> your<00:00:54.100> of<00:00:54.489> your<00:00:55.180> Wi-Fi

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.290 
increase the range of your of your Wi-Fi
or<00:00:55.899> Internet<00:00:56.370> using<00:00:57.370> this<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.640> like<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.969> go

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
or Internet using this is like the go

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.080 
or Internet using this is like the go
between<00:00:58.450> the<00:00:58.840> middle<00:00:59.110> computer<00:01:00.039> you<00:01:00.670> can<00:01:00.850> just

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
between the middle computer you can just

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.070 
between the middle computer you can just
click<00:01:01.329> Airport<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.410> will<00:01:02.500> work<00:01:02.680> similarly

click Airport and it will work similarly

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.810 
click Airport and it will work similarly
but<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:05.320> could<00:01:05.830> have<00:01:05.890> visit<00:01:06.220> I<00:01:06.520> have<00:01:06.729> this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
but I could have visit I have this

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.240 
but I could have visit I have this
connection<00:01:07.119> by<00:01:07.509> Ethernet<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.920> I'll<00:01:09.039> close

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
connection by Ethernet so I'll close

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.960 
connection by Ethernet so I'll close
that<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:11.020> then<00:01:11.080> I'll<00:01:11.470> click<00:01:11.680> Airport<00:01:12.220> so<00:01:12.610> what

that and then I'll click Airport so what

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.460 
that and then I'll click Airport so what
that's<00:01:13.119> basically<00:01:13.299> doing<00:01:13.659> is<00:01:13.840> it's<00:01:14.020> receiving

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
that's basically doing is it's receiving

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.690 
that's basically doing is it's receiving
the<00:01:15.310> Internet<00:01:16.590> through<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:18.340> Ethernet<00:01:18.670> port

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
the Internet through the Ethernet port

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.149 
the Internet through the Ethernet port
and<00:01:19.689> it<00:01:19.840> will<00:01:20.020> be<00:01:20.170> distributing<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:20.979> by

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
and it will be distributing it by

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.179 
and it will be distributing it by

to encrypt it which I recommend you do a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.780 
to encrypt it which I recommend you do a
user<00:01:33.549> hundred<00:01:34.270> twenty<00:01:34.509> eight<00:01:34.540> bit<00:01:34.869> think

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
user hundred twenty eight bit think

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.789 
user hundred twenty eight bit think
encryption<00:01:37.200> which<00:01:38.200> means<00:01:38.439> you've<00:01:38.560> been<00:01:38.590> asked

to<00:01:38.920> use<00:01:39.130> 13<00:01:39.939> characters<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.619> it<00:01:41.799> needs<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.040> be

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
to use 13 characters so it needs to be

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.760 
to use 13 characters so it needs to be
13<00:01:42.430> characters<00:01:42.820> long<00:01:43.170> Chara<00:01:44.170> which<00:01:44.590> I

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
13 characters long Chara which I

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.870 
13 characters long Chara which I
recommend<00:01:45.720> ok<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.250> once<00:01:48.400> you've<00:01:48.549> got<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.820> all
