you the back up rear view camera so you
put<00:00:14.870> it<00:00:14.960> in<00:00:15.019> reverse<00:00:15.139> it<00:00:15.500> automatically<00:00:16.009> goes

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
put it in reverse it automatically goes

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.580 
put it in reverse it automatically goes
and<00:00:16.520> you<00:00:16.550> can<00:00:16.730> see<00:00:16.939> several<00:00:17.720> distance<00:00:18.290> lines

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
and you can see several distance lines

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.769 
and you can see several distance lines
that<00:00:19.279> allow<00:00:19.520> you<00:00:19.579> to<00:00:19.730> let<00:00:20.210> you<00:00:20.329> know<00:00:20.360> how<00:00:20.599> close

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
that allow you to let you know how close

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.190 
that allow you to let you know how close
you<00:00:20.869> are<00:00:21.110> to<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:21.230> vehicle<00:00:21.610> as<00:00:22.610> you<00:00:22.790> go<00:00:23.200> it'll

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
you are to a vehicle as you go it'll

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.830 
you are to a vehicle as you go it'll
just<00:00:24.230> let<00:00:24.560> you<00:00:24.710> know<00:00:25.060> where<00:00:26.060> you're<00:00:26.180> at<00:00:26.329> you

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
just let you know where you're at you

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.269 
just let you know where you're at you
can<00:00:26.930> see<00:00:27.050> that<00:00:27.079> orange<00:00:27.380> line<00:00:27.649> will<00:00:27.800> also<00:00:27.890> have

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
can see that orange line will also have

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.970 
can see that orange line will also have
the<00:00:28.310> direction<00:00:28.790> that<00:00:29.149> you're<00:00:29.840> steering<00:00:30.590> so

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
the direction that you're steering so

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.290 
the direction that you're steering so
that<00:00:31.099> you<00:00:31.189> can<00:00:31.340> see<00:00:31.489> you're<00:00:31.640> directed<00:00:32.029> course

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
that you can see you're directed course

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.569 
that you can see you're directed course
so<00:00:33.170> that's<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.410> great<00:00:33.559> feature<00:00:33.920> great<00:00:34.309> safety

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
so that's a great feature great safety

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.479 
so that's a great feature great safety
feature<00:00:35.320> allows<00:00:36.320> you<00:00:36.500> just<00:00:36.530> to<00:00:36.800> know<00:00:37.129> exactly

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
feature allows you just to know exactly

feature allows you just to know exactly
where<00:00:37.609> you<00:00:37.670> going<00:00:37.789> to<00:00:37.850> go<00:00:37.969> keep<00:00:38.359> you<00:00:38.480> from

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
where you going to go keep you from

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.819 
where you going to go keep you from
getting<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:38.899> little<00:00:39.050> fender<00:00:39.289> benders<00:00:39.710> and

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
getting a little fender benders and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.849 
getting a little fender benders and
parking<00:00:40.129> lots<00:00:40.309> things<00:00:40.579> like<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:41.559> as<00:00:42.559> we<00:00:42.710> move

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
parking lots things like that as we move

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.450 
parking lots things like that as we move
forward<00:00:43.070> now<00:00:44.199> you<00:00:45.199> can<00:00:45.320> hear<00:00:45.620> how<00:00:45.800> quiet<00:00:46.070> it<00:00:46.399> is

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
forward now you can hear how quiet it is

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.799 
forward now you can hear how quiet it is
in<00:00:46.519> fact<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:46.940> probably<00:00:47.030> can't<00:00:47.449> hear<00:00:47.660> how

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
in fact you probably can't hear how

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.279 
in fact you probably can't hear how
quiet<00:00:48.019> it<00:00:48.289> is<00:00:48.350> because<00:00:48.739> it's<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.039> quiet<00:00:50.289> but

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
quiet it is because it's so quiet but

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.340 
quiet it is because it's so quiet but
this<00:00:51.469> new<00:00:52.239> design<00:00:53.239> of<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.570> pathfinder<00:00:54.170> has

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
this new design of the pathfinder has

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.299 
this new design of the pathfinder has
the<00:00:55.149> xtronic<00:00:56.149> CVT<00:00:57.070> transmission<00:00:58.070> or<00:00:58.219> the

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
the xtronic CVT transmission or the

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.029 
the xtronic CVT transmission or the
continuously<00:00:59.149> variable<00:00:59.600> transmission<00:01:00.379> what

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
continuously variable transmission what

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.489 
continuously variable transmission what
that<00:01:01.249> means<00:01:01.489> is<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:02.239> uses<00:01:02.539> a<00:01:02.690> whole<00:01:02.929> new<00:01:03.109> design

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.499 
that means is it uses a whole new design

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.290 
that means is it uses a whole new design
of<00:01:03.710> transmission<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.489> give<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.730> better<00:01:04.909> fuel

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
of transmission to give you better fuel

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.630 
of transmission to give you better fuel
economy<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.960> smoother<00:01:06.830> ride<00:01:06.860> without<00:01:07.220> any<00:01:07.520> of

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
latch and glide technology so let's hop

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.610 
latch and glide technology so let's hop
out<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.720> take<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> look<00:04:20.049> at<00:04:20.259> the<00:04:20.320> second

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
go into the trunk and we'll see how we

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.740 
go into the trunk and we'll see how we
fold<00:05:33.620> down<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.800> seats<00:05:34.120> ok<00:05:35.120> as<00:05:35.300> we<00:05:35.450> look<00:05:35.600> into

a<00:05:40.280> lot<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.520> force<00:05:41.150> needed<00:05:41.450> to<00:05:41.540> raise<00:05:41.780> it<00:05:42.550> you

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
a lot of force needed to raise it you

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.280 
a lot of force needed to raise it you
see<00:05:43.730> here<00:05:44.000> there<00:05:44.600> are<00:05:44.660> several<00:05:44.870> different

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
see here there are several different

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.980 
see here there are several different
tabs<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.190> chords<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.790> things<00:05:47.000> let<00:05:47.810> me<00:05:47.870> show

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
tabs and chords and things let me show

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.530 
tabs and chords and things let me show
you<00:05:48.020> how<00:05:48.140> to<00:05:48.260> use<00:05:48.380> this<00:05:48.940> you<00:05:49.940> have<00:05:50.180> to<00:05:50.330> first

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
you how to use this you have to first

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.850 
you how to use this you have to first
pulled<00:05:50.810> down<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.020> headrest<00:05:51.500> so<00:05:51.740> you<00:05:51.830> just

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
pulled down the headrest so you just

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.950 
pulled down the headrest so you just
pull<00:05:52.190> on<00:05:52.340> this<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:53.210> let<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:53.420> headrest<00:05:53.750> move

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
pull on this and let the headrest move

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.040 
pull on this and let the headrest move
forward<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:55.340> then<00:05:55.460> you<00:05:55.610> lift<00:05:55.850> on<00:05:56.180> this<00:05:56.780> tab

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
forward and then you lift on this tab

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.010 
forward and then you lift on this tab
here<00:05:57.080> which<00:05:58.070> will<00:05:58.250> allow<00:05:58.310> this<00:05:58.640> to<00:05:59.630> fold<00:05:59.870> down

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
here which will allow this to fold down

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.320 
here which will allow this to fold down
flat<00:06:01.630> so<00:06:02.630> it<00:06:02.690> gives<00:06:02.780> you<00:06:02.930> lots<00:06:03.170> of<00:06:03.440> extra<00:06:04.100> space

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
flat so it gives you lots of extra space

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.020 
flat so it gives you lots of extra space
with<00:06:05.330> the<00:06:05.360> 50-50<00:06:06.020> split<00:06:06.290> in<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.500> third<00:06:06.680> row

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
with the 50-50 split in the third row

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.030 
with the 50-50 split in the third row
allowing<00:06:08.030> you<00:06:08.180> to<00:06:08.360> really<00:06:08.960> have<00:06:09.590> anything<00:06:09.800> you
