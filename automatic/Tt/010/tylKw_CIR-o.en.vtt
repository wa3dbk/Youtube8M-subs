bowlers feel like a ringing tenpin is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.000 
bowlers feel like a ringing tenpin is
simply<00:00:39.060> an<00:00:39.180> unlucky<00:00:39.600> break<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.650> what<00:00:40.829> we're

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
simply an unlucky break but what we're

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.190 
simply an unlucky break but what we're
going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.370> show<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.600> while<00:00:42.810> a<00:00:42.840> shot

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
going to show here is that while a shot

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.140 
going to show here is that while a shot
that<00:00:43.380> leaves<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.739> ringing<00:00:44.100> tenpin<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> very

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
that leaves a ringing tenpin is a very

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.690 
that leaves a ringing tenpin is a very
very<00:00:45.450> good<00:00:45.810> shot<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.830> not<00:00:47.130> quite<00:00:47.430> perfect

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
very good shot it's not quite perfect

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.940 
very good shot it's not quite perfect
and<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.690> difference<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.680> quite

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and the difference is really quite

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.820 
and the difference is really quite
obvious<00:00:50.400> when<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.450> overlay<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.960> two<00:00:52.290> shots<00:00:52.590> on

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
obvious when we overlay the two shots on

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.860 
obvious when we overlay the two shots on
top<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.430> another<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:54.240> see<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.630> there<00:00:54.840> is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
top of one another we see that there is

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.720 
top of one another we see that there is
an<00:00:55.050> obvious<00:00:55.530> difference<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.220> position<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
an obvious difference in the position of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
an obvious difference in the position of
the<00:00:56.820> bowling<00:00:57.210> ball<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.630> it<00:00:57.870> travels<00:00:58.260> down<00:00:58.320> the

lane the area outside the solid portion
of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.830> ball<00:01:02.010> shows<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.580> difference<00:01:03.140> once

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
of the ball shows the difference once

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
of the ball shows the difference once
the<00:01:04.320> ball<00:01:04.500> starts<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> change<00:01:05.250> direction<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the ball starts to change direction you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.179 
the ball starts to change direction you
see<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> shot<00:01:07.290> which<00:01:07.500> leaves<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.979> solid

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
see that the shot which leaves the solid

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.490 
see that the shot which leaves the solid
tenpin<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> good<00:01:09.270> inch<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:09.720> two<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.229> at

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
tenpin is a good inch or two right at

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
tenpin is a good inch or two right at
the<00:01:10.619> break<00:01:10.860> point<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.759> that<00:01:11.909> strikes

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the break point of the one that strikes

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.710 
the break point of the one that strikes
as<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.799> ball<00:01:13.979> enters<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.520> pins<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.600> this

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
as the ball enters the pins some of this

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.779 
as the ball enters the pins some of this
difference<00:01:16.140> has<00:01:16.259> been<00:01:16.320> shaved<00:01:16.740> off<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.759> is

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
difference has been shaved off but it is

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.760 
difference has been shaved off but it is
still<00:01:18.119> obvious<00:01:18.659> enough<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.649> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
still obvious enough to see that the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.380 
still obvious enough to see that the
ball<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.039> entering<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.729> pins<00:01:20.999> from<00:01:21.240> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
ball is entering the pins from a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.830 
ball is entering the pins from a
slightly<00:01:21.749> different<00:01:22.049> position<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> ball

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
slightly different position as the ball

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
slightly different position as the ball
goes<00:01:25.079> through<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.409> pins<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.130> difference

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
goes through the pins the difference

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.510 
goes through the pins the difference
becomes<00:01:27.179> even<00:01:27.539> more<00:01:27.570> obvious<00:01:28.249> look<00:01:29.249> at<00:01:29.369> how

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
becomes even more obvious look at how

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
becomes even more obvious look at how
the<00:01:29.579> ball<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.179> shot<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.569> strikes<00:01:30.990> drives

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the ball on the shot that strikes drives

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.349 
the ball on the shot that strikes drives
through<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:31.979> pins<00:01:32.340> without<00:01:32.549> deflecting

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
through the pins without deflecting

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.719 
through the pins without deflecting
while<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> ball<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.770> leaves<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.249> tendon

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
while the ball that leaves the tendon

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.719 
while the ball that leaves the tendon
begins<00:01:36.179> to<00:01:36.329> deflect<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:36.990> right<00:01:37.670> by<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
begins to deflect to the right by the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.700 
begins to deflect to the right by the
time<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> balls<00:01:39.450> enter<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> pit<00:01:40.229> there<00:01:40.679> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
time the balls enter the pit there a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.359 
time the balls enter the pit there a
good<00:01:41.069> foot<00:01:41.460> apart<00:01:41.880> from<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.270> another<00:01:43.369> now

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
good foot apart from one another now

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.969 
good foot apart from one another now
let's<00:01:44.729> watch<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.149> pin<00:01:45.329> action<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.560> reason

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
let's watch the pin action the reason

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.219 
let's watch the pin action the reason
the<00:01:47.069> perfect<00:01:47.549> shot<00:01:47.729> strikes<00:01:48.179> basically<00:01:48.960> comes

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the perfect shot strikes basically comes

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.169 
the perfect shot strikes basically comes
down<00:01:49.289> to<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> balls<00:01:50.009> position<00:01:50.639> when<00:01:50.819> it<00:01:50.850> hits

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
down to the balls position when it hits

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.529 
down to the balls position when it hits
the<00:01:51.389> three<00:01:51.630> pin<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.249> the<00:01:53.249> perfect<00:01:53.700> strike<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
the three pin on the perfect strike the

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.139 
the three pin on the perfect strike the
ball<00:01:54.780> hits<00:01:55.109> three<00:01:55.530> pin<00:01:55.740> into<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.100> six<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.119> that

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
ball hits three pin into the six so that

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.899 
ball hits three pin into the six so that
it<00:01:57.359> goes<00:01:57.509> directly<00:01:57.780> into<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.649> 10<00:01:58.950> pin
