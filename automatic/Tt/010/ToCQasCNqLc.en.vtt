anomaly somewhere here in the ruins and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.910 
anomaly somewhere here in the ruins and
when<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.130> fills<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> hundred<00:02:04.350> that

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
when that fills up to a hundred that

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.730 
when that fills up to a hundred that
means<00:02:05.130> i<00:02:05.250> found<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> anomaly<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.560> that's<00:02:07.560> why

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
means i found the anomaly and that's why

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.380 
means i found the anomaly and that's why
you<00:02:07.799> saw<00:02:08.009> me<00:02:08.160> running<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.610> wall<00:02:08.819> earlier<00:02:09.060> I

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
you saw me running to wall earlier I

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.420 
you saw me running to wall earlier I
thought<00:02:09.690> I'd<00:02:09.869> got<00:02:10.170> relatively<00:02:10.800> close<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.340> it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
thought I'd got relatively close to it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.900

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
up killing about 25 hahahaha if so we'll

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.980
