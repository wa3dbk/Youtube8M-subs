00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
set that I have actually tested in uu

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.540 
set that I have actually tested in uu
but<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.379> should<00:00:16.680> work<00:00:16.980> well<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.850> ru<00:00:19.550> Kangaskhan

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
but it should work well in ru Kangaskhan

let's<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.970> over<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> move<00:01:21.390> set<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.890> I'll

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
let's go over the move set and I'll

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.890 
let's go over the move set and I'll
explain<00:01:23.280> why<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.790> good<00:01:24.119> why<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.630> so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
explain why it's so good why it's so

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.580 
explain why it's so good why it's so
unexpected<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.920> why<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.490> awesome<00:01:26.900> um<00:01:27.900> if

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
unexpected and why it's so awesome um if

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.080 
unexpected and why it's so awesome um if
your<00:01:29.100> point<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.700> opponent<00:01:30.060> doesn't

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
your point if your opponent doesn't

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
your point if your opponent doesn't
expect<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.810> you're<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> lot<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
expect this you're going to do a lot of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.370 
expect this you're going to do a lot of
damage<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> their<00:01:33.119> team<00:01:33.329> I'll<00:01:33.840> explain<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
damage to their team I'll explain how it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.710 
damage to their team I'll explain how it
works<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.740> right<00:01:34.979> here<00:01:35.280> first<00:01:36.119> move<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
works so right here first move is

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.719 
works so right here first move is
substitute<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.710> want<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> run<00:01:38.189> substitute

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
substitute you want to run substitute

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.490 
substitute you want to run substitute
because<00:01:39.030> substitute<00:01:39.900> protects<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.470> from

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
because substitute protects you from

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.940 
because substitute protects you from
status<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:42.780> pretty<00:01:43.320> much<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
status and that is pretty much it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.920 
status and that is pretty much it
substitute<00:01:44.399> protects<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:44.880> status<00:01:45.360> not

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
substitute protects you from status not

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.260 
substitute protects you from status not
to<00:01:46.049> mention<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.590> substitute<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.340> walls

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
to mention you can substitute on walls

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.929 
to mention you can substitute on walls
that<00:01:48.780> can't<00:01:49.140> really<00:01:49.290> attack<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:50.430> hard<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that can't really attack that hard and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.960 
that can't really attack that hard and
break<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.420> subs<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.049> oopsie<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:53.340> clay

bulky<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.390> not<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.990> bulky<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.649> your

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
bulky but it's not that bulky so your

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.089 
bulky but it's not that bulky so your

up<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.310> substitute<00:02:28.870> even<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:29.960> you'd<00:02:30.050> like

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
up a substitute even if you'd like

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.200 
up a substitute even if you'd like
statuses<00:02:30.830> which<00:02:31.010> they<00:02:31.220> most<00:02:31.430> likely<00:02:31.670> will<00:02:31.970> do

but<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.489> will<00:03:04.610> give<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> tag<00:03:05.360> boost<00:03:05.690> and

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
but it will give you a tag boost and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.740 
but it will give you a tag boost and
then<00:03:06.350> that's<00:03:06.800> where<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.459> real<00:03:08.090> fun<00:03:08.330> happens

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
then that's where the real fun happens

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.960 
then that's where the real fun happens

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
because you can start firing off returns

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.729 
because you can start firing off returns
once<00:03:11.270> you<00:03:11.390> get<00:03:11.540> one<00:03:11.780> or<00:03:11.900> two<00:03:11.930> boosts<00:03:12.440> under
