looks really great things that we can

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880 
looks really great things that we can
improve<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.079> painting<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.739> first

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
improve on with this painting the first

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.250 
improve on with this painting the first
thing<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.219> would<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.020> again

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
thing I would do on this is do it again

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.020 
thing I would do on this is do it again
but<00:00:52.649> start<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.280> accurate<00:00:53.489> drawing

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
but start with a more accurate drawing

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.549 
but start with a more accurate drawing
and<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.390> focus<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.960> making<00:00:55.170> sure<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
and really focus on making sure the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
and really focus on making sure the
curve<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.039> leaves<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.239> outline<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
curve of your leaves and the outline of

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
curve of your leaves and the outline of
the<00:00:57.899> hummingbird<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.559> done<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:59.129> accurately

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the hummingbird are done more accurately

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
the hummingbird are done more accurately
because<00:01:00.120> what's<00:01:00.449> happening<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
because what's happening is the way that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
because what's happening is the way that
they're<00:01:02.280> drawn<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.730> gives<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.300> stiff

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
they're drawn it gives it a very stiff

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
they're drawn it gives it a very stiff
feel<00:01:04.019> there's<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> lot<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.280> movement<00:01:05.820> in

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
feel there's not a lot of movement in

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.460 
feel there's not a lot of movement in
this<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.689> didn't<00:01:06.930> send<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.140> reference

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
this and you didn't send your reference

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.750

photos<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.159> did<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> Google<00:01:08.490> image

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
photos so I just did a Google image

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.370 
photos so I just did a Google image
search<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.330> pull<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.750> couple<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.140> photos

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
search and pull up a couple of photos

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.230 
search and pull up a couple of photos
that<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.770> use<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.340> compare<00:01:11.760> it'll<00:01:12.090> just

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that we can use to compare it'll just

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.550 
that we can use to compare it'll just
make<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.420> easier<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.810> understand<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:13.470> I'm

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
make it easier to understand what I'm

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.960 
make it easier to understand what I'm
talking<00:01:13.890> about<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.250> first<00:01:14.460> I'm<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> look

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
again I didn't charge it looking at the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.300 
again I didn't charge it looking at the
flower<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.540> leaf<00:01:24.869> actual<00:01:25.500> petals<00:01:25.740> look<00:01:26.130> like

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
flower the leaf actual petals look like

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
flower the leaf actual petals look like
they<00:01:26.400> could<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.549> elongated<00:01:27.119> more<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.600> really

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
they could be elongated more and really

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.749 
they could be elongated more and really
focus<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.890> fact<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.400> start<00:01:29.670> out

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
focus on the fact that they start out

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.450 
focus on the fact that they start out
really<00:01:30.030> thin<00:01:30.119> they<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:31.140> wider<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.130> thin

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
really thin they get wider and then thin

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.310 
really thin they get wider and then thin
out<00:01:32.610> quite<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> bit<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.630> kind<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.930> taper

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
out quite a bit and just kind of taper

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.789 
out quite a bit and just kind of taper
off<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.100> gives<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> very<00:01:35.579> elegant<00:01:36.210> look

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
off it gives it a very elegant look

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.140 
off it gives it a very elegant look
right<00:01:37.799> now<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> way<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.640> you've<00:01:38.759> got<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
right now the way that you've got it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
right now the way that you've got it
they're<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:39.720> shorter<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.380> they're<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> bit

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
they're a bit shorter and they're a bit

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.319 
they're a bit shorter and they're a bit
more<00:01:41.070> shorter<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.700> don't<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:41.939> quite<00:01:42.180> as

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
more shorter you don't have quite as

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.539 
more shorter you don't have quite as
much<00:01:42.479> form<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:43.829> making<00:01:44.040> those<00:01:44.250> little

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
much form so just making those little

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.340 
much form so just making those little
adjustments<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.570> shape<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.049> really

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
adjustments on this shape like really

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.069 
adjustments on this shape like really
focus<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.520> actual<00:01:48.149> drawing<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.720> outline

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
focus on the actual drawing the outline

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.719 
focus on the actual drawing the outline
before<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.530> start<00:01:49.799> painting<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.340> next<00:01:50.579> thing

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
before you start painting the next thing

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.550 
before you start painting the next thing
on<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.270> contrast<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.869> would<00:01:52.140> love<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
on here is the contrast I would love to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
on here is the contrast I would love to
see<00:01:52.680> more<00:01:52.799> contrast<00:01:53.310> than<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.090> can

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
see more contrast than this and you can

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.060 
see more contrast than this and you can
see<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> sample<00:01:55.200> photo<00:01:55.409> look<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
see on the sample photo look at the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
see on the sample photo look at the
darks<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:57.090> deep<00:01:57.390> shadows<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.170> just

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
darks the really deep shadows it just

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590 
darks the really deep shadows it just
makes<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> greens<00:01:59.250> pop<00:01:59.640> that<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.329> more

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
makes the greens pop that much more

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.690 
makes the greens pop that much more
because<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.469> does<00:02:01.770> have<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.130> much<00:02:02.280> black<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.670> a

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
because it does have so much black and a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.950 
because it does have so much black and a
lot<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.880> times<00:02:03.060> people<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.329> think<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.719> don't

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
lot of times people will think I don't

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.240 
lot of times people will think I don't
want<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> put<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> shadows<00:02:04.770> too<00:02:04.950> dark<00:02:05.159> because

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
want to put the shadows too dark because

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.859 
want to put the shadows too dark because
I<00:02:05.460> want<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.909> bright<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.180> vivid<00:02:06.390> but

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
I want this to be bright and vivid but

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.300 
I want this to be bright and vivid but
what<00:02:07.020> happens<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.770> don't<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.099> those

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
what happens is if you don't have those

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.300 
what happens is if you don't have those
shadows<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.910> there

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
shadows in there

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.670 
shadows in there
that<00:02:09.520> lack<00:02:09.819> of<00:02:10.000> contrast<00:02:10.539> actually<00:02:11.260> dulls<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
that lack of contrast actually dulls the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.410 
that lack of contrast actually dulls the
painting<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> colors<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> lot<00:02:12.940> if<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.270> can

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
painting and the colors a lot if you can

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.089 
painting and the colors a lot if you can
get<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.810> high<00:02:14.200> high<00:02:14.440> contrast<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.069> your

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
get that high high contrast with your

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.070 
get that high high contrast with your
darks<00:02:15.520> right<00:02:16.090> up<00:02:16.239> against<00:02:16.540> your<00:02:16.660> bright<00:02:16.870> vivid

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
darks right up against your bright vivid

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.020 
darks right up against your bright vivid
colors<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.650> just<00:02:17.830> makes<00:02:18.010> them<00:02:18.130> pop<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.849> much

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
colors it just makes them pop so much

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.820 
colors it just makes them pop so much
more<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:19.720> can<00:02:19.870> see<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> sample<00:02:20.590> photo

almost<00:02:53.230> obnoxious<00:02:53.980> color<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.580> so<00:02:55.180> by<00:02:55.450> adding

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
almost obnoxious color and so by adding

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.120 
almost obnoxious color and so by adding
some<00:02:56.049> more<00:02:56.140> yellow<00:02:56.470> into<00:02:56.739> this<00:02:56.860> you're<00:02:57.010> gonna

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
some more yellow into this you're gonna

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.500 
some more yellow into this you're gonna
achieve<00:02:57.519> that<00:02:57.730> better<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.120> get<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.299> nice

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
achieve that better and get that nice

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.360 
achieve that better and get that nice
vivid<00:02:59.019> orange<00:02:59.200> color<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.769> with<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.040> one<00:03:00.220> I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
vivid orange color and with this one I

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.280 
vivid orange color and with this one I
don't<00:03:00.489> know<00:03:00.849> where<00:03:01.360> your<00:03:01.720> photo<00:03:01.959> your

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
don't know where your photo your

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.020 
don't know where your photo your
reference<00:03:02.620> photo<00:03:02.830> came<00:03:03.069> from<00:03:03.250> but<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.910> was

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
reference photo came from but if it was

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.750 
reference photo came from but if it was
if<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.660> was<00:03:04.690> comparing<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:06.069> sample<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.730> I

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
if I was comparing to the sample that I

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.789 
if I was comparing to the sample that I
found<00:03:06.970> on<00:03:07.090> Google<00:03:07.120> image<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:08.319> can<00:03:08.470> see<00:03:08.650> these

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
found on Google image you can see these

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.140 
found on Google image you can see these
these<00:03:08.860> darker<00:03:09.430> little<00:03:09.580> petals<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.030> are

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
these darker little petals that are

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.910 
these darker little petals that are
towards<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.900> back<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.290> flower<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.739> that

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
towards the back of the flower and that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.440 
towards the back of the flower and that
again<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:12.549> gonna<00:03:12.640> make<00:03:12.849> your<00:03:13.030> contrast

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
again is just gonna make your contrast

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.240 
again is just gonna make your contrast
pop<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.930> whole<00:03:14.079> flowers<00:03:14.470> just<00:03:14.950> gonna<00:03:15.100> stand

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
pop the whole flowers just gonna stand

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.770 
pop the whole flowers just gonna stand
out<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.489> lot<00:03:15.670> better<00:03:15.820> moving<00:03:16.209> on<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.690> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
out a lot better moving on to the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.870 
out a lot better moving on to the
hummingbird<00:03:17.200> again<00:03:17.829> starting<00:03:18.459> off<00:03:18.609> with<00:03:18.820> a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
hummingbird again starting off with a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.449 
hummingbird again starting off with a
strong<00:03:19.299> drawing<00:03:19.810> is<00:03:20.109> so<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:20.890> important<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.430> I

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
strong drawing is so so important and I

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.069 
strong drawing is so so important and I
say<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:21.760> all<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:21.970> time<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:22.750> if<00:03:22.900> your

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
say this all the time but if your

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.080 
say this all the time but if your
drawing<00:03:23.350> is<00:03:23.650> not<00:03:23.680> really<00:03:24.430> really<00:03:24.609> accurate<00:03:25.000> to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
drawing is not really really accurate to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.150 
drawing is not really really accurate to
start<00:03:25.329> with<00:03:25.480> once<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.079> start<00:03:26.440> painting<00:03:26.680> it's

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
start with once you start painting it's

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.830 
start with once you start painting it's
not<00:03:27.400> going<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.790> get<00:03:27.910> any<00:03:28.120> better<00:03:28.239> make<00:03:28.630> sure

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
not going to get any better make sure

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.120 
not going to get any better make sure
you<00:03:29.019> start<00:03:29.260> with<00:03:29.319> a<00:03:29.440> very<00:03:29.650> very<00:03:29.890> accurate

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
you start with a very very accurate

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.400 
you start with a very very accurate
drawing<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:31.060> for<00:03:31.239> this<00:03:31.329> guy<00:03:31.540> I'm<00:03:31.840> pretty<00:03:32.109> sure

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
drawing so for this guy I'm pretty sure

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.319 
drawing so for this guy I'm pretty sure
he's<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.620> hummingbird<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.670> don't<00:03:33.970> know<00:03:34.120> for

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
he's a hummingbird but I don't know for

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.449 
he's a hummingbird but I don't know for
certain<00:03:34.720> because<00:03:35.140> his<00:03:35.470> tail<00:03:35.709> is<00:03:35.980> not<00:03:36.010> like<00:03:36.310> any

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
certain because his tail is not like any

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.800 
certain because his tail is not like any
honey<00:03:36.670> mean<00:03:36.819> bird<00:03:36.970> I've<00:03:37.150> seen<00:03:37.390> he's<00:03:37.569> almost

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
honey mean bird I've seen he's almost

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.120 
honey mean bird I've seen he's almost
kind<00:03:38.019> of<00:03:38.079> a<00:03:38.139> combination<00:03:38.410> of<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.829> couple<00:03:38.950> of

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
kind of a combination of a couple of

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.009 
kind of a combination of a couple of
birds<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.819> I'm<00:03:40.030> not<00:03:40.209> sure<00:03:40.269> if<00:03:40.630> if<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.900> were

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
birds so I'm not sure if if you were

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.270 
birds so I'm not sure if if you were
doing<00:03:41.170> kind<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.709> bird<00:03:41.889> from<00:03:42.130> your

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
doing kind of a bird from your

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.520 
doing kind of a bird from your
imagination<00:03:42.430> or<00:03:42.970> what<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.299> this<00:03:43.530> hummingbird

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
imagination or what and this hummingbird

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.900 
imagination or what and this hummingbird
that<00:03:44.560> I've<00:03:44.739> got<00:03:44.889> as<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.010> sample<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.609> just<00:03:45.760> kind

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
that I've got as a sample is just kind

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.240 
that I've got as a sample is just kind
of<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.090> generic<00:03:46.870> hummingbird<00:03:47.440> photo<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.980> don't

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
of a generic hummingbird photo I don't

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.680 
of a generic hummingbird photo I don't
know<00:03:48.430> what<00:03:48.670> you're<00:03:48.819> again<00:03:49.180> don't<00:03:49.450> know<00:03:49.569> what

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
know what you're again don't know what

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.479 
know what you're again don't know what
your<00:03:49.810> reference<00:03:50.139> photo<00:03:50.319> is<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:50.799> I'm<00:03:51.190> not<00:03:51.250> gonna

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
your reference photo is so I'm not gonna

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.800 
your reference photo is so I'm not gonna
be<00:03:51.609> too<00:03:51.730> picky<00:03:51.880> about<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> colors<00:03:52.540> I'm<00:03:52.690> just

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
be too picky about the colors I'm just

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.150 
be too picky about the colors I'm just
looking<00:03:53.049> at<00:03:53.109> the<00:03:53.200> outline<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.739> bird<00:03:53.889> and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
looking at the outline of the bird and

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.670 
looking at the outline of the bird and
so<00:03:54.489> going<00:03:54.700> back<00:03:54.970> again<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.510> movement<00:03:56.109> but

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
so going back again to the movement but

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.289 
so going back again to the movement but
look<00:03:57.040> at<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.220> difference<00:03:57.549> in<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.910> shape<00:03:58.120> the

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
look at the difference in the shape the

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.729 
look at the difference in the shape the
wings<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.840> way<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:59.109> they're<00:03:59.230> positioned

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
wings the way that they're positioned

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.550 
wings the way that they're positioned
choosing<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.970> right<00:04:01.180> wing<00:04:01.750> position<00:04:02.260> makes<00:04:02.440> a

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
choosing the right wing position makes a

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.629 
choosing the right wing position makes a
big<00:04:02.709> difference<00:04:03.010> when<00:04:03.130> you're<00:04:03.220> doing<00:04:03.459> birds

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
big difference when you're doing birds

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.309 
big difference when you're doing birds
that<00:04:03.790> are<00:04:03.850> flying<00:04:04.120> even<00:04:04.780> if<00:04:04.870> your<00:04:04.959> reference

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
that are flying even if your reference

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.870 
that are flying even if your reference
photo<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.650> exactly<00:04:06.130> how<00:04:06.250> you're<00:04:06.430> drawing<00:04:06.639> is

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
photo is exactly how you're drawing is

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.580 
photo is exactly how you're drawing is
with<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.120> wings<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.510> wouldn't<00:04:08.260> change<00:04:08.440> that

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
with the wings I wouldn't change that

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.930 
with the wings I wouldn't change that
and<00:04:08.889> adjust<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.250> up<00:04:09.340> just<00:04:09.609> to<00:04:09.700> give<00:04:09.819> it<00:04:09.850> more

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
and adjust it up just to give it more

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.340 
and adjust it up just to give it more
movement<00:04:10.389> because<00:04:10.600> they're<00:04:10.840> they're<00:04:11.139> so

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
movement because they're they're so

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.410 
movement because they're they're so
stiff<00:04:11.769> it's<00:04:12.579> just<00:04:12.760> kind<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.030> weird<00:04:13.209> position

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
stiff it's just kind of a weird position

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.469 
stiff it's just kind of a weird position
so<00:04:14.250> like<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.310> said<00:04:15.459> if<00:04:15.579> it<00:04:15.730> was<00:04:15.940> how<00:04:16.090> your<00:04:16.269> photo

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
so like I said if it was how your photo

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.149 
so like I said if it was how your photo
your<00:04:16.690> reference<00:04:17.019> photo<00:04:17.229> was<00:04:17.409> I<00:04:17.590> would<00:04:17.799> adjust

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
your reference photo was I would adjust

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:19.740 
your reference photo was I would adjust
it<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:18.580> that<00:04:18.609> your<00:04:18.909> painting<00:04:19.359> has<00:04:19.539> more

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
it so that your painting has more

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.699 
it so that your painting has more
movement<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.260> you're<00:04:20.530> in

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
movement and you're in

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.110 
movement and you're in
proving<00:04:20.949> on<00:04:21.069> that<00:04:21.190> photo<00:04:21.400> but<00:04:21.729> this<00:04:21.910> photo

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
proving on that photo but this photo

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.300 
proving on that photo but this photo
that<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.360> found<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.870> very<00:04:23.139> similar<00:04:23.680> to<00:04:24.220> the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
that I found is very similar to the

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.770 
that I found is very similar to the
positioning<00:04:24.759> of<00:04:24.850> yours<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.300> then<00:04:25.449> looking<00:04:25.690> at

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
positioning of yours and then looking at

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.020 
positioning of yours and then looking at
the<00:04:25.840> tail<00:04:26.139> feathers<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:27.009> can<00:04:27.190> see<00:04:27.430> again<00:04:27.819> I'm

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
the tail feathers you can see again I'm

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.879 
the tail feathers you can see again I'm
assuming<00:04:28.810> it's<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.990> hummingbird<00:04:29.380> not<00:04:29.530> positive

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
assuming it's a hummingbird not positive

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.409 
assuming it's a hummingbird not positive
if<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.250> doesn't<00:04:30.460> have<00:04:30.550> any<00:04:30.639> bird<00:04:30.819> their<00:04:31.120> tail

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
if it doesn't have any bird their tail

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.150 
if it doesn't have any bird their tail
feathers<00:04:31.449> tend<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.080> be<00:04:32.199> a<00:04:32.229> lot<00:04:32.440> shorter<00:04:32.710> more

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
feathers tend to be a lot shorter more

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.640 
feathers tend to be a lot shorter more
stiff<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.759> when<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.090> do<00:04:34.330> birds<00:04:34.660> being<00:04:35.470> that

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
stiff and when you do birds being that

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.110 
stiff and when you do birds being that
you<00:04:35.740> put<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.009> detail<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.699> did<00:04:36.880> into

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
you put the detail that you did into

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.850 
you put the detail that you did into
your<00:04:37.240> flower<00:04:37.479> then<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:38.319> would<00:04:38.440> be<00:04:38.560> best<00:04:38.740> to

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
your flower then it would be best to

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.379 
your flower then it would be best to
match<00:04:39.099> that<00:04:39.280> detail<00:04:39.610> on<00:04:39.729> the<00:04:39.789> bird<00:04:40.000> in<00:04:40.180> which

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
match that detail on the bird in which

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.900 
match that detail on the bird in which
case<00:04:40.660> paint<00:04:41.500> each<00:04:41.680> individual<00:04:42.340> feather<00:04:42.610> and

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
case paint each individual feather and

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.249 
case paint each individual feather and
with<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.150> acrylic<00:04:43.300> this<00:04:43.539> is<00:04:43.720> really<00:04:44.020> easy<00:04:44.169> to

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
with the acrylic this is really easy to

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.230 
with the acrylic this is really easy to
do<00:04:44.440> because<00:04:44.560> it<00:04:44.770> does<00:04:44.979> dry<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:45.430> quickly<00:04:45.729> you

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
do because it does dry so quickly you

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.540 
do because it does dry so quickly you
can<00:04:46.419> get<00:04:46.539> tons<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.900> detail<00:04:47.289> use<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.860> liner<00:04:48.250> brush

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
can get tons of detail use a liner brush

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.360 
can get tons of detail use a liner brush
and<00:04:48.699> get<00:04:49.030> each<00:04:49.740> individual<00:04:50.740> feather<00:04:51.039> and

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
and get each individual feather and

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.100 
and get each individual feather and
shade<00:04:51.610> them<00:04:51.819> look<00:04:52.090> really<00:04:52.539> closely<00:04:52.750> at<00:04:52.960> your

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
shade them look really closely at your

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.320 
shade them look really closely at your
reference<00:04:53.380> photo<00:04:53.800> when<00:04:54.430> you're<00:04:54.580> drawing<00:04:54.910> and

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
reference photo when you're drawing and

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.150 
reference photo when you're drawing and
painting<00:04:55.599> especially<00:04:56.139> when<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.800> first<00:04:56.979> get

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
painting especially when you first get

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.400 
painting especially when you first get
started<00:04:57.310> you<00:04:58.060> shouldn't<00:04:58.360> be<00:04:58.419> spending<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.990> lot

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
started you shouldn't be spending a lot

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.529 
started you shouldn't be spending a lot
a<00:04:59.650> lot<00:05:00.220> more<00:05:00.490> time<00:05:00.759> looking<00:05:01.389> at<00:05:01.509> your

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
a lot more time looking at your

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:02.999 
a lot more time looking at your
reference<00:05:01.810> photo<00:05:02.229> and<00:05:02.440> referring<00:05:02.800> back<00:05:02.949> to

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
reference photo and referring back to

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.469 
reference photo and referring back to
that<00:05:03.340> then<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.669> are<00:05:03.699> with<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.270> actual

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
that then you are with the actual

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.659 
that then you are with the actual
painting<00:05:05.050> or<00:05:05.229> drawing<00:05:05.410> and<00:05:05.860> make<00:05:06.340> sure<00:05:06.520> that

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
painting or drawing and make sure that

painting or drawing and make sure that
you<00:05:06.789> get<00:05:06.910> that<00:05:07.060> drawing<00:05:07.360> really<00:05:07.570> accurate<00:05:08.139> and

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
you get that drawing really accurate and

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.749 
you get that drawing really accurate and
it's<00:05:08.650> gonna<00:05:08.770> make<00:05:08.949> a<00:05:08.979> big<00:05:09.220> difference<00:05:09.370> in<00:05:09.729> your

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
it's gonna make a big difference in your

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
I'm really impressed because acrylic is

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.360 
I'm really impressed because acrylic is
not<00:05:13.690> easy<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.169> blend<00:05:14.349> you've<00:05:14.830> done<00:05:15.039> a<00:05:15.070> great
