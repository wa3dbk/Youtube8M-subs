of you know the sega master system and
the<00:00:50.290> game<00:00:50.530> gear<00:00:50.860> are<00:00:51.100> essentially<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.030> same

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
the game gear are essentially the same

pretty<00:02:28.920> easy<00:02:29.190> until<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.670> get<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.000> this

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
pretty easy until you get up to this

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.300 
pretty easy until you get up to this
first<00:02:30.420> boss<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.709> realize<00:02:32.099> it's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
first boss and then you realize it's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.610 
first boss and then you realize it's
incredibly<00:02:32.790> hard<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.840> problem<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.590> that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
incredibly hard the problem is is that

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.229 
incredibly hard the problem is is that
you're<00:02:34.860> going<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.069> want<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.340> jump<00:02:35.700> as<00:02:35.940> this

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
you're going to want to jump as this

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.479 
you're going to want to jump as this
thing<00:02:36.480> runs<00:02:36.780> towards<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.380> but<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.220> thing

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
thing runs towards you but this thing

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.259 
thing runs towards you but this thing
will<00:02:38.760> jump<00:02:39.319> more<00:02:40.319> often<00:02:40.560> then<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.700> just<00:02:42.000> runs

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
will jump more often then it just runs

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.780 
will jump more often then it just runs
at<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:43.019> you'll<00:02:43.260> jump<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.890> jumps<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.610> hit

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
at you so you'll jump it jumps you hit

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.170 
at you so you'll jump it jumps you hit
in<00:02:44.880> midair<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:46.200> get<00:02:46.350> hit<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.970> key<00:02:48.150> is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
in midair and you get hit so the key is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.270 
in midair and you get hit so the key is
actually<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.840> not<00:02:49.049> jump<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.500> just<00:02:49.980> take<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
actually to not jump and just take the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:02.380 
actually to not jump and just take the
hits<00:02:50.489> when<00:02:50.640> he<00:02:50.730> runs<00:02:50.940> at<00:02:51.120> you

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:20.010 

you

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.080 

you

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.929 

so<00:03:24.090> on<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.689> next<00:03:24.870> world<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.709> will<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
so on to the next world if you will the

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.270 
so on to the next world if you will the
game<00:03:27.120> has<00:03:27.390> four<00:03:28.049> basic<00:03:28.650> worlds<00:03:29.099> different

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
game has four basic worlds different

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.360 
game has four basic worlds different
environments<00:03:30.170> with<00:03:31.170> three<00:03:31.799> levels<00:03:32.129> within

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
environments with three levels within

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.690 
environments with three levels within
each<00:03:32.819> some<00:03:33.659> of<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.840> levels<00:03:33.989> within<00:03:34.319> are<00:03:34.829> very

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
each some of the levels within are very

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.539 
each some of the levels within are very
similar<00:03:36.120> very<00:03:36.780> repetitive<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.739> you'll

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
similar very repetitive and you'll

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.039 
similar very repetitive and you'll
almost<00:03:38.730> think<00:03:39.150> sometimes<00:03:39.599> you're<00:03:39.810> playing

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
almost think sometimes you're playing

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.380 
almost think sometimes you're playing
the<00:03:40.140> same<00:03:40.349> level<00:03:40.560> over<00:03:40.950> again<00:03:41.220> but<00:03:42.060> then<00:03:42.239> you

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
the same level over again but then you

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.750 
the same level over again but then you
get<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.319> next<00:03:43.560> world<00:03:43.769> or<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.730> next

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
get to the next world or the next

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.270 
get to the next world or the next
environment<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:45.810> as<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:46.590> can<00:03:46.739> see<00:03:46.890> here<00:03:46.920> we

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
environment and as we can see here we

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.650 
environment and as we can see here we
have<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> complete<00:03:47.849> change<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:49.829> graphics

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.750 

the<00:03:57.230> game's<00:03:57.440> not<00:03:57.680> too<00:03:57.920> hard<00:03:58.190> for<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.490> most

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
the game's not too hard for the most

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.030 
the game's not too hard for the most
part<00:03:59.150> other<00:03:59.420> than<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.870> odd<00:04:00.020> thing<00:04:00.470> like<00:04:00.770> you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
part other than the odd thing like you

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.740 
part other than the odd thing like you
know<00:04:01.340> figuring<00:04:01.730> out<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.030> cheapness<00:04:02.330> of<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
know figuring out the cheapness of the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.080 
know figuring out the cheapness of the
boss<00:04:02.930> is<00:04:03.260> some<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.860> mean<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.430> bosses<00:04:04.850> could

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
boss is some I mean the bosses could

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.710 
boss is some I mean the bosses could
have<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:06.050> know<00:04:06.170> better<00:04:06.440> design<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:07.160> them<00:04:07.720> but

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
have you know better design to them but

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.970 
have you know better design to them but
like<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:08.900> said<00:04:09.050> for<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.320> most<00:04:09.500> part<00:04:09.650> it's<00:04:09.830> not

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
like I said for the most part it's not

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.100 
like I said for the most part it's not
too<00:04:10.430> hard<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.820> game<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.270> don't<00:04:11.900> know<00:04:11.960> if<00:04:12.050> I

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
too hard of a game I don't know if I

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.110 
too hard of a game I don't know if I
mentioned<00:04:12.170> it<00:04:12.620> but<00:04:12.740> you<00:04:12.860> have<00:04:13.040> three<00:04:13.640> lives<00:04:13.880> as

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
mentioned it but you have three lives as

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.150 
mentioned it but you have three lives as
Ren<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.810> have<00:04:14.930> three<00:04:15.200> lights<00:04:15.410> of<00:04:15.620> Stimpy

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
Ren and you have three lights of Stimpy

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.300 
Ren and you have three lights of Stimpy
and<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.150> can<00:04:17.330> pick<00:04:17.570> every<00:04:18.290> time<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.680> start<00:04:19.220> a

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
and you can pick every time you start a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.640 
and you can pick every time you start a
leveler<00:04:19.670> every<00:04:20.180> time<00:04:20.299> you<00:04:20.450> die<00:04:20.720> so

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
leveler every time you die so

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.670 
leveler every time you die so
essentially<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.190> have<00:04:22.220> six<00:04:22.700> lives<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.680> you

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
essentially you have six lives and you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.480 
essentially you have six lives and you
also<00:04:24.830> get<00:04:25.100> three<00:04:25.370> continues<00:04:26.410> so<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:28.250> do<00:04:28.400> have

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
also get three continues so you do have

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.790 
also get three continues so you do have
a<00:04:28.550> lot<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.820> tries<00:04:29.210> at<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.630> levels<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.140> mean

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
a lot of tries at the levels I mean

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.650 
a lot of tries at the levels I mean
there's<00:04:30.980> also<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.310> password<00:04:31.850> system<00:04:32.120> so<00:04:32.540> of

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
there's also a password system so of

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.470 
there's also a password system so of
course<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:33.080> can<00:04:33.260> continue<00:04:33.890> on<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.370> level<00:04:35.210> you

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
course you can continue on a level you

00:04:35.480 --> 00:05:13.280 
course you can continue on a level you
left<00:04:35.660> off<00:04:35.900> on

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.870 

it's<00:05:14.290> muddy<00:05:15.030> mudskipper<00:05:16.030> it's<00:05:16.810> muddy

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
it's muddy mudskipper it's muddy

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.350 
it's muddy mudskipper it's muddy
mudskipper<00:05:18.880> it's<00:05:19.600> the<00:05:19.840> muddy<00:05:20.280> mudskipper

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
mudskipper it's the muddy mudskipper

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.620 
mudskipper it's the muddy mudskipper
show<00:05:23.040> once<00:05:24.040> again<00:05:24.400> if<00:05:24.640> you<00:05:24.850> remember<00:05:25.330> her<00:05:25.450> ren

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
show once again if you remember her ren

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.960 
show once again if you remember her ren
and<00:05:25.780> stimpy<00:05:25.920> you<00:05:26.920> probably<00:05:27.310> remember<00:05:27.490> that

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
and stimpy you probably remember that

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.220 
and stimpy you probably remember that
song<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.360> I<00:05:28.660> just<00:05:28.840> heard<00:05:29.020> in<00:05:29.140> the<00:05:29.200> background

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
song that I just heard in the background

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.310 
song that I just heard in the background
there<00:05:29.980> and<00:05:30.510> you<00:05:31.510> know<00:05:31.630> that<00:05:31.870> brings<00:05:32.140> us<00:05:32.290> down

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
there and you know that brings us down

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.410 
there and you know that brings us down
to<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.830> end<00:05:32.980> I<00:05:33.190> mean<00:05:33.370> it's<00:05:33.490> not<00:05:33.550> a<00:05:33.670> bad<00:05:34.090> ren

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
to the end I mean it's not a bad ren
