the<00:03:24.870> settings<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.410> does<00:03:25.680> show<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
the settings so it does show the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.610 
the settings so it does show the
resolution<00:03:27.270> of<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.360> image<00:03:27.480> rather<00:03:27.870> than<00:03:28.050> I

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
resolution of the image rather than I

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.500

it<00:04:08.400> set<00:04:08.580> contains<00:04:09.060> constrains<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.840> a

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
it set contains constrains it to a

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.710 
it set contains constrains it to a
square<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.310> actual<00:04:11.430> eric<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.360> square

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
square so the actual eric is a square

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.310 
square so the actual eric is a square
rather<00:04:13.350> than<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.650> weird<00:04:13.890> shape<00:04:14.570> so<00:04:15.570> it's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
rather than a weird shape so it's

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.229
