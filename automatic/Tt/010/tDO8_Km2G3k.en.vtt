00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.070
 we make what is the mixture and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.670
 we bake is ready, I have it here 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.890
 precisely here that's how rich he looks and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.510
 smells great because we will do the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.580
 which is the frosting that is very easy and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.189
 very fast good here I put what they are 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.039
 333 points that are butter 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.730
 regular you have to put them to heat 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:42.070
 at a low temperature on your stove in a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 ollita with 23 points also of milk 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.809
 a fourth sorry a table of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.039
 that would be from vanilla extract to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.629
 final anyway I'll put you 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.460
 the ingredients for any mistake that 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.190
 I was wrong here is very easy so no 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.050
 I am like that but I want to tell you that this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.019
 it's already hot is the butter the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.690
 milk and vanilla together that easy 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.450
 good and we will occupy cocoa powder 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.350
 let's also occupy what is sugar 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.690
 glas powder and icing sugar and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.190
 we remove the extract from here 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.979
 vanilla because we no longer occupy it is 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.440
 everything we are going to occupy what is the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.310
 vanilla butter milk the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.380
 cocoa and powdered sugar this good 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.729
 let's occupy what is a bowl or it would be 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.580
 for example a cap like this one 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.170
 plastic that I 'm going to make 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.460
 here my sugar glass is going to sift 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.649
 this is to do the frosting what 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 will sweep nice so decorated the taste 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.039
 Delicious chocolate will love them 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.039
 they are going to see 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.770
 We serve it that way very carefully because 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.770
 that is throwing everything 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.450
 we put the coconut to all also 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.229
 very carefully 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.730
 there is 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.890
 Now what are we going to do? Let's put 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.510
 let's put what is our 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.750
 butter milk and vanilla and 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.170
 let's mix very carefully and 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.990
 let's beat alone 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.489
 this is going to be our next plus that 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.110
 yes be very careful because as it is more not 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.420
 look at the cook that is made this way 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.209
 that very slowly with a lot 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.330
 be careful here, now you finish 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.239
 your frosting can also add what 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.500
 What is this is not how I told you 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.360
 first video raisins which peanut go 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.920
 the leather so what do you guys 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.300
 like to put on your brown 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.300
 look nothing but rich 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.750
 there it is already forming if you can see it 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.420
 and it smells so good you have to beat it very 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.330
 well so that we do not get too gritty 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.220
 you have to beat the well well well if 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.360
 you have better in what the balloon is already 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.660
 he forgot me why he is struggling 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.030
 a little bit is better the balloon is the one 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.280
 we use to beat is better 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.069
 because this we have to be manual 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.620
 it has to have this consistency this 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.630
 not so liquid but something so manageable 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.910
 look 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.880
 so tasty and this is what is going to 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.420
 make me go over our brownie 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.230
 I was going to show off and it was part of showing off 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.230
 see very rich 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.280
 there it is already ready so it looks nothing 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.310
 plus 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.500
 I know you're going to be touched to do it 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.319

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.680
