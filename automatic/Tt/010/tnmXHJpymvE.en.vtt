00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
your refrigerator probably on Sunday or

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.099 
your refrigerator probably on Sunday or
Monday<00:00:29.400> let<00:00:29.999> it<00:00:30.119> defrost<00:00:30.449> slowly<00:00:30.839> in<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
refrigerator for a few days so I would

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.299 
refrigerator for a few days so I would
put<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.870> Sunday<00:00:34.260> Monday<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.739> then<00:00:35.160> by

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
put it in Sunday Monday and then by

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.729 
put it in Sunday Monday and then by
Wednesday<00:00:35.789> it'll<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.090> ready<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.449> brine

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
Wednesday it'll be ready to brine

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.139 
Wednesday it'll be ready to brine
brining<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.829> also<00:00:38.129> great<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.550> fresh<00:00:38.820> birds

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
brining is also great for fresh birds

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.970 
brining is also great for fresh birds
because<00:00:39.629> usually<00:00:39.840> those<00:00:40.199> aren't<00:00:40.559> injected

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
because usually those aren't injected

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.369 
because usually those aren't injected
with<00:00:41.070> any<00:00:41.280> chemicals<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.449> this<00:00:42.660> really<00:00:42.930> helps

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
with any chemicals and this really helps

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.500 
with any chemicals and this really helps
keep<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.769> moisture<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.489> turkey<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.300> it's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
keep the moisture in the turkey so it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.200 
keep the moisture in the turkey so it's
really<00:00:45.899> delicious<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.710> succulent<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
really delicious and succulent on that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
really delicious and succulent on that
so<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> fresh<00:00:49.050> bird<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.440> would<00:00:49.559> probably

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
so with a fresh bird you would probably

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
so with a fresh bird you would probably
brine<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.429> Wednesday<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> cook<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> on
