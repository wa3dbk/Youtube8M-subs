00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.130
 new gta 5 video online and how it is 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.480
 watching here I am with my super albanis 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.740
 Russian bera bera who had it already this 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.690
 car a little abandoned voucher can I 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.980
 to be like that because site like that because if not 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.750
 I just burst two cars with a c4 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 but good a reason as I say I'm 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.610
 here 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.500
 albany even as I say it is a car 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.670
 that I had it quite abandoned and the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.330
 wta how good this video are we going to talk 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.859
 of car we are not going to talk 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 specifically from dawn or solve 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.369
 but we 're going to talk about the topic 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.689
 of the gt5 cars online is the group 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.310
 mystery that here on the map the tal 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.900
 that you are probably interested in the wta that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.150
 It's been a long time since we got a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.650
 video so mysteries and such the truth 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.360
 before his so-called mysteries of gta 5 and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.559
 that's good if you want more mysteries 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.450
 of this game and is about to leave it for the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.010
 comments from hadley in the video that and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.780
 good but in this case I come to talk 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.219
 about a mystery related to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.750
 gta 5 cars so surely 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.280
 good there will be people who already know 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.390
 some people will not but what they 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.829
 I am sure that it is surely 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.780
 interest and you like it since one of the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.550
 things that we like most about gt5 is the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.500
 great variety of cars there and so 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.390
 well I do not know if you know, I suppose so 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.190
 which is good in all of the times it has 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.530
 got in gta 5 online the most cars 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.539
 emblematic so to speak the cars 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 more glamorous rather have been the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.680
 surroundings and the grotti tourism the phd 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.519
 environment forgive the agrotourism that good 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.150
 these two cars, we can 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.250
 find 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.990
 in this store in the store of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.490
 legendary motor sports 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.800
 where all the range cars are 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.940
 high of gt5 and as I say then here they are 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.380
 all the cars that you've got in all 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.460
 in all the dlc if you are here not 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.990
 they will be there even now since what 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.340
 they removed and well as I say here 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.720
 we can find this environment and the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.280
 crotti tourism that cars have been 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 How good that the hotel has gotten 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.910
 one of the most run from all 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.140
 the tasks I think yes yes yes 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.220
 I actually think the Brot and tourism 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.780
 and the center are not what runs the most and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.240
 the most emblematic and those that people 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.860
 he liked it better so well 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.140
 well design a reference towards these 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.310
 two cars that was already in gta 5 from 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.530
 beginning of the game and good service 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.840
 these cars left including the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.770
 efes in the online gt5 custom game 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.970
 that time was passing but to 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.860
 beginning of the game these cars do not 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.119
 they were in gta five times and we 're leaving 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.950
 it is precisely to this location that 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.510
 you are watching on screen 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.910
 here it is worth just here beside 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.619
 this hairdresser northwest of the city 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.420
 of the cars, so to speak 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.979
 here it's worth then we can find a 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.450
 car shop effectively as it is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.520
 watching our screens and well then 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.720
 you have noticed us that in that store of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.369
 cars as there are inside the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.110
 showcases like cars so covered not 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.300
 covered by a blanket and well then 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.580
 we can see that here in this part of the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.600
 shop just up here we see that 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.040
 it hits and 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.050
 and you already know that the sector is not of the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.140
 It's a bad mark and well the car that 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.690
 it's in there we can not confirm it 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.460
 obviously but there are a lot of videos 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.290
 a lot of people a lot of forums 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.330
 they say that the car from here inside is 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.580
 the totally confirmed environment is worth 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.470
 this car is to aesthetics obviously 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.960
 a blanket over and you can can say 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.420
 that I know is a giant flat box 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.320
 but it's not a car that leaves but it 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.550
 It looks a lot like this environment 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.900
 aesthetically even if you have the blanket 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.220
 over convinced front part a 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.810
 little so curved to the front besides 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.280
 we can see that the blanket puts the mark 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.960
 hit and see if we can see it from 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.060
 Look up, look up or take off yes 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.940
 although it is also seen put into use 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.400
 but the air mark of what comes to 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.370
 be the blanket puts off and it's worth then 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.990
 as I say is the aesthetics of this car 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.790
 that I have the blanket over I would say that 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.350
 it's the center one but we're going yes or yes 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.610
 is the good I have seen by a lot 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.170
 of forest people talking about that 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.280
 this was the center not though good as 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.470
 I say with the blanket because you can not 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.210
 Price very well but I would say this 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.530
 is the center is not worth and as I say 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.180
 this was from the beginning of the game 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.230
 since when it left gta 5 here in the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.430
 game on this site 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.020
 so you could do it as a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.640
 reference to the center no no and justly 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.270
 here we can find another car that 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.550
 good 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.860
 he assures us that if he is not going to come by 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.180
 you 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.830
 black team you and you know that the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.750
 tourism is from the agro dÃ­ez velotti brand 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.860
 tourism is called the car and this this 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.240
 book that is even clearer in that 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.010
 I do not know if you can appreciate it well with 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.810
 sheets in the quality of the capturing 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.340
 it is a capture of maximum quality but 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.420
 Well the fact is striking here 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.500
 It reflects a bit of the sun and does not look very 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.330
 well so I recommend you to come 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.250
 you from your own game and what 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.360
 you can see much better but this one did that 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.460
 yes or it can be appreciated perfectly 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.440
 that the back is that of tourism or 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.760
 whether I really do not know if I 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.860
 will remove the blanket will be tourism yes or yes 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.970
 honestly I say the same aesthetic 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.230
 I do not know you can do it to me but the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.510
 comments can you tell me what do you think 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.550
 about total but the truth as I say is 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.470
 that yes or it seems to me clearly that 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.250
 this is the gros and tourism the truth and the 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.900
 good time is also a lot 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.820
 coincidence what I put here for free and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.870
 so two good side two 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.000
 brand cars that have come in 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.500
 this new dlc and apart in one that lanÃºs 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.460
 there was also a car that was the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.930
 hong lei 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.580
 sorry handley so that's also 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.750
 another coincidence you do not know what is something 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.370
 pretty curious I 've put so that 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.540
 will investigate around the building to see 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.860
 If I would make one or the other reference, 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.540
 there was none here seen that when 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.980
 Sister said that this is the mark of a 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.209
 engine what was searched in google it seems like a 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.500
 motorcycle also appeared a tap but 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.090
 good if a tap that splashes water but 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.370
 we go 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.110
 but as I say there seems to seem 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.910
 be that a brand of engines or taps or 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.560
 I looked it up in google image and it did not 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.480
 very strange things appeared and here 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.620
 we can also find part of 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.300
 sure theme lines to see the face of 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.889
 safe tivo 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.530
 that the sure thing has a bad face 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.210
 milk 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.879
 that you put bukingham that this also 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.259
 He has searched before and a 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.449
 so super old car I understand why 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.919
 and why do I believe let's not say anything like 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.060
 some tires and such but as I say no 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.889
 there was nothing more interesting here 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.240
 around the building but basically 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.440
 then it remains to teach because these people 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.849
 is looking at what is looking at this 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.199
 showcase is mine I'm recording by 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.199
 meat favor or manager 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.479
 but do not recharge this is the goal 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.080
 I honestly this this book what 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:16.180
 clarifies the clear aesthetics of a tourism 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.710
 I do not know about you and this one a little too 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.419
 less but yes that looks like c in 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.949
 around if a boy then here I leave you 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.659
 this reference to the cars of 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.699
 again as I say the curiosity of this is 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.930
 that this was already this window 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.569
 store was already from the beginning of 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.590
 game and then well we could and 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.550
 as I say at the beginning a little where 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.080
 there were the cars that can be 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.580
 appreciate here then then this would be 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.050
 a curiosity that since the beginning of 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.849
 game already terror if always standing on 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.870
 the cars and such an Asian then here I 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.310
 dismissal I already liked this video 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.780
 he left the team ports and liked 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.910
 your first canada if you are not and 3 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.910
 1 goodbye that is
