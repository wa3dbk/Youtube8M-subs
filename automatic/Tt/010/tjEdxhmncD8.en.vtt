October when the new moon cycle starts

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.720 
October when the new moon cycle starts
again<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.440> I'll<00:04:54.530> have<00:04:54.680> not<00:04:54.830> reading<00:04:55.100> but<00:04:55.520> for

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
again and I'll have not reading but for

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.700 
again and I'll have not reading but for
this<00:04:55.820> one<00:04:55.880> here<00:04:56.420> it's<00:04:56.870> all<00:04:57.260> of<00:04:57.410> that<00:04:57.560> just

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
this one here it's all of that just

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.190 
this one here it's all of that just
examining<00:04:58.370> your<00:04:58.520> beliefs<00:04:58.910> once<00:04:59.570> again<00:04:59.720> it's<00:05:00.050> a

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
examining your beliefs once again it's a

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.000 
examining your beliefs once again it's a
sword<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:00.890> your<00:05:01.040> your<00:05:01.460> mindset<00:05:01.970> and

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
sword and that your your mindset and

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.560 
sword and that your your mindset and
being<00:05:04.010> in<00:05:04.100> reversed<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.640> think<00:05:04.910> it's<00:05:05.060> all<00:05:05.360> about

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
being in reversed I think it's all about

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.330 
being in reversed I think it's all about
feeling<00:05:05.810> a<00:05:05.990> little<00:05:06.170> bit<00:05:06.260> frustrated<00:05:06.890> that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
feeling a little bit frustrated that

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.890 
feeling a little bit frustrated that
maybe<00:05:07.610> you<00:05:07.820> didn't<00:05:08.090> make<00:05:08.210> as<00:05:08.360> much<00:05:08.510> progress

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
maybe you didn't make as much progress

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.110 
maybe you didn't make as much progress
as<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.680> had<00:05:09.800> hoped<00:05:09.830> when<00:05:10.550> you<00:05:10.670> started<00:05:11.000> your
