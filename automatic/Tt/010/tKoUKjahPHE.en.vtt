forward<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.880> doing<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.330> it's<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:36.930> to

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
forward in doing that it's going to

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.170 
forward in doing that it's going to
happen<00:02:37.200> pretty<00:02:37.560> quickly<00:02:37.950> there<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.910> way<00:02:39.120> to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
happen pretty quickly there is a way to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.390 
happen pretty quickly there is a way to
slow<00:02:39.569> this<00:02:39.780> move<00:02:40.080> down<00:02:40.319> just<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.950> little<00:02:40.980> bit

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
slow this move down just a little bit
