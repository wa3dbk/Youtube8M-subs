Julia and Jack who share with us how it
was<00:01:11.119> possible<00:01:11.539> to<00:01:11.600> design<00:01:12.049> such<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.440> slim

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
was possible to design such a slim

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.840 
was possible to design such a slim
speaker<00:01:17.590> so<00:01:18.590> Julia<00:01:19.100> what<00:01:19.460> was<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.670> biggest

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
speaker so Julia what was the biggest

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.820 
speaker so Julia what was the biggest
challenge<00:01:20.060> in<00:01:20.659> developing<00:01:21.140> such<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.440> slim

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
challenge in developing such a slim

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.490 
challenge in developing such a slim
speaker<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:23.270> biggest<00:01:23.569> challenge<00:01:23.960> really<00:01:24.259> was

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
speaker the biggest challenge really was

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.380 
speaker the biggest challenge really was
designing<00:01:24.860> with<00:01:25.069> drivers<00:01:25.460> both<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.149> tweeter

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
designing with drivers both the tweeter

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.590 
designing with drivers both the tweeter
and<00:01:26.780> especially<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.679> mid-range<00:01:28.130> driver

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
and especially the mid-range driver

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.139 
and especially the mid-range driver
typically<00:01:29.600> these<00:01:29.810> are<00:01:30.080> maybe<00:01:30.740> 75<00:01:31.550> millimeters

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
typically these are maybe 75 millimeters

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.260 
typically these are maybe 75 millimeters
deep<00:01:32.330> but<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.319> fit<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.679> slim<00:01:34.039> speaker<00:01:34.520> we<00:01:35.119> did

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
deep but to fit in a slim speaker we did

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.210 
deep but to fit in a slim speaker we did
a<00:01:35.300> driver<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.720> was<00:01:36.080> perhaps<00:01:36.590> 1/3<00:01:37.039> of<00:01:37.159> that

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
a driver that was perhaps 1/3 of that

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.490 
a driver that was perhaps 1/3 of that
depth<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.569> how<00:01:38.780> did<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.080> do<00:01:39.200> it

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
depth so how did you do it

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.539 
depth so how did you do it
we<00:01:40.460> started<00:01:40.940> by<00:01:41.149> designing<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:42.009> flat<00:01:43.009> radiating

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
we started by designing a flat radiating

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.260 
we started by designing a flat radiating
diaphragm

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
diaphragm

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.059 
diaphragm
now<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:44.869> needed<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.259> have<00:01:45.409> stiffening<00:01:45.890> ribs

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
now this needed to have stiffening ribs

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.469 
now this needed to have stiffening ribs
on<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.460> rear<00:01:46.640> which<00:01:46.909> were<00:01:47.030> integrally

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
on the rear which were integrally

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.690 
on the rear which were integrally
moulded<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.470> we<00:01:48.619> also<00:01:48.740> mounted<00:01:49.220> aluminium

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
moulded and we also mounted aluminium

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.149 
moulded and we also mounted aluminium
discs<00:01:50.450> onto<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:51.170> back<00:01:51.440> of<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.679> ribs<00:01:51.890> to

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
discs onto the back of the ribs to

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.490 
discs onto the back of the ribs to
create<00:01:52.789> a<00:01:52.909> slim<00:01:53.209> but<00:01:53.450> very<00:01:53.659> stiff<00:01:54.049> structure

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
create a slim but very stiff structure

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.830 
create a slim but very stiff structure
right<00:01:55.430> now<00:01:55.640> in<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.909> conventional<00:01:56.450> mid-range

this<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.100> this<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.579> great<00:02:19.790> help<00:02:20.000> because

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
this is a this is a great help because

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.750 
this is a this is a great help because
cabinet<00:02:20.840> bracing<00:02:21.200> means<00:02:21.380> fewer<00:02:22.040> vibrations

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
cabinet bracing means fewer vibrations

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.490 
cabinet bracing means fewer vibrations
of<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.970> cabinet<00:02:23.329> which<00:02:23.600> could<00:02:23.840> which<00:02:24.320> could

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
of the cabinet which could which could

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.570 
of the cabinet which could which could
spoil<00:02:24.709> vehicles

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
spoil vehicles

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.400 
spoil vehicles
okay<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.210> so<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.780> result<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.170> all<00:02:27.290> this

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
okay and so the result of all this

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.380 
okay and so the result of all this
development<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.490> mid-range<00:02:28.940> driver<00:02:29.180> that's

doesn't stop there we've incorporated
smart<00:03:30.739> technology<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.910> sound<00:03:32.270> is

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
smart technology so that the sound is

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.449 
smart technology so that the sound is
automatically<00:03:33.050> adjusted<00:03:33.680> depending<00:03:34.100> on

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
automatically adjusted depending on

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.100 
automatically adjusted depending on

so<00:03:44.620> clearly<00:03:44.860> there<00:03:45.040> are<00:03:45.070> two<00:03:45.220> different<00:03:45.610> size

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
so clearly there are two different size

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.370 
so clearly there are two different size
models<00:03:46.210> what<00:03:46.420> are<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.570> differences<00:03:46.960> well<00:03:47.260> the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
models what are the differences well the

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.950 
models what are the differences well the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
drivers which means that it can go

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.610 
drivers which means that it can go
louder<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.210> there<00:03:52.540> were<00:03:52.600> also<00:03:52.720> two<00:03:53.230> Center

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
louder and there were also two Center

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.850
