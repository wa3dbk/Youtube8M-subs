lot of players don't love coming to the
net<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.660> think<00:00:22.020> most<00:00:22.680> people<00:00:23.220> out<00:00:23.369> there

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
net I think most people out there

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.120 
net I think most people out there
especially<00:00:23.699> at<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> club<00:00:24.570> level<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:25.199> way

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
especially at the club level are way

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.200 
especially at the club level are way
more<00:00:26.160> comfortable<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.349> baseline<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
more comfortable at the baseline so the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.410 
more comfortable at the baseline so the
baton<00:00:30.599> play<00:00:30.949> is<00:00:31.949> set<00:00:32.369> up<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.910> slice

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
baton play is set up with a slice

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.740 
baton play is set up with a slice
backhand<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:34.469> some<00:00:34.829> point<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> rally<00:00:35.750> that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
backhand at some point in the rally that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.920 
backhand at some point in the rally that
is<00:00:36.960> intentionally<00:00:37.829> hit<00:00:38.190> tool<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.879> shorter<00:00:39.690> on

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
is intentionally hit tool and shorter on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.639 
is intentionally hit tool and shorter on
the<00:00:40.680> opponent's<00:00:41.010> backhand<00:00:41.820> side<00:00:42.469> I'm<00:00:43.469> going

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the opponent's backhand side I'm going

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
the opponent's backhand side I'm going
to<00:00:43.739> stress<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> drop<00:00:45.270> shot

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
to stress that this is not a drop shot

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.170 
to stress that this is not a drop shot
because<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.739> love<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.430> idea<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.850> trying

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
because I don't love the idea of trying

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.270 
because I don't love the idea of trying
to<00:00:48.329> hit<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.539> hit<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> great<00:00:49.440> drop<00:00:49.739> shot<00:00:50.010> from

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
to hit it hit a great drop shot from

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.160 
to hit it hit a great drop shot from
super<00:00:50.879> deep<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> court<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
super deep in the court and there's a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.779 
super deep in the court and there's a
good<00:00:52.379> chance<00:00:52.649> I'm<00:00:52.890> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.160> behind<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
good chance I'm going to be behind the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.420 
good chance I'm going to be behind the
baseline<00:00:54.149> when<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> hit<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.899> slice<00:00:55.309> but<00:00:56.309> I'm

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
baseline when I hit this slice but I'm

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250 
baseline when I hit this slice but I'm
definitely<00:00:56.699> trying<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.510> feel<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.020> this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
definitely trying to feel like this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.689 
definitely trying to feel like this
slice<00:00:58.820> if<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.180> saw<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.539> second<00:01:01.289> bounce<00:01:01.699> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
slice if we saw the second bounce the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.250 
slice if we saw the second bounce the
second<00:01:03.090> bounce<00:01:03.270> would<00:01:03.510> definitely<00:01:03.960> land

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
second bounce would definitely land

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.609 
second bounce would definitely land
inside<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.430> baseline<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.439> therefore<00:01:07.439> it's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
inside the baseline and therefore it's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.640 
inside the baseline and therefore it's
it's<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> force<00:01:08.610> mark<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.170> come<00:01:10.439> up

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it's going to force mark here to come up

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.940 
it's going to force mark here to come up
he's<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> pick<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.570> low<00:01:12.840> ball<00:01:13.229> pretty

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
he's going to pick up a low ball pretty

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.820 
he's going to pick up a low ball pretty
far<00:01:14.369> inside<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.119> baseline<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:16.229> which<00:01:16.799> point

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
far inside the baseline at which point

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.690 
far inside the baseline at which point
if<00:01:17.400> he<00:01:18.000> retreated<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.990> rally<00:01:19.290> I'm<00:01:20.220> on

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
if he retreated in this rally I'm on

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.020 
if he retreated in this rally I'm on
serious<00:01:21.630> offense<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.259> point<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> what

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
serious offense at that point so what

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.910 
serious offense at that point so what
you<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.390> find<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.530> lot<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you will find I think is that a lot of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.399 
you will find I think is that a lot of
players<00:01:26.130> are<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.820> forced<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.810> come<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> net

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
players are just forced to come to net

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.190 
players are just forced to come to net
where<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.729> necessarily<00:01:30.000> love<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.990> be

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
where they don't necessarily love to be

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.530 
where they don't necessarily love to be
and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:32.400> I'm<00:01:32.579> thinking<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.180> I've<00:01:33.329> got

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and then I'm thinking that I've got

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.140 
and then I'm thinking that I've got
options<00:01:33.810> when<00:01:34.500> he<00:01:34.530> has<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.070> pop<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.610> ball<00:01:35.909> up

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
options when he has to pop this ball up

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
options when he has to pop this ball up
I<00:01:36.299> could<00:01:36.479> hit<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> lob<00:01:36.960> over<00:01:37.170> him<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.740> could<00:01:38.130> hit<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I could hit a lob over him I could hit a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.240 
I could hit a lob over him I could hit a
passing<00:01:38.850> shot<00:01:39.090> either<00:01:39.360> direction<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.320> could<00:01:41.130> go

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
passing shot either direction I could go

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.880 
passing shot either direction I could go
Adam<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:42.450> make<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.810> fearful<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.860> coming

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
Adam really make them fearful of coming

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.719 
Adam really make them fearful of coming
to<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> net<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.790> next<00:01:45.149> time<00:01:45.329> i<00:01:45.360> use<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.869> play

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
markets a pretty neutral ball I can do a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.039 
markets a pretty neutral ball I can do a
lot<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> things<00:02:49.590> with<00:02:49.919> that<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.400> at<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.730> point

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
lot of things with that so at that point

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.099 
lot of things with that so at that point
it's<00:02:52.049> very<00:02:52.560> important<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.310> try<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.689> be<00:02:54.689> aware

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
it's very important to try to be aware

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.009 
it's very important to try to be aware
of<00:02:55.169> of<00:02:55.709> what<00:02:56.189> mark<00:02:56.549> thinks<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.090> coming<00:02:57.480> next<00:02:57.659> if

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
of of what mark thinks is coming next if

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.319 
of of what mark thinks is coming next if
they're<00:02:58.169> just<00:02:58.379> standing<00:02:58.650> up<00:02:58.950> there<00:02:59.219> kind<00:03:00.209> of

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
they're just standing up there kind of

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.599 
they're just standing up there kind of
praying<00:03:00.569> they<00:03:00.810> don't<00:03:01.019> get<00:03:01.200> hit<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
praying they don't get hit that's the

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.220 
praying they don't get hit that's the
best<00:03:02.849> case<00:03:03.030> scenario<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.629> can<00:03:03.870> pretty<00:03:04.109> much

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
best case scenario you can pretty much

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.589 
best case scenario you can pretty much
hit<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.709> ball<00:03:04.859> anywhere<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.579> catch<00:03:06.329> them

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
hit the ball anywhere and catch them

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.140 
hit the ball anywhere and catch them
flat<00:03:06.840> footed<00:03:07.139> marks<00:03:08.129> obviously<00:03:08.639> a<00:03:08.669> very<00:03:08.939> good

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
flat footed marks obviously a very good

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.830 
flat footed marks obviously a very good
player<00:03:09.419> so<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.079> kind<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.620> look<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.280> see<00:03:11.849> if<00:03:12.180> he

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
player so I I kind of look to see if he

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.740 
player so I I kind of look to see if he
might<00:03:13.049> guess<00:03:13.379> one<00:03:13.739> way<00:03:13.919> or<00:03:14.099> another<00:03:14.599> go<00:03:15.599> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
might guess one way or another go the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.710 
might guess one way or another go the
opposite<00:03:16.260> way<00:03:16.319> if<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:17.400> looks<00:03:17.669> like<00:03:17.879> I<00:03:17.909> drew<00:03:18.449> him

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
opposite way if it looks like I drew him

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.500 
opposite way if it looks like I drew him
in<00:03:18.959> really<00:03:19.590> close<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:20.159> the<00:03:20.280> net<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.669> he

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
in really close to the net and he

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.030 
in really close to the net and he
wouldn't<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.900> able<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.109> cover<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.590> LOB<00:03:22.769> I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
wouldn't be able to cover the LOB I

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.909 
wouldn't be able to cover the LOB I
might<00:03:23.250> throw<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.519> up<00:03:24.019> at<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.290> point<00:03:25.650> that

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
might throw that up at that point that

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.710 
might throw that up at that point that
down<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.370> line<00:03:26.549> forehand<00:03:26.849> looked<00:03:27.359> like<00:03:27.540> my

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
down the line forehand looked like my

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.689 
down the line forehand looked like my
best<00:03:27.959> option<00:03:28.229> so<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.650> went<00:03:28.889> for<00:03:28.979> it<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.310> got<00:03:29.549> it

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699
