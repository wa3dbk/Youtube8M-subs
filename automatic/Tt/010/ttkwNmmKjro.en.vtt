00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.220
 people have stories for those who just 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.480
 Followed the man then a thousand and five 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.039

 the copper or someone from my job channel 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.380
 And little patriot as you can. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.440
 contribute monthly with the amount 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.360
 Do you want law about a link? 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 in the description with the video has a content 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.390
 concrete turned blue a bit from the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.730
 channel operation 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.590
 see what 's hot, but finally guys 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.820
 Let's discuss why there is a click here. 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 on the tablet that has nothing was not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.079
 there for the and for the debate but anyway 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.180
 guys overcame them the beautiful and the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.270
 fighters galera 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 we saw in chapter 7 48 is that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.229
 shinji to light beautiful with the light version 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.369
 King's punch succeeded in destroying a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.640
 Cock arm and will try to see in it some 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.530
 people will stay lativale like that 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.330
 Epic is losing to a galley. 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.799
 unknown to beauty they are 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.080
 unknown but I can not deny the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.090
 force that he was here have been 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.070
 they showed in the coliseum 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.200
 we saw specific chapter called 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.299
 king punch in the hangar 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.090
 we saw the call to the british world 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.579
 in which we have known more of the power 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.170
 of her characters so she isabella 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.229
 alone with a king punch of impotence 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.360
 total can destroy a lot of one 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.340
 gigantic wall he was in a 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.560
 light version there beauty because I think 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.670
 that he would destroy a monkey until he saw 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.399
 and not 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.320
 nor would it be a struggle because there we have to 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.990
 discuss more about pica character 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.659
 is very much present in the current debates 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.540
 since it is in vogue in the chapters 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.759
 current and cursed in turn guys 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.509
 opens a continent with his head and he 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.420
 with his head in his normal form now 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.879
 He has power so I thought it might be 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.860
 he two destroyed that arm I 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.050
 I was not surprised, I thought it was this. 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.740
 there it is appropriate with history for 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.300
 development 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.520
 these two characters also that the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.100
 people had in the coliseum wanted to know what 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.620
 Do you think about this destruction of the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.440
 pica arm is by their power 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.200
 you think it's an exaggeration if you think 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.450
 Yes, it is appropriate with what is being 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.150
 built on history and something else 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.370
 how do you think others 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.740
 participants in the agreement with 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.960
 and the two together 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.240
 along with the crowd do you think 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.770
 what they have to offer for the 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.280
 and in the end in this battle against 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.200
 You think this is the Flemish band. 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.090
 trio of protagonists is not about 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.370
 to welcome uol 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.260
 in the final Flemish will catch the officials 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.880
 and the Flemish and the participants of the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.770
 I'm going to pick up the commanders as 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.620
 It's from Delhi, India. 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.900
 People, I do not know, I think so. 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.300
 It would be cool as the serum said in 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.940
 chapter because you do not from a backup 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.700
 for us to see you and want to play me here 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.310
 gave the alarm but anyway what do you guys 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.230
 They do not give us backup, they protect us. 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.360
 sees the rear end of us while the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.460
 we end up with everyone thinks this 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.900
 legal participation worthy of this 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.970
 character that we know they are 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.670
 sources but I do not have a 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.590
 great in history still old are you 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.810
 see if they were compared by 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.000
 example in the strong marine war 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.710
 people see the allies of the white beard as 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.260
 those of calvo drugs today on the subject of 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.650
 brothers birthday album 22 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.790
 May 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.800
 we go to that he has a participation 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.260
 small that he has a very strong 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.300
 big, but they're there he does not 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.980
 steals a lot so did not want too much 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.180
 it was so great that this 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.240
 character had a participation 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.040
 backup as the allies of beard 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.590
 white in the war and leave the selection 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.510
 for the three protagonists does not 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.000
 only he knows we 're robin there 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.700
 pounds and rebecca may have some 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.650
 great participation also the sage thala 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.790
 But anyway, check it out 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.040
 I hope you enjoyed the debate 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.380
 I would like to hear a lot of you 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.300
 because it is a very random subject that 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.730
 You can do it in different ways. 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.090
 they are many asia they have 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.910
 libero are several characters from the coliseum 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.420
 And that's it folks have later like the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.100
 review of the little hair weight is 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.590
 the Portuguese already the convention has the German 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.010
 why it is finally 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.010
 Hey guys
