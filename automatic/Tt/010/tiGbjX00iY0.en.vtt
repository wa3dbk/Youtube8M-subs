that he likes the pipes where they're

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.650 
that he likes the pipes where they're
placed<00:01:43.980> kinda<00:01:44.980> hard<00:01:45.100> seeing<00:01:45.400> it<00:01:45.850> well<00:01:46.000> junk<00:01:46.510> we

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
placed kinda hard seeing it well junk we

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.430 
placed kinda hard seeing it well junk we
got<00:01:46.840> stanked<00:01:47.380> everywhere<00:01:47.770> but<00:01:49.230> that<00:01:50.230> one's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
got stanked everywhere but that one's

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.230 
got stanked everywhere but that one's
leaning<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.980> little<00:01:51.010> bit<00:01:51.280> but<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.970> how<00:01:55.180> we

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
leaning a little bit but that's how we

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.210 
leaning a little bit but that's how we
like<00:01:55.570> them<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.140> we're<00:01:56.590> gonna<00:01:56.710> build<00:01:56.920> us<00:01:57.100> a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
like them so we're gonna build us a

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.360 
like them so we're gonna build us a
bracket<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:58.060> hold<00:01:58.090> them<00:01:58.360> up<00:01:58.510> there<00:01:58.690> I<00:01:59.370> think

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
bracket to hold them up there I think

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.620 
bracket to hold them up there I think
that's<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.610> good<00:02:00.760> idea<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:04.240> right

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's a good idea all right

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.419 
that's a good idea all right
I<00:02:06.159> got<00:02:07.159> my<00:02:07.310> fabricating<00:02:08.149> juices<00:02:08.630> flowing<00:02:09.429> look

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
I got my fabricating juices flowing look

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.120 
I got my fabricating juices flowing look
who's<00:02:10.670> sitting<00:02:10.910> over<00:02:11.120> there<00:02:11.330> on<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> stump

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
anyway got the beginnings of my brackets

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.160 
anyway got the beginnings of my brackets
for<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.680> stacks<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.580> here<00:02:22.810> I'm<00:02:23.810> gonna<00:02:23.989> keep
