00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
shaping it into an egg by first rolling

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.099 
shaping it into an egg by first rolling
it<00:00:14.219> into<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> ball<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.089> then<00:00:15.240> tapering<00:00:15.839> one

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 

then<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.960> want<00:00:22.169> to<00:00:22.259> create<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.560> base<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.160> your

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
then you want to create a base for your

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.490 
then you want to create a base for your
eggs<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.060> want<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.750> by<00:00:24.960> cutting<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
eggs and you want to do so by cutting a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.859 
eggs and you want to do so by cutting a
circle<00:00:25.739> and<00:00:26.310> creating<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> dip<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.419> center

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
circle and creating a dip in the center

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:37.520 
circle and creating a dip in the center
to<00:00:28.140> rest<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.560> egg<00:00:28.710> in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.439 

I<00:00:39.320> also<00:00:40.320> created<00:00:40.829> some<00:00:41.160> lines<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.760> decides<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
I also created some lines and decides to

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.360 
I also created some lines and decides to
give<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.989> texture<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.160> have

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
give it some texture but you don't have

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.509 
give it some texture but you don't have
to<00:00:45.140> make<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.320> many<00:00:46.530> eggs<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.920> want<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519

to make as many eggs as you want and
bake<00:00:47.969> them<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.329> 10<00:00:48.510> minutes<00:00:49.940> next<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.269> want

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
bake them for 10 minutes next you want

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
bake them for 10 minutes next you want
to<00:00:51.480> roll<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> thin<00:00:52.110> snake<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.860> color<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.339> your

create<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.159> petals

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.730 

then<00:01:00.630> flatten<00:01:01.200> them<00:01:01.380> with<00:01:01.530> your<00:01:01.680> finger

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.499 

now<00:01:08.740> before<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.399> start<00:01:09.520> adding<00:01:09.909> your<00:01:10.060> design

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
now before you start adding your design

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.480 
now before you start adding your design
on<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.780> egg<00:01:10.929> spread<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.439> thin<00:01:11.770> layer<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.039> liquid

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
on the egg spread a thin layer of liquid

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.309 
on the egg spread a thin layer of liquid
clay<00:01:12.909> all<00:01:13.149> over<00:01:13.359> the<00:01:13.630> area<00:01:13.810> where<00:01:14.109> their

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:14.319 
clay all over the area where their

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.230 
clay all over the area where their
design<00:01:14.649> will<00:01:14.859> be<00:01:15.039> to<00:01:15.609> bond<00:01:15.789> the<00:01:15.969> Clay's

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
design will be to bond the Clay's

00:01:16.240 --> 00:02:10.940 
design will be to bond the Clay's
together

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.350 

then<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.130> want<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> add<00:02:12.550> some<00:02:12.820> leaves<00:02:13.000> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
then you want to add some leaves and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.450 
then you want to add some leaves and
make<00:02:13.660> them<00:02:13.810> more<00:02:13.960> detailed<00:02:14.470> by<00:02:14.830> creating<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
make them more detailed by creating the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:03:00.690 
make them more detailed by creating the
nerve<00:02:15.670> occurs<00:02:16.000> with<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.270> needle<00:02:16.660> tool

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.940 

to<00:03:01.330> add<00:03:01.450> more<00:03:01.660> detail<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.020> your<00:03:02.290> egg<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.739> can

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
to add more detail to your egg you can

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.770 
to add more detail to your egg you can
cut<00:03:03.129> a<00:03:03.160> thin<00:03:03.489> strip<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.910> clay<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.239> wrap<00:03:04.599> your

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
cut a thin strip of clay to wrap your

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.809 
cut a thin strip of clay to wrap your
egg<00:03:04.930> with<00:03:05.200> but<00:03:05.800> first<00:03:06.129> make<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.550> more

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
egg with but first make it more

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.940 
egg with but first make it more
interesting<00:03:07.180> by<00:03:07.599> creating<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.170> design<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:08.739> it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
interesting by creating a design on it

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.220 
interesting by creating a design on it
I'm<00:03:09.580> using<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.300> needle<00:03:10.540> tool<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.959> push<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
I'm using a needle tool to push the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
I'm using a needle tool to push the
sides<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.980> in<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.370> sort<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:12.730> zigzag<00:03:12.970> pattern

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.220 

then<00:03:25.250> I'm<00:03:25.490> using<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:26.000> rubber<00:03:26.150> end<00:03:26.420> tool<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.110> a

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
then I'm using a rubber end tool and a

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.020 
then I'm using a rubber end tool and a
brush<00:03:27.500> dipped<00:03:27.740> in<00:03:27.980> liquid<00:03:28.069> clay<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.580> soften

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
the edges at the strip to the egg

00:03:43.010 --> 00:04:16.300 
the edges at the strip to the egg
remembering<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.880> bond<00:03:44.120> with<00:03:44.239> liquid<00:03:44.720> clay

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.759 

after<00:04:17.090> baking<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:17.720> can<00:04:17.750> add<00:04:18.019> more<00:04:18.200> detail<00:04:18.590> to

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
after baking you can add more detail to

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:55.760 
after baking you can add more detail to
your<00:04:18.859> eggs<00:04:19.100> using<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.639> critic<00:04:20.000> plane

if you want them as charms you can

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.960 
if you want them as charms you can
either<00:04:57.900> drill<00:04:58.229> a<00:04:58.259> hole<00:04:58.530> after<00:04:58.830> baking<00:04:59.460> or<00:04:59.669> poke

either drill a hole after baking or poke
a<00:05:00.000> hole<00:05:00.120> before<00:05:00.720> baking<00:05:00.960> them<00:05:01.349> and<00:05:01.560> then

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
a hole before baking them and then

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.409 
a hole before baking them and then
insert<00:05:02.819> a<00:05:02.970> screw<00:05:03.419> bail<00:05:04.729> to<00:05:05.729> give<00:05:05.910> some<00:05:06.180> of<00:05:06.300> the
