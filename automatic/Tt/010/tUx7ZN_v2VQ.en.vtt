00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello we open chuto of orders a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.429
 drawn a city in 3d 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.840
 so I left on a base here 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:19.340
 so we will start by doing the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.340
 first building at these lots anyway 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.770
 hu 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.860
 so after we'll do second because 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:51.690
 that in my class then we should 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:54.960
 speak 3d first and then the second 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.150
 match could not vary a little bit more 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.390
 late when I'll have 50 changes to 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.390
 above 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.800
 in fact 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.090
 the form this document heals not a 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.090
 cake but rather not bad 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.920
 no ab 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:34.670
 another building with a bigger 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:37.150
 roof 3 the treasures be it not a 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.150
 show x 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:19.180
 the 3d but also now rich part 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:25.200
 it is important and we thought the dinos 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:30.730
 building I think I will arrive 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.350
 up to rachis and after you do 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.370
 as you want you can do 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.160
 full of decoration words I like 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.160
 do well the small windows that I 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.250
 glue hours after that to make it 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.799
 like the building in new york 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.799
 others like that I love it 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:15.500
 and that was our first tutorial 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.209
 how to draw cities in 3d 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.669
 I did not finish of course but I 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.470
 will show you the end another time 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.470
 maybe not tell you
