 lula 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.600
 a glance 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.400

 after that liu xia woman 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.470
 I have other countries 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.230
 guillaume gille 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.500

 a little queen like that 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 there is a very important little thing 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.130
 it's a more titled with humor 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 like that so if you knew 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.750
 even the market 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.400
 others for people over 85 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.310
 surprising 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 in celibacy 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.370
 what does Iraq say 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.560
 it sounds the death knell in the audience there is a winner 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.370
 Why 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.410
 English like that 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.410
 we want to use 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.600
 for now the price of gold 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600
 I use them and that's because it makes us 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.059
 but bp took note of the ban 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.059
 so if you do not want a word like me 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.479
 the gardens of the town hall 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:20.029
 something like that 5- foot the pedestrian must put it here 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.549
 e the committee 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.549
 was like that for him but who does not pass 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.959
 latest 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.769
 and after 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.579
 in the second trial 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:35.629
 Christmas 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.169
 pen 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.169
 1 this complaint the pen 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.449
 bitche problem 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.759
 and he goes to the end must be like that of the studio you are going to be done 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.199
 like that 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.199
 I will miss you 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.450
 a single paper queen that run 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.449
 South 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.699
 6 the market 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.949
 ouattara 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:09.839
 here no job 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.839
 our unit 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:15.569
 at arras 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.789
 yet apple 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.789
 unbeaten 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.509
 stack of papers from all sides 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:28.559
 of course 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:32.469
 m we must take the lead of this studio there will be a title like that 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.129
 you put it well like that I thought more happy because the opponent 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.889
 the prism 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.569
 it is essential 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.239
 if you see the paper 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.179
 so good 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.529
 then you see a week 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:53.239
 and now you're going to put boiled water style that you thought 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.909
 a small margin on the same difficult thing 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.700
 he did not want 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.399
 the future of small habits 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.399
 all summer on the side there to know it's this side of the Atlantic 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.419
 l 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.179
 who will be able to 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:11.499
 the good figure 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.649
 so now that you know 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.430
 walk between them 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.430
 the market index she shows skeptical 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.789
 via this page 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.789
 it's done market is always too much 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.090
 the parquet of paris opened an investigation 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.469
 but we learn quickly 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:34.410
 to see him come back from the back 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.219
 straight ahead 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:37.279
 Quebec 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.649
 we still do not know by the group yesterday 10h29 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.740
 it will probably have been modified by j 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.650
 and normally it works 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.340
 for me it's because I like 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.689
 very big part 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.689
 these are world prices 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.069
 to note the piston 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.069
 stepstone a little crazy thing 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.520
 for the unit 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.319
 a rally of finland 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.509
 good then 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.419
 now we are going to put pressure on him 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.309
 ramuntxo review 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:20.309
 Parisian Saturday 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.919
 europe 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.979
 - lna argh 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.360
 the decision announced by m 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.360
 sometimes still paper and market 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:52.809
 briefly a third time 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.379
 the vehicle 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.360
 there was no case 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.360
 Querrey 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.379
 they never 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.569
 the cranial perimeter of wounds it works 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.619
 the Coptic community 

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:15.639
 presumed inside the silo 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.639
 the principle it is simpler than that 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.180
 alas I will tell you that we are determined to follow him 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.240
 clap that I will give everything 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.930
 he lies on a farm 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.930
 the test performed 36 36 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.229
 you clearly see 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.419
 then tuesday 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:43.839
 it's so sad 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:46.330
 Maxppp 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.039
 that's done 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.139
 3 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:52.069
 France 2 will focus 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.879
 we will see 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.319
 in a given time to let go 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.139
 m 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.139
 when she is here a little trick 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.919
 unesco 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.279
 at least that's it 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.370
 Why 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.199
 releasing the multi 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.800
 sequential shutter 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.300
 the paper so here 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.080
 because the water 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.980
 probably not a coincidence if it's not very powerful at the end to the other for 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:32.619
 the moment yes 

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.619
 paris - the paris stock exchange corrected the shooting 

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:40.460
 I hope some media 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.879
 maybe we can be less 

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.879
 century photo library 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.819
 at the end of May 

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:51.149
 pti
