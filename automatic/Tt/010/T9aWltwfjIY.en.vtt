00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
but most of it doesn't seem to take

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.080 
but most of it doesn't seem to take
place<00:02:07.719> once<00:02:08.110> upon<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.440> time<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.190> more<00:02:09.700> around

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
place once upon a time but more around

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.300 
place once upon a time but more around
the<00:02:10.179> time<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.479> maybe<00:02:10.869> Shrek<00:02:11.440> lives<00:02:11.739> it<00:02:11.980> in

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
the time that maybe Shrek lives it in

the time that maybe Shrek lives it in
fact<00:02:12.580> yeah<00:02:13.120> shrim<00:02:13.569> probably<00:02:13.959> stole<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> lot

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
fact yeah shrim probably stole a lot

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.229 
fact yeah shrim probably stole a lot
from<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:14.769> movie<00:02:15.069> didn't<00:02:15.340> they<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.060> does<00:02:16.209> that

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
from this movie didn't they so does that

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.600 
from this movie didn't they so does that
make<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> Lanham<00:02:16.870> bad<00:02:17.220> necessarily<00:02:18.220> if

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
make a Lanham bad necessarily if

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.640 
make a Lanham bad necessarily if
anything<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.239> makes<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.599> unique<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.500> very

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
anything it makes it unique it's a very

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.319 
anything it makes it unique it's a very
different<00:02:21.010> take<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.459> Disney<00:02:21.760> was<00:02:21.940> trying<00:02:22.209> to

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
different take that Disney was trying to

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.059 
different take that Disney was trying to
do<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.840> apparently<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.410> really<00:02:23.650> paid<00:02:23.829> off

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
do and apparently it really paid off

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.130 
do and apparently it really paid off
the<00:02:24.459> jokes<00:02:24.730> rather<00:02:24.940> Williams<00:02:25.420> makes<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.840> funny

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
the jokes rather Williams makes is funny

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.630 
the jokes rather Williams makes is funny
and<00:02:26.349> despite<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.860> fact<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.400> doesn't

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
and despite the fact that it doesn't

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.490 
and despite the fact that it doesn't
look<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:27.879> Arabia<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.599> still<00:02:28.959> looks<00:02:29.260> great

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500

those incredibly catchy beats at times

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.610

some<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.329> modern<00:02:58.750> talking<00:02:58.989> get<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.349> little

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
some of the modern talking get a little

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.199 
some of the modern talking get a little
annoying<00:02:59.859> like<00:03:00.250> little<00:03:00.549> lad<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.880> tries<00:03:01.060> to

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
more but I think it still has the same

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.990 
more but I think it still has the same
Disney<00:03:05.500> heart<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:06.160> is<00:03:06.280> very<00:03:06.519> entertaining

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
Disney heart and it is very entertaining
