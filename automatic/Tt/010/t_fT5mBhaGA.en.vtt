Tony's priority was creating complicated
and<00:00:07.160> asymmetrical<00:00:08.160> frame<00:00:09.170> for<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.230> picture

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.710 
and asymmetrical frame for the picture
and<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.920> visual<00:00:14.519> was<00:00:15.800> nearly<00:00:16.800> all<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:18.539> he

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
and the visual was nearly all of what he

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.910 
and the visual was nearly all of what he
was<00:00:18.869> doing<00:00:19.100> he<00:00:20.100> didn't<00:00:20.520> particularly<00:00:21.920> it

struck<00:00:23.279> me<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:24.330> great<00:00:24.990> ideas<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
struck me have great ideas on the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.700 
struck me have great ideas on the
through<00:00:26.220> line<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> story<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.410> about

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
through line of the story it was about

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.640 
through line of the story it was about
moving<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.849> interesting<00:00:30.660> visual<00:00:31.080> against

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
moving one interesting visual against

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.880 
moving one interesting visual against
another

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.869 

I<00:00:41.469> think<00:00:42.469> generally<00:00:43.070> people<00:00:43.309> are<00:00:45.879> orientating

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
I think generally people are orientating

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.860 
I think generally people are orientating
themselves<00:00:47.449> toward<00:00:48.429> multi<00:00:49.429> perceptions<00:00:50.120> so

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
themselves toward multi perceptions so

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.079 
themselves toward multi perceptions so
the<00:00:50.989> idea<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.500> crossing<00:00:51.769> over<00:00:52.100> into<00:00:52.549> different

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
the idea of crossing over into different

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.119 
the idea of crossing over into different
areas<00:00:53.239> all<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.629> time<00:00:53.929> is<00:00:54.140> becoming<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.710> purple

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
areas all the time is becoming a purple

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.799 
areas all the time is becoming a purple
perfectly<00:00:55.729> natural<00:00:56.739> attribute<00:00:58.809> it's

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
perfectly natural attribute it's

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:00.670 
perfectly natural attribute it's
inevitable

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
inevitable

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.099

brand<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.780> thought<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:35.930> was<00:02:36.049> pretty<00:02:36.319> cool<00:02:37.209> and

brand I thought that was pretty cool and

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.030 
brand I thought that was pretty cool and
I<00:02:38.299> think<00:02:38.390> maybe<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.930> try<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.409> apply<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.650> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
I think maybe I try and apply that to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.250 
I think maybe I try and apply that to
what<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.340> do<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:41.260> guess<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.440> such<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> fast<00:02:43.069> event

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
what I do I guess in such a fast event

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.870 
what I do I guess in such a fast event
society<00:02:45.459> we<00:02:46.459> want<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:48.080> want<00:02:48.290> our<00:02:48.880> provocations

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
society we want we want our provocations

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.740 
society we want we want our provocations
and<00:02:50.030> our<00:02:50.180> confrontations<00:02:51.050> immediately
