00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
to wipe each tee but what are you really

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.739 
to wipe each tee but what are you really
doing<00:01:52.459> when<00:01:52.789> you<00:01:52.880> pull<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.209> towel<00:01:53.420> from<00:01:53.659> the

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
doing when you pull the towel from the
