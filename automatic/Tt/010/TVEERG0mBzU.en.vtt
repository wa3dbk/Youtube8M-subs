00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.280 
NYC CNC today we're going to take a look
at<00:00:05.549> what<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.819> tormach<00:00:06.150> can<00:00:06.390> do<00:00:06.569> we're<00:00:07.170> going

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
at what the tormach can do we're going

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.930 
at what the tormach can do we're going
to<00:00:07.350> use<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> roughing<00:00:07.950> end<00:00:08.130> mill<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.550> let's

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
to use a roughing end mill and let's

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.730 
to use a roughing end mill and let's
push<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.210> as<00:00:09.420> hard<00:00:09.450> as<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.900> can<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.290> see<00:00:10.530> what

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
push it as hard as we can to see what

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.799 
push it as hard as we can to see what
sort<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.980> cut<00:00:11.219> depth<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.700> can<00:00:11.849> take<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.570> chunk

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
sort of cut depth we can take in a chunk

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.810 
sort of cut depth we can take in a chunk
of<00:00:12.929> aluminum<00:00:13.040> this<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.219> not<00:00:14.370> something<00:00:14.759> I

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
of aluminum this is not something I

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.160 
of aluminum this is not something I
actually<00:00:14.969> think<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> most<00:00:15.660> important

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
actually think is the most important

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.140 
actually think is the most important
test<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> should<00:00:16.710> do<00:00:16.890> or<00:00:17.400> think<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:17.970> when

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
test you should do or think about when

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.269 
test you should do or think about when
you're<00:00:18.300> buying<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.779> home<00:00:18.990> CNC<00:00:19.529> mill<00:00:19.740> the

you're buying a home CNC mill the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.830 
you're buying a home CNC mill the
tormach<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.789> not<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> vertical<00:00:21.510> machining

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

Center I love mine it's great but I
didn't<00:00:25.080> buy<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:25.410> how<00:00:26.310> much<00:00:26.519> meat<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.119> could

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
didn't buy it for how much meat it could

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.540 
didn't buy it for how much meat it could
take<00:00:27.420> off<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.840> one<00:00:28.019> pass<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:28.769> rather<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.279> the

people<00:00:36.180> asked<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.899> doesn't<00:00:37.559> mean<00:00:37.710> we

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
people asked for it and doesn't mean we

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.380 
people asked for it and doesn't mean we
can't<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> little<00:00:38.219> fun<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> I'm

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
can't have a little fun with it I'm

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
can't have a little fun with it I'm
going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> use<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.930> 1/2<00:00:40.170> inch<00:00:40.410> 3<00:00:40.680> flute<00:00:40.950> high

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
going to use this 1/2 inch 3 flute high

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.250 
going to use this 1/2 inch 3 flute high

so<00:00:43.680> take<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> look<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.399> gee<00:00:44.579> wizard<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.030> some

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so take a look at gee wizard for some

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
so take a look at gee wizard for some
speeds<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.629> feeds<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.230> let's<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.890> what

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
speeds and feeds and then let's see what

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.220 
speeds and feeds and then let's see what
we<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.340> get<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.270> mill<00:00:48.420> alright<00:00:49.079> I've

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
we can get out of the mill alright I've

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.779 
we can get out of the mill alright I've
got<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.680> carbide<00:00:50.399> end<00:00:50.430> mill<00:00:50.640> 1/2<00:00:51.360> inch<00:00:51.629> 3<00:00:52.199> flute

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
got my carbide end mill 1/2 inch 3 flute

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.700 
got my carbide end mill 1/2 inch 3 flute
3/4<00:00:53.789> inch<00:00:53.910> stick<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.329> check<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> rougher<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
3/4 inch stick out check the rougher and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.830 
3/4 inch stick out check the rougher and
let's<00:00:56.250> assume<00:00:56.399> we're<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> try<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> cut<00:00:57.510> a

point seven five horsepower if we were

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.340 
point seven five horsepower if we were
to<00:01:10.590> kick<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.330> here<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.810> should<00:01:13.200> be

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
to kick that up to here we should be

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
to kick that up to here we should be
able<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.560> go<00:01:13.770> 35<00:01:14.700> inches<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> minute<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.509> is

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
able to go 35 inches a minute which is

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.230 
able to go 35 inches a minute which is
right<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.530> peak<00:01:16.770> horsepower<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.850> let's<00:01:18.060> go

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
right at the peak horsepower so let's go

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.570 
right at the peak horsepower so let's go
ahead<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.170> take<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> look<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> machine<00:01:20.369> see

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
ahead and take a look at the machine see

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
ahead and take a look at the machine see
we<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.820> we're<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> start<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> point

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
we get we're going to start with a point

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.039 
we get we're going to start with a point
three<00:01:22.799> inch<00:01:22.979> depth<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.520> cut<00:01:23.759> at<00:01:23.970> 18<00:01:24.720> inches<00:01:24.900> a

this<00:01:45.280> time<00:01:45.460> we'll<00:01:45.610> do<00:01:45.759> it<00:01:45.789> at<00:01:46.240> 35<00:01:46.780> inches<00:01:47.140> a

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
this time we'll do it at 35 inches a

this time we'll do it at 35 inches a
minute<00:01:47.560> which<00:01:47.920> should<00:01:48.100> be<00:01:48.189> about<00:01:48.430> point<00:01:48.729> eight

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970

horsepower<00:01:57.000> sounded<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.149> little<00:01:58.299> bit<00:01:58.539> more<00:01:58.720> of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
horsepower sounded a little bit more of

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.230 
horsepower sounded a little bit more of
a<00:01:58.840> strain<00:01:59.170> but<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.979> think<00:02:00.610> we've<00:02:00.700> got<00:02:00.729> some<00:02:01.090> room

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
a strain but I think we've got some room

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
a strain but I think we've got some room
left<00:02:01.270> here<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.990> take<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.170> more<00:02:02.409> aggressive<00:02:02.560> cut

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.580 

okay<00:02:06.310> third<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.939> last<00:02:07.179> cut<00:02:07.659> at<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:08.080> step<00:02:08.349> of

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
okay third and last cut at this step of

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.440 
okay third and last cut at this step of
cut<00:02:08.860> again<00:02:09.459> we're<00:02:09.670> still<00:02:09.880> at<00:02:10.030> point<00:02:10.299> three

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
cut again we're still at point three

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.240 
cut again we're still at point three
inches<00:02:10.959> if<00:02:11.140> we're<00:02:11.230> going<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.380> try<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.680> at<00:02:11.799> 50

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
inches if we're going to try it at 50

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.949 
inches if we're going to try it at 50
inches<00:02:12.549> a<00:02:12.610> minute<00:02:12.970> according<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.420> G<00:02:13.660> wizard

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.680 
inches a minute according to G wizard
that's<00:02:14.110> one<00:02:14.380> point<00:02:14.590> two<00:02:14.890> five<00:02:14.920> horsepower

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
that's one point two five horsepower

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.000 
that's one point two five horsepower
just<00:02:16.690> starting<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.110> push<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.560> limit<00:02:17.830> about

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
just starting to push the limit about

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.559 
just starting to push the limit about
what<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.280> tormach<00:02:18.580> can<00:02:18.760> do<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.120> wanted<00:02:19.450> to

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
what the tormach can do I wanted to

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.210 
what the tormach can do I wanted to
mention<00:02:19.720> as<00:02:19.989> well<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.620> important<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.010> you

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
mention as well it's important that you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.890 
mention as well it's important that you
choke<00:02:21.549> up<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.150> end<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:22.690> I'm<00:02:22.870> doing

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
choke up on the end of it as I'm doing

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.050 
choke up on the end of it as I'm doing
here<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.709> minimize<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.430> tools

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
here so that you minimize the tools

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:35.309 
here so that you minimize the tools
stick<00:02:25.330> out<00:02:25.480> from<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.780> tool<00:02:25.959> holder<00:02:34.319> okay

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
stick out from the tool holder okay

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.930 
stick out from the tool holder okay
could<00:02:35.560> definitely<00:02:35.769> hear<00:02:36.069> more<00:02:36.280> strain<00:02:36.670> there

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
could definitely hear more strain there

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.900 
could definitely hear more strain there
but<00:02:37.150> again<00:02:37.269> tool<00:02:38.079> is<00:02:38.230> still<00:02:38.349> intact<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:39.340> you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
but again tool is still intact and you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.930 
but again tool is still intact and you
look<00:02:40.150> at<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.709> bottom<00:02:41.709> surface<00:02:42.040> finish<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.579> the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
look at the bottom surface finish of the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.330 
look at the bottom surface finish of the
part<00:02:43.720> seems<00:02:44.049> okay<00:02:44.440> for<00:02:44.769> especially<00:02:45.040> for<00:02:45.220> a

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
part seems okay for especially for a

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.640 
part seems okay for especially for a
rougher<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.209> let's<00:02:46.390> go<00:02:46.959> down<00:02:47.109> to<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.290> deeper

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
rougher so let's go down to a deeper

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.930 
rougher so let's go down to a deeper
depth<00:02:47.859> of<00:02:47.980> cut<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.190> see<00:02:48.459> what<00:02:48.579> we<00:02:48.700> get<00:02:50.940> okay

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
depth of cut and see what we get okay

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.390 
depth of cut and see what we get okay
here<00:02:52.329> come<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.630> real<00:02:52.780> tests<00:02:53.290> half<00:02:53.950> an<00:02:54.190> inch

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
here come the real tests half an inch

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.599 
here come the real tests half an inch
depth<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.150> cut<00:02:55.389> I'm<00:02:56.139> going<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.889> start<00:02:57.220> off<00:02:57.370> at

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
depth of cut I'm going to start off at

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.330 
depth of cut I'm going to start off at
18<00:02:58.090> inches<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.630> minute<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.470> should<00:02:59.769> be<00:02:59.950> about

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
18 inches a minute that should be about

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.009 
18 inches a minute that should be about
3/4<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.389> horsepower

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
3/4 of a horsepower

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.569 
3/4 of a horsepower
again<00:03:02.290> all<00:03:02.530> these<00:03:02.769> tests<00:03:03.100> are<00:03:03.190> being<00:03:03.340> run<00:03:03.459> at

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
again all these tests are being run at

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:21.390 
again all these tests are being run at
3,000<00:03:04.150> rpms<00:03:04.540> let's<00:03:05.139> see<00:03:05.440> what<00:03:05.680> happens

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.710 

that<00:03:22.400> sounded<00:03:22.730> pretty<00:03:22.970> nice<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.450> think<00:03:23.630> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
that sounded pretty nice I think the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.860 
that sounded pretty nice I think the
mill<00:03:23.870> actually<00:03:24.319> like<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.430> cut<00:03:25.730> same<00:03:26.569> cut

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
mill actually like that cut same cut

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.559 
mill actually like that cut same cut
this<00:03:27.230> time<00:03:27.470> at<00:03:27.650> 27<00:03:28.340> inches<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.760> minute<00:03:29.090> which

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
this time at 27 inches a minute which

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:39.990 
this time at 27 inches a minute which
should<00:03:29.840> be<00:03:30.050> one<00:03:30.230> point<00:03:30.830> one<00:03:31.190> three<00:03:31.610> horsepower

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.070 

okay<00:03:41.000> sorry<00:03:41.240> bad<00:03:41.450> timing<00:03:41.720> on<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.959> air

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
okay sorry bad timing on the air

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.949 
okay sorry bad timing on the air
compressor<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:43.310> definitely<00:03:43.850> sounded<00:03:44.300> under

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
compressor that definitely sounded under

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.600 
compressor that definitely sounded under
more<00:03:45.140> strain<00:03:45.530> let<00:03:45.800> me<00:03:45.890> clean<00:03:46.190> off<00:03:46.340> the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
more strain let me clean off the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.449 
more strain let me clean off the
material<00:03:47.300> here<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.720> try<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.350> again<00:03:48.459> okay

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
material here and try that again okay

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.160 
material here and try that again okay
let's<00:03:49.670> try<00:03:49.880> that<00:03:49.940> again<00:03:50.090> half<00:03:50.630> an<00:03:50.780> inch<00:03:50.930> depth

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
let's try that again half an inch depth

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.800 
let's try that again half an inch depth
of<00:03:51.290> cut<00:03:51.500> 27<00:03:52.489> inches<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.820> minute<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.330> sounds<00:03:53.690> like

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
of cut 27 inches a minute it sounds like

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.150 
of cut 27 inches a minute it sounds like
this<00:03:53.959> is<00:03:54.140> pushing<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.560> limit<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.950> tool

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
this is pushing the limit of the tool

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:06.559 
this is pushing the limit of the tool
let's<00:03:56.090> take<00:03:56.330> a<00:03:56.360> look

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.120 

yep<00:04:07.599> that's<00:04:08.319> all<00:04:08.470> we're<00:04:08.560> going<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.739> get<00:04:08.950> that

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
yep that's all we're going to get that

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.520 
yep that's all we're going to get that
should<00:04:09.340> be<00:04:09.430> 1.1<00:04:10.090> 3<00:04:10.300> horsepower<00:04:10.599> I<00:04:10.989> told<00:04:11.380> myself

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
should be 1.1 3 horsepower I told myself

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.229 
should be 1.1 3 horsepower I told myself
making<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.099> video<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.550> I'd<00:04:12.610> be<00:04:12.730> okay<00:04:13.030> if<00:04:13.060> I

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
making this video that I'd be okay if I

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.210 
making this video that I'd be okay if I
broke<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.630> end<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.870> mill<00:04:13.989> but<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.650> don't<00:04:15.010> think

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
broke the end of mill but I don't think

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.650 
broke the end of mill but I don't think
