months chamomile lemon balm onions and
then<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.769> dedicated<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.230> duckweed<00:00:26.960> so

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
then I dedicated this to duckweed so

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.769 
then I dedicated this to duckweed so
this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.340> where<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.519> get<00:00:29.670> most<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.150> my<00:00:30.240> fish<00:00:30.510> food

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
this is where I get most of my fish food

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.490 
this is where I get most of my fish food
I<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.730> other<00:00:32.730> fish<00:00:32.910> food<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> use<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
I have other fish food that I use that I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
I have other fish food that I use that I
bought<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.370> grow<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:35.969> too<00:00:36.180> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
bought but I just grow this here too to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
bought but I just grow this here too to
supplements<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.350> diverse<00:00:37.680> diet

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
supplements like it's a diverse diet

supplements like it's a diverse diet
going<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> filter<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> made<00:00:40.440> out<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
going on this is a filter I made out of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.529 
going on this is a filter I made out of
gravel<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.290> sponges<00:00:44.090> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.210> look<00:00:45.390> right

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
gravel and sponges if you look right

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.410 
gravel and sponges if you look right
here<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.890> water<00:00:47.129> gets<00:00:47.520> piped<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.090> from<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
here the water gets piped in from the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
here the water gets piped in from the
fish<00:00:48.629> tank<00:00:48.660> via<00:00:49.230> gravity<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.120> then<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> just

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
fish tank via gravity and then it just

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.110 
fish tank via gravity and then it just
goes<00:00:51.570> straight<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.230> bottom<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.090> then<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
goes straight to the bottom and then it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
goes straight to the bottom and then it
fills<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.230> bucket<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.430> exits

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
fills up the bucket and then exits

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.510 
fills up the bucket and then exits
through<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:59.010> makeshift

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
through here so a little makeshift

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.439 
through here so a little makeshift
filter<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> made<00:01:01.520> it<00:01:02.520> works<00:01:02.670> pretty<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:02.969> it's

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
filter I made it works pretty well it's

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.380 
filter I made it works pretty well it's
been<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.159> it's<00:01:05.159> been<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.400> use<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.640> about<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
been in it's been in use for about a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.990 
been in it's been in use for about a
year<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.189> I<00:01:08.189> haven't<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.850> noticed

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
year now and I haven't really noticed

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.830 
year now and I haven't really noticed
any<00:01:09.479> problems<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> here's<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> fish<00:01:12.030> tank<00:01:12.390> we

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
any problems so here's the fish tank we

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.370 
any problems so here's the fish tank we
got<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.170> goldfish<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.430> here

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
got some goldfish going on in here

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.800 
got some goldfish going on in here
see<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.710> get

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
see if we can get

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.359 
see if we can get
McCoy<00:01:19.030> probably<00:01:20.030> I'll<00:01:20.090> be<00:01:20.180> able<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.360> see<00:01:20.630> him

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
McCoy probably I'll be able to see him

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.039 
McCoy probably I'll be able to see him
but<00:01:22.810> anyways<00:01:24.640> these<00:01:25.640> goldfish<00:01:26.119> are<00:01:26.360> probably

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
but anyways these goldfish are probably

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.039 
but anyways these goldfish are probably
three<00:01:27.740> months<00:01:28.009> old<00:01:28.340> four<00:01:28.700> months<00:01:28.970> old<00:01:29.090> they're

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
three months old four months old they're

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.499 
three months old four months old they're
growing<00:01:30.320> really<00:01:30.440> fast<00:01:33.820> after<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:35.060> we<00:01:35.390> have

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
growing really fast after that we have

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.190 
growing really fast after that we have
the<00:01:35.630> gravel<00:01:36.020> bed<00:01:36.140> system<00:01:37.509> initially<00:01:38.509> I<00:01:38.780> try<00:01:39.140> to

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
the gravel bed system initially I try to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.170 
the gravel bed system initially I try to
do<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.619> gravity<00:01:40.100> based<00:01:40.340> as<00:01:40.610> well<00:01:40.820> but<00:01:41.060> it

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
do it gravity based as well but it

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.630 
do it gravity based as well but it
didn't<00:01:41.450> work<00:01:41.479> too<00:01:42.110> good<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.799> just<00:01:43.190> kind<00:01:43.490> of

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
didn't work too good so I just kind of

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.270 
didn't work too good so I just kind of
you<00:01:44.509> can<00:01:44.600> see<00:01:44.780> I<00:01:44.810> kind<00:01:45.049> of<00:01:45.170> piped<00:01:45.470> it<00:01:45.710> right

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
you can see I kind of piped it right

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.539 
you can see I kind of piped it right
there<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:48.110> some<00:01:48.320> PVC<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.070> then<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:49.250> just<00:01:49.399> have

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
there just some PVC and then I just have

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.850 
there just some PVC and then I just have
a<00:01:49.580> pump<00:01:49.940> pushing<00:01:50.929> water<00:01:51.140> there's<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.649> little

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
a pump pushing water there's a little

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.050 
a pump pushing water there's a little
bit<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.009> duck<00:01:52.280> weed<00:01:52.490> growing<00:01:52.759> over<00:01:53.090> here<00:01:55.060> I'm

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
bit of duck weed growing over here I'm

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.570 
bit of duck weed growing over here I'm
not<00:01:56.300> gonna<00:01:56.420> clean<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:56.720> out<00:01:56.990> as<00:01:57.140> way<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.590> it's

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
not gonna clean that out as way to it's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.899 
not gonna clean that out as way to it's
just<00:01:58.700> not<00:01:59.330> worth<00:01:59.509> it<00:01:59.690> so<00:02:00.520> extra<00:02:01.520> duck<00:02:01.700> weed

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
just not worth it so extra duck weed

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.559 
just not worth it so extra duck weed
growth<00:02:02.270> whatever<00:02:04.090> here's<00:02:05.090> my<00:02:05.240> tomato<00:02:05.630> plant

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
growth whatever here's my tomato plant

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.830 
growth whatever here's my tomato plant
yeah<00:02:08.569> it's<00:02:09.470> definitely<00:02:09.979> taking<00:02:10.970> over

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
yeah it's definitely taking over

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.270 
yeah it's definitely taking over
everything<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:15.380> pretty<00:02:15.500> rad

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
everything it's pretty rad

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.820 
everything it's pretty rad
I've<00:02:16.489> pulled<00:02:16.910> probably<00:02:17.480> about<00:02:17.660> 42<00:02:18.110> pounds<00:02:18.560> of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
I've pulled probably about 42 pounds of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.370 
I've pulled probably about 42 pounds of
tomatoes<00:02:18.980> off<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:19.790> thing<00:02:20.060> maybe<00:02:20.989> thirty

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
tomatoes off of this thing maybe thirty

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.840 
tomatoes off of this thing maybe thirty
but<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.730> between<00:02:23.150> there<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:25.400> tomatoes

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
but in between there the tomatoes

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.640 
but in between there the tomatoes
normally<00:02:26.299> get<00:02:26.480> about<00:02:26.660> twice<00:02:26.989> this<00:02:27.320> size

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
normally get about twice this size

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
the the fruit starts to declining starts

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.240 
the the fruit starts to declining starts
to<00:02:36.620> decline<00:02:36.860> in<00:02:37.370> terms<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:38.590> how<00:02:39.590> big<00:02:39.860> they<00:02:40.040> are

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
to decline in terms of how big they are

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.220 
to decline in terms of how big they are
the<00:02:40.760> flavor<00:02:41.120> stuff<00:02:41.480> like<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:41.989> probably

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
the flavor stuff like that so probably

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.289 
the flavor stuff like that so probably
gonna<00:02:42.350> pull<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.769> soon<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.549> put<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> new<00:02:43.940> one<00:02:43.970> in

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
other I can't I couldn't figure out how

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.849 
other I can't I couldn't figure out how
to<00:04:18.139> eat<00:04:18.350> it<00:04:18.470> at<00:04:18.560> first<00:04:18.769> but<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:19.160> did<00:04:19.609> eventually

to eat it at first but I did eventually
so<00:04:22.490> that's<00:04:22.669> overview<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.600> system<00:04:24.669> it's<00:04:25.669> a

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
so that's overview of the system it's a

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.120 
so that's overview of the system it's a
pretty<00:04:26.530> simple<00:04:27.530> we<00:04:27.710> got<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.880> anti-siphon<00:04:28.880> valve

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
pretty simple we got a anti-siphon valve

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.350 
pretty simple we got a anti-siphon valve
into<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.160> sump<00:04:31.600> into<00:04:32.600> a<00:04:32.870> pump<00:04:33.490> back<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:35.120> then

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
into a sump into a pump back in and then

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.820 
into a sump into a pump back in and then
recycles<00:04:36.050> you<00:04:36.890> got<00:04:37.039> that<00:04:38.320> filter<00:04:39.320> draining

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
recycles you got that filter draining

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.700 
recycles you got that filter draining
into<00:04:40.039> the<00:04:40.600> end<00:04:41.600> of<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.840> raft<00:04:42.050> with<00:04:42.560> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
into the end of the raft with the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.380 
into the end of the raft with the
duckweed<00:04:43.130> we<00:04:43.370> got<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.610> floating<00:04:43.970> raft<00:04:44.180> system

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
duckweed we got the floating raft system

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.900 
duckweed we got the floating raft system
going<00:04:44.810> on<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.500> then<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:46.160> comes<00:04:46.520> out<00:04:46.640> right

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
going on and then it comes out right

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
going on and then it comes out right
here<00:04:48.250> goes<00:04:49.250> all<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.580> way<00:04:49.700> down<00:04:49.930> right

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
here goes all the way down right

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.170 
here goes all the way down right
underneath<00:04:51.229> and<00:04:51.680> back<00:04:51.950> in<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:52.729> sump<00:04:53.000> tank

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
underneath and back in to the sump tank

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.120 
underneath and back in to the sump tank
and<00:04:53.510> that's<00:04:53.750> basically<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.500> whole<00:04:54.620> thing<00:04:54.860> I

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
and that's basically the whole thing I

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.080 
and that's basically the whole thing I
built<00:04:55.669> this<00:04:55.820> greenhouse<00:04:56.360> from<00:04:57.020> scratch

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
built this greenhouse from scratch

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.500 
built this greenhouse from scratch
it's<00:04:59.990> pretty<00:05:00.860> rad<00:05:01.070> let's<00:05:02.060> see<00:05:02.180> if<00:05:02.240> we<00:05:02.330> get<00:05:02.450> a

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
it's pretty rad let's see if we get a

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.930 
it's pretty rad let's see if we get a
view<00:05:02.900> from<00:05:02.960> outside<00:05:03.229> here

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.800 

yeah<00:05:09.940> so<00:05:10.330> that's<00:05:10.479> basically<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.020> greenhouse

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
yeah so that's basically the greenhouse

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.589 
yeah so that's basically the greenhouse
and<00:05:14.550> temperature<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.699> here<00:05:15.879> right<00:05:16.090> now<00:05:16.120> I

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
and temperature in here right now I

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.390 
and temperature in here right now I
normally<00:05:16.930> leave<00:05:17.080> that<00:05:17.289> open<00:05:17.500> even<00:05:17.919> though<00:05:18.099> I

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
normally leave that open even though I

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.800 
normally leave that open even though I
shouldn't<00:05:18.819> but<00:05:18.879> don't<00:05:19.030> have<00:05:19.120> any<00:05:19.270> vents<00:05:19.690> in

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
shouldn't but don't have any vents in

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:30.540 
shouldn't but don't have any vents in
here<00:05:19.960> at<00:05:20.050> SU<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.259> temperatures<00:05:29.550> humidity

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
here at SU the temperatures humidity

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:38.100 
here at SU the temperatures humidity
says<00:05:31.150> 100%<00:05:31.509> but<00:05:32.020> that's<00:05:32.199> a<00:05:32.319> lie<00:05:35.580> anyways<00:05:37.110> yeah

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
says 100% but that's a lie anyways yeah

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.809 
says 100% but that's a lie anyways yeah
so<00:05:38.259> that's<00:05:38.379> a<00:05:38.500> system<00:05:38.710> you<00:05:39.400> guys<00:05:39.550> have<00:05:39.699> any

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
so that's a system you guys have any

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:45.120 
so that's a system you guys have any
questions<00:05:40.419> just<00:05:41.380> ask<00:05:42.840> away<00:05:43.840> and<00:05:44.110> I<00:05:44.770> will<00:05:44.830> do<00:05:45.099> my

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
questions just ask away and I will do my

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.670 
questions just ask away and I will do my
best<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.610> answer<00:05:45.819> the<00:05:46.810> systems<00:05:47.169> been<00:05:47.349> in<00:05:47.470> place

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
best to answer the systems been in place

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.510 
best to answer the systems been in place
for<00:05:47.710> about<00:05:49.319> nine<00:05:50.319> months<00:05:50.349> ten<00:05:51.069> months<00:05:51.099> almost

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
for about nine months ten months almost

for about nine months ten months almost
a<00:05:51.759> year<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.210> it's<00:05:53.370> doing<00:05:54.370> pretty<00:05:54.520> good<00:05:54.759> it's

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
a year and it's doing pretty good it's

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.330 
a year and it's doing pretty good it's
it's<00:05:55.750> a<00:05:57.060> great<00:05:58.060> hobby
