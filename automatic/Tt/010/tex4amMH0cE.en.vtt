wrong<00:01:51.219> way<00:01:51.429> to<00:01:51.549> do<00:01:51.759> it<00:01:51.909> as<00:01:52.029> long<00:01:52.060> as<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.389> tastes

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
wrong way to do it as long as it tastes

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.080 
wrong way to do it as long as it tastes
the<00:01:52.840> same<00:01:53.079> right<00:01:53.499> exactly<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.639> could<00:01:54.789> just<00:01:54.819> as

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
the same right exactly you could just as

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.480 
the same right exactly you could just as
easily<00:01:55.270> use<00:01:55.779> a<00:01:56.200> cutter<00:01:56.889> if<00:01:57.039> you<00:01:57.130> have<00:01:57.279> one<00:01:57.459> that

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
easily use a cutter if you have one that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.969 
easily use a cutter if you have one that
size<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.359> a<00:01:58.389> perfect<00:01:58.959> single<00:01:59.350> serving<00:01:59.740> or

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
size this is a perfect single serving or

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.609 
size this is a perfect single serving or
you<00:02:00.520> could<00:02:00.670> use<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.880> bread<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.270> butter<00:02:01.389> plate

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you could use a bread and butter plate

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.840 
you could use a bread and butter plate
that's<00:02:02.619> kind<00:02:02.829> of<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:02.979> base<00:02:03.219> of<00:02:03.249> the<00:02:03.609> tart

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
that's kind of the base of the tart

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.459 
that's kind of the base of the tart
exactly<00:02:04.539> so<00:02:04.959> we<00:02:05.049> put<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.319> on<00:02:05.439> a

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
exactly so we put it on a

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.040 
exactly so we put it on a
parchment-lined<00:02:05.950> baking<00:02:05.979> sheet<00:02:06.969> okay<00:02:07.840> and

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
parchment-lined baking sheet okay and

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.230 
parchment-lined baking sheet okay and
then<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:09.069> can<00:02:09.220> make<00:02:09.340> your<00:02:09.399> own<00:02:09.550> apple<00:02:10.090> butter

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
then you can make your own apple butter

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.500 
then you can make your own apple butter
or<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:11.160> but<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> nice<00:02:12.880> it's<00:02:13.209> not<00:02:13.330> too

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
or and but this is a nice it's not too

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.140 
or and but this is a nice it's not too
sweet<00:02:13.690> it's<00:02:14.349> very<00:02:14.440> cinnamony<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.220> couple<00:02:16.030> of

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
sweet it's very cinnamony a couple of

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.360 
sweet it's very cinnamony a couple of
tablespoons<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.870> each<00:02:17.050> chart<00:02:17.380> smooth<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.220> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
tablespoons on each chart smooth it to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.480 
tablespoons on each chart smooth it to
about<00:02:18.840> half<00:02:19.840> an<00:02:19.960> inch<00:02:20.110> or<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.440> from<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.770> edges

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
about half an inch or so from the edges

about half an inch or so from the edges
from<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.940> edge<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:23.250> pastry<00:02:24.450> excellent<00:02:25.450> now

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
from the edge of a pastry excellent now

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.480 
from the edge of a pastry excellent now
as<00:02:25.840> we<00:02:25.990> do<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.320> what<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.770> next<00:02:26.920> step<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
as we do this what is the next step the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.530 
as we do this what is the next step the
next<00:02:27.520> step<00:02:27.820> is<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:29.520> overlap<00:02:30.520> slices<00:02:31.270> of<00:02:31.420> at

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
next step is to overlap slices of at

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.200 
next step is to overlap slices of at
fresh<00:02:31.810> apple<00:02:32.200> i'm<00:02:32.350> using<00:02:32.560> Granny<00:02:32.950> Smiths<00:02:33.430> in<00:02:33.700> a

concentric circle let's move this down

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.820 
concentric circle let's move this down
here<00:02:36.640> now<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.510> have<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.960> very<00:02:38.170> interesting<00:02:38.740> way

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
here now you have a very interesting way

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.260 
here now you have a very interesting way
of<00:02:38.860> pairing<00:02:39.280> these<00:02:39.400> apples<00:02:39.850> why<00:02:39.970> don't<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.180> go

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
of pairing these apples why don't you go

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.370 
of pairing these apples why don't you go
ahead<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.420> demonstrate<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:41.080> really

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
ahead and demonstrate that really

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.020 
ahead and demonstrate that really
quickly<00:02:41.620> well<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.610> very<00:02:42.760> much<00:02:42.970> the

pastry is a lot of butter and flour if

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.210 
pastry is a lot of butter and flour if
it<00:03:49.660> gets<00:03:49.810> too<00:03:50.050> soft<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.650> it's<00:03:50.800> not<00:03:51.010> going<00:03:51.130> to

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
it gets too soft and it's not going to

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.240 
it gets too soft and it's not going to
get<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.460> same<00:03:51.490> rise<00:03:51.940> as<00:03:52.390> if<00:03:52.900> it's<00:03:53.380> cold<00:03:53.650> well

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
get the same rise as if it's cold well

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.160 
get the same rise as if it's cold well
oh<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:54.700> now<00:03:54.850> it's<00:03:54.880> done<00:03:55.270> you<00:03:55.720> would<00:03:55.840> put<00:03:55.990> it<00:03:56.080> in

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
oh so now it's done you would put it in

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.690 
oh so now it's done you would put it in
the<00:03:56.260> oven<00:03:56.290> or<00:03:56.680> would<00:03:56.830> you<00:03:56.980> have<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.490> brush<00:03:57.640> it
