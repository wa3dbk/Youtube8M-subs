00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.600
 hi friends is my first video tutorial 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.660
 what do I do for repair I want to know 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.629
 the method that I somehow I 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.509
 I invented is how to solder the 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.580
 gastric card to one to a laptop that 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.910
 it is a very typical fault when 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.000
 Suddenly stop giving image the laptop 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.470
 can allow everything but not image 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.890
 then this problem could be 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.279
 ram memories but very typically it's the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.560
 graphic card that are that of the of the 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.690
 motherboard 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.270
 the graphics card is 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.010
 located next to the processor is 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.380
 and likewise put under the 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.090
 dissipator itself because it is also a 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.970
 processor does not leave a processor that 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.440
 heated by them and sedesol to that is what 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.010
 what we have to do to solve it 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.010
 obviously it's heating it up and pressing it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.350
 but in the problem sometimes when one 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.670
 is technical is dedicated to the repair to 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.460
 times the battery does not with the tools 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.769
 like I do not have this heat gun 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 What I did was improvise a method 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.049
 new that it occurred to me to have a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.479
 150 4 reflector that I've been 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.610
 using and it works perfect does not come out 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.869
 to tame in the autopsy as well and for that reason 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.729
 I want to share it so that more people 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.510
 what other technicians can do 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.300
 let's have heat gun 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.980
 let them know that it is not vital that there are other 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.920
 good options what we are going to do is 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.730
 use the 150 watt reflector it 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.150
 What to show 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.570
 I do not know how advisable it is to use 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.690
 from another of another major power because 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.070
 It could even damage other components 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.160
 maybe lift tracks on the card 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.350
 things that already had drawbacks what 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.720
 what we do is put this on the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.210
 card on the mother card and wait 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.130
 first we connect it and we hope that it 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.920
 hot once it's hot what 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.530
 we take it as a wet cell and what 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.010
 we put and we put the base plate under 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 he clear down the graphics card 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.180
 but to prevent problems from 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.099
 overheating in other parts 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.370
 existing 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:15.319
 like plastic parts or things like that the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.240
 Video battery could explode there 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.940
 to be careful with this kind of thing 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.290
 once 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.080
 really to prevent those problems 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.180
 what what I have done is isolate a 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.099
 little the rest of the card with aluminum 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.770
 similarly works as a heatsink 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.110
 of heat what we do we see here the 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.989
 graphic card is an nvidia but this 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.030
 is the memory of the graphics card and 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.860
 as I say the graphics card is already 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.290
 on the other side this processor board 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.940
 this laptop I just repaired what 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.310
 we do is to paper everything that is 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.590
 around the card should be left 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.980
 papered preferably make a good 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.690
 papered in this way that only remains 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.260
 the pure visible card of the card 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.140
 graph 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.989
 once we have those in that way what 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.750
 do not put directly resolved 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.950
 on the card I can not think of that 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.099
 could cause damage 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.860
 I do not know if it hurts at home but what 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.590
 better to prevent in this case I put 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.550
 apart from that on paper 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.450
 I put some supports to the degrees 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:27.230
 where the reflector as the legs of 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.760
 aluminum well in ball because this 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.980
 support is not too high because if 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.500
 the reflector is quite removed 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.390
 the graphics card might not be 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.540
 enough heat then what we do 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.730
 is to support but low you should almost 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.680
 be at maximum maximum one centimeter of 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.950
 distance while trying to make it 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.170
 less be thin with that that is 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.010
 close that I do not touch it of preference 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.330
 the video of the graphics card with this 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.790
 good temperature 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.880
 now once to warm the card 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.880
 graph 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.170
 the stranger who is below the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.300
 terminals the tin that should be 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.030
 sticking the graphics card with the board 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.040
 base is strange should be put in a 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.130
 pasty state 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.690
 no solid liquid a little doughy that 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:24.050
 is based then we take advantage of that is 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.210
 that warming and with something that is not 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.430
 rigid with something that is a little bit like 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.500
 dampens with that dampen me in this 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.169
 case I put the tweezers could be a 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.699
 stick maybe with something like that 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.710
 the fact is that this I did with paper 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.680
 aluminum and somehow they are a 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.680
 shock absorber this makes uniform pressure 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.600
 on the graphics card instead of doing 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.430
 a pressure point that could that 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.740
 crash the or something like this 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.020
 exhibit keep in mind that is a 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.360
 glass is a type of glass then 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.840
 much care will only go worse 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.000
 then once you press the 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.520
 keep pressed during what will be 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.870
 five minutes first they put it to 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.510
 heat two minutes press five and 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.980
 let cool 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.980
 the lie and good I am simply 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.810
 the semi armengol arm well because to 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.080
 prove it had been and effectively 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.150
 since not what what is done for 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.220
 make my arm the only thing that we connect 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.070
 do not forget to put the 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.310
 fan is very important 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.900
 we connect the power and we put it 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.340
 the ram memory to prove it is not 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.160
 necessary to put the hard drive and put together 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.720
 all the time because if it were not effective 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.700
 the first time we can perform again 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.080
 the method but it was not planted let's 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.820
 return to the same job we are not going to 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.360
 check here 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.740
 learn perfect we give it on here 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.740
 they are liked on in this case 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.690
 and ready and now we are going to see the image 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.640
 but this 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.640
 who is sending me 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:15.220
 is to reach near the hard drive that 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.960
 it's not put well then friends 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.450
 I hope it's tutorials work and it gives me 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.170
 I'm very happy to help you, I hope that 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:26.460
 tell me to thank you for a like for 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:29.590
 Hence please I hope you like 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.400
 if we are beginners in electronics 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.229
 gabon are amateurs 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.250
 do it with all the cava of the world is not 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.250
 so easy 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.680
 maybe afterwards there's a story of how 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.010
 will be sending but good until the 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.010
 next
