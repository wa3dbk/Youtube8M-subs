00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.069
 how about friends welcome to this new 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.740
 video on this occasion I want to give you a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.030
 small tip on how to conserve 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.189
 colors of their figures 13 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.029
 is that sometimes the colors 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:24.000
 like they are losing by the sun or 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.849
 for something like this well here in this video 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.250
 I'm going to show a small tip of how 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.919
 keep them and make it something 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.809
 economically how are we going to do to 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.010
 keep the colors we are going to varnish 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.890
 the figures with resistol are usually 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.990
 people who varnish it with acrylic or 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.090
 varnish 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.210
 but it's a little more expensive and a little more 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.620
 complicated since the varnish is a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.920
 You have to use the thinner to 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.920
 clean the brush and with the resistol not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.340
 well the only thing he's going to do is going to take 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.070
 your bottle of resistol is going to put you 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.350
 resistol a 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.130
 in some parts or your entire figure of 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.130
 slowly 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.030
 and with a brush all the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.030
 resistol that they put 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.140
 here yes be careful to have clean 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.440
 hands since the resistol when 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.060
 they touch and they have dirty the hands would be 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.939
 stained 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.509
 I would put some small colored balls 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.509
 black 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.220
 once you have finished passing 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.560
 to the whole figure they will let it dry 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.830
 and in a few moments like in an hour a 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.400
 little more in the figure will start to 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.280
 take shine by the resistol here such 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.680
 once you ask if you have to lower 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.650
 the record with water does not have to 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.590
 reduce them simply put it on 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.620
 just as it comes is school resistol the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.930
 that they occupy for school are not some 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.300
 registration in particular there are some that 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.340
 well here an advice also that 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.020
 they have to keep the resistol in a 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.630
 place where the sun does not hit you because 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.670
 leave it uncovered because if it does not 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.010
 it starts to be ugly and then it does not work and 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.770
 will begin to leave some spots like 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.660
 that white in the colors so not 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.030
 I'm going to do that because once I 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.140
 that happened and I did not know why until I 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.030
 I realized that was why 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.010
 well no time I will show you how 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.750
 it is that it remains once it has finished 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.190
 to varnish and dry well here and dry 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.650
 well, you must have them 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.020
 they have to be shiny and apart the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.450
 figure will be hard 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.140
 is going to grab a little more resistance 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.750
 more strength will be a little harder 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.930
 the figure will let it dry well 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.730
 another advice do not go to let it dry in 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.330
 the sun because if not also then 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.340
 produces that you do not miss the form 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.489
 it must be and forth like that 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.989
 white color in the colors puts them 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.150
 some small white spots on the 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.450
 colors that happened to me once you can see it 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.599
 in the sun I will also show you here as 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.910
 it looks will look shiny it looks something 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.620
 shining the angry birds 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.580
 so you have to stay you are 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.580
 colored figures 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.700
 so with these two figures I 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.250
 varnishes and varnishing many with 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.860
 resistol is very economical and works 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.330
 perfectly for those who like it 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.770
 keep your figures well 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.170
 well I hope you liked this 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.620
 video do not forget to give thumb up 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.260
 commenting and sharing would help me a lot 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.960
 doing that since I would like more 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.240
 people knew this art and if you are 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.690
 new subscribe and in this the next
