00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.899
 servus people this is an additional video too 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.670
 the videos extreme and walls gave 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.530
 it is not exactly 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.969
 but jan has the exercise video 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.980
 not at all and therefore 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.750
 Let's explain that again in a video 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.670
 it's about how to get off 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.070
 line function outlines if you only 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.510
 the functional count has given oh yes 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.980
 if you do not have the mentioned video 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.300
 Have a look at it first 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.300
 the link is in the description 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.870
 the task was the first two off 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.740
 line functions of this function 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.640
 Draw and bill 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.270
 Let's just take a look at the important ones 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.739
 should know or participate in, we know at 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.570
 extremely important in a function 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.670
 corresponds to a position in the abt 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.590
 line function so we can 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.820
 These are just the times 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.670
 by a sign 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.199
 here is a low point that is why the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.510
 From line function here a zero 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.550
 place still have the same game here 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.310
 at the high point and here again 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.290
 roughly we see the low point already so 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.710
 go through woody off line function 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.850
 just has to look like in between 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.840
 left of the first low point is the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.869
 function down 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.399
 The slope is thus negative exactly 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.170
 slope is derivative and there the 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.240
 Gradient is negative the derivative 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.750
 function be here below the x-axis 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.790
 that's about the same as we see here as well 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.250
 is a turning point in the function 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.410
 yes we know a turning point in one 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.440
 function corresponds to an extreme position 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.149
 the abt line function here must therefore 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.799
 be a high point because the slope 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.750
 first gets bigger and then again 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.560
 smaller 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.290
 That's why it's going to be back then 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.790
 down to the next 0 point important 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.409
 between the first low point and the 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.720
 The highlight of the function is the slope 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.850
 positive because it is just going up 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.890
 Therefore, in this area, the starting 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.560
 also function permanently over the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.060
 x-axis after the throw point it goes 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.130
 namely down again because of that 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.350
 the line function now also goes off 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.330
 below the x-axis here is again 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.890
 Turnaround, therefore, must be down here 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.840
 somewhere a low point to 1 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.060
 We can then continue roughly 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.890
 sketch and now we have to go back 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.110
 get the zero point because I've got there 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.459
 it goes up again 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.200
 and we already have the first derivation 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.010
 drawn to the disco 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.110
 But you can not ask for more 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.549
 now the second derivative so 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.950
 just here again the derivative 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.570
 draw first we look again where 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.799
 the extreme are and draw 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.780
 then ever make the zero of the 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.829
 derivation 1 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.840
 We also see that here 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.220
 is the turning point and because here 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.410
 function goes up must the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.980
 derivative function over the x-axis 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.100
 his 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.350
 So it comes from the top then becomes the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.079
 Popo negative goes under the x-axis 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.700
 and then cross that low point 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.250
 the place of the turning point of the green 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.290
 Function must ultimately be easy 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.489
 back up to 0 place and ready 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.489
 we already have the second one 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.419
 Inferred drawn you see that it 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.280
 not so hard 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.169
 First, you just look where the extreme 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.000
 make the function are so draws 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.829
 there the zeros of the derivative 1 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.060
 then you have to look where the function 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.980
 up and down goes around 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.650
 determine if the derivative ba over 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.090
 or under the x-axis is high points 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.260
 and low points must then match 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.120
 be put on the walls 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.000
 be the rest with a bit 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.320
 fantasy hope the video has you 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.260
 liked and helped if the thumb 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.519
 furniture storm a nice day and still 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.519
 as always a lot of fun
