00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.729 
could so I mention to the lines again or
if<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.580> right-click<00:02:17.880> on<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.569> view<00:02:18.810> access<00:02:19.319> its

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
if we right-click on the view access its

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.190 
if we right-click on the view access its
properties<00:02:20.220> you'll<00:02:21.120> find<00:02:21.420> within<00:02:21.630> there<00:02:21.959> that

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
properties you'll find within there that

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.740 
properties you'll find within there that
you<00:02:22.739> can<00:02:22.890> align<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.310> brakes<00:02:23.580> with<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.420> parent

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
you can align the brakes with the parent

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.199 
you can align the brakes with the parent
like<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:29.600> within<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.840> same<00:02:31.080> view<00:02:32.209> it's

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
like so within the same view it's

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:43.570 
like so within the same view it's
possible<00:02:33.720> for<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.020> do<00:02:34.260> multiple<00:02:34.500> brakes

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.220 

and<00:02:44.580> they<00:02:44.790> can<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.180> horizontal<00:02:45.959> or<00:02:46.500> vertical

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.210 

this<00:02:52.230> brings<00:02:52.530> us<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.890> end<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.130> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
this brings us to the end of the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.019 
this brings us to the end of the
demonstration<00:02:53.450> thank<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.690> watching
