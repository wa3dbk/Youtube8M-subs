feet<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.359> that<00:03:30.509> is<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.750> little<00:03:31.139> 3<00:03:31.319> foot<00:03:31.500> cable<00:03:31.709> I

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.009 
feet so that is a little 3 foot cable I

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.339 
feet so that is a little 3 foot cable I
was<00:03:32.579> correct<00:03:32.939> on<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.090> one<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.599> guess<00:03:34.019> would<00:03:34.109> go

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
was correct on that one I guess would go

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.929 
was correct on that one I guess would go
to<00:03:34.439> the<00:03:34.560> battery<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.069> we'll<00:03:35.519> see<00:03:35.669> what<00:03:35.849> the

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
to the battery and we'll see what the

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.599 
to the battery and we'll see what the
battery<00:03:36.120> says<00:03:36.479> it's<00:03:36.720> charging<00:03:37.079> on<00:03:37.609> charging

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
battery says it's charging on charging

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.800 
would be fully charged and that won't
happen<00:06:04.440> with<00:06:04.680> the<00:06:04.800> normal<00:06:05.099> charger<00:06:05.460> so<00:06:05.810> there

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810
