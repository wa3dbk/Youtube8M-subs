00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 with less than 72 how good videos are 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.450
 to a new minecraft prison video 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.890
 gentlemen and in this case I come 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.260
 bringing new minecraft views 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.509
 which is the number 5 that we have since 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.910
 the last two weeks gentlemen now now 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.800
 we have a new but apparently good 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.840
 there was a fake hovering around these parts 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.840
 that they simply generated a number 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.510
 from 4 to 5 without having changed anything in 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.519
 about books and even just for 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.189
 generate money with links from as fly or 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.230
 several things because I really did not know 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.940
 of that with what matters is that life 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.320
 what I bring to you is like this is the real one and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 now I tell him the changes that include 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.770
 but first I must ask for an apology 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.160
 for the absence of my videos these 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.660
 five days and then that mind because 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.950
 nothing was not lazy but good 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.110
 it's also because there was not much that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.300
 record strip of textures then for what 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.340
 because it is already free at 0.9 point zero and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.559
 maps because in this case they are for 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.570
 knitting 8 and not for 9 and also 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.329
 if they know that he was not there so that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.160
 subscribe to mx in the contest but 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.870
 now I will try to be a little more 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.660
 active in the channel and now without further 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.339
 delay here is the new stadium no 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.340
 I have an idea if this was true but good 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.409
 you were not supposed to be able to play 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.119
 and for which I tell you because 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.860
 I never tried it and the place I do not have 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.210
 with me I'm lonely but good 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 suppose that avoids is already fixed to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.800
 this bug and also gentlemen when you put 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.960
 a little tnt at the time of exploding 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.940
 that you detonate the game can 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.070
 appreciate but this was not the only one with 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.170
 the tnt but also is that if you do not 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.270
 grows abba does not detona bullet have you that 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.890
 was next to the main one in case 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.720
 that it was clear and other damage that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.610
 caused was that he did not believe in the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.740
 readings of the new terrain after 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.390
 exclusion is already matter how many 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.369
 ships by the situation and the textures 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.560
 they did not charge but good is all this 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.420
 already be arranged gentlemen and a very book 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.789
 characteristic that we have it since 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 4 builds is that when we immerse ourselves in 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.500
 the water or when we went down to some 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.570
 cave the sign darkened or like 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.940
 it managed to have a more grayish hue 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.429
 but good at last guys this view has already 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.509
 been resolved euros guys clear that 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.399
 other ships that are not so 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.750
 characteristic and also new things 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.119
 that in the degree that they are not so 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.590
 important but good is quickly given 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.750
 the search for ebooks in this new 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.700
 build number 5 how are these 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.350
 we find in this as they are the ones that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.090
 I will say next 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.190
 look for what we found 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.810
 is that the first is that this unit 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.760
 many ways when starting a new world 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.950
 the second is that the burden of the new 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.930
 world generates some transparent blocks 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.700
 or invisible and the third is that at 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.320
 loading a new world takes a bit 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.660
 in to start playing these are about 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.280
 how many three books are three books that 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.500
 have found until now 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.850
