not<00:03:21.340> completely<00:03:21.760> unhappy<00:03:22.390> either<00:03:22.840> but<00:03:23.830> I'm

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
not completely unhappy either but I'm

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.410 
not completely unhappy either but I'm
not<00:03:24.160> really<00:03:24.430> all<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.730> thrilled<00:03:25.360> with<00:03:25.600> it

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
not really all that thrilled with it

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.910 
not really all that thrilled with it
doesn't<00:03:28.420> seem<00:03:28.840> like<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.230> miracle<00:03:29.500> machine

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
doesn't seem like the miracle machine

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.300 
doesn't seem like the miracle machine
that<00:03:30.430> they<00:03:30.610> say<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.769> mean<00:03:32.769> if<00:03:32.860> somebody's

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
that they say it is I mean if somebody's

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.080 
that they say it is I mean if somebody's
never<00:03:33.580> had<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.910> food<00:03:34.330> processor<00:03:35.080> before<00:03:36.090> which

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
never had a food processor before which

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.979 
never had a food processor before which
I<00:03:37.209> think<00:03:37.450> works<00:03:37.600> better<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.350> regular<00:03:38.920> one<00:03:39.989> they

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
I think works better a regular one they

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.490 
I think works better a regular one they
would<00:03:41.170> be<00:03:41.290> thrilled<00:03:41.650> with<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.010> I'm<00:03:42.220> sure

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.940 

to<00:03:46.500> me<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.709> regular<00:03:46.980> food<00:03:47.400> processor<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.269> better

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
to me a regular food processor is better

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.940 
to me a regular food processor is better
