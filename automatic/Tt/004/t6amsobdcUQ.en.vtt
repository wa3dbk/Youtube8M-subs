screwdriver I found no need to mess with
it<00:02:19.680> at<00:02:19.769> all<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.549> it's<00:02:20.700> easily<00:02:20.849> done<00:02:21.120> if<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.599> if

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
it at all but it's easily done if you if

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.490 
it at all but it's easily done if you if

you need to the spring tension I'd it's

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500 
you need to the spring tension I'd it's
really<00:02:25.709> good<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.010> holds<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.370> nicely<00:02:27.090> into<00:02:27.420> the

click when it locks up and no
discernible<00:02:33.900> movement<00:02:34.400> well<00:02:35.400> I've<00:02:35.519> been<00:02:35.610> very

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
discernible movement well I've been very

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.940 
discernible movement well I've been very
unusual<00:02:36.599> about<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.900> knife<00:02:37.110> initially<00:02:37.739> was

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
unusual about this knife initially was

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.440 
unusual about this knife initially was
the<00:02:37.980> thickness<00:02:38.519> of<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.730> blade<00:02:38.819> compared<00:02:39.390> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
the thickness of the blade compared to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.610 
the thickness of the blade compared to
the<00:02:39.540> thickness<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.870> handle<00:02:40.260> you'll<00:02:40.410> see

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
the thickness the handle you'll see

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.740 
the thickness the handle you'll see
there<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:41.190> quite<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.430> slim<00:02:41.849> sort<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.569> weight

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
there it's quite a slim sort of a weight

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.479 
there it's quite a slim sort of a weight
and<00:02:42.989> if<00:02:43.049> we<00:02:43.170> compare<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.560> just<00:02:43.980> quickly<00:02:44.220> to

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
and if we compare it just quickly to

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.789 
and if we compare it just quickly to
another<00:02:44.730> knife<00:02:45.000> I'd<00:02:45.269> bring<00:02:45.569> up<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.900> Spyderco

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
another knife I'd bring up a Spyderco

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.100 
another knife I'd bring up a Spyderco
delica<00:02:47.160> 4<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:48.329> can<00:02:48.420> see<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.660> difference<00:02:48.989> in

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
delica 4 you can see the difference in

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.979 
delica 4 you can see the difference in
the<00:02:49.200> blade<00:02:49.379> thicknesses<00:02:49.860> but<00:02:50.040> also<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
the blade thicknesses but also in the

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.869 
the blade thicknesses but also in the
thickness<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.099> lock<00:02:53.250> mechanism<00:02:53.459> now<00:02:53.849> I

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
thickness on the lock mechanism now I

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.670 
thickness on the lock mechanism now I
did<00:02:54.120> notice<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.930> felt<00:02:55.170> very<00:02:55.230> odd<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.650> first

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
did notice it felt very odd at first

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.800 
did notice it felt very odd at first
when<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.160> was<00:02:56.250> using<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:57.060> lock<00:02:57.329> mechanism

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
when I was using that lock mechanism

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.530 
when I was using that lock mechanism
because<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:58.349> felt<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:59.099> very<00:02:59.819> slim<00:03:00.299> piece

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
because it just felt a very slim piece

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.780 
because it just felt a very slim piece
of<00:03:00.720> steel<00:03:00.930> but<00:03:01.410> used<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.950> quite<00:03:02.190> quickly<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
of steel but used that quite quickly the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.479 
of steel but used that quite quickly the
handle<00:03:03.780> itself<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.319> very<00:03:04.769> well<00:03:05.040> shaped<00:03:05.280> now

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
handle itself is very well shaped now

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.490 
handle itself is very well shaped now
i've<00:03:05.579> got<00:03:05.760> large<00:03:06.239> sized<00:03:06.569> hands<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.200> find

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
i've got large sized hands and I find

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.199 
i've got large sized hands and I find
this<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.650> an<00:03:07.890> extremely<00:03:08.430> comfortable<00:03:08.790> knife

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
this is an extremely comfortable knife

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.869 
this is an extremely comfortable knife
to<00:03:09.390> use<00:03:09.590> it's<00:03:10.590> an<00:03:10.709> excellent<00:03:11.099> slicing<00:03:11.670> tool

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
to use it's an excellent slicing tool

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.270 
to use it's an excellent slicing tool
again<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.629> Finn<00:03:12.810> steel<00:03:13.170> helps<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.099> came

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
again the Finn steel helps that it came

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.550 
again the Finn steel helps that it came
of<00:03:14.459> course<00:03:14.700> very<00:03:14.970> sharp<00:03:15.269> as<00:03:15.420> you'd<00:03:15.599> expect<00:03:15.930> and

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
of course very sharp as you'd expect and

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.860 
of course very sharp as you'd expect and
it's<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.250> particularly<00:03:17.579> good<00:03:17.880> knife<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.660> food

didn't want to belt carries a knife you

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.140 
didn't want to belt carries a knife you
can<00:04:47.840> certainly<00:04:48.169> do<00:04:48.349> that<00:04:48.379> a<00:04:49.060> little<00:04:50.060> bit

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
can certainly do that a little bit

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.760 
can certainly do that a little bit
difficult<00:04:50.629> to<00:04:50.870> get<00:04:51.050> yet<00:04:51.199> there's<00:04:51.409> not<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.590> lot

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
difficult to get yet there's not a lot

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.860 
difficult to get yet there's not a lot
of<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.919> chain<00:04:52.190> but<00:04:52.580> then<00:04:52.759> this<00:04:52.909> patch<00:04:53.569> hasn't

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
of a chain but then this patch hasn't

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
like a almost like a fixed blade chief

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.959 
like a almost like a fixed blade chief
you've<00:05:12.440> got<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.620> a<00:05:12.710> belt<00:05:13.129> loop<00:05:13.310> and<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.819> knife

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
there's no actual cover over it so you I

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:19.510 
there's no actual cover over it so you I
don't<00:05:18.710> know<00:05:18.800> whether<00:05:18.949> this<00:05:19.099> chief<00:05:19.340> is

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
don't know whether this chief is
