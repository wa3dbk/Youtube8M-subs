00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.380 
involves a lot more highlighting than
contouring<00:01:14.590> really<00:01:14.860> but<00:01:15.250> you've<00:01:16.000> got<00:01:16.149> all<00:01:16.179> the

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
so imma start with a very light contour

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.370 
so imma start with a very light contour
as<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:20.979> mentioned<00:01:21.610> Felice<00:01:22.119> has<00:01:22.539> a<00:01:22.569> slender<00:01:23.020> face

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
so we don't really need to carve too

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.999 
so we don't really need to carve too
much<00:01:25.270> out<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.479> her<00:01:25.659> cheekbone<00:01:25.869> I'm<00:01:26.709> gonna<00:01:26.860> go
