00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.230
 of the dotcom review meeting today 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.240
 we analyze the vision jacket of the house 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
 art knicks a jacket designed to 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.619
 when things get ugly inside 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.170
 the endorphin collection according to a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.930
 collection they have thought for maximum 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.180
 activity for myself maximum weight 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.090
 perspiration and that's why it incorporates 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.369
 goretex active according to the membrane 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.720
 new goretex jacket designed for 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.340
 all high activity sports 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 physical as can be the trail running 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 a membrane designed to perspire 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.750
 in agreement leads from the layers that the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.299
 unite carries something less than tail according 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.159
 and this makes it transpire even more good 

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.989
 as you see a jacket that remains 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.850
 pretty in carved pretty tight 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.949
 designed to protect us to give us 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.000
 also a little bit of heat especially 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.440
 protect us from the cold of the wind valeri 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 which is much longer in the area 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.159
 back normally sometimes when 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.989
 we run a little stooping good 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.220
 because this will protect us the part 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.809
 lower especially after also 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.240
 when we wear pants 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.650
 waterproof or something else 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
 waterproof on the legs because it's going to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.060
 end up lowering the water according to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.820
 behind and without us leaving 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.130
 getting inside the pants ahead 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.579
 how do you see zippers heat-sealed from 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.229
 I agree all of it as if it's waterproof 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.810
 the jacket as the zipper has to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.399
 be also waterproof if it would not be a 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.130
 water entry point according to 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.250
 a car is worth not easy subject 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.320
 to use and with a cord to help us 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.259
 to maneuver in case we are with 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.920
 gloves I remember as you see the neck 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.240
 I take advantage of you I teach you vale is not very high 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.770
 and it is quite open also for 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.090
 favor perspiration 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.950
 transform if it rains this neck 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.299
 open then we are going to assume 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.640
 that between something more water inwards 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.280
 it's worth here to also post something 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.479
 more lacking here in the back 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.049
 in agreement sleeves fix sleeves very 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.200
 complete are intended not to stop 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.130
 produce chafing so as not to go 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.500
 hooked when we run we are 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.429
 lower agree that we stay that we 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.010
 produce tension and 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.840
 fully adjustable if not long 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.459
 cold we will bring this more open to 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.549
 favor the perspiration membranes 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.859
 all transpire but logically if 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.230
 we help by leaving certain parts open 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.969
 Well, it's going to favor much better if 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.280
 It is very cold or it rains because we can 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:30.459
 close with velcro without any problem 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.090
 another detail of the sleeve is the stitching 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.849
 fix here to the if you take the camera 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.819
 agreement goes it does not go straight up 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.769
 but it makes this position thought for 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.069
 favor much you see when we stay like this 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.780
 ok upload all this part of here 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.700
 favors the position much more and not 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.290
 We have the sewing in a place where it is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.329
 more likely to end up entering the water 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.760
 we have a layer in front of agreement and not 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.219
 the stitching in this part of here 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.709
 reflective just like on this side it's worth 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.830
 on both reflective sides just like 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.560
 the goretex logo 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.440
 the logo of the house art tics and here in 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.790
 the back also reflective 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.740
 agree that more leads on this side 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.990
 You can hardly see yourself here as a father 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.580
 It is easy to see that it is easy for us to have the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.160
 jacket and after two weeks what 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.950
 we discover pocket of agreement very well 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.920
 the pocket so that it does not also enter 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.620
 with a cord 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.900
 zipper to maneuver 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.819
 agreement the very wide pocket in the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.890
 very large part I will teach to set 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.830
 this this here is very big fit 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.420
 Mobile fit gel is everything we want 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.489
 we fit in here is a pocket 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.920
 quite large positioned on this side 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.680
 agree to favor when 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.140
 we run that we do not jump if 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.239
 we arrive if we take some garment if 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.160
 We carry weight things like you can do 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.360
 a phone and here to the back 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.140
 in agreement 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.790
 fix a carabiner here only on a 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.849
 side intended to close 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.980
 and adjust the whole jacket and not 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.370
 between the water not between the wind nor the 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.310
 cold and get very tight in agreement and the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.479
 water not the water does not enter either 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.519
 agreement if we were to wear trousers 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.650
 waterproof would help us stay 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.090
 tight and the water ran towards 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.800
 down 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.449
 I'm going to show you the pocket inside 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.690
 if we carry electronic devices not 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:33.540
 we are going to have to worry about this 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.280
 it's the pocket to look at, you can barely see everything 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.990
 we have sealed with it also with 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.340
 gore in agreement is to say that we are going to 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.740
 be able to carry the device without 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.810
 us woman neither on the outside nor on our 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.340
 your own sweat will end up soaking you 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.080
 I teach how is the full ability of 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.520
 the jacket I am contest inside that 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.160
 all the seams are finished 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.050
 sealed in flat vale is a jacket 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.850
 completely waterproof I can already 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.590
 see that we are not going to wet the eggs 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.090
 for hours we will be able to run with 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.310
 this 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.860
 I'll show you many chances 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.900
 ultras careers are necessary 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.790
 bring this good material well here 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.500
 we have a jacket that looks great 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.419
 folded if we entertain ourselves yet 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.699
 we will manage to achieve we will have a 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.419
 smaller package according to very good 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.979
 Paste skill above all and having 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.400
 sleeves we can also wear it like this 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.979
 we want to fuck the waist according 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.900
 this is the proposal of the house art 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.350
 tics according to the vision a jacket 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.060
 designed for very cold days or on 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.250
 everything with rain think that there is a 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.490
 membrane of the goretex house the most 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.740
 transpires according to the active and 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.300
 thought for those days where things 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.650
 they get ugly and where normally nobody 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.510
 wants to go running with this 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.610
 jacket will make us want to leave 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.870
 to run and here a more analysis of 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.530
 brings us running dotcom review 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.530
 we see in the next
