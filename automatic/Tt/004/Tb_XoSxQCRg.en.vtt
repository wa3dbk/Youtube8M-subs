00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 this morning, however, at the meeting called 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.109
 from the mayor of paola in the room 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.050
 the councilor is the subject of the discussion 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.300
 carristi focused on another theme 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.360
 have noted a situation of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.550
 fact that materially puts out 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.219
 play the allegorical carriages giuseppe 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.800
 group of cobwebs 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.469
 then the wagons you ascertain are not 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.879
 more in a position to be moved or 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.489
 it is like taking part in a fashion show 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.550
 unfortunately it is unfortunately the case 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.870
 we have suffered damages only 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.059
 exclusively on paper mache 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.449
 structurally we are ok however unfortunately 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.870
 the wind and rain of this night has 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.930
 compromised the artistic side of the wagon 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.229
 and therefore it is no longer possible to take off for 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.030
 you basically the 2015 carnival for the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.710
 wagon yes for the group it would seem that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.780
 we are also waiting for a little something 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.850
 because the right is still upwind 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.229

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.040
 day we hope we can drink it 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.570
 choice to no longer remove the wagons e 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.799

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.520

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.770

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.990
 of victory the iron structure 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.869
 seems to hold but the coating of 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.360
 papier-mache and other light materials 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.549
 is flaking under the weight of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.159
 rain of these days just for 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.060
