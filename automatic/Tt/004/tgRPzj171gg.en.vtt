okay<00:00:01.050> so<00:00:01.500> here's<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.370> quick<00:00:02.580> overview<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.389> the

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 
okay so here's a quick overview of the

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.650 
okay so here's a quick overview of the
nitrogen<00:00:04.560> cycle<00:00:04.589> within<00:00:05.160> an<00:00:05.400> aquarium<00:00:05.970> it's

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
nitrogen cycle within an aquarium it's

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.620 
nitrogen cycle within an aquarium it's
important<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.379> know<00:00:07.560> at<00:00:08.519> least<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.940> basics<00:00:09.420> of

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
important to know at least the basics of

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.230 
important to know at least the basics of
this<00:00:10.160> in<00:00:11.160> order<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.580> understand<00:00:12.030> how<00:00:12.179> to

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
this in order to understand how to

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.690 
this in order to understand how to
properly<00:00:12.660> cycle<00:00:13.200> your<00:00:13.349> tank<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.889> further

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
properly cycle your tank and further

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.760 
properly cycle your tank and further
help<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.179> cycling<00:00:15.599> gear<00:00:15.719> tank<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.230> have<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
help on cycling gear tank I do have the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.500 
help on cycling gear tank I do have the
video<00:00:17.070> which<00:00:17.369> features<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.970> which<00:00:18.090> I'll<00:00:18.270> put<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
video which features it which I'll put a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.840 
video which features it which I'll put a
link<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.960> towards<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.500> end<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:20.670> let's<00:00:21.150> begin

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
link in towards the end so let's begin

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
link in towards the end so let's begin
okay<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:23.910> here's<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.990> basic<00:00:25.260> setup<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.070> an

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
okay so here's a basic setup of an

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.849 
okay so here's a basic setup of an
aquarium<00:00:26.730> you've<00:00:27.060> got<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.810> tank<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
aquarium you've got the tank the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.030 
aquarium you've got the tank the
substrate<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.449> plants<00:00:30.990> if<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.740> any

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
substrate the plants if you have any

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.630 
substrate the plants if you have any
plants<00:00:32.700> aren't<00:00:32.880> essential<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.989> they<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.290> help

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
plants aren't essential but they do help

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.690 
plants aren't essential but they do help
the<00:00:35.640> fish<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.989> filter<00:00:37.440> filters<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the fish and the filter filters on the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
the fish and the filter filters on the
left<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.210> blue<00:00:39.660> box<00:00:40.340> okay<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:42.440> might<00:00:43.440> be

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
left the blue box okay so might be

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.100 
left the blue box okay so might be
asking<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.010> all<00:00:44.160> these<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.579> rose<00:00:44.760> mean<00:00:45.110> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
asking what all these are rose mean the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
asking what all these are rose mean the
red<00:00:46.289> ones<00:00:46.559> show<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.239> movement<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.989> ammonia<00:00:49.860> so

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
red ones show the movement of ammonia so

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.610 
red ones show the movement of ammonia so
as<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.230> fish<00:00:52.850> produces<00:00:53.850> waste

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
as you can see the fish produces waste

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.549 
as you can see the fish produces waste
which<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> direct<00:00:56.309> source<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.730> ammonia<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
which is a direct source of ammonia and

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.500 
which is a direct source of ammonia and
this<00:00:58.559> falls<00:00:59.070> down<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> into<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
this falls down to the into the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
this falls down to the into the
substrate<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.350> fluttering<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> tank<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
substrate or fluttering the tank to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.590 
substrate or fluttering the tank to
bring<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.780> sort<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.170> waste<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.650> obviously

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
bring on what sort of waste is obviously

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
bring on what sort of waste is obviously
so<00:01:06.770> we've<00:01:07.770> got<00:01:07.950> waste<00:01:08.130> sitting<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> bottom

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
so we've got waste sitting on the bottom

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
so we've got waste sitting on the bottom
of<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> tank<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> water<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:12.590> as<00:01:13.590> soon

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
of the tank and in the water so as soon

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.969 
of the tank and in the water so as soon
as<00:01:14.159> things<00:01:14.790> start<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:17.509> decompose<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.170> wrought

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
as things start to decompose and wrought

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.719 
as things start to decompose and wrought
such<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.540> fish<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.930> waste<00:01:22.200> or<00:01:22.590> food<00:01:23.340> or

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
such as the fish is waste or food or

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.410 
such as the fish is waste or food or
anything<00:01:24.619> any<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:26.009> vegetable<00:01:26.580> matter<00:01:26.759> that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
anything any like vegetable matter that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.749 
anything any like vegetable matter that
is<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> substrate<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.900> will<00:01:31.110> start<00:01:31.409> to

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
is in the substrate this will start to

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.319 
is in the substrate this will start to
produce<00:01:32.759> ammonia<00:01:33.390> also<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:35.700> two<00:01:36.119> ways

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
produce ammonia also so that's two ways

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.510 
produce ammonia also so that's two ways
that<00:01:36.780> ammonia<00:01:37.079> gets<00:01:37.439> into<00:01:37.770> your<00:01:37.860> water<00:01:38.270> now

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
that ammonia gets into your water now

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.740 
that ammonia gets into your water now
too<00:01:41.930> because<00:01:42.930> ammonia<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.860> most<00:01:44.899> toxic

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
too because ammonia is the most toxic

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.609 
too because ammonia is the most toxic
substance<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> your<00:01:49.049> fish<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:50.670> must

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
substance to your fish you must

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.660 
substance to your fish you must
establish<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:53.430> bacterial<00:01:54.060> colony<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:55.290> can

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
establish a bacterial colony that can

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.990 
establish a bacterial colony that can
process<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:57.570> ammonia<00:01:57.990> into<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:59.310> less<00:01:59.579> harmful

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
process this ammonia into a less harmful

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.980 
process this ammonia into a less harmful
substance<00:02:00.960> known<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:01.549> nitrate<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.600> art<00:02:06.810> if

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
substance known as nitrate so the art if

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
substance known as nitrate so the art if
we<00:02:07.229> move<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> orange<00:02:08.009> arrows<00:02:08.340> these

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
we move on to the orange arrows these

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.460 
we move on to the orange arrows these
show<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.929> movement<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.739> nitrites<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.989> when

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
show the movement of nitrites so when

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.140 
show the movement of nitrites so when
you've<00:02:13.620> established<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.490> colony<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.910> bacteria

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
you've established a colony of bacteria

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.850 
you've established a colony of bacteria
which<00:02:16.020> are<00:02:16.730> alive<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.660> filter<00:02:19.140> itself<00:02:19.200> and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
which are alive in the filter itself and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.140 
which are alive in the filter itself and
also<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.300> substrate<00:02:21.870> normally<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
also in the substrate normally but the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.760 
also in the substrate normally but the
main<00:02:24.630> place<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.050> want<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.230> get<00:02:25.440> them<00:02:25.530> using

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
main place you want to get them using

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.310 
main place you want to get them using
your<00:02:25.920> filter<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:27.570> as<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.720> can<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.080> orange

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
your filter so as you can see the orange

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.990 
your filter so as you can see the orange
arrows<00:02:28.680> you've<00:02:29.040> got<00:02:29.190> one<00:02:29.370> coming<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.790> the

arrows you've got one coming out of the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.260 
arrows you've got one coming out of the

as<00:02:55.709> there's<00:02:56.370> two<00:02:56.550> types<00:02:56.850> are<00:02:57.270> at<00:02:57.510> least<00:02:57.750> two

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050

we've<00:03:05.490> processed<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.360> ammonia<00:03:06.810> into

we've processed the ammonia into

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.320 
we've processed the ammonia into
nitrites<00:03:07.500> which<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> slightly<00:03:08.520> less<00:03:08.880> toxic

if issues going to be under a lot of

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.310 
if issues going to be under a lot of
stress<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:23.400> could<00:05:23.580> potentially<00:05:23.669> die<00:05:24.320> so

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
stress and it could potentially die so

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.740 
stress and it could potentially die so
it<00:05:25.740> is<00:05:25.889> very<00:05:26.070> important<00:05:26.699> to<00:05:26.910> make<00:05:27.270> sure<00:05:27.300> you

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
it is very important to make sure you

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.219 
it is very important to make sure you
have<00:05:27.930> built<00:05:28.260> up<00:05:28.410> this<00:05:28.560> colony<00:05:29.070> of<00:05:29.729> bacteria

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
have built up this colony of bacteria

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:36.020 
have built up this colony of bacteria
that<00:05:31.229> can<00:05:31.470> process<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:33.630> two<00:05:34.110> substances<00:05:35.030> so

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
that can process the two substances so

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.150 
that can process the two substances so
that's<00:05:36.510> just<00:05:36.599> a<00:05:36.810> quick<00:05:36.840> overview<00:05:37.139> of<00:05:37.740> how<00:05:38.099> the

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
that's just a quick overview of how the

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.460 
that's just a quick overview of how the
nitrogen<00:05:38.760> cycle<00:05:38.789> works<00:05:39.419> like<00:05:40.110> I<00:05:40.139> said<00:05:40.289> if<00:05:40.410> you

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
nitrogen cycle works like I said if you

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.290 
nitrogen cycle works like I said if you
want<00:05:40.650> more<00:05:43.010> more<00:05:44.010> of<00:05:44.130> a<00:05:44.250> guide<00:05:44.460> on<00:05:44.880> to<00:05:45.030> how<00:05:45.240> to

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
want more more of a guide on to how to

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.360 
want more more of a guide on to how to
begin<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:46.020> cycle<00:05:46.200> process<00:05:46.620> in<00:05:47.039> your<00:05:47.160> tank

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
begin the cycle process in your tank

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.440 
begin the cycle process in your tank
check<00:05:48.330> out<00:05:48.479> one<00:05:48.630> of<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.810> video<00:05:50.090> yeah<00:05:51.090> any
