time<00:00:57.010> we<00:00:57.159> down<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:59.489> also<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.690> try<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.839> use<00:01:02.289> the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
time we down and also to try and use the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.639 
time we down and also to try and use the
formality<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.909> dance<00:01:03.940> at<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.899> time<00:01:05.229> to

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
formality of the dance at the time to

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.910 
formality of the dance at the time to
charge<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:07.330> space<00:01:07.720> between<00:01:08.259> them<00:01:08.590> with<00:01:08.770> an

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
charge the space between them with an

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.359 
charge the space between them with an
intensity<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.380> foxtrot<00:01:11.770> i<00:01:11.950> think

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
intensity and the foxtrot i think

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.020 
intensity and the foxtrot i think
particularly<00:01:12.729> lends<00:01:13.210> itself<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.850> this

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
particularly lends itself to to this

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.260 
particularly lends itself to to this
kind<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.479> thing<00:01:16.690> it's<00:01:16.869> its<00:01:17.200> own<00:01:17.619> is<00:01:18.009> a<00:01:18.580> sexier

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
kind of thing it's its own is a sexier

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:29.899 
kind of thing it's its own is a sexier
dance<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:19.899> we<00:01:20.020> know<00:01:20.229> i<00:01:20.259> think

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.039 

we're<00:01:30.479> too<00:01:30.960> fast<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:32.180> I'm<00:01:33.180> probably<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.930> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
we're too fast and I'm probably kind of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.920 
we're too fast and I'm probably kind of
like<00:01:34.200> gaming

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.350 

just<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.260> to<00:01:40.410> do<00:01:40.560> some<00:01:40.800> complain<00:01:41.370> to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
just for this to do some complain to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.870 
just for this to do some complain to
sort<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:42.980> well<00:01:43.980> then<00:01:44.190> don't<00:01:44.640> do

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
sort of think about well then don't do

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
sort of think about well then don't do
guess<00:01:45.330> you<00:01:45.480> shouldn't<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:46.080> think<00:01:46.500> about

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
guess you shouldn't have to think about

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.040 
guess you shouldn't have to think about
anything<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.190> that<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.510> know<00:01:48.660> you

shouldn't have children

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.180 
shouldn't have children
