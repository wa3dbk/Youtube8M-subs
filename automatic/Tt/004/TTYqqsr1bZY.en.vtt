00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.750
 and what's up, I'm Chinese javier 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.170
 I'll come with a review of a 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.749
 application that has very good utility 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.969
 which consists of deleting files 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:17.390
 duplicates that you have on your hard drive 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:20.000
 this application is called gaming 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.509
 as we see the interface of this 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.960
 application is very simple since only 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:30.020
 contains a button where you can 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.609
 use to add folders where 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.000
 you want them scanned to search 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:38.690
 duplicate files and has a one zone 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.750
 drag for folders 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.300
 also that you need to scan 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.640
 well let's start seeing how it 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 add a folder from the go button 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.110
 to click on the button 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.650
 and we are going to select 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.100
 any folder that we want that scans 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.649
 we must overtake 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.280
 we will appear in the folder icon 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.510
 and your name 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.640
 and a new button that you are going to go scan 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.840
 we are going to click on this button so that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.840
 start looking for duplicate files 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.830
 It depends on the files and the size of 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.130
 the same as this folder is 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.550
 what will it take to scan the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.550
 application 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.950
 when I finish scanning the shore of 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.740
 this circle is going to take color 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.619
 green 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.720
 if it contains duplicate files and it's going 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.680
 to show 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.020
 how much weight of duplicate files has 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.270
 this interprets to see the archives 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.550
 duplicates we're going to come to this this 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.550
 new button means show results 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.100
 and it will show us 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.370
 what files are here we have this 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.370
 archive 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.940
 and here are going to appear some other 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.259
 folders that are 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.879
 within this same from where it was 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.000
 searched where files were found 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.000
 duplicates 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.430
 good if we want to delete that file 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 duplicate let's give right click 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.700
 and we're going to get three auto options 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.870
 select duplicate files 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.909
 from selecting all files 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.819
 duplicates and remove the files 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.099
 duplicates of this list this does not 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.750
 refers to eliminating silos but that 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.280
 this file we do not want it to be 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.310
 removed and as it is not found in 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.219
 that list when we want to delete a 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.260
 file that is selected or not 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.930
 is selected let's give here in 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.000
 auto select duplicates and we will 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.109
 see that two numbers appear here 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.109
 It means this file 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.160
 when I was at number 1 wants 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.290
 say that this file is going to delete 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.770
 just one of the two files 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.470
 selected and that what we want 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.750
 and this button will light up red 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.569
 what did we do? 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.989
 and we are going to click if you want 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.989
 selection from removing that file 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.680
 we're also going to have this button on this 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.590
 side that will be for auto select 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.680
 one only one of the two files 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.349
 duplicates well if you have multiple files 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.150
 duplicates you will be able to eliminate more 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.739
 fast and easy 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.739
 well let's click on this button 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.680
 the file is deleted 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.470
 well now we go since we eliminate the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.470
 file we can not go back 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.550
 and we can select in news can for 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.680
 do in another different folder now 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.910
 let's see how the rock dragon works 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.710
 we open the finder 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.350
 and like all programs we're just going to 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.350
 drag the folder you want it 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.150
 let's scan and let go 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.790
 example of imaging equipment and we're going to 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.680
 scan 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.790
 they will be the same steps 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.940
 as you can see this has less less weight 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.880
 and it scans faster and now the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.220
 the contour of the circle is 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.050
 he turned orange he wants 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.570
 say that this folder does not contain 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.800
 no duplicate file and we can 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.220
 continue with what we want 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.220
 examine 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.790
 the truth of this application is made to me 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:54.830
 very usable is very good and I give it 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.890
 a score of 8 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.790
 since this application is very simple 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.940
 but very useful 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.630
 I recommend it 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.930
 this has a value in the 96 appstore 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.930
 pesos 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.500
 and the truth that yes is very good to me 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:19.169
 liked it, I think I'll leave it for myself 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.719
 and that's it for this video 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.620
 If you have any questions, you can comment 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:27.449
 down I'll leave the link where 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.539
 you can get the application in the 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.220
 description and see you hopefully they have 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.950
 liked this video 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.470
 I like to subscribe 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.590
 put favorites to share it with your 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.490
