lonely<00:02:32.079> tool<00:02:32.319> changer<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:34.500> running<00:02:35.500> on<00:02:35.739> all

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
lonely tool changer it's running on all

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.800 
lonely tool changer it's running on all
the<00:02:37.629> tracks<00:02:38.730> well<00:02:39.730> it's<00:02:39.909> just<00:02:39.939> seen<00:02:40.359> running

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
the tracks well it's just seen running

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.500 
the tracks well it's just seen running
for<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.170> little<00:02:41.379> bit<00:02:42.180> while<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.209> still<00:02:43.390> like

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
for a little bit while I still like

for a little bit while I still like
juice<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.019> camera<00:02:50.040> it's<00:02:51.040> gonna<00:02:51.189> stop<00:02:51.459> down

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
juice on the camera it's gonna stop down

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.910 
juice on the camera it's gonna stop down
there<00:02:52.450> because<00:02:53.010> I've<00:02:54.010> divided<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.909> sexes

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
there because I've divided the sexes

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.220 
there because I've divided the sexes
into<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.129> power<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.389> that<00:02:58.420> if<00:02:58.750> something<00:02:59.019> goes

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
into a power so that if something goes

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.979 
into a power so that if something goes
wrong<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.709> can<00:02:59.859> always<00:03:00.099> change<00:03:00.280> changing

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
wrong you can always change changing

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.619 
wrong you can always change changing
much<00:03:01.989> can<00:03:02.200> happen<00:03:02.379> next<00:03:03.220> time<00:03:03.489> balancing<00:03:04.450> is

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
much can happen next time balancing is

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.110 
much can happen next time balancing is
gonna<00:03:04.810> be<00:03:04.959> done<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.340> lot<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.489> stuff<00:03:06.790> and

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
gonna be done for a lot of stuff and

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.690 
gonna be done for a lot of stuff and
they<00:03:07.510> solve<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.650> other<00:03:08.799> tracks<00:03:09.129> of<00:03:09.280> being

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
they solve the other tracks of being

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.949 
they solve the other tracks of being
finished<00:03:10.000> down<00:03:10.180> here<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.450> then<00:03:10.569> there<00:03:10.840> yeah
