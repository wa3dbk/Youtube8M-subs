00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
your friend has flown pretty high into

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.480 
your friend has flown pretty high into
the<00:01:19.560> air<00:01:19.650> make<00:01:19.860> sure<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.280> pretty

the air make sure that you are pretty
high<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> sky<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.570> essentially<00:01:22.320> from

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
high up in the sky and essentially from

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.510 
high up in the sky and essentially from
there<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.920> want<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.310> friend

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
steady up the cargo bub so that is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
steady up the cargo bub so that is
completely<00:01:25.409> straight<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.670> soon<00:01:26.850> as

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
completely straight and that as soon as

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.550 
completely straight and that as soon as
he's<00:01:27.090> steady<00:01:27.390> make<00:01:27.900> sure<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.229> he<00:01:28.320> keeps

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
he's steady make sure that he keeps

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200 
he's steady make sure that he keeps
holding<00:01:28.740> down<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> right<00:01:29.280> trigger<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
holding down the right trigger so that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
holding down the right trigger so that
he<00:01:30.329> keeps<00:01:30.600> flying<00:01:30.810> directly<00:01:31.320> straight<00:01:31.799> up

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
he keeps flying directly straight up

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
he keeps flying directly straight up
into<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> air<00:01:32.640> now<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> absolutely<00:01:33.659> essential

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
into the air now is absolutely essential

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
into the air now is absolutely essential
in<00:01:34.320> order<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> work<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.520> long<00:01:35.700> as

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
in order for this to work as long as

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.550 
in order for this to work as long as
your<00:01:35.939> friend<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.360> flying<00:01:36.540> directly<00:01:37.170> straight

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
your friend is flying directly straight

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
your friend is flying directly straight
up<00:01:37.829> into<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.040> sky<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.460> he<00:01:38.520> keeps<00:01:38.729> elevating

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
up into the sky and he keeps elevating

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.969 
up into the sky and he keeps elevating
higher<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.720> higher<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.680> guys<00:01:40.799> want

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
higher and higher and what you guys want

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
higher and higher and what you guys want
to<00:01:41.040> go<00:01:41.100> ahead<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> cargo<00:01:42.540> up<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
to go ahead and do is as the cargo up is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.539 
to go ahead and do is as the cargo up is
flying<00:01:43.049> upwards<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.950> guys<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> go

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
flying upwards you guys then want to go

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.039 
flying upwards you guys then want to go
ahead<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.970> jump<00:01:45.240> off<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> side<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> car

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
ahead and jump off the side of the car

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
ahead and jump off the side of the car
go<00:01:46.229> bub<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:46.979> put<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.340> into<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> diving

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
go bub so they put you into the diving

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.670 
go bub so they put you into the diving
animation<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.780> essentially<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
animation and essentially because the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.319 
animation and essentially because the
cargo<00:01:49.979> Bob<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> flying<00:01:50.430> upwards<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> just

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
cargo Bob is flying upwards and you just

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.480 
cargo Bob is flying upwards and you just
don't<00:01:51.479> off<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.899> downwards<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.710> causes<00:01:53.100> some

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
don't off it downwards it causes some

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.100 
don't off it downwards it causes some
kind<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.820> character<00:01:54.149> glitch<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.570> happen<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
kind of a character glitch to happen and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.600 
kind of a character glitch to happen and
are<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> kind<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.890> diving<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.520> you're

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
are you kind of diving but you're

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.130 
are you kind of diving but you're
actually<00:01:56.729> flying<00:01:57.090> upwards<00:01:57.570> into<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> sky

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
actually flying upwards into the sky

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.300 
actually flying upwards into the sky
kind<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> direction<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.130> way<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
kind of the direction the way the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.740 
kind of the direction the way the
crocker<00:01:59.520> bob<00:01:59.640> was<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.509> see

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
crocker bob was going so as you can see

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.330 
crocker bob was going so as you can see
the<00:02:01.020> glitch<00:02:01.229> did<00:02:01.439> actually<00:02:01.590> work<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> it's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the glitch did actually work and it's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.560 
the glitch did actually work and it's
pretty<00:02:02.549> awesome<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.180> those<00:02:03.270> 40

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
you have a board online and at this

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.880 
you have a board online and at this
point<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.520> keep<00:02:11.849> floating<00:02:12.330> all

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
point you keep floating all

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.170 
point you keep floating all
way<00:02:12.950> into<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.430> sky<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.670> literally<00:02:14.060> don't

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
way into the sky you literally don't

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.750 
way into the sky you literally don't
stop<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:15.200> will<00:02:15.350> keep<00:02:15.470> going<00:02:15.830> as<00:02:15.950> far<00:02:16.370> as<00:02:16.580> you

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
stop you will keep going as far as you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.580 
stop you will keep going as far as you
know<00:02:17.180> possibly<00:02:17.390> can<00:02:17.900> go<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:18.110> I'm<00:02:18.319> not<00:02:18.410> entirely

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
know possibly can go so I'm not entirely

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.710 
know possibly can go so I'm not entirely
sure<00:02:18.709> how<00:02:18.950> far<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.310> can<00:02:19.520> go<00:02:19.700> I'm<00:02:20.300> not<00:02:20.450> too<00:02:20.569> sure

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
sure how far you can go I'm not too sure

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.120 
sure how far you can go I'm not too sure
you<00:02:20.900> know<00:02:20.990> but<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.200> sky<00:02:21.470> barrier<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:21.890> or

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
you know but the sky barrier is or

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.470 
you know but the sky barrier is or
anything<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.490> or<00:02:22.640> if<00:02:22.819> is<00:02:22.970> even<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> sky

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
anything like that or if is even a sky

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.330 
anything like that or if is even a sky
barrier<00:02:23.810> but<00:02:24.380> essentially<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:25.010> will<00:02:25.190> keep

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
barrier but essentially you will keep

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.190 
barrier but essentially you will keep
flying<00:02:25.640> directly<00:02:25.970> up<00:02:26.150> into<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> sky<00:02:26.660> for<00:02:27.050> as

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
flying directly up into the sky for as

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.320 
flying directly up into the sky for as
long<00:02:27.500> as<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.830> can<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.520> what's<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> going<00:02:29.240> to

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
long as you can so what's it going to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.430 
long as you can so what's it going to
put<00:02:29.480> your<00:02:29.570> awesome<00:02:29.810> little<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:30.320> was
