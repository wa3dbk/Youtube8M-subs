 Today you will learn where and how 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.250
 Microphone best prescriber spokesman 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.200
 or rapper is placed and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.960
 to make professional shots like 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.799
 she also was living beat the raab 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.799
 still a mess 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.240
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.710
 delamar the specialist magazine for musicians my 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.390
 name is christian and today you are experiencing 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.189
 the best tips and professional 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.599
 Recordings of vocals and language in 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.820
 to make your recording studio 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.920
 We take various positions in this regard 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 the microphone placement as well as their front 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.829
 and disadvantages 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.129
 but first we start with the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.180
 Basics so that the right vote 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.860
 can unfold 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.260
 should the singer or rapper at the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 Performance standing while sitting expresses itself 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.110
 the midriff together so that the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.960
 voice can sound pressed 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.640
 We also want to avoid that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.829
 We tend to get the microphone a bit too 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.899
 high for the singer to stand upright 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.809
 and the voice can unfold freely 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.489
 in microphone if we just tripod 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.619
 then it should be mentioned that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.489
 Many sound engineers put the head first 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.010
 hanging 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.930
 with a tube microphone like the max ev 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.119
 fir that we can use here by 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.970
 The heat of the tube escape upwards 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.530
 and does not have to pass the membrane 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.780
 In addition, this will be the reflection 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.080
 minimizes the from the upper body of the singer 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.640
 to be thrown back 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.890
 Most influence on the recording 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.780
 the distance to the membrane increases the more you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.520
 when singing to the microphone, the more 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.560
 The voice sounds closer and more present 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.009
 and the less space share is too 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.140
 hear 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.299
 This is especially for hobby studios very 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.470
 interesting because these are not optimized 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.300
 have reception space 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.460
 how do you look out of the world 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.620
 So live something or hit the raab 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.950
 but a dirt without wok wm perfect 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.950
 because how 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.770
 my microphone with a kidney 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.930
 Richtcharakteristik comes closer 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.970
 the name meeting effect to wear 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.580
 the more you get to the membrane the more 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.649
 the voice will become better at the same time 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.689
 It also increases the intimacy of the recording 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.569
 that is wonderful to thicken 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.370
 of rather thin voices if you use 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.989
 quite close to the microphone sings one hears the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.030
 change your position by the 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.709
 teetering during the performance in 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.300
 unfamiliar shape brings that later 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.700
 problems with the mixing by the 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.500
 change the sound color in particular 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.930
 by the lateral change of the axis 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.650
 more on that later 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.390
 how do you look wild without 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.209
 entertainment has the life of fashion shock 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.940
 the raab one more purpose without wok wm 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.650
 and the ebbe flood technology you can 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.120
 use the louder passages the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.190
 not to override preamp 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.870
 to do that, you take special care 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.110
 in the song are simply from the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.819
 Many beginners ask themselves a question 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.450
 a good distance to the membrane well 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.250
 could be 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.920
 In many cases, it has proven itself 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.709
 about a handbreadth distance to the microphone 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.390
 allow 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.370
 when talking and singing work both 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.950
 head as well as chest as a resonance body 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.200
 go for the lighter frequencies lighter 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.630
 Mouth and nose tend to be something more 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.400
 down we can join us 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.530
 make use of the microphone placement 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.030
 sounds like a singer to nasal or can 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.630
 a little more volume in his voice 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.489
 use 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.079
 then you can use the microphone in the direction of 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.000
 breast tend and you the result 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.630
 listen to 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.100
 conversely, you can do a lot 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.200
 bass-heavy singer also of something 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.750
 lower in the direction of the head and nose 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.640
 It is important to record different things 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.290
 positions for the microphone 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.170
 and the results afterwards exactly 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.820
 to listen 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.320
 have the third wheel for the sound 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.970
 I already mentioned earlier 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.100
 this is about a lateral 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.109
 transfer to the axis by one over 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.269
 singing at the microphone's membrane 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.640
 These balance and depressive ones can help 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.430
 the recording will affect the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.160
 balances are sheep sibilants at the 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.079
 consonants as it or z arise

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.890

 sauerkraut super plum sauerkraut 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.400
 and the passive ones include b or b 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.049
 p 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.060
 which ploppen to a kind at the 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.190

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.790
 Daily the bumps tend to go 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.770
 vertically down and through one 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.510
 You can sing this side by side 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.200
 without a pop filter, good grip 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.840
 let's get together 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.820
 by the distance to the microphone you can 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.700
 both the intimacy and the bass 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.410
 share influence over the inclination to 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.150
 Breast and head you can 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.400
 tone color and the nasal factor 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.110
 determine and pass by the side 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.720
 You can speak passive and you 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.700
 get a grip on balance sheets by us 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.889
 these proposed placements 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.350
 you can combine with each other for 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.990
 any combination of singer and microphone 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.370
 a sweet spot especially 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.310
 good for the respective recording 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.620
 but the whole thing works 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.240
 with a rage there is also 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.940
 a change in the presence of 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.700
 voice recordings any change in 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.350
 distance angle or tilt pulls one 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.600
 change the frequency response after 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.610
 This is due to the design 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.860
 of microphones and also applies to the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.990
 most expensive and best mikes also for 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.120
 the one used here with acts ev 4 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.830
 that was it from my side for today 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.350
 with tips for microphone placement 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.120

 We'll be back to the lama soon

 hit the raab a bit more 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.170
 that perfect

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.210
 weeks like to come and co on the

 one wonders at the stella comedies 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.490
 if they are so hot because you get up 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.250
 should take and the aligned

 marzahn everyone believes today as 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.730
 can be funny 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.460
 We would have been without this nonsense 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.920
 really fun or beans dieter planks 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.790
 Okay, that would be you can see them from the
