 Yes Hi the previous channel is Maehara 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.559
 Yes today is this 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:13.190
 Thomas Tomica 06 Chocolate Percy 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:18.020
 It is here I is Tteyuu Thomas Tomica 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:23.780
 The new series was coming out before it is it 06 chocolate 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.200
 Percy sounds similar to the previous Tomica Thomas series, but with consolidated specifications 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.840
 Ne 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.680
 Pan 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.710
 For the lett, this Thomas Tomica lineup 1 to 6 was written 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.120
 But most officials did not have him 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.700
 And Tsu Na or Well okay it did not change at all 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.860
 One turn of Tomica Thomas 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:48.900
 It feels like I can play with things, and the package looks like this Tomica-like 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.160
 Oh yes in the car I wrote Tomica and it looks like an ordinary Tomica-like 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.030
 It sounds like 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.240
 Hmmm 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.570
 Let's open it now 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.570

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 It was a good chocolate today , it was a good chocolate. 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.910
 Percy is yeah 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.710
 It feels like I 'm thinking it's good I think that chocolate is on it 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.270
 Sour 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.270
 Or number 6 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:52.700
 There is a buber and only price increases 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:52.700
 Oh really park Nuupaka I ended up with scary feeling But yeah eh value Te A'a' 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:02.340
 Pretty Bolagnona car like this 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:07.740
 Well, basically it's just like the percy and it's just painted chocolate 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.420
 It is refurbished, and this is Percy with capsule plastic rail at the same time 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.170
 Hey 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.180
 I want and this is a wooden lace chocolate percy 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.110
 Hmmm 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.680
 I do not remember to tap Fisher Price 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:26.830
 This is limited to 8 lands, right? 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 If you compare it like that, even if the wooden rail is over 1 he is not all over 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.500
 Ne 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.770
 This capsule plastic rail and Tomica Thomas 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.230
 Hmm 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.030
 Us say cramped I'd reflected cute all brown 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:49.460
 I'm a little surprised at the capsule plastic I wish I had such a face-up cat 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:55.580
 I hit the electric space from the back and returned to the front, but there is a hole for connection 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:57.470
 Percy I pulled to the front in front of the chocolate and I got a chocolate 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.670
 The Tomos but whether to pull 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.240
