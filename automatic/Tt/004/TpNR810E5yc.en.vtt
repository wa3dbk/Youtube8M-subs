00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
in the narrow I'm pretty sure it'll ask

in the narrow I'm pretty sure it'll ask
you<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:41.010> respring<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.120> it's<00:04:42.270> basically<00:04:42.540> just

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
you to respring so it's basically just

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.740 
you to respring so it's basically just
turn<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.370> out<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:44.910> putting<00:04:45.150> your<00:04:45.360> ipod<00:04:45.630> to

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
sleep like this boom then back on and

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.360 
sleep like this boom then back on and
then<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.960> just<00:04:49.170> go<00:04:49.380> back<00:04:49.680> up<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.160> rode

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
then you just go back up and rode

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.140 
then you just go back up and rode
dragonvale<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.390> then<00:04:52.820> we<00:04:53.820> would've

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
dragonvale and then we would've

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.040 
dragonvale and then we would've
dragonvale<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:56.120> try<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.510> then<00:04:57.810> if<00:04:57.930> they

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
dragonvale just try it and then if they

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.930 
dragonvale just try it and then if they
ask<00:04:58.230> you<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.530> confirm<00:04:58.770> purposes<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.730> means

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
ask you to confirm purposes that means

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.710 
ask you to confirm purposes that means
it<00:05:00.180> didn't<00:05:00.600> work<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.140> did<00:05:01.530> something<00:05:01.830> wrong

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
it didn't work and did something wrong

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.820 
it didn't work and did something wrong
so<00:05:03.720> I<00:05:04.020> don't<00:05:04.230> see<00:05:04.320> how<00:05:04.440> you<00:05:04.500> could<00:05:04.680> do<00:05:04.800> that

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
so I don't see how you could do that

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.380 
so I don't see how you could do that
though<00:05:05.100> but<00:05:05.580> um<00:05:05.820> yeah<00:05:06.510> or<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:08.190> or<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.520> program

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
though but um yeah or the or the program

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.870 
though but um yeah or the or the program
doesn't<00:05:09.570> work<00:05:09.920> yeah<00:05:10.920> and<00:05:13.520> it's<00:05:14.520> pretty<00:05:14.640> cool

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
doesn't work yeah and it's pretty cool

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.950 
doesn't work yeah and it's pretty cool
so<00:05:17.660> yeah<00:05:18.660> then<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:20.340> just<00:05:20.550> freed<00:05:21.150> up<00:05:21.360> purchases

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
so yeah then it just freed up purchases

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.290
