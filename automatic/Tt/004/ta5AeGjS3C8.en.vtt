shuttlecraft and we have a sleep so

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.009 
shuttlecraft and we have a sleep so
we're<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.519> to<00:00:47.640> keep<00:00:47.699> this<00:00:47.879> hand<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.749> will<00:00:48.899> be

we're going to keep this hand we will be

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.919 
we're going to keep this hand we will be
on<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.170> draw<00:00:49.350> down<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.210> sarkan<00:00:51.420> ball<00:00:51.690> is

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
on the draw down so the sarkan ball is

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.799 
on the draw down so the sarkan ball is
the<00:00:52.139> deck<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.729> previously<00:00:53.729> played<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.359> is<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the deck I previously played it is the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.259 
the deck I previously played it is the
red<00:00:54.989> black<00:00:55.229> deck<00:00:55.579> kept<00:00:56.579> rat<00:00:56.760> took<00:00:56.909> all<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> red

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
red black deck kept rat took all the red

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.200 
red black deck kept rat took all the red
out<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.569> it<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.339> drew<00:00:59.670> an<00:00:59.819> etherium

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
out of it so we drew an etherium

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.419 
out of it so we drew an etherium
sculptor<00:01:00.659> which<00:01:01.229> makes<00:01:01.499> art<00:01:01.679> of<00:01:01.769> x1<00:01:02.100> less<00:01:02.159> it

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
sculptor which makes art of x1 less it

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.530 
sculptor which makes art of x1 less it
costs<00:01:02.819> one<00:01:03.299> less<00:01:03.719> cast<00:01:04.940> we're<00:01:05.940> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
costs one less cast we're going to so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.910 
costs one less cast we're going to so
they<00:01:06.660> don't<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> turn<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.440> drop<00:01:07.680> we're

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
they don't have a turn one drop we're

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.440 
they don't have a turn one drop we're
going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> play<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.580> Terra<00:01:08.760> morphix<00:01:09.180> pants

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
going to play the Terra morphix pants

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.090 
going to play the Terra morphix pants
and<00:01:09.840> we're<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.230> to<00:01:10.260> use<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.530> an<00:01:10.740> island

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and we're going to use it for an island

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.600 
and we're going to use it for an island
at<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.280> end<00:01:11.370> of<00:01:11.400> history<00:01:13.220> now<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.490> really

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
at the end of history now that it really

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.070 
at the end of history now that it really
matters<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.780> end<00:01:15.870> of<00:01:15.960> his

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
matters if we do it at the end of his

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.720 
matters if we do it at the end of his
turns<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.770> are<00:01:16.890> planning<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.370> computer

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
turns we are planning it's a computer

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.670 
turns we are planning it's a computer
but<00:01:17.910> normally<00:01:18.690> when<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.930> play<00:01:19.110> tera<00:01:19.350> morphic

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
but normally when you play tera morphic

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.260 
but normally when you play tera morphic
expanses<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.490> want<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> wait<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.000> end<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
expanses you want to wait to the end of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.950 
expanses you want to wait to the end of
your<00:01:21.390> opponent's<00:01:21.810> turn<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.200> use<00:01:22.410> them

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
your opponent's turn to use them

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.180 
your opponent's turn to use them
just<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.500> they<00:01:24.710> don't<00:01:24.799> have<00:01:24.950> any<00:01:25.070> more

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
just so that they don't have any more

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.190 
just so that they don't have any more
information<00:01:25.720> don't<00:01:26.720> give<00:01:26.869> them<00:01:26.930> any<00:01:27.080> more

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
information don't give them any more

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.080 
information don't give them any more
information<00:01:27.590> than<00:01:28.010> you<00:01:28.070> need<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.280> he's<00:01:28.970> going

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
information than you need to he's going

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
information than you need to he's going
to<00:01:29.150> get<00:01:29.240> himself<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.690> goblins

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.890 

and<00:01:35.250> we're<00:01:35.370> gonna<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.580> an<00:01:35.729> out<00:01:41.720> I'm<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.840> to

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
and we're gonna get an out I'm going to

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.210 
and we're gonna get an out I'm going to
play<00:01:43.050> tapped<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.470> course<00:01:45.530> wurmcoil<00:01:46.530> engine<00:01:46.830> I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
play tapped of course wurmcoil engine I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.910 
play tapped of course wurmcoil engine I
like<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.150> so<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.050> can<00:01:49.170> play<00:01:49.320> our<00:01:49.350> t1<00:01:49.590> death

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
like that so we can play our t1 death

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.830 
like that so we can play our t1 death
touch<00:01:50.190> or<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:50.850> could<00:01:50.970> play<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> etherium

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
touch or we could play the etherium

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
touch or we could play the etherium
that'll<00:01:52.050> make<00:01:52.140> them<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.560> less<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.979> cast<00:01:53.369> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that'll make them one less to cast and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.740 
that'll make them one less to cast and
we'll<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.590> three<00:01:55.590> mana<00:01:55.800> next<00:01:56.159> turn<00:01:56.750> she

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
we'll have three mana next turn she

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.380 
we'll have three mana next turn she
costs<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:59.659> and<00:02:00.659> he<00:02:00.869> would<00:02:00.990> cost<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:02.390> ultimately

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
costs to and he would cost to ultimately

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.600 
costs to and he would cost to ultimately
that's<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.050> going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> matter<00:02:04.470> but

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.810 

I'm<00:02:08.610> gonna<00:02:08.759> go<00:02:08.850> ahead<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.000> play<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.239> anyway<00:02:10.820> he

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
I'm gonna go ahead and play it anyway he

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.380 
I'm gonna go ahead and play it anyway he
may<00:02:11.940> burn<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.269> me<00:02:12.330> killin<00:02:12.690> but<00:02:12.840> we'll<00:02:12.989> see<00:02:14.390> this

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
may burn to me killin but we'll see this

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.210 
may burn to me killin but we'll see this
way<00:02:15.570> we<00:02:15.720> can<00:02:15.750> actually<00:02:16.290> block<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.860> tokens

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
way we can actually block the tokens

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.390 
way we can actually block the tokens
when<00:02:17.340> he<00:02:17.400> attacks<00:02:21.560> because<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:22.800> play<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
when he attacks because if we play the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.250 
when he attacks because if we play the
death<00:02:23.550> touch<00:02:23.820> good<00:02:24.420> block<00:02:24.630> but<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:24.930> lose<00:02:25.080> our

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
death touch good block but we lose our

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.290 
death touch good block but we lose our
guy<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.700> that'd<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.820> bad<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:30.000> he's<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.239> going

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
guy and that'd be bad so he's not going

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.850 
guy and that'd be bad so he's not going
to<00:02:30.570> attack

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
spells cost one less cast ok so we can

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.630

fourteen dropping to one next turn if we

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.920 
fourteen dropping to one next turn if we

draw an island he's not attacking he's

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:27.169 
draw an island he's not attacking he's
gonna<00:05:20.050> play<00:05:20.700> raging<00:05:21.700> goblin

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:27.179 

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:30.119 

what's<00:05:28.179> the<00:05:28.299> reason<00:05:28.689> there's<00:05:28.929> the<00:05:29.109> island<00:05:29.469> yep

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
what's the reason there's the island yep

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.899 
what's the reason there's the island yep
we're<00:05:31.029> gonna<00:05:31.149> play<00:05:31.329> sleep<00:05:31.949> the<00:05:32.949> reason<00:05:33.429> we

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
we're gonna play sleep the reason we

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.429 
we're gonna play sleep the reason we
could<00:05:34.059> actually<00:05:34.179> look<00:05:34.689> at<00:05:34.869> my<00:05:34.989> work<00:05:35.139> oh<00:05:35.289> yeah

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:35.439 
could actually look at my work oh yeah

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.149 
could actually look at my work oh yeah
the<00:05:36.099> reason<00:05:36.429> that<00:05:36.459> I<00:05:37.799> think<00:05:38.799> that<00:05:38.829> we<00:05:39.039> did

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
the reason that I think that we did

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.099 
the reason that I think that we did
better<00:05:39.279> with<00:05:39.429> the<00:05:39.939> shark<00:05:40.239> on<00:05:40.359> deck<00:05:40.599> is<00:05:40.839> because

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:41.109 
better with the shark on deck is because

00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:42.979 
better with the shark on deck is because
I<00:05:41.739> actually<00:05:41.889> have<00:05:42.159> all<00:05:42.279> the<00:05:42.369> cards<00:05:42.549> and<00:05:42.789> locked

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:42.989 
I actually have all the cards and locked

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:45.119 
I actually have all the cards and locked
so<00:05:43.989> I<00:05:44.019> was<00:05:44.319> probably<00:05:44.559> using<00:05:44.889> a<00:05:44.949> better

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:45.129 
so I was probably using a better

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:46.079 
so I was probably using a better
building<00:05:45.489> what<00:05:45.579> we're<00:05:45.669> playing<00:05:45.879> against

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
building what we're playing against

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:49.229 
building what we're playing against
right<00:05:46.299> here<00:05:47.459> after<00:05:48.459> you<00:05:48.669> play<00:05:48.849> through<00:05:49.089> all

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:49.239 
right here after you play through all

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:51.779 
right here after you play through all
the<00:05:49.569> game<00:05:49.869> there's<00:05:50.559> actually<00:05:50.979> a<00:05:51.009> revenge

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
the game there's actually a revenge

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:52.979 
the game there's actually a revenge
where<00:05:51.999> you<00:05:52.059> play<00:05:52.209> against<00:05:52.419> them<00:05:52.509> again<00:05:52.779> and<00:05:52.929> I

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:52.989 
where you play against them again and I

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:54.389 
where you play against them again and I
think<00:05:53.169> they<00:05:53.289> have<00:05:53.319> better<00:05:53.679> versions<00:05:54.129> of<00:05:54.219> the

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:54.399 
think they have better versions of the

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:57.059 
think they have better versions of the
decks<00:05:54.609> at<00:05:54.939> that<00:05:55.119> point<00:05:55.419> and<00:05:56.169> i<00:05:56.589> might<00:05:56.739> do<00:05:56.859> those

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
decks at that point and i might do those

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.769 
decks at that point and i might do those
later<00:05:57.309> on<00:05:57.519> if<00:05:57.849> you<00:05:57.969> all<00:05:58.089> want<00:05:58.269> to<00:05:58.299> see<00:05:58.479> them<00:05:58.599> I

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
later on if you all want to see them I

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.199 
later on if you all want to see them I
made<00:05:59.109> you<00:05:59.229> the<00:05:59.409> archenemy<00:05:59.889> stuff<00:06:00.099> as<00:06:00.249> well<00:06:00.429> but

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:01.209 
made you the archenemy stuff as well but

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:02.459 
made you the archenemy stuff as well but
that'll<00:06:01.479> be<00:06:01.569> that'll<00:06:01.959> depend<00:06:02.169> on<00:06:02.379> how

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
that'll be that'll depend on how

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:04.139 
that'll be that'll depend on how
successful<00:06:02.679> these<00:06:03.129> videos<00:06:03.549> are<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:03.969> if<00:06:04.029> you

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:04.149 
successful these videos are and if you

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:06.589 
successful these videos are and if you
want<00:06:04.719> to<00:06:04.749> see<00:06:04.869> those<00:06:04.989> videos<00:06:05.019> later<00:06:05.469> on<00:06:05.649> or<00:06:05.769> not

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
want to see those videos later on or not

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.549 
want to see those videos later on or not
but<00:06:07.599> we're<00:06:07.749> probably<00:06:07.959> going<00:06:08.229> to<00:06:08.319> win<00:06:08.379> this

00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:08.559 
but we're probably going to win this

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:10.319 
but we're probably going to win this
game<00:06:08.649> because<00:06:08.889> they're<00:06:09.069> not<00:06:09.189> I'm<00:06:09.759> tapping<00:06:10.059> so

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:10.329 
game because they're not I'm tapping so

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:12.119 
game because they're not I'm tapping so
we<00:06:10.449> get<00:06:10.539> another<00:06:10.719> attack<00:06:11.259> next<00:06:11.469> turn<00:06:11.619> sleep<00:06:11.979> is

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
we get another attack next turn sleep is

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.759 
we get another attack next turn sleep is
such<00:06:12.279> a<00:06:12.309> great<00:06:12.489> guard<00:06:13.139> French<00:06:14.139> my<00:06:14.499> doesn't

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:14.769 
such a great guard French my doesn't

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:16.499 
such a great guard French my doesn't
know<00:06:14.829> who<00:06:15.009> see<00:06:15.309> it<00:06:15.339> taps<00:06:15.969> all<00:06:16.149> creatures

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
know who see it taps all creatures

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.059 
know who see it taps all creatures
players<00:06:16.839> control<00:06:17.169> and<00:06:17.559> then<00:06:17.769> those<00:06:17.889> creatures

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:18.069 
players control and then those creatures

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.559 
players control and then those creatures
