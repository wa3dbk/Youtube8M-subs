00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
this is how to solve the 3d puzzle with

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.190 
this is how to solve the 3d puzzle with
the<00:00:04.259> 12<00:00:04.589> sticks<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.370> ball<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.819> middle

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
the 12 sticks in the ball in the middle

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.680 
the 12 sticks in the ball in the middle
first<00:00:07.200> thing<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.560> do<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:07.980> find<00:00:08.690> sticks

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
first thing you do is you find sticks

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.430 
first thing you do is you find sticks
that<00:00:09.900> twist<00:00:10.910> so<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.120> one<00:00:12.330> twists<00:00:12.780> these<00:00:13.110> do

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
that twist so this one twists these do

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.720 
that twist so this one twists these do
not<00:00:13.650> twist<00:00:15.379> so<00:00:16.379> now<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:16.949> found<00:00:17.160> these<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
not twist so now that we found these the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.810 
not twist so now that we found these the
twist<00:00:18.199> we<00:00:19.199> turn<00:00:19.800> them<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.340> they're<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.609> their

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
twist we turn them so they're on their

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.080 
twist we turn them so they're on their
side<00:00:21.980> now<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.279> have<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.640> ones<00:00:23.820> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
side now that we have the ones that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.660 
side now that we have the ones that
twist<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> side<00:00:25.230> we're<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.369> twist

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
twist on the side we're going to twist

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.109 
twist on the side we're going to twist
this<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.740> counterclockwise<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.369> twist<00:00:29.970> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
this one counterclockwise and twist this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.310 
this one counterclockwise and twist this
one<00:00:30.359> clockwise<00:00:36.800> notice<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:38.010> rotate<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.610> down

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
one clockwise notice they rotate it down

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
one clockwise notice they rotate it down
allowing<00:00:40.320> us<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> slide<00:00:41.370> these<00:00:42.440> out

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.980 

these<00:00:55.340> two<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.790> we<00:00:55.910> just<00:00:56.120> removed<00:00:56.360> have<00:00:56.960> a

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
these two that we just removed have a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.250 
these two that we just removed have a
small<00:00:57.530> notch<00:00:57.860> on<00:00:58.730> one<00:00:59.060> side<00:00:59.330> and<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.750> big<00:01:00.050> notch

on<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.710> other<00:01:00.860> side<00:01:01.450> there<00:01:02.450> on<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.690> top<00:01:02.930> then

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
on the other side there on the top then

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.460 
on the other side there on the top then
the<00:01:03.710> next<00:01:04.160> layer<00:01:04.810> in<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.950> middle<00:01:08.200> they<00:01:09.200> come

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
the next layer in the middle they come

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:27.929 
the next layer in the middle they come
out<00:01:09.620> they<00:01:10.190> have<00:01:10.220> big<00:01:10.729> notches<00:01:11.150> on<00:01:11.330> both<00:01:11.360> sides

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.340 

now<00:01:28.570> we<00:01:28.630> can<00:01:28.929> take<00:01:29.109> the<00:01:29.259> ball<00:01:29.439> out<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:32.020> we<00:01:32.170> can

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
now we can take the ball out and we can

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.249 
now we can take the ball out and we can
notice<00:01:35.069> these<00:01:36.069> big<00:01:36.579> notches<00:01:37.030> on<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.299> top<00:01:37.600> line

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
notice these big notches on the top line

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.510 
notice these big notches on the top line
up<00:01:38.500> with<00:01:38.979> those<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.609> rotate<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:41.399> they<00:01:42.399> have

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
up with those that rotate and they have

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.319 
up with those that rotate and they have
little<00:01:42.880> notches<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.740> side<00:01:45.009> line<00:01:46.000> up<00:01:46.149> with

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
little notches on this side line up with

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.449 
little notches on this side line up with
the<00:01:46.450> ones<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:46.810> do<00:01:47.170> not<00:01:47.409> rotate<00:01:47.679> this<00:01:48.250> one

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
the ones that do not rotate this one

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.589 
the ones that do not rotate this one
does<00:01:48.640> not<00:01:48.880> rotate<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:50.409> here<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:52.299> finish

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
does not rotate here here to finish

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.830 
does not rotate here here to finish
taking<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:53.049> apart<00:01:53.819> we<00:01:54.819> rotate<00:01:55.299> these<00:01:55.539> two

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
taking it apart we rotate these two

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.020 
taking it apart we rotate these two
bottom<00:01:56.200> ones<00:01:57.539> so<00:01:58.539> that<00:01:58.569> we<00:01:58.840> can<00:01:59.020> take<00:02:00.030> upright

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
bottom ones so that we can take upright

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:51.500 
bottom ones so that we can take upright
pieces<00:02:01.479> out

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.179 

to<00:02:52.510> put<00:02:52.659> it<00:02:52.750> back<00:02:52.870> together<00:02:53.079> you<00:02:53.739> start<00:02:53.980> off

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
to put it back together you start off

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:59.640 
to put it back together you start off
with<00:02:54.219> two<00:02:54.400> pieces<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:59.079> put<00:02:59.349> on<00:02:59.469> the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
with two pieces like that you put on the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.030 
with two pieces like that you put on the
pieces<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.189> will<00:03:00.370> rotate<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.799> in<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
pieces that will rotate this is in the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.080 
pieces that will rotate this is in the
unlocked<00:03:06.219> position

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
unlocked position

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.170 
unlocked position
so<00:03:07.659> you<00:03:08.069> next<00:03:09.120> pinch<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.329> together<00:03:10.590> lift<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.769> up

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
so you next pinch it together lift it up

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.709 
so you next pinch it together lift it up
slide<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.209> two<00:03:13.510> pieces<00:03:13.750> into<00:03:14.139> place<00:03:15.719> and

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:16.719 
slide the two pieces into place and

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:26.750 
slide the two pieces into place and
rotate<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:20.560> one<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:21.040> lock<00:03:21.250> them<00:03:21.459> into<00:03:21.609> place

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:48.790 

now<00:03:27.760> do<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:28.150> same<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.659> other<00:03:28.689> side

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.130 

next<00:03:49.800> put<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.040> ball<00:03:50.310> inside<00:03:53.720> take<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.900> two

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
next put the ball inside take the two

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:04.929 
next put the ball inside take the two
that<00:03:55.590> rotate<00:03:57.890> slide<00:03:58.890> them<00:03:59.100> into<00:03:59.280> place

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:11.300 

last<00:04:05.939> take<00:04:06.689> the<00:04:06.840> last<00:04:07.079> two<00:04:07.260> pieces<00:04:10.159> put<00:04:11.159> them

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
last take the last two pieces put them

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:31.029 
last take the last two pieces put them
from<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.700> inside<00:04:12.019> push<00:04:13.019> him<00:04:13.230> into<00:04:13.650> place

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.689 

then<00:04:32.039> rotate<00:04:33.139> the<00:04:34.139> top<00:04:34.349> -<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.860> lock<00:04:35.069> those<00:04:35.370> into

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
then rotate the top - to lock those into

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:54.140 
then rotate the top - to lock those into
place<00:04:49.310> now<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:50.520> locked<00:04:50.759> into<00:04:51.060> place<00:04:53.150> now

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
place now it's locked into place now

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.550 
place now it's locked into place now
rotate<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.130> puzzle<00:04:59.840> so<00:05:00.840> that<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.199> ones<00:05:01.440> that

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
rotate the puzzle so that the ones that

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.050 
rotate the puzzle so that the ones that
rotate<00:05:02.310> are<00:05:03.030> going<00:05:03.659> up<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:03.960> down
