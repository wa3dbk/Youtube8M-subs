necessarily say Bilderberg meeting but I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.060 
necessarily say Bilderberg meeting but I
just<00:00:24.150> said<00:00:24.269> their<00:00:24.420> global<00:00:24.750> oulous<00:00:25.080> elite<00:00:25.769> will

just said their global oulous elite will
be<00:00:26.189> meeting<00:00:26.490> somewhere<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.349> they're<00:00:28.349> gonna

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
be meeting somewhere and they're gonna

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.769 
be meeting somewhere and they're gonna
basically<00:00:28.740> leave<00:00:29.400> early<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
basically leave early because of the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.270 
basically leave early because of the
pressure<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.550> people<00:00:33.000> put<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
pressure that the people put on them and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.250 
pressure that the people put on them and
some<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:35.989> said<00:00:36.989> something

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
some of that I think said something

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.979 
some of that I think said something
about<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:38.300> technology<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.960> I

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
about like with technology like what I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.569 
about like with technology like what I
thought<00:00:40.230> would<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.309> mini

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
thought would be like a little mini

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
thought would be like a little mini
drone<00:00:41.930> that's<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> interpreted<00:00:43.829> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
drone that's the way I interpreted it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.160 
drone that's the way I interpreted it
and<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.600> little<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:46.079> they

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and they have these little what they

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.799 
and they have these little what they
call<00:00:46.200> quad<00:00:46.680> copters<00:00:47.300> which<00:00:48.300> all<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.600> means

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
call quad copters which all that means

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
call quad copters which all that means
is<00:00:49.020> there's<00:00:49.200> four<00:00:49.530> propellers<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.489> each

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
is there's four propellers in each

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.029 
is there's four propellers in each
corner

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
corner

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.709 
corner
thus<00:00:53.039> quadcopter<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.620> they're<00:00:55.620> quite<00:00:55.920> stable

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
thus quadcopter and they're quite stable

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.080 
thus quadcopter and they're quite stable
they're<00:00:57.719> very<00:00:57.989> maneuverable<00:00:58.760> unlike<00:00:59.760> some<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
they're very maneuverable unlike some of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.360 
they're very maneuverable unlike some of
the<00:01:00.350> earlier<00:01:01.350> stuff<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> lack

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the earlier stuff that was at the lack

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640 
the earlier stuff that was at the lack
of<00:01:02.399> regular<00:01:02.850> helicopter<00:01:03.049> I<00:01:04.049> don't<00:01:04.500> talk<00:01:04.619> about

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
of regular helicopter I don't talk about

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
of regular helicopter I don't talk about
remote<00:01:05.040> control<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.210> know<00:01:06.270> ones

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
remote control a little you know ones

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.140 
remote control a little you know ones
like<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> big<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> little<00:01:07.680> bigger<00:01:08.150> you

like this big or or a little bigger you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.640 
like this big or or a little bigger you
know<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> wind<00:01:09.659> comes<00:01:09.900> out<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.439> just

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
know the wind comes out and they just

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.350 
know the wind comes out and they just
you<00:01:11.070> better<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.640> good<00:01:11.760> at<00:01:12.060> controlling

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you better be really good at controlling

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
you better be really good at controlling
that<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:12.930> even<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:13.890> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that thing even if it's a little bit of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
that thing even if it's a little bit of
a<00:01:14.040> wind<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.210> small<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.630> gets<00:01:15.780> affected<00:01:16.200> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
a wind it's so small it gets affected so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.600 
a wind it's so small it gets affected so
easily<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.740> I've<00:01:17.100> had<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> few<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.580> those

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
easily so I've had a few of those

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.450 
easily so I've had a few of those
smaller<00:01:18.000> ones<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.720> my<00:01:18.930> time<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.220> them

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
smaller ones in my time some of them

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
smaller ones in my time some of them
really<00:01:20.670> small<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.330> could<00:01:21.570> easily<00:01:21.659> fly

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
really small like you could easily fly

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.289 
really small like you could easily fly
them<00:01:22.200> indoors<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.119> when

got the big bank buildings down there

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.220 
got the big bank buildings down there
just<00:05:27.350> like<00:05:27.470> every<00:05:27.740> freaking<00:05:28.100> city<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.840> I<00:05:29.840> know
