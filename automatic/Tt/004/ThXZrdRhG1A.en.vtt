the<00:02:07.569> red<00:02:07.780> peppers<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.530> have<00:02:09.220> been<00:02:09.340> able<00:02:09.489> to

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
the red peppers I have been able to

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.140 
the red peppers I have been able to
locate<00:02:09.789> one<00:02:11.040> two<00:02:12.040> little<00:02:12.459> pieces<00:02:12.640> but<00:02:12.970> this

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
locate one two little pieces but this

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.850 
locate one two little pieces but this
did<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.450> know<00:02:13.540> like<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:13.959> like<00:02:14.110> pepper<00:02:14.410> skin

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
it's not like actual any like real

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.830 
it's not like actual any like real
pepper<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.489> think<00:02:18.700> was<00:02:18.819> just<00:02:19.000> honestly<00:02:19.569> putting

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
pepper I think was just honestly putting

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.900 
pepper I think was just honestly putting
in<00:02:20.020> there<00:02:20.170> just<00:02:20.379> for<00:02:20.560> color<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:21.250> does<00:02:21.550> satisfy

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
in there just for color it does satisfy

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.319 
in there just for color it does satisfy
the<00:02:22.870> need<00:02:23.140> for<00:02:23.590> color<00:02:23.829> but<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.730> kind<00:02:24.939> of<00:02:25.000> want

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
the need for color but I kind of want

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.640 
the need for color but I kind of want
the<00:02:25.540> taste<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.140> pepper

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
the taste of pepper

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.500 
the taste of pepper

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
to rice ratio and actually when I look

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.580 
to rice ratio and actually when I look
in<00:02:55.500> here<00:02:55.790> there<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:56.909> lot<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.120> chicken<00:02:57.590> you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
textbook bacon it's like you take a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.289 
textbook bacon it's like you take a
scratch-and-sniff<00:03:19.379> sticker<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.280> it's<00:03:20.790> bacon

scratch-and-sniff sticker and it's bacon
okay<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.769> doesn't<00:03:22.950> mean<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.220> going<00:03:23.459> to

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
okay that doesn't mean it's going to

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.220 
okay that doesn't mean it's going to
taste<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:23.970> bacon<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.389> certainly<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.840> mean<00:03:25.139> it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
taste like bacon but certainly I mean it

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.930 
taste like bacon but certainly I mean it
smells<00:03:25.680> like<00:03:25.980> bacon<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.609> it's<00:03:26.730> got<00:03:26.849> this

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
smells like bacon and it's got this

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.800 
smells like bacon and it's got this
bacon<00:03:27.769> kind<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.920> aftertaste<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.659> I

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
bacon kind of aftertaste to it and I

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.379 
bacon kind of aftertaste to it and I
think<00:03:30.870> that's<00:03:31.170> okay<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.489> think<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:33.090> almost

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
think that's okay but I think it almost

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.289 
think that's okay but I think it almost

great<00:04:22.109> pieces<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.740> chicken<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.970> right<00:04:24.210> cooked

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
great pieces of chicken the right cooked

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.010 
great pieces of chicken the right cooked
perfectly<00:04:25.770> in<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.130> microwave<00:04:26.460> cooked

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
perfectly in the microwave cooked

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.250 
perfectly in the microwave cooked
reheated<00:04:28.520> defrosted<00:04:29.520> in<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:29.790> microwave<00:04:30.260> but

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
reheated defrosted in the microwave but

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.719 
reheated defrosted in the microwave but
I<00:04:31.320> really<00:04:31.620> think<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:32.070> broccoli<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.669> a

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
I really think that the broccoli is a

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.370 
I really think that the broccoli is a
throwaway<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.360> think<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.780> peppers<00:04:34.199> are<00:04:34.320> a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
throwaway I think the peppers are a

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.020 
throwaway I think the peppers are a
throwaway<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:35.040> think<00:04:35.430> there's<00:04:35.580> almost<00:04:35.760> too

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
throwaway I think there's almost too

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.740 
throwaway I think there's almost too
much<00:04:36.419> bacon<00:04:36.660> taste<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:38.010> not<00:04:38.370> enough<00:04:38.750> creamy

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
much bacon taste and not enough creamy

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.560 
much bacon taste and not enough creamy
ranch<00:04:40.410> taste<00:04:40.949> within<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.789> chicken<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.539> the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
ranch taste within the chicken and the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.480 
ranch taste within the chicken and the
rice<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.320> within<00:04:43.680> all<00:04:43.949> those<00:04:44.130> other<00:04:44.280> pieces

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
rice and within all those other pieces

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.420 
rice and within all those other pieces
so<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.419> don't<00:04:45.600> think<00:04:45.780> it's<00:04:46.020> as<00:04:46.199> good<00:04:47.010> as<00:04:47.280> the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
so I don't think it's as good as the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.870 
so I don't think it's as good as the
other<00:04:47.550> one<00:04:47.789> um<00:04:48.150> if<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:49.680> like<00:04:49.710> bacon<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.789> who

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
other one um if you like bacon and who

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.580 
other one um if you like bacon and who
doesn't<00:04:51.090> like<00:04:51.330> big<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.690> let's<00:04:51.810> face<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.199> but

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
doesn't like big and let's face it but

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.490 
doesn't like big and let's face it but
if<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:52.889> like<00:04:53.370> like<00:04:54.120> crazy<00:04:54.690> amounts<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.169> bacon

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
if you like like crazy amounts of bacon

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.570 
if you like like crazy amounts of bacon
I<00:04:56.280> think<00:04:56.789> you're<00:04:57.060> going<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.389> say<00:04:58.139> yeah<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:59.400> is

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
I think you're going to say yeah this is

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.719 
I think you're going to say yeah this is
crazy<00:05:00.000> amounts<00:05:00.419> of<00:05:00.510> bacon<00:05:00.810> taste<00:05:01.220> but<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.430> don't

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
crazy amounts of bacon taste but I don't

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.180
