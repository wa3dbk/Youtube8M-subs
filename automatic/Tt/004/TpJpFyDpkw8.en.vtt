00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.390
 from stiko feinheit from stuttgart with 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.460
 daniel dÃ¶rrer daniel one of the toughest 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.720
 fights lately or last 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.609
 time in any case were not the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.410
 the hardest had about the example 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.570
 Czech Republic or had to but each 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.100
 fall with one of the first the last 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 three months 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.879
 the last four won with ko what was 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.610
 the problem 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.140
 ok so first of all again pregnant 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.300
 did not work out with the knockout 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.890
 Of course I always search like you 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.450
 know 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.489
 he has the distances a bit better 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.870
 dominates like the other against depor 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.399
 I think that's actually one of mine 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.640
 Rise and control life completely 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.410
 from the dominant distance from the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.280
 better distance from him the hard ones 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.489
 to set a hit 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480
 he has bridged that very well or almost 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.530
 made a little better like me 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.970
 Michael Ballack respect 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.689
 he says he would backtrack 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.000
 to wish 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.740
 he wants to have the consent belt so 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.600
 beautiful I'm planning big respectful 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 Michael was the game when I was the one 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.540
 Belts are as beautiful as water is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.310
 We really like to leave my side 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.720
 of course I can say management 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.509
 we need but I'm sure that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.250
 give him the opportunity for a rematch 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.720
 whoever is given in my opinion 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.329
 because I can do that better in any case 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.130
 and I want to say it very briefly 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.590
 say approval here in stuttgart as 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.329
 There were more bathing people than there were in the room 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.829
 Herbrand are of course everyone has 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.329
 seen so hammer mood was the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.799
 mood the hall has got used to the air 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.150
 So has the brand that was wonderful, the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.939
 was a lot of fun for her 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.799
 whole boys here in stuttgart resp 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.450
 rather come from the grass anteroom 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.149
 stuttgart room and my hometown 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.130
 from ellwangen am so has a lot 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.360
 would have fun made my depots up 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.799
 many see a blatant 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.770
 performance increase in you still mine 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.960
 fight what did the stickers teach 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.110
 what you did not have before , that's me 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.280
 Try my relatively passive style 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.409
 I do I had but it is too 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.629
 little so you have seen if you have him 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.530
 then do not win then it will be 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.360
 just now 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.370
 it could have been by me from other 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.800
 that was a really close fight and out 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.480
 this reason i have passive style but 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.740
 hard as a stick but if you through the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.020
 complete goal that somehow not 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.640
 then knock out opponents knock out 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.340
 is just about to point now 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.410
 just and accordingly he so if you 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.060
 asked what was happening in munich 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.010
 currently over or more long until it has 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.430
 activating him to passivity 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.190
 become 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.510
 march have found before after again 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.709
 Thailand to go to training camp 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.450
 of course, after no later than 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.060
 the next fight in the summer 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:51.209
 will be held on 7 6 in munich too 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:53.340
 and explain why I was before 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.420
 said quite easily and indeed it 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.190
 this is my 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.290
 Favorite book written by the movies 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.850
 that means in English the way of the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.650
 peaceful warrior the vaart is like 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.440
 Concrete is also a bit mine 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.959
 message or the center of my team if 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.310
 he looks at the t-shirt here from the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.100
 just to 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.860
 this is our fair that's my t 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.049
 shirt my fight so if the book 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.790
 interested in experience of pepper sprays 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.400
 the book is actually everything in it 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.079
 the people need to know over the live call 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.989
 I'm always in a good mood once 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.250
 cranky things are not me 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.400
 fallen and now experience for example 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.650
 scheine queried who else 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.590
 I am located on the sunny side of the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.940
 life has become big 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.700
 So put the book then I understand 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.010
 that mine and so I am right how are you 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.109
 Alright, it's okay now 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.820
 Jesus in the ring then you are in one 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.470
 other mood than no not at all 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.269
 actually because you make a ring 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.709
 nothing more than doping outside so 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.630
 Your personality will be exactly the same 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.040
 just fight that's just in the case 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.299
 your job or your passion or 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.430
 besides whatever but the 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.959
 personality does not change 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.040
 and which man outside the ring 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.690
 are you really the human being inside 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.410
 of the dark it looks different though 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.600
 but think the inner attitude yourself 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.000
 the people see the other two yes 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.280
 So that's what I want you to see 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.940
 because it is there is nothing played that 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.640
 is authentic 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.329
 that's why it even worked for me 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.699
 do not buy 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.000
 you just look 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.000
 thank you for the interview
