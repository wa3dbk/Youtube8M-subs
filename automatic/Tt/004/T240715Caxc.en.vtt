00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.299
 Hello and welcome to a new video. 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.830
 In this video, this is the sixth time around 10 facts about Apple, which you determined 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.019
 did not know yet. 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.240
 Here we go! 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.470
 Fact # 1: iTunes against Nuclear Weapons If you own an Apple product, you use 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.470
 sure iTunes. 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.330
 And of course you then have also agreed to the terms of use. 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.250
 These are, among other things, that you iTunes not to the development, the design, 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.300
 for the production or production of nuclear weapons, missiles and chemical or biological weapons 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 may. 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.450
 Fact No. 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 2: Why Apple's "Apple" So Jobs and Wozniak a name for their 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 newly founded company searched, they came across "Apple". 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.280
 Steve Jobs came up with it because he had previously worked on an apple orchard 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.399
 and besides, he liked the shape and an apple stood for a healthy and good one 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.399
 Content. 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.399
 Fact No. 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.480
 2: The bite in the apple Where we are at Apple in general: 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.579
 Did you know that the bite in the Apple logo has no deeper background? 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.969
 Logically, Apple's logo had to be an apple. 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.060
 Now, a design agency Jobs presented 2 designs. 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.579
 A bitten and a normal apple. 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.329
 But since the normal reminded too much of a cherry, Steve Jobs pulled the bite 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:19.329
 in front. 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.329
 Fact No. 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.069
 4: Origin of the "i" Here too had jobs, as in the previous one 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:25.749
 Fact, no deeper background. 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:30.340
 The only requirement for the name of the first iMac was that the Macintosh or 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.560
 Mac should be included in the name. 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.889
 In the middle of a series of suggested names, "iMac" was hidden, but Jobs did not 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:39.889
 liked. 

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:42.709
 However, this name was then chosen on explicit advice. 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.770
 This decision soon showed its consequences: the music player became "iPod", 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.130
 the media manager "iTunes", the phone "iPhone" and the tablet "iPad" 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.130
 gennant. 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 Fact # 5: Hidden Signatures Inside the first Macs was for those who 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.119
 Unscrew your Mac hiding a little surprise. 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.450
 On the inside of the case were signatures of eg 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.820
 Steve Jobs and the original Mac designers visible. 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.019
 Besides, there was a human on the board who, by the way, was Mr. 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.379
 Macintosh means and according to jobs in every Mac lives. 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.500
 Fact # 6: iPads on the toilet Jobs was initially very confident that tablet computers 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.280
 could have only one sense: surfing the toilet. 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.849
 However, he does not seem to be quite right about that since Apple started the 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.300
 iPad device over 240 million 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.650
 Sold copies. 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.650
 But if you look at so many accessories, then you could almost think that 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.730
 Steve Jobs was right with his statement. 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.490
 Fact No. 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.439
 7: Employees Did you know how many employees Apple employs? 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.769
 Currently there are around 93,000! 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.880
 Incidentally, 50% of these 93,000, ie 46,500 employees, are in retail, ie in an Apple 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.400
 Store and take care of sales, consulting and co. 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.830
 Fact No. 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.990
 8: Spreading iOS After the launch of iOS 7, it was already after 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.819
 15 days about 55% of all devices installed. 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.909
 The situation was different with iOS 8: Also after 15 days only 35% were updated. 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.430
 In my opinion, this is because only iOS 7 makes such a big difference, with new design 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.439
 and many new features, compared to the previous version made. iOS 8 has indeed 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.549
 also some news, but not quite as much and not as outstanding as the 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:38.739
 previous update. 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.260
 Fact No. 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.180
 9: Apple's Educational Discount If you are student, student or teacher 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.989
 you can buy with a discount at Apple and really save money. 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.150
 With a Mac there are up to 200 €. 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.780
 The thing is funny only if the discount, well, very low. 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.930
 With the new iPhone 6, the savings compared to the normal price is exactly one 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.930
 Cent. 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.620
 With something like that, I'm just wondering what Apple thought. 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.019
 Fact No. 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.519
 10: Apple's surprise bag Yes, there really is a surprise bag 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.769
 from directly Apple. 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:20.690
 For 35,000 yen, the equivalent of about 240 €, it is exclusively in Japanese Apple stores 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.690
 to buy. 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.440
 These then contain things, such as 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.400
 Bags, headphones, speakers, battery packs, cases and much more. 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.470
 But of course Apple's own products. 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.500
 If you're lucky, you can look forward to a MacBook Air. 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.250
 And all for only 240 ¬, but unfortunately only in Japan. 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.250
 Too bad. 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.040
 What do you actually think about these facts, which surprised and knew you? 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.040
 you already? 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.090
