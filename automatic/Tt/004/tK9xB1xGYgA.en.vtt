00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.160 
can take five to eight weeks I actually
have<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.400> technology<00:02:08.030> tried<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.570> me<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.110> I

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
have the technology tried on me and I

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.350 
have the technology tried on me and I
kept<00:02:09.410> thinking<00:02:09.590> hmm<00:02:10.340> not<00:02:10.610> working<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:11.300> not

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
kept thinking hmm not working it's not

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.000 
kept thinking hmm not working it's not
working<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.110> wondered<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.680> really

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
working and I wondered is it really

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.590 
working and I wondered is it really
going<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.220> work<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.730> then<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:13.970> course<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.360> did

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
going to work and then of course it did

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.540 
going to work and then of course it did
and<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.989> was<00:02:15.020> very<00:02:15.200> pleased<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.920> know<00:02:16.010> your<00:02:16.340> fat

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
and I was very pleased I know your fat

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.210 
and I was very pleased I know your fat
is<00:02:16.730> being<00:02:16.970> frozen<00:02:17.360> does<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.290> feel<00:02:18.620> like<00:02:18.980> you

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
is being frozen does it feel like you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.310 
is being frozen does it feel like you
have<00:02:19.340> some<00:02:19.580> gigantic<00:02:19.880> ice<00:02:20.209> pack<00:02:20.630> for<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:21.230> know

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
have some gigantic ice pack for you know

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.170 
have some gigantic ice pack for you know
you<00:02:21.380> don't<00:02:21.680> feel<00:02:21.739> any<00:02:21.980> cold<00:02:22.250> whatsoever<00:02:22.730> so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
you don't feel any cold whatsoever so

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.960 
you don't feel any cold whatsoever so
easy<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.350> procedures<00:02:25.010> not<00:02:25.310> for<00:02:25.610> everyone

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
easy but the procedures not for everyone

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.170 
easy but the procedures not for everyone
we<00:02:26.600> speak<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.170> our<00:02:27.290> patients<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.550> are<00:02:28.730> very

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
we speak to our patients we are very

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.229 
we speak to our patients we are very
clear<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.810> tell<00:02:30.140> them<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:31.340> if<00:02:31.760> they're

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
clear to tell them that if they're

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.810 
clear to tell them that if they're
eating<00:02:32.750> 4,000<00:02:33.500> calories<00:02:33.530> are<00:02:34.100> 10,000

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
eating 4,000 calories are 10,000

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.210 
eating 4,000 calories are 10,000
calories<00:02:35.330> they<00:02:35.540> can<00:02:35.870> continue<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:37.010> this

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
calories they can continue that so this

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.610 
calories they can continue that so this
is<00:02:37.250> not<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> license<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.690> eat<00:02:38.989> as<00:02:39.170> much<00:02:39.380> as<00:02:39.440> you

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620
