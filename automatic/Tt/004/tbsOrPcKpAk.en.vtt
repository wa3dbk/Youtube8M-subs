we're not addressing the underlying

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.790 
we're not addressing the underlying

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
problem how do we know that we're

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.440 
problem how do we know that we're
actually<00:03:05.010> doing<00:03:05.520> everything<00:03:05.910> we<00:03:06.030> need<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:06.300> do

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
actually doing everything we need to do

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.930 
actually doing everything we need to do
well<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.200> would<00:03:07.560> suggest<00:03:07.740> that's<00:03:08.100> impossible

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
well I would suggest that's impossible

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.720 
well I would suggest that's impossible
to<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:10.310> using<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.370> band-aid

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
to know that so using a band-aid

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.670 
to know that so using a band-aid
approach<00:03:11.880> not<00:03:12.330> only<00:03:12.750> doesn't<00:03:13.050> correct<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
approach not only doesn't correct the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.770 
approach not only doesn't correct the
underlying<00:03:14.070> problem<00:03:14.640> but<00:03:15.210> it<00:03:15.300> actually

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
underlying problem but it actually

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.410 
underlying problem but it actually
creates<00:03:16.260> issues<00:03:16.710> when<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:17.700> give<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.120> body<00:03:18.270> a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
creates issues when you give the body a

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.840 
creates issues when you give the body a
crutch<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:19.020> any<00:03:19.260> kind<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:20.220> will<00:03:20.430> become

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
crutch of any kind it will become

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.790 
crutch of any kind it will become
dependent<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:22.170> you're<00:03:22.470> taking
