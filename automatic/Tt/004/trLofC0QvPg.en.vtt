00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.570
 information concerning in peace 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.060
 accessory like that but more for 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.670
 generally tell you about my channel 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 what you will do in the future and how you are doing 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.880
 proceeding to it first of all I want 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 thank you for the 30 thousand subscribers who 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.560
 now I miss a hundred c150 se 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.910
 therefore I should not be mistaken 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.470
 reach the 30,000 mark 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.880
 subscribers and I want to apologize first 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.320
 if a few videos are coming out in this one 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.440
 period however I will talk to you with 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.930
 calm so week ago I was in 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.470
 vacation so I uploaded a series in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.420
 live a week ago echoes a live series 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.950
 and on bari I apologize if the last episode 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.040
 it has been a bit like that with so many times 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.900
 earth, however, as I said after an hour 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.820
 and a half that I was recording live 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.660
 with a cap on his head a bonnet the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.460
 neck with microphone is computer for 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.559
 xbox television the dictator everything 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.270
 lit in the room with a temperature 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.520
 really high at four in the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.160
 afternoon was really difficult 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.960
 be able to be pretty e 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.280
 bright and active throughout 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 course of the live then the last episode 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 he had left a bit so it was here I didn't see 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.030
 time to finish because I was dying from 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.230
 hot anyway afterwards I had to leave 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.880
 peace to me however I see that the first ones there 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.820
 did you appreciate me apologize again if 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.860
 the last state a little so and I hope that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.690
 still it has not been such a thing 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.940
 tragic is that after a video of peace 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.620
 we have achieved that I like the 1300s 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.659
 so welcome 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.180
 and now leaving a few videos because 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.430
 because in this period we say not there 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.560
 there are so many new things to talk about 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.700
 that is, I usually speak and talk about 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.800
 information about a video game 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 when it was a peace or of the 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.890
 information about a video game that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 has yet to come out since it is 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.130
 especially call of duty 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.360
 I should talk about call of duty gozzi 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.530
 problem that does not come out new 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.440
 information of the most goce 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.080
 will have announced the free map 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.750
 fall for those who pre-order is this game 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.700
 but they didn't say anything in the picture 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.200
 new gameplay then before speaking 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.030
 of call of duty ghost appearance that 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.890
 new trailers are shown 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.310
 these new gameplay these trailers 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.579
 gameplay 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.889
 I think they are shown during 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.270
 colony gamescom ie towards the middle 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.650
 August then 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.300
 time two weeks should come out 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.950
 new gameplay and so I'll have some 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.320
 video to do something to be treated 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.080
 you will say why then you do not get to 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.620
 do live blogs 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.180
 if you have no ideas on what to do here is why 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.270
 I don't do the live I'll explain it to you right away 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.090
 as you well know there are so many 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.700
 youtuber that live with while we are 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.570
 in three they play comment and are also 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.520
 good entertain here I am not 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.110
 brought to entertain or rather I can 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.080
 also try to do live comments 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.490
 the problem that if I point the fun 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.980
 it will be quite difficult because when 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.690
 I play everywhere 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.240
 I'm distracted by the gameplay mi 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.880
 I focus more on the game than on that one 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.920
 I say so there are so many silent pauses 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.020
 of silence so I can't talk 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.610
 for a long time entertain you and anyway does a 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.440
 have a little fun you have seen with the ai 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.450
 fortunately there were four of us and 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.080
 so a little bit all the others 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.670
 they talked and yet could start 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.680
 make some life comments about these 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.040
 wide while if made on call of duty 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.170
 I think I do something about it 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.180
 who actively practice the mode 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.230
 which I like better even if we say that 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.260
 these days there are really no more 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.959
 playing and then we leave a good one 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.940
 question mark is not just a blog 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.080
 I don't have a video camera 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.490
 blog I made I was in 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.200
 past camera from the enemy then 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.780
 not good that I ask all 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.170
 weeks to lend me his 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.620
 video camera 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.680
 however I think I am doing some kind of faq 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.480
 time a kind of fuck you time is 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.220
 however where they respond to yours 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.180
 questions so if you have any questions 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.160
 to do me 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.990
 for this possible faq timing life 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.700
 write in the comments below 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.170
 I will take some from here now not 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.490
 I promise you nothing I don't even know when 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.810
 I will do it maybe it will take two weeks 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.480
 two three weeks 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.270
 however I also have to see the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.660
 availability of these media accessories 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:16.650
 that will lend me and for now nothing then 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.060
 summer is progressing is going 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.160
 my opinion too fast 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.980
 so I don't have to think about school 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.060
 because then I am the realization and I hope that 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.480
 anyway be passing by the springs 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.820
 holidays 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.800
 this fall starting in September 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.690
 so many new games will come out 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.790
 including the new consoles I don't have 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.350
 still chosen which console to take 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.320
 also because it has an average of no 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.750
 take nothing if I explain myself better 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.130
 I don't feel like spending 400 euros to get 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.020
 a console when I still a 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.760
 pretty decent computer power 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.130
 use to play the only thing that 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.050
 on computers later there are fewer people 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.760
 compared with however only the majority 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.970
 part of youtube is on me console 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.310
 like to get in touch with the rest 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.370
 of youtube and therefore I will evaluate some 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.230
 choice to make I must say that both are 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.110
 quite valid in my opinion certainly 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.910
 xbox one later it will be fixed a little 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.650
 their game policies used in this way 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.930
 so they eliminated some 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.760
 restrictions is a little more work 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.940
 there are four complexes , however, and 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.490
 I will have to reflect and study to mature 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.110
 this choice then inserting the 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.120
 new games when these come out 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.130
 I think I will try new games 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.070
 I will not only do more goals than duty but 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.170
 I will try to expand a little the range of 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.470
 games that I want that I will bring you 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.350
 and maybe I thought I would take 5 because 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.670
 anyway something that is always me 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.410
 also liked out of four I never have 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.630
 played a lot played anyway 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.950
 stress and I saw cut 5 a bit 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.600
 made me want to take it then 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.980
 other games will come out I can't tell you 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.760
 which ones will probably take 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.910
 battlefield 3 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.110
 here it is tt ghost and gt with shots of yours 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.080
 also a question mark 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.140
 we will see why lately I am cod 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.150
 tiring and then I will evaluate some who 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.930
 series do I will try not to do 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.910
 only cod 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.310
 it is a bit true also because after the 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.250
 public looking at queues is restricted 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.630
 therefore the more varied the more there is the 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.970
 opportunity to please everyone 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.110
 show everyone what they want 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.220
 to see 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.190
 so guys with this video 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.690
 update I leave you hope the 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.520

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.040
 answered some of your questions 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.170
 that is why for a few videos why not 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.490
 do this because you don't do that other me 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.949

 today is a pretty cool day 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.590
