00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970 

I<00:00:03.319> think<00:00:04.319> it's<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:05.299> nice<00:00:06.470> way<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.500> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
I think it's the nice way that the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.070 
I think it's the nice way that the
university<00:00:08.400> has<00:00:08.820> put<00:00:09.030> itself<00:00:09.269> together<00:00:09.510> from

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
university has put itself together from

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.480 
university has put itself together from
a<00:00:10.230> perspective<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:11.070> very<00:00:12.030> intimate<00:00:12.480> classes

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
a perspective of very intimate classes

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.490 
a perspective of very intimate classes
good<00:00:14.490> support<00:00:15.000> services<00:00:15.540> for<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> students

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
good support services for the students

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.519 
good support services for the students
and<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.820> very<00:00:18.060> nice<00:00:18.270> area<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:18.990> students<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and a very nice area for the students to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.910 
and a very nice area for the students to
break<00:00:19.740> out<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.660> mingle<00:00:21.660> together<00:00:22.170> as<00:00:22.470> well<00:00:22.710> as

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.840 
having problems in particularly in the
numerically<00:01:39.390> focused<00:01:40.280> classes<00:01:41.280> since<00:01:41.640> I'm<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
numerically focused classes since I'm a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.420

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.050 

I<00:01:51.010> think<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.100> coolest<00:01:52.340> thing<00:01:52.460> about<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.880> job

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
I think the coolest thing about the job

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.540 
I think the coolest thing about the job
is<00:01:53.120> working<00:01:53.630> with<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.900> students<00:01:54.320> you've<00:01:55.310> got

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
is working with the students you've got

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.280 
is working with the students you've got
to<00:01:55.700> look<00:01:55.850> at<00:01:56.060> me<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.360> little<00:01:56.780> bit<00:01:56.900> different

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
to look at me a little bit different

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.710 
to look at me a little bit different
than<00:01:57.590> other<00:01:57.800> faculty<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.730> distance<00:01:59.210> in<00:01:59.420> age

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
than other faculty the distance in age

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.470 
than other faculty the distance in age
between<00:02:00.500> me<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.520> students<00:02:01.910> is<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> lot

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
between me and the students is a lot

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.800 
between me and the students is a lot
bigger<00:02:03.380> than<00:02:03.590> for<00:02:04.100> most<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.430> our<00:02:04.550> faculty<00:02:04.820> so

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
bigger than for most of our faculty so

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.560 
bigger than for most of our faculty so
what<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.110> students<00:02:06.500> continue<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.250> do<00:02:07.400> in<00:02:07.880> my

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
what the students continue to do in my

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.290 
today just didn't exist so my learning
process<00:02:32.750> from<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.380> students<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.760> huge

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
process from the students is huge

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.510

compared<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.900> many<00:02:36.200> people<00:02:39.370> well<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.430> think

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
compared to many people well I think

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.100 
compared to many people well I think
there<00:02:40.790> are<00:02:40.820> a<00:02:40.910> lot<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.150> different<00:02:41.630> things<00:02:41.810> but

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
there are a lot of different things but

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.820 
there are a lot of different things but
I<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:43.520> look<00:02:44.000> at<00:02:44.120> things<00:02:44.360> from<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.230> perspective

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
I I look at things from the perspective

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.830 
I I look at things from the perspective
of<00:02:45.980> how<00:02:46.220> do<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.370> just<00:02:46.640> get<00:02:46.880> away<00:02:47.210> by<00:02:47.540> still

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
of how do you just get away by still

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.930 
of how do you just get away by still
being<00:02:48.110> in<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.380> city<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.890> most<00:02:49.460> people<00:02:49.760> would

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
being in the city and most people would

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.570 
being in the city and most people would
say<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.510> park<00:02:50.780> along<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.200> alster<00:02:51.830> would<00:02:52.400> be

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
say the park along the alster would be

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.490 
say the park along the alster would be
where<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.820> would<00:02:52.940> go<00:02:53.240> but<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.810> would<00:02:53.930> recommend

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
where you would go but I would recommend

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.350 
where you would go but I would recommend

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360
