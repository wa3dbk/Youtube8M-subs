00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 the winding mechanism of a watch 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.480
 and the transmission of a car photo 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 to call a gear system that's 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.660
 a mechanism consisting of two wheels 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.969
 teeth that train each other 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 to transmit power in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.800
 continuous gear combination of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.539
 various diameter and flow on the speed 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.539
 and the rotational force 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.320
 this factory makes gears 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.520
 intended for the transmission of machines 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.680
 industrial production begins 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.630
 with a big round bar of stainless steel 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.700
 which contains a certain amount of 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.910
 carbon to make the metal even more 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.910
 robust 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 an automated band saw cuts a 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.140
 piece of the right thickness for the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.140
 size of the gear manufacture 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:01:00.969
 this is one of the cuts this one is placed 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.920
 on a computerized tour while he 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.310
 turns a turret including several 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.960
 fuel tools comes into play one 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.280
 after another the tools the factory 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:28.810
 cutting to give it a shape 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:30.280
 specifies a rain of fluids 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.560
 cooling avoids overheating 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.780
 while standards are reactive 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.170
 he drills a hole to the center of the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.630
 cuts the last tool traces a 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.880
 groove at the front thereby removing a 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.200
 a little more metal you lighten the weight of 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.270
 the piece a strawberry controlled by 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.500
 personal computer in the holes that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.299
 let the fluid flow 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.080
 lubrication while the gear 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.080
 work 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.320
 these holes also lightens the weight of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.320
 gear 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:15.220
 the name of the company and the number of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:17.080
 the piece are engraved on the decor at 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.600
 using a coated circular knife 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.790
 of titanium a carving machine 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.180
 the inner teeth the one lining the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.180
 central hole 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.500
 the other components of the machine 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.130
 maintain the pace of the movement of 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.870
 circular knife the number of teeth and 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.670
 their size varies from gear to 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.770
 the other so for each model 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.780
 factory must install a precise knife 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:46.000
 on the machine the outer teeth are 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.150
 cut by a computerized machine equipped 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.130
 a strawberry sea â€‹â€‹cutting turn 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.130
 against the tool while he profile 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.450
 if the cutter cut the tooth at once 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.459
 his knife it's true I 'll be there 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.900
 cuts therefore remain turned while 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.550
 that the strawberry lanta there a little more to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.300
 every turn until the teeth is 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.300
 the right depth 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.260
 the wheel is then subjected to a 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.370
 computerized inspection a palace probe 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.690
 the entire surface including each tooth 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.239
 she sends the data to a computer 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.489
 who analyzes the dimensions and confirm 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.030
 they meet the specifications 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.950
 of engineering the wheels that succeeds this 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.750
 quality control inspection are going 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.769
 baked for a heat treatment that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.769
 strengthens the steel 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.000
 when the oven reach some 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.099
 temperatures it injects carbon the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.129
 pieces absorb it and steel strengthen 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.780
 even more afterwards the metal 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.780
 is soaked in oil what it lasts 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.400
 if the heat treatment has 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.390
 the defect to deform a little 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.190
 steel 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.989
 chacko goes into a grinding machine 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.850
 computerized system that gives him 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:28.820
 very precise dimensions so that 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:30.320
 levels adjusts perfectly this 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.150
 factory makes gears of 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.940
 various sizes and various materials 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.789
 in addition to steel she makes 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.660
 gears in aluminum island the times 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:44.210
 and stainless steel certainly a gear 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.800
 have straight teeth other helical 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.419
 which attenuates the noise when it turns 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.460
 the gears are essential to 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.750
 many mechanisms, be they 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.750
 watches or heavy machinery 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.310
 and
