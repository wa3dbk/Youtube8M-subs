00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
happens when this machine runs up and

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.729 
happens when this machine runs up and
down<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.270> lanes<00:00:39.480> we've<00:00:40.110> seen<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.470> so<00:00:40.680> many

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
down the lanes we've seen it so many

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.029 
down the lanes we've seen it so many

starts<00:01:13.829> and<00:01:14.040> stops<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.329> also<00:01:15.570> control

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
starts and stops on and we also control

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
starts and stops on and we also control
how<00:01:16.259> many<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.619> these<00:01:16.710> lines<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.220> all<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.520> we

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
how many of these lines of all that we

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.330 
how many of these lines of all that we
put<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:18.420> forward<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> reverse<00:01:19.979> as

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
put going forward and in the reverse as

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.560 
put going forward and in the reverse as
you<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.579> see<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.119> machine<00:01:21.540> is

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you can see right now the machine is

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.770 
you can see right now the machine is
actually<00:01:21.930> cleaning<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.180> it's<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.360> forward

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
actually cleaning as it's going forward

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
actually cleaning as it's going forward
and<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.079> oiling<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.799> forward<00:01:26.130> right

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and it's oiling going forward right

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
and it's oiling going forward right
behind<00:01:26.579> it<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.090> basically<00:01:27.329> you<00:01:27.600> give<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.869> got

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
behind it so basically you give you got

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.760 
behind it so basically you give you got
a<00:01:28.049> shoe<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:29.390> cushion<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.750> applying<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
a shoe a cushion or that's applying the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
a shoe a cushion or that's applying the
condition<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.460> cleaner<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.600> front<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
condition the cleaner right in front and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
condition the cleaner right in front and
then<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.290> basically<00:01:34.439> cleaning<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.220> all<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
then it's basically cleaning up all the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.889 
then it's basically cleaning up all the
oil<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.210> behind<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.630> it's

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
oil and then right behind it it's

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.990 
oil and then right behind it it's
applying<00:01:37.229> fresh<00:01:37.530> oil<00:01:37.740> now<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.729> back

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
applying fresh oil now on the way back

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
applying fresh oil now on the way back
out<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> pit<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.860> just

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
out of the pit it's going to be just

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.620 
out of the pit it's going to be just
oiling<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:41.820> back<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> said

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
oiling on the way back and like I said

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.209 
oiling on the way back and like I said
and<00:01:42.750> that's<00:01:42.810> basically<00:01:43.140> how<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.350> design

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
and that's basically how we design

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.469 
and that's basically how we design
patterns<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:44.969> particular<00:01:45.119> Lane

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
patterns with this particular Lane

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.230 
patterns with this particular Lane
machine<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.079> combination<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.520> control

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
machine is that combination of control

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.450 
machine is that combination of control
between<00:01:48.420> where<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.530> start<00:01:49.799> those<00:01:49.920> lines<00:01:50.250> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
between where we start those lines of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.130 
between where we start those lines of
oil<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> also<00:01:51.299> how<00:01:51.450> many<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.930> apply

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
oil and also how many that we apply

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.230 
oil and also how many that we apply
going<00:01:52.500> forward<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.549> reverse<00:01:53.640> combine

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
going forward and the reverse combine

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.480 
going forward and the reverse combine
that<00:01:54.390> also<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.320> distance<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.369> those

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that also with with distance and those

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.560 
that also with with distance and those
are<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.820> few<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> things<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.479> we

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
are just a few of the things that we

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
are just a few of the things that we
