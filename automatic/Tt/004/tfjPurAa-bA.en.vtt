recently<00:03:02.970> saw<00:03:03.420> some<00:03:03.660> pictures<00:03:03.870> from<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.410> set

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
recently saw some pictures from the set

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.200 
recently saw some pictures from the set
of<00:03:04.740> season<00:03:05.100> 5<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.490> she's<00:03:05.760> wearing<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> dress

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
of season 5 and she's wearing a dress

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.750 
of season 5 and she's wearing a dress
very<00:03:06.660> similar<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.500> one<00:03:07.710> so<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.430> makes<00:03:08.580> me

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
very similar to this one so it makes me

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.100 
very similar to this one so it makes me
think<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.240> is<00:03:09.300> where<00:03:09.570> her<00:03:09.720> style<00:03:10.020> is

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
think that this is where her style is

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.450 
think that this is where her style is
