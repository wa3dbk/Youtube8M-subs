00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
just pretty pretty genius like it was a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.459 
just pretty pretty genius like it was a
great<00:01:59.729> idea<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.329> they<00:02:00.810> came<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.290> this

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
great idea that they came up with this

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.990 
great idea that they came up with this
on<00:02:01.710> these<00:02:02.579> shoes<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.990> see<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:05.000> wonder

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
on these shoes you can see the I wonder

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.050 
on these shoes you can see the I wonder
why<00:02:06.180> they<00:02:06.360> did<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> black<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:08.310> midsole

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
why they did just the black like midsole

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.150 
why they did just the black like midsole
area<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:09.569> whatever<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.050> guess<00:02:10.619> no<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.009> know

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
area or whatever I guess no you know

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.850 
area or whatever I guess no you know
what<00:02:11.390> that's<00:02:12.390> obviously<00:02:12.870> representative<00:02:13.650> of

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
what that's obviously representative of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.430 
what that's obviously representative of
tire<00:02:14.100> tread<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.210> that's<00:02:15.750> very<00:02:15.930> fitting<00:02:16.350> I

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
tire tread so that's very fitting I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.750 
tire tread so that's very fitting I
don't<00:02:16.590> know<00:02:16.650> why<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.640> said<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:20.670> know

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
don't know why I I said that you know

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.430 
don't know why I I said that you know
I'm<00:02:20.850> again<00:02:21.240> I'm<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.630> sneaker<00:02:21.930> enthusiast

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
I'm not a know-it-all I don't know

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.510 
I'm not a know-it-all I don't know
everything<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.960> uh<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.440> definitely<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.370> your

now<00:02:27.240> one<00:02:27.390> thing<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.600> have<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.720> say<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.960> can<00:02:28.080> see

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
now one thing I have to say you can see

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.650 
now one thing I have to say you can see
the<00:02:28.320> crease<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.070> weird<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:30.150> low<00:02:30.390> quality

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the crease the weird like low quality

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.270 
the crease the weird like low quality
creasing<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.320> these<00:02:31.440> ones<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:31.800> here<00:02:31.830> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
creasing of these ones right here and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.250 
creasing of these ones right here and
that<00:02:32.790> was<00:02:33.030> unfortunate<00:02:33.690> when<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.840> saw<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.170> I

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that was unfortunate when I saw that I

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.290 
that was unfortunate when I saw that I
was<00:02:34.350> like<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:35.220> was<00:02:35.640> kind<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.820> bummed<00:02:36.060> because

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
was like I was kind of bummed because

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.320 
was like I was kind of bummed because
that's<00:02:37.230> was<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> way<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.910> these<00:02:39.060> ones

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
that's was just the way that these ones

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.090 
that's was just the way that these ones
actually<00:02:39.540> ended<00:02:40.050> up<00:02:40.170> coming<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.800> mean<00:02:40.950> what

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
actually ended up coming and I mean what

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.830 
actually ended up coming and I mean what
can<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:41.820> feel<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.240> right<00:02:42.420> here

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
can I do it you can feel it right here

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.860 
can I do it you can feel it right here
it's<00:02:43.080> definitely<00:02:43.440> off<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.860> definitely<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
it's definitely off it's definitely a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.660 
it's definitely off it's definitely a
manufacturing<00:02:45.870> problem<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.860> don't<00:02:47.610> know

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
manufacturing problem but I don't know

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.890 
manufacturing problem but I don't know
that's<00:02:48.000> probably<00:02:48.510> something<00:02:48.750> for<00:02:48.840> another

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that's probably something for another

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.460 
that's probably something for another
video<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:50.480> yeah<00:02:51.480> maybe<00:02:51.959> I'll<00:02:52.110> touch<00:02:52.290> up
