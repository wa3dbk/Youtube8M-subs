00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.660 
I generally started using what's called
the<00:02:08.030> time<00:02:08.179> what<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.259> does<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:09.890> gives<00:02:10.310> you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
the time what that does is it gives you

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.020 
the time what that does is it gives you
a<00:02:10.970> little<00:02:11.150> more<00:02:11.239> control<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.870> changes<00:02:12.260> your

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
a little more control it changes your

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.590 
a little more control it changes your
right<00:02:14.030> thumbstick

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
right thumbstick

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.309 
right thumbstick
button<00:02:15.470> as<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.970> switch<00:02:16.970> swaps<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:18.170> make

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
button as a switch swaps that to make

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.199 
button as a switch swaps that to make
you<00:02:18.470> approach<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.549> prone<00:02:19.760> with<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.030> rather

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
you approach in the prone with it rather

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.520 
you approach in the prone with it rather
than<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.720> think<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.019> right<00:02:21.200> button

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
than the I think it's a right button

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.110 
than the I think it's a right button
wherever<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.370> square<00:02:22.640> button<00:02:22.880> or<00:02:22.940> whatever

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
wherever that square button or whatever

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.630 
wherever that square button or whatever
is<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.299> ps4<00:02:23.569> so<00:02:24.290> now<00:02:24.860> what<00:02:25.280> does<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.400> do

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
is on the ps4 so now what does that do

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.699 
is on the ps4 so now what does that do
that<00:02:25.819> just<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.239> just<00:02:26.299> allows<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.260> control

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
that just it just allows you to control

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.309 
that just it just allows you to control
your<00:02:27.830> movements<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> lot<00:02:28.280> more<00:02:28.459> smoothly

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
your movements a lot more smoothly

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.930 
your movements a lot more smoothly
say<00:02:30.890> we're<00:02:31.040> suppose<00:02:31.250> watch<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.580> movement

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
say we're suppose watch this movement

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.820 
say we're suppose watch this movement
here<00:02:32.060> alright<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.870> means<00:02:33.080> get<00:02:33.260> down<00:02:33.470> do<00:02:33.680> like<00:02:33.799> a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
here alright it means get down do like a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.050 
here alright it means get down do like a
little<00:02:34.099> stick<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.340> move<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.730> come<00:02:34.819> up<00:02:34.940> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
little stick and move and come up and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.840 
little stick and move and come up and
shoot<00:02:35.239> them<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.049> I<00:02:36.080> need<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:36.890> go<00:02:37.010> prone<00:02:37.280> pop<00:02:37.640> off

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
shoot them so I need to go prone pop off

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.849 
shoot them so I need to go prone pop off
the<00:02:38.810> reason<00:02:39.019> I'm<00:02:39.109> able<00:02:39.200> do<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.410> because<00:02:39.590> my

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
the reason I'm able do that because my

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.740 
the reason I'm able do that because my
thumb's<00:02:40.160> don't<00:02:40.430> ever<00:02:40.670> leave<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.420> thumb

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
thumb's don't ever leave the thumb

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.020 
thumb's don't ever leave the thumb
sticks<00:02:42.130> that<00:02:43.130> gives<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.370> greater<00:02:43.670> degree<00:02:44.000> of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
sticks that gives you greater degree of

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.590 
sticks that gives you greater degree of
control<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.720> movement<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.440> one<00:02:45.890> fluid<00:02:46.160> motion

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.210 

thumb<00:02:50.600> off<00:02:50.780> your<00:02:50.989> right<00:02:51.170> leg<00:02:51.530> put<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.040> body

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
thumb off your right leg put the body

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.910 
thumb off your right leg put the body
and<00:02:52.519> pop<00:02:52.670> back<00:02:52.819> up<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.329> then<00:02:53.930> plus<00:02:54.260> liking<00:02:54.650> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
and pop back up and then plus liking the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.979 
and pop back up and then plus liking the
aim<00:02:55.069> at<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.310> same<00:02:55.489> time<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.030> by<00:02:56.690> doing<00:02:56.750> that

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
aim at the same time so by doing that

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.479 
aim at the same time so by doing that
you<00:02:57.140> give<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.709> specter<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.100> degree<00:02:58.459> of

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
you give you the specter a degree of

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.440 
you give you the specter a degree of
accuracy<00:02:59.120> control<00:02:59.600> and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
accuracy control and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.360 
accuracy control and
but<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.080> course<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.440> lose<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.890> ability<00:03:01.920> to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
but of course you lose that ability to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.839 
but of course you lose that ability to
do<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.490> panic<00:03:02.819> knife<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:04.470> my<00:03:04.620> case<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.040> don't

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
do a panic knife and in my case I don't

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.120 
do a panic knife and in my case I don't
know<00:03:06.239> why<00:03:06.360> anyway<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.020> doesn't<00:03:07.950> really

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
know why anyway so I doesn't really

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.320 
know why anyway so I doesn't really
affect<00:03:08.370> me<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.550> much<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:08.940> if<00:03:09.060> you're<00:03:09.180> one

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
affect me that much but if you're one

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.880 
affect me that much but if you're one
that<00:03:09.360> kind<00:03:10.050> of<00:03:10.110> relies<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.319> a<00:03:10.470> quite<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.709> bit

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
that kind of relies on a quite a bit

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.550 
that kind of relies on a quite a bit
this<00:03:11.010> may<00:03:11.220> be<00:03:11.280> huge<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.989> I'm<00:03:13.170> gonna<00:03:13.260> give<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.470> a

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
this may be huge so I'm gonna give it a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.229
