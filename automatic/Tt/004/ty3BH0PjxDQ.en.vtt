them<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.250> we're<00:01:38.400> jumping<00:01:38.610> we

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
them to do but when we're jumping we

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.420 
them to do but when we're jumping we
know<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.540> can't<00:01:39.870> sit<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.830> our<00:01:41.040> horses

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430

you're just letting your skin touch the

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.650 
you're just letting your skin touch the
saddle<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.460> your<00:04:05.700> pelvis<00:04:06.210> bones<00:04:06.480> are

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
saddle and your pelvis bones are

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.720 
saddle and your pelvis bones are
actually<00:04:06.780> up<00:04:07.110> out<00:04:07.380> of<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.770> tack<00:04:08.010> itself<00:04:08.490> and

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
actually up out of the tack itself and

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.180 
actually up out of the tack itself and
that<00:04:09.390> would<00:04:09.510> be<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.660> half<00:04:10.050> seat<00:04:10.410> or<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.650> light

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.970 
that would be a half seat or a light
seat<00:04:11.520> so<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.270> would<00:04:12.540> use<00:04:12.570> a<00:04:12.930> half<00:04:13.440> seat<00:04:13.740> or<00:04:13.890> a

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
seat so you would use a half seat or a

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.590 
seat so you would use a half seat or a
light<00:04:14.250> seat<00:04:14.550> oftentimes<00:04:15.240> if<00:04:15.420> you're
