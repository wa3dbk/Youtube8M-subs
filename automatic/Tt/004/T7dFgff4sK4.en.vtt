00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
the bracket away we'll then see where

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.060 
the bracket away we'll then see where
we've<00:01:14.690> got<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:14.960> drill<00:01:15.140> our<00:01:15.289> seven<00:01:15.679> millimeter

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070

masonry<00:01:23.030> drill<00:01:23.180> into<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.049> drill<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.890> we're

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
masonry drill into the drill and we're

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.670 
masonry drill into the drill and we're
going<00:01:25.189> to<00:01:25.220> drill<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.520> hole<00:01:25.610> into<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:26.270> wall

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
going to drill a hole into the wall

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.740 
going to drill a hole into the wall
approximately<00:01:27.680> 40<00:01:28.100> millimeters<00:01:28.759> deep<00:01:29.000> here

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
approximately 40 millimeters deep here

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.469 
approximately 40 millimeters deep here
we<00:01:29.840> go<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:34.700> now<00:01:34.820> we've<00:01:34.970> drilled<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.299> hole

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
we go so now we've drilled the hole

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.569 
we go so now we've drilled the hole
we're<00:01:35.630> going<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.900> push<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.380> raw<00:01:37.159> plug<00:01:37.400> into

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
we're going to push the raw plug into

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:38.950 
we're going to push the raw plug into
the<00:01:37.759> hole<00:01:37.909> till<00:01:38.150> it's<00:01:38.299> flush<00:01:38.540> with<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.810> hole

the hole till it's flush with the hole

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.980 
the hole till it's flush with the hole
okay<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:39.860> we've<00:01:40.250> drilled<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.759> four<00:01:40.970> holes<00:01:41.720> and

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
okay so we've drilled the four holes and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.469 
okay so we've drilled the four holes and
put<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.229> raw<00:01:42.380> plugs<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.070> I've<00:01:43.729> fitted<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.160 
four screws into the raw plugs but
before<00:01:49.610> we<00:01:49.729> fully<00:01:49.880> tighten<00:01:50.390> I'm<00:01:50.750> just<00:01:50.990> going

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
before we fully tighten I'm just going

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.810 
before we fully tighten I'm just going
to<00:01:51.229> recheck<00:01:51.740> with<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.070> spirit<00:01:52.369> level<00:01:52.490> just<00:01:52.729> to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
to recheck with the spirit level just to

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.679 
to recheck with the spirit level just to
make<00:01:53.030> sure<00:01:53.060> it's<00:01:53.450> level<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.899> that<00:01:54.740> seems<00:01:55.040> fine

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
make sure it's level and that seems fine

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.389 
make sure it's level and that seems fine
so<00:01:56.689> now<00:01:56.869> I'm<00:01:56.960> going<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.290> fully<00:01:57.890> tighten<00:01:58.130> the

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
so now I'm going to fully tighten the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.100 
so now I'm going to fully tighten the
screws

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.530 

so<00:02:02.980> we<00:02:03.100> fitted<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.460> auto<00:02:03.700> reel<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.360> wall

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
so we fitted the auto reel to the wall

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.390 
so we fitted the auto reel to the wall
bracket<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.170> now<00:02:05.380> going<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.710> push<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.100> pivot

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
tube all the way through the auto reel

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.340 
tube all the way through the auto reel
and<00:02:09.250> through<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.610> wall<00:02:09.759> bracket<00:02:10.170> noting<00:02:11.170> that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
and through the wall bracket noting that

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.190 
and through the wall bracket noting that
the<00:02:11.770> park<00:02:12.490> point<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> male<00:02:13.360> part<00:02:13.690> point<00:02:14.020> is

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
the park point of the male part point is

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.140 
the park point of the male part point is
facing<00:02:14.680> towards<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.280> front<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> product

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
facing towards the front of the product

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.060 
facing towards the front of the product
and<00:02:16.390> we<00:02:16.930> just<00:02:17.110> pushed<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.500> pivot<00:02:17.890> tube

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
and we just pushed the pivot tube

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.200 
and we just pushed the pivot tube
straight<00:02:18.400> down<00:02:18.670> through<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.000> both<00:02:19.180> of

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
straight down through the both of

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.990 
straight down through the both of
products<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.430> next<00:02:21.610> thing<00:02:21.760> we're<00:02:21.880> going

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
products so the next thing we're going

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.480 
products so the next thing we're going
to<00:02:22.090> do<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.510> fit<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.110> water<00:02:23.350> inlet<00:02:23.800> hose<00:02:24.040> into

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
to do is fit the water inlet hose into

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.340 
to do is fit the water inlet hose into
the<00:02:24.610> reel<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.450> do<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:25.870> have<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.140> take

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
the reel and to do that we have to take

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.440 
the reel and to do that we have to take
out<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.800> wide<00:02:27.040> fitting<00:02:27.490> taking<00:02:28.210> out<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
out of this wide fitting taking out the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:43.770 
out of this wide fitting taking out the
two<00:02:28.630> screws<00:02:28.960> which<00:02:29.170> I'll<00:02:29.380> do<00:02:29.530> now<00:02:42.630> now<00:02:43.630> we've

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
two screws which I'll do now now we've

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.180 
two screws which I'll do now now we've
removed<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.170> two<00:02:44.380> screws<00:02:44.410> we<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:44.920> now<00:02:45.160> just

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
removed the two screws we can now just

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.240 
removed the two screws we can now just
pull<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.910> white<00:02:46.840> inlet<00:02:47.440> fitting<00:02:47.650> out<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.130> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
pull this white inlet fitting out of the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.890 
pull this white inlet fitting out of the
reel<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:49.300> so<00:02:49.860> what<00:02:50.860> we<00:02:50.980> have<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.220> do<00:02:51.370> now<00:02:51.580> is

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
reel like so what we have to do now is

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.900 
reel like so what we have to do now is
obtain<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.050> inlet<00:02:53.680> hose<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.280> push<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.730> up

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
obtain the inlet hose and push it up

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.150 
obtain the inlet hose and push it up
through<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:56.050> channel<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:56.920> comes

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
through this channel so that it comes

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.650 
through this channel so that it comes
out<00:02:57.340> into<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.730> center<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.240> rail<00:02:58.420> like

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
out into the center of the rail like

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.400 
out into the center of the rail like
that<00:02:59.040> pull<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.400> good<00:03:00.880> quantity<00:03:01.330> through<00:03:01.720> so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
that pull a good quantity through so

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.570 
that pull a good quantity through so
that<00:03:02.560> you've<00:03:02.650> got<00:03:02.680> plenty<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.160> room<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.430> work

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
that you've got plenty of room to work

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.600 
that you've got plenty of room to work
and<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.690> we<00:03:04.810> can<00:03:04.959> fit<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.980> white<00:03:06.190> Inlet

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
and then we can fit the white Inlet

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.229 
and then we can fit the white Inlet
molding<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.690> this<00:03:07.840> hose<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:10.000> slide

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
molding to this hose like so you slide

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.250 
molding to this hose like so you slide
the<00:03:10.390> little<00:03:10.510> gray<00:03:10.810> knot<00:03:11.050> down<00:03:12.930> push<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.110> hose

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the little gray knot down push the hose

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.630 
the little gray knot down push the hose
into<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.739> center<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.400> this<00:03:16.150> ring<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.630> claws

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
into the center of this ring of claws

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.729 
into the center of this ring of claws
pushing<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.760> firmly<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.810> twisting<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.530> hose

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
pushing it firmly and twisting the hose

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.759 
pushing it firmly and twisting the hose
so<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:21.550> it<00:03:21.760> goes<00:03:21.910> all<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.120> way<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:23.620> can

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
so that it goes all the way in we can

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.170 
so that it goes all the way in we can
then<00:03:23.950> tighten<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.930> nut<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.370> like<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:27.700> until

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
then tighten the nut on like so until

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.600 
then tighten the nut on like so until
it's<00:03:28.330> nice<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.570> tight

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.280 

we<00:03:34.610> can<00:03:34.760> then<00:03:34.879> refit<00:03:35.420> this<00:03:35.599> back<00:03:35.870> into<00:03:36.170> the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
we can then refit this back into the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.350 
we can then refit this back into the
center<00:03:36.650> where<00:03:36.769> we<00:03:36.890> got<00:03:37.069> it<00:03:37.220> from<00:03:37.250> or<00:03:38.030> pulling

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
center where we got it from or pulling

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.540 
center where we got it from or pulling
the<00:03:38.569> excess<00:03:38.959> O's

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
the excess O's

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.900 
the excess O's
out<00:03:40.550> through<00:03:40.879> the<00:03:41.030> reel<00:03:42.459> pushing<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.580> inlet

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
out through the reel pushing the inlet

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:57.210 
out through the reel pushing the inlet
molding<00:03:44.599> in<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.019> refitting<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.040> two<00:03:46.280> screws

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.350 

now<00:03:58.220> we've<00:03:58.370> fitted<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.730> end<00:03:58.849> that<00:03:59.000> will<00:03:59.150> just

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
now we've fitted the end that will just

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.600 
now we've fitted the end that will just
make<00:03:59.390> sure<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.799> fully<00:04:01.099> tight<00:04:01.400> by

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
make sure that it's fully tight by

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.949 
make sure that it's fully tight by
tightening<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.209> knot<00:04:02.330> just<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.629> little<00:04:02.840> bit

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
tightening the knot just a little bit

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.420 
tightening the knot just a little bit
further<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.319> make<00:04:03.530> sure<00:04:03.739> it's<00:04:03.920> nice<00:04:04.069> and<00:04:04.099> tight

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
further to make sure it's nice and tight

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.390 
further to make sure it's nice and tight
so<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.420> last<00:04:05.569> job<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.989> finish<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.799> assembly

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
so the last job to finish the assembly

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.330

the<00:05:52.460> hose<00:05:52.640> out<00:05:52.910> at<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.270> point<00:05:53.570> so<00:05:53.900> I'll<00:05:53.990> just

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
the hose out at that point so I'll just

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:00.490 
the hose out at that point so I'll just
show<00:05:54.320> you<00:05:54.380> how<00:05:54.530> to<00:05:54.590> do<00:05:54.800> that<00:05:54.950> now<00:05:59.230> as<00:06:00.230> you<00:06:00.410> can

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
show you how to do that now as you can

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.310 
show you how to do that now as you can
see<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.800> hose<00:06:00.980> is<00:06:01.190> now<00:06:01.400> held<00:06:02.300> out<00:06:02.540> and<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.140> don't

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
see the hose is now held out and I don't

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.020 
see the hose is now held out and I don't
need<00:06:03.530> to<00:06:03.710> worry<00:06:03.950> about<00:06:04.010> it<00:06:04.340> going<00:06:04.520> back<00:06:04.760> into

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
need to worry about it going back into

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.970 
need to worry about it going back into
the<00:06:05.150> case<00:06:05.360> on<00:06:05.540> its<00:06:05.690> own<00:06:05.870> and<00:06:06.080> I<00:06:06.140> can<00:06:06.320> start<00:06:06.800> to

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
the case on its own and I can start to

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.770 
the case on its own and I can start to
water<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.400> garden<00:06:07.550> or<00:06:08.000> do<00:06:08.180> whatever<00:06:08.390> I<00:06:08.570> want

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
water the garden or do whatever I want

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.840 
water the garden or do whatever I want
to<00:06:08.810> do<00:06:09.020> with<00:06:09.200> the<00:06:09.320> hose<00:06:09.500> wash<00:06:10.160> my<00:06:10.400> car<00:06:10.610> or

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
to do with the hose wash my car or

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.940 
to do with the hose wash my car or
something<00:06:11.150> like<00:06:11.240> that<00:06:11.450> when<00:06:12.290> I<00:06:12.380> finish<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:12.890> I

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
something like that when I finish and I

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.490 
something like that when I finish and I
want<00:06:13.130> to<00:06:13.310> store<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:14.300> hose<00:06:14.330> back<00:06:14.780> into<00:06:14.990> the

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
want to store the hose back into the

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.200 
want to store the hose back into the
case<00:06:15.710> all<00:06:16.100> I<00:06:16.130> need<00:06:16.400> to<00:06:16.490> do<00:06:16.640> is<00:06:16.760> put<00:06:16.970> a<00:06:17.000> little

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
case all I need to do is put a little

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.420 
case all I need to do is put a little
bit<00:06:17.390> more<00:06:17.450> hose<00:06:17.840> out<00:06:18.140> so<00:06:18.680> it<00:06:18.800> goes<00:06:18.950> past<00:06:19.220> the

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
bit more hose out so it goes past the

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.460 
bit more hose out so it goes past the
clicks<00:06:19.670> and<00:06:19.940> then<00:06:20.540> the<00:06:20.960> hose<00:06:21.140> will<00:06:21.350> be

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
clicks and then the hose will be

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.170 
clicks and then the hose will be
automatically<00:06:22.010> retracted<00:06:22.640> back<00:06:22.790> into<00:06:23.090> the

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
automatically retracted back into the

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.900 
automatically retracted back into the
case<00:06:23.390> and<00:06:23.840> stored<00:06:24.440> nice<00:06:25.040> and<00:06:25.280> needs<00:06:25.460> ready<00:06:25.760> for

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
case and stored nice and needs ready for

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.090 
case and stored nice and needs ready for
next<00:06:26.150> time<00:06:26.270> and<00:06:26.600> finally<00:06:27.410> we<00:06:27.500> can<00:06:27.560> tidy<00:06:27.950> things

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
next time and finally we can tidy things

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.790 
next time and finally we can tidy things
up<00:06:28.340> by<00:06:28.580> just<00:06:29.480> taking<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:30.110> nozzle<00:06:30.440> off<00:06:30.590> by

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
up by just taking the nozzle off by

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.800 
up by just taking the nozzle off by
sliding<00:06:31.130> the<00:06:31.430> yellow<00:06:31.700> color<00:06:32.030> back<00:06:32.510> on<00:06:32.660> the

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
sliding the yellow color back on the

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.170 
sliding the yellow color back on the
fitting<00:06:33.280> put<00:06:34.280> that<00:06:34.430> somewhere<00:06:34.700> safe

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
fitting put that somewhere safe

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.930 
fitting put that somewhere safe
and<00:06:35.420> then<00:06:36.380> this<00:06:36.560> fittingly<00:06:37.040> stored<00:06:37.640> at<00:06:37.790> each

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
and then this fittingly stored at each

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.430 
and then this fittingly stored at each
apart<00:06:38.270> point<00:06:38.600> which<00:06:38.750> is<00:06:38.840> on<00:06:38.930> the<00:06:39.050> back<00:06:39.200> of<00:06:39.350> the

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
apart point which is on the back of the

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.500 
apart point which is on the back of the
reel<00:06:39.650> while<00:06:40.340> just<00:06:40.520> clicking<00:06:40.760> it<00:06:41.000> into<00:06:41.300> place

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
reel while just clicking it into place

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.270 
reel while just clicking it into place
like<00:06:41.780> that<00:06:42.520> and<00:06:43.520> that's<00:06:43.700> it<00:06:44.140> that's<00:06:45.140> it<00:06:45.440> job

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
like that and that's it that's it job

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.550 
like that and that's it that's it job
done
