 moment to correct this problem is and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.120
 where giving a researched and found 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 this topic here of 2012 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.409
 the guy with the same problem and if he already 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.020
 told him it 's to correct this mistake 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.610
 you need to reset the settings 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.830
 of your internet explorer 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.790
 so you put this code here in the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.460
 start menu 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.770
 I'll leave it in the description of the video. 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.509
 put here click on these cabinets in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.280
 OK 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.600
 then you will see neither advanced nor 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.860
 reset delete personal settings 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.630
 reset internet settings 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.630
 explorer and click on set 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.410
 Just click to close it too. 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.700
 that you can try to update the 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.350
 your internet explorer 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.020
 Only I did not do this to me, it worked. 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.120
 only reset the settings and place 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.830
 here he could not solve understood 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.540
 So that's why I say it 's a 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.920
 gambiarra because it might not 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.530
 It works for everyone 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.150
 only that for me it worked old on my pc 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.260
 and generally when some error does not 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.060
 I managed to correct 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.220
 so I think that for most 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.990
 people who have problems will work and 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.650
 that's it if you can solve your 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.510
 problem 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.520
 write short and if the video is not heard 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.270
 nothing for you I like it too 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.270
 That's what I said
