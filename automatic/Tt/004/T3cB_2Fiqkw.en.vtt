into<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.090> mountains<00:02:42.420> here<00:02:42.980> one<00:02:43.980> definition

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
into the mountains here one definition

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.750 
into the mountains here one definition
already<00:02:45.780> well<00:02:46.110> parts<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.370> they're<00:02:47.580> working

anyway from Liberty it goes basically

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.550 
anyway from Liberty it goes basically
along<00:04:16.520> 17<00:04:17.330> for<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.720> most<00:04:17.930> part<00:04:18.290> through

about that either but anyway the main

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.360 
about that either but anyway the main
line<00:04:57.020> goes<00:04:57.290> up<00:04:57.500> here<00:04:59.170> on<00:05:00.170> this<00:05:00.410> valley<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.250> it

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
line goes up here on this valley and it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.670 
line goes up here on this valley and it
must<00:05:01.640> turn<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:02.330> go<00:05:02.420> up<00:05:02.630> go<00:05:02.750> on<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:03.050> river

Delhi branch went up the Dow line right

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.150 
Delhi branch went up the Dow line right
here<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:13.520> then<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:13.759> mainline<00:05:14.210> from<00:05:14.600> Alton

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
here and then the mainline from Alton

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.159 
here and then the mainline from Alton
makes<00:05:16.160> it<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.729> Sydney<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.630> guessing<00:05:17.870> it's

makes it to Sydney and guessing it's

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.350 
makes it to Sydney and guessing it's
kind<00:05:18.410> of<00:05:18.470> like<00:05:18.680> right<00:05:18.919> around<00:05:19.039> to<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.520> valley

Fulton and on swag oh that's actually
still<00:06:30.790> being<00:06:30.940> is<00:06:31.150> still<00:06:31.600> tracked<00:06:31.900> there<00:06:32.140> and

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
still being is still tracked there and

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.840

still run trains on I don't know if it's

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.510 
still run trains on I don't know if it's
a<00:06:33.970> short<00:06:34.270> line<00:06:34.540> or<00:06:35.380> if<00:06:35.530> it's<00:06:35.680> like<00:06:35.830> a<00:06:35.860> branch<00:06:36.250> of

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
a short line or if it's like a branch of

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.000 
a short line or if it's like a branch of
my<00:06:37.510> father<00:06:37.810> and<00:06:37.930> that's<00:06:38.080> the<00:06:38.230> effects<00:06:38.620> I'm<00:06:38.860> not

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
my father and that's the effects I'm not

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.100 
my father and that's the effects I'm not
sure<00:06:39.220> but<00:06:39.460> I<00:06:39.670> know<00:06:40.180> I've<00:06:40.510> heard<00:06:40.780> that<00:06:40.810> that's

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
sure but I know I've heard that that's

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.730 
sure but I know I've heard that that's
still<00:06:41.440> in<00:06:41.590> use<00:06:41.770> but<00:06:42.550> anyway<00:06:42.850> that's<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.360> route

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
still in use but anyway that's the route

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.610 
still in use but anyway that's the route
from<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:44.770> big<00:06:45.220> overhead<00:06:45.730> point<00:06:46.150> of<00:06:46.240> view<00:06:46.390> and<00:06:46.840> I

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
from a big overhead point of view and I

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.710 
from a big overhead point of view and I
guess<00:06:48.490> you<00:06:48.640> can<00:06:48.790> kinda<00:06:49.090> guess<00:06:49.270> by<00:06:49.570> how

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
guess you can kinda guess by how

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.380 
guess you can kinda guess by how
mountainous<00:06:50.260> it<00:06:50.470> is<00:06:50.590> why<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:51.430> onw<00:06:51.910> went<00:06:52.270> out

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
mountainous it is why the onw went out

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.530 
mountainous it is why the onw went out

little towns out in the middle of

little towns out in the middle of
nowhere<00:06:57.250> and<00:06:57.730> they<00:06:58.570> just<00:06:58.780> couldn't<00:06:59.080> revin

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580

generate enough revenue to keep it going
you<00:07:03.070> know<00:07:03.160> most<00:07:03.460> of<00:07:03.610> their<00:07:03.760> money<00:07:03.970> came<00:07:04.330> from

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
you know most of their money came from

Holland<00:07:05.650> Cola<00:07:06.130> of<00:07:06.460> Scranton<00:07:07.000> Scranton

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
Holland Cola of Scranton Scranton

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.290 
Holland Cola of Scranton Scranton
Scranton<00:07:07.960> division<00:07:08.620> up<00:07:08.740> through<00:07:09.030> there<00:07:10.030> and

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
Scranton division up through there and

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.740 
Scranton division up through there and
then<00:07:10.480> and<00:07:11.200> then<00:07:11.980> I<00:07:12.370> think<00:07:12.610> it<00:07:12.730> linked<00:07:13.300> up<00:07:13.480> with

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
then and then I think it linked up with

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.660 
then and then I think it linked up with
the<00:07:13.960> New<00:07:14.590> Haven<00:07:14.800> Railroad<00:07:15.160> and<00:07:15.960> Maybrook

the New Haven Railroad and Maybrook

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.060 
the New Haven Railroad and Maybrook
which<00:07:18.670> is<00:07:18.880> down<00:07:19.090> here<00:07:19.120> and<00:07:19.660> then<00:07:20.500> the<00:07:20.650> matin

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
which is down here and then the matin

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.740 
which is down here and then the matin
the<00:07:21.280> New<00:07:21.460> Haven<00:07:21.640> took<00:07:22.000> it<00:07:22.120> over<00:07:22.330> through<00:07:22.570> the

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
the New Haven took it over through the

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.890 
the New Haven took it over through the
Tipsy<00:07:23.140> and<00:07:23.230> whatnot<00:07:23.560> but<00:07:24.419> over<00:07:25.419> the<00:07:25.510> Tipsy

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900

bridge but now when that stopped working

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.230 
bridge but now when that stopped working
and<00:07:29.590> they<00:07:29.710> lost<00:07:29.919> their<00:07:30.190> connection<00:07:30.340> down<00:07:30.850> into

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.320 
Jersey it's just one thing after another

Jersey it's just one thing after another
as<00:07:35.320> well<00:07:35.740> they<00:07:35.950> went<00:07:36.160> out<00:07:36.310> of<00:07:36.430> business<00:07:37.150> with

they just got liquidated which really
suck<00:07:44.659> but<00:07:45.220> anyway<00:07:46.900> they<00:07:47.900> tuned<00:07:48.110> for<00:07:48.409> the<00:07:48.470> next

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.620 
suck but anyway they tuned for the next

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.279 
suck but anyway they tuned for the next
video<00:07:49.039> this<00:07:49.460> one<00:07:49.699> comes<00:07:50.000> out<00:07:50.180> alright<00:07:50.539> and

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:51.289 
video this one comes out alright and

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:55.719 
video this one comes out alright and
I'll<00:07:51.590> zoom<00:07:51.919> in<00:07:52.550> with<00:07:52.759> the<00:07:53.199> satellite<00:07:54.199> view<00:07:54.729> and

00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:55.729 
I'll zoom in with the satellite view and

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:58.600 
I'll zoom in with the satellite view and
try<00:07:56.030> to<00:07:56.090> really<00:07:57.050> find<00:07:57.349> it<00:07:57.560> like<00:07:58.039> really<00:07:58.370> find

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:58.610 
try to really find it like really find

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.219 
try to really find it like really find
all<00:07:58.759> the<00:07:58.909> different<00:07:59.000> crossings<00:07:59.659> and<00:07:59.840> whatnots

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:00.229 
all the different crossings and whatnots

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:01.869 
all the different crossings and whatnots
and<00:08:00.440> the<00:08:00.500> tunnels<00:08:00.860> like<00:08:01.039> to<00:08:01.220> find<00:08:01.490> most<00:08:01.639> of<00:08:01.819> the

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:01.879 
and the tunnels like to find most of the

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:05.740 
and the tunnels like to find most of the
tunnels<00:08:02.270> I<00:08:02.389> think<00:08:02.629> and<00:08:03.940> so<00:08:04.940> I'll<00:08:05.360> see<00:08:05.690> you

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:05.750 
tunnels I think and so I'll see you

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.770 
tunnels I think and so I'll see you
later<00:08:05.960> bye
