00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.090
 makes happy that lovers of 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.239
 literature continue to increase and although 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.460
 I have no interest in literature to 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.969
 you say you are choosing to touch randomly 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.590

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.290
 be so superficial 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.730
 it is not being superficial to choose 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.790
 a run for the teacher to 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:21.900
 teaches is normal your reasons are 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.380
 abnormal impure and if they are impure that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.270
 you import tuition to college 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.740
