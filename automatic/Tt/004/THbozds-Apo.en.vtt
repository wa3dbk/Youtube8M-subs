00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
can just run two and these things feel

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.709 
can just run two and these things feel
dry<00:00:45.870> pop<00:00:46.230> them<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> other<00:00:47.430> two<00:00:47.719> yeah

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.710 
there anything different about operating
it<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.729> typical<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.270> how<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> run<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
it is it typical you know how to run a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.330 
it is it typical you know how to run a
zero<00:01:46.020> turn<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.829> operate<00:01:47.070> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
zero turn you can you can operate this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.950 
zero turn you can you can operate this
I'll<00:01:47.790> create<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.149> motor<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.540> how<00:01:48.659> wide<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
I'll create this motor and how wide it

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620 
I'll create this motor and how wide it
cut<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.950> offer<00:01:50.250> fifty<00:01:50.759> two<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.360> six

cut we have offer fifty two and a six
inch<00:01:51.899> cut<00:01:52.170> okay<00:01:52.640> let's<00:01:53.640> talk<00:01:53.790> about<00:01:53.850> price

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
inch cut okay let's talk about price

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.570 
inch cut okay let's talk about price
the<00:01:55.240> price<00:01:56.320> price<00:01:57.320> but<00:01:57.619> maybe<00:01:57.799> just<00:01:58.400> enough

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
hours for our lithium yeah it'll go

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.020 
hours for our lithium yeah it'll go
about<00:02:36.830> fifty<00:02:37.160> nine<00:02:37.280> hundred<00:02:37.610> dollars<00:02:37.850> with
