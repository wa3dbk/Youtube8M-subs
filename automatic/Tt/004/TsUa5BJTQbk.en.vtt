00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.960 
welcome to the chapter summary of the
complement<00:00:03.570> system<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:04.370> in<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:05.549> section<00:00:05.759> we

complement system and in this section we

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.550 
complement system and in this section we
will<00:00:06.089> summarize<00:00:06.330> everything<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.170> learned<00:00:07.379> so

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
will summarize everything we learned so

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.419 
will summarize everything we learned so

that<00:01:06.090> was<00:01:06.299> dependent<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.080> antibody<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that was dependent on antibody if you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
that was dependent on antibody if you
said<00:01:09.240> classic<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:09.990> you're<00:01:10.140> correct<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
said classic then you're correct the

said classic then you're correct the
classical<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> only<00:01:12.450> way<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.080> makes
