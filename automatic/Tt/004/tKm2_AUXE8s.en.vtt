00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.670 

I'm<00:01:15.580> lucky<00:01:15.909> enough<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.150> be<00:01:16.300> good<00:01:17.200> enough<00:01:17.409> and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.870 

I'm<00:01:24.740> more<00:01:24.920> than<00:01:25.010> willing<00:01:25.160> to<00:01:25.430> perch<00:01:25.610> on<00:01:25.730> the

I'm more than willing to perch on the
edge<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.150> cliff<00:01:26.360> for<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> couple<00:01:26.870> hours<00:01:27.080> to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
get that shot I want the pictures work

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.790 
get that shot I want the pictures work
out<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.840> other<00:01:29.930> people<00:01:29.990> like<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.440> picture<00:01:30.710> is

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
out and other people like the picture is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.039 
out and other people like the picture is
set<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.670> trade<00:01:31.850> off

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.590 

I<00:01:36.189> really<00:01:37.189> like<00:01:37.369> doing<00:01:37.549> long<00:01:37.850> exposures<00:01:37.880> of

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
I really like doing long exposures of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.069 
I really like doing long exposures of
the<00:01:38.689> ocean<00:01:39.020> getting<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:39.920> water<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.310> blur<00:01:40.520> and

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
the ocean getting the water to blur and

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.149 
the ocean getting the water to blur and
so<00:01:42.079> when<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:42.320> contrast<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:43.039> the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
so when you contrast that with the

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.830 
so when you contrast that with the
roundness<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.609> the<00:01:43.729> rocks<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:44.299> maybe<00:01:44.539> throw

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
roundness of the rocks and maybe throw

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.200 
roundness of the rocks and maybe throw
in<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:45.079> jagged<00:01:45.350> branch<00:01:45.710> or<00:01:45.920> tooth<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:46.369> find<00:01:47.119> that

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
in a jagged branch or tooth I find that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.590 
in a jagged branch or tooth I find that
works<00:01:47.420> really<00:01:47.630> well<00:01:47.750> for<00:01:47.869> composition

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.150 

night<00:01:53.600> photography<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:54.350> also<00:01:54.650> something<00:01:55.040> I've

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
night photography is also something I've

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.190 
night photography is also something I've
grown<00:01:55.400> really<00:01:55.640> fond<00:01:55.970> of<00:01:56.120> capturing<00:01:57.050> the
