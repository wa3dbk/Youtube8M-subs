00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.530

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.300
 One 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.300
 Initial software a 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.100
 Mobile Suit Gundam 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.230
 If the eaves the first time 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.230

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.390
 8 years 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.410
 Well that 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.070
 It is also an early work though 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.410
 In the polygon 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.500
 In terms of movement 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.930
 I think that I bought a lot with some hope, but I bought a lot 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.720
 First software of him that bought Well that I myself also the most 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.350
 a 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.020
 It was Gundam 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.690
 I remember I bought it with the main subject of ps Yes 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.680
 Hmm 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.140

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.630
 Please do it with that toy's rabbits 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.460
 I bought it 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.900
 Well difficult 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.640
 If you look at it, it will be very different 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.229
 In fact 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.229
 Operation is quite difficult 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.370
 Oh dear 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.020
 I remember I did my hard work 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.430
 Pretty ne 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.030
 And was also wonder if not it was he who 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.170
 I think 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.690
 Well if there is to say bone Speaking bone 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.110
 The beginning while introducing it 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.110
 think 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.320
 8 years ago 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.750
 There was a little before I took this 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.000
 It's been a long time, so many things I forgot 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.140
 Body is 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.140
 I think I'm not Ika with 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.790
 Still somehow 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.960
 Hey, if possible 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.500
 I think that I want to win in such a way to TV Gundam 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.500
 I think 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.160
 Well this is 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.940
 I wonder if I bought a real saber hug 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.940
 I'm doing it 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.319
 I pretty black Tteru 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.220
 We Kuna' 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:58.180
 About the time being integrally I think I'm quite difficult 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.170
 I want to go after chasing but want to serve 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.170
 I feel 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:15.510
 Well I say I kill at that saber 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:18.379
 I'd be a little hard time until you can see there is a little difficult to sense of distance 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.379
 Oh Kekko said 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.240
 It is lazy, isn't it? 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.959
 I think you have entered 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.120
 Even if it's too close, it won't open 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.500
 Zodiac away not all hit 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.500
 Ready to enter 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.769
 If you pan this government because there is no real Agi 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.569
 than hp has been reduced is 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.060
 It was like life 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.080

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.840
 Hold on right 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.390
 Red above is positive 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.860
 It is bullet 2 of the weapon 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:06.490
 The blue one on the left is hp . 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.490
