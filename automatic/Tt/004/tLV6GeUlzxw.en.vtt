isn't<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> fully<00:01:50.030> surround<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:53.280> isn't

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
isn't a fully surround it so that isn't

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.410 
isn't a fully surround it so that isn't
that<00:01:53.610> bad<00:01:53.790> you're<00:01:53.909> still

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
that bad you're still

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.420 
that bad you're still
great<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:57.790> source<00:01:58.659> block<00:01:58.870> here<00:01:59.080> I<00:01:59.110> think<00:01:59.430> it'll

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
great my source block here I think it'll

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.060 
great my source block here I think it'll
still<00:02:00.640> grow<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:02.170> got<00:02:02.380> access<00:02:03.010> to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
still grow because it's got access to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.570 
still grow because it's got access to
the<00:02:03.190> water<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:04.390> then<00:02:04.690> it'll<00:02:05.440> just<00:02:05.650> grow<00:02:05.800> so

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
the water and then it'll just grow so

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.790 
the water and then it'll just grow so
for<00:02:06.760> instance<00:02:07.090> just<00:02:07.300> go<00:02:07.960> for<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.200> walk<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.679> by

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
for instance just go for the walk and by

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.940 
for instance just go for the walk and by
the<00:02:08.860> time<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.069> get<00:02:09.160> back<00:02:09.369> it'll<00:02:09.700> be<00:02:10.709> okay<00:02:11.740> no

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
the time I get back it'll be okay no

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.660 
the time I get back it'll be okay no
it's<00:02:12.190> point<00:02:12.430> being<00:02:12.700> hmm<00:02:13.780> about<00:02:14.470> three<00:02:15.250> four

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
it's point being hmm about three four

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.180 
it's point being hmm about three four
minutes<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:16.240> real<00:02:16.480> time<00:02:16.720> since<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.500> finished<00:02:18.040> in

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
minutes in real time since I finished in

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.340 
minutes in real time since I finished in
the<00:02:18.280> tutorial<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.510> already<00:02:19.810> grown<00:02:19.990> one

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
the tutorial and it's already grown one

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.530 
the tutorial and it's already grown one
now<00:02:21.250> if<00:02:21.900> I'm<00:02:22.900> not<00:02:22.959> sure<00:02:23.370> another<00:02:24.370> one<00:02:24.580> because

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
now if I'm not sure another one because

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.960 
now if I'm not sure another one because
it<00:02:25.660> might

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.560 

I<00:02:28.000> can't<00:02:28.840> meet<00:02:28.930> at<00:02:29.020> ceiling<00:02:29.230> age<00:02:29.500> because<00:02:30.220> of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
I can't meet at ceiling age because of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.780 
I can't meet at ceiling age because of
that<00:02:31.570> or<00:02:32.350> if<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:32.680> gonna<00:02:32.770> grow<00:02:32.950> at<00:02:33.160> one<00:02:33.310> but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
that or if it's gonna grow at one but

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.220 
that or if it's gonna grow at one but
that's<00:02:34.000> proven<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.540> doesn't<00:02:34.750> grow<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:34.900> haven't

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
that's proven it doesn't grow I haven't

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.080 
that's proven it doesn't grow I haven't
just<00:02:35.320> got<00:02:35.470> another<00:02:35.590> cactus<00:02:36.130> because<00:02:36.790> that's

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
just got another cactus because that's

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.460 
just got another cactus because that's
too<00:02:37.239> like<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.510> did<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.110> beginning<00:02:38.200> of

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
too like I did in the beginning of
