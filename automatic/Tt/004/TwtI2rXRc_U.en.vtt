00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.710
 Gosh 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.710
 the supra 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.560
 my goodness I have here again 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.000
 employed 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:44.410
 Take a look at how this stylist is me 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.410
 mine was as a comparison as a comparison 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.590
 as a comparison here my 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.660
 small difference of wheel size at very 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:07.970
 probably the absolute hammer 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.720
 16 yes okay but then I have now 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.330
 here actually already employed again 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.850
 I have the brushless carbon butterfly 1 too 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:22.670
 6 sacconi fixed so there is really no 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.759
 fill out car I have now here 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.310
 everything was done so the carbon fighter 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:33.140
 has the right mega 20 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.740
 centimeter carbon braker wheels on it 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.399
 to get 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.229
 Let's see if the regulator motor and mine 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:45.490
 4s lipo will always be 22 s constellation 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:50.050
 still wants to join show yes 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.970
 otherwise what else have I done the 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.520
 Body as you see is black 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.140
 there has been emperor lettering 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.229
 we also get a label I show 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.700
 I have just a little rhesus monkey 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.479
 It's easy to see it done here 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.069
 Of course, cool does not have any function 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.300
 Lamps are offer I'll show you too 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:14.690
 right here and from a hp baha 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.130
 vfb are here front lamps turn built 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.630
 the light is not that 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.190
 now only the lamp holders there 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.430
 I can even something purely for time 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.270
 build and then I did something else 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.800
 I'll show you that for the first time 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.819
 briefly in detail that still 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.989
 here again the carbon braker wheels with 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.730
 red rand have gotten from me 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:43.219
 up here my logo on it 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:46.219
 the hpi headlights of the rear wing 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.959
 was from these ugly stickers 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.269
 liberated and now has monster 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.829
 Get energy sticker up here 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.829
 even only the brushless sticker 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.500
 you stayed behind maybe you 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.500
 from my lights video just knows 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.150
 tied with cable ties this 80's 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.090
 cent bike lights from denmark that can 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.730
 Of course, I also think it's flashing 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.870
 I'm pretty cool, too 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.900
 reset trapp is just such a piece 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.760
 Water pipe with two cable ties 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.370
 is attached and that they are behind 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.750
 such a small edge where you have two pipes 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.120
 stuck in each other can I have up there 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.709
 and drilled down and then just 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.870
 with a cable tie on the damper 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.340
 bridge moored very simple again 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.749
 the spectacle goes out again and again 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.049
 By the way, two speeds 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:39.079
 So it can slow down 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.370
 I think it's cool and me 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.810
 have this time on the crossbar 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.370
 made around the lights a bit 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.719
 to get wide apart the city 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.730
 now here at the spoiler or damper 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.310
 I can find a bridge 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.989
 every case really cool 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.430
 yes, and I think so at all 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.829
 actually do not find any real 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.590
 German word for this car because of 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:03.499
 just love it absolutely 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.569
 he is so incredibly tall he believes it 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:07.760
 not at all you have to do that 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.909
 Imagine that is bigger than one now 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.650
 hp baha you may know that 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:16.459
 carbon braker and the whole thing then 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.579
 brushless that's really awesome 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.760
 and by the way, I like it too 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.900
 the caro just fine in black and then 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.630
 with the fat wheels 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.380
 it is really a real monster 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.700
 Now something so important 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.790
 I've changed that on the 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:40.240
 Dare I show you the whole time now 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.240
 here 

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:59.799
 that's how I read it 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:05:02.979
 I have made an elle profile here 

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:05.289
 built on the side and show 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.659
 I just times I hide you once a 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:12.099
 other shot as the whole was before 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:16.119
 Attention, something falls on the side 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:18.309
 between body and bottom plate is 

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:21.099
 a small slit in the original and 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:23.679
 of course, flying through this slot 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.049
 all the dirt in when the wheels turn 

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:27.219
 now turn especially if it is to 

00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:29.619
 as asked before 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:32.019
 then of course the whole dirt 

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:37.029
 and especially on small stones gravel and 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:40.449
 sand downright between these so in the 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:43.509
 small-small catapults and fly 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.419
 then of course against the regulator and 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.669
 the engine and fan of de clars the yes 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.169
 right there by the side and that is 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.839
 definitely not healthy in the long term 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.550
 if the engine is there, so to speak 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:56.349
 or the regulator of these 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.729
 all dirt through the wheels 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:03.159
 sandblasted is what makes it so 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.050
 probably here are these alu 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:07.300
 actually make to do around 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.099
 to do this step the whole thing 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.799
 better then by smuggling 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.569
 To protect dirt and as you see 

00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:15.549
 I have the whole thing really nice 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.319
 then you just have it here 

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:20.439
 bit of self-adhesive velcro 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:23.289
 done on both sides and in the 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:25.269
 body then it sits there too the 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:31.539
 Velcro tape above and below 

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:34.539
 and so is this little column here 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.860
 apparently then it is closed and the 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.889
 then hopefully, whole cars will remain 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.599
 cleaner and, above all , not distributed 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.449
 Show you this again if 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.279
 that's how it is 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.680
 Turn the wheels and all the dirt 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:49.319
 gets catapulted in here and 4 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.089
 against the regulator that will be so now 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:56.099
 completely avoided and I recommend that 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:56.779
 you might do that at the 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.520
 dare 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:02.879
 otherwise everything is the same from technology 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.849
 stayed as it was and next 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:07.979
 is there again a handy video where 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:12.629
 Let's see how the whole dare then 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:16.189
 runs with the carbon braker wheels so 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:19.189
 until running video with this baic 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.189
 Hello
