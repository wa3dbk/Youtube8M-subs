00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:09.110
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.400
 can speed up the processor mt 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.379
 not taking root in bios 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.070
 this video is more for inexperienced 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.900
 users who do not know how to 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 speed up the bios processor and on or are afraid 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.090
 for this md came up with such a program 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.780
 as mdf drive you can download it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.430
 special site 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:42.930
 we launch it on immediately there is such 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.899
 the message is about m and bears 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.260
 no responsibility what we 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.899
 use this program that is to your 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.120
 fear and risk 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.930
 because as you know acceleration 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.789
 relaxed processor him with a dangerous business 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.920
 only this requires good topics 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.479
 cooling so here's the problem we go in 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.860
 In the tab the clock voltage is that is 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:18.570
 voltage so select the turbo tab 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.869
 core control enable turbo core enable 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.460
 him 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:29.100
 I have an amd fx 6100 processor 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:35.549
 it can break up to three 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:39.150
 auditing hearts 3 and 3 for you to see 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:44.460
 that i will have 33 now i will show you 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:48.259
 This is with a quick program speed test. 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.259
 c searches professional 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.560
 that's the speed i'm 33 megahertz 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:03.250
 Now I clocked up to 3 walk and all 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:07.450
 counting two clicks so here i am 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:11.920
 already on the line sign acceleration to 19 and 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.690
 with a half X, that is, it is an indicator 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.320
 3 and 9 grc click ok 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.610
 again warning ok and now on 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:28.120
 main tab too 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.840
 move the slider to the speed which 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.100
 as much as possible on your process 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:42.000
 Well, there you will see for me this 19 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:46.240
 half xv here on 6 cores speed 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.500
 increased push warm here 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:54.720
 click on this message to you 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.120
 do not want to turbo core 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.150
 started when windows start up 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.489
 no, we want ok again 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.459
 all the settings started okay and now 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.560
 to check our speed and again 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.739
 running the program from the cavity 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:20.160
 professional quick speed test 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.160
 processor whole test eat 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:33.700
 so so so so and the speed of 39 megahertz 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:38.319
 from what we wanted to and so this can be done 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:42.040
 with each processor mtk place md on 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:48.090
 intel processors this will not work 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:51.280
 I'll finish it 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.690
 write comments what videos you want 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.459
 so that I once again took some video lessons 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.870
 put likes subscribe thanks for 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.870
