that's<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.319> there<00:00:40.530> right<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:40.739> we're<00:00:41.639> going

that's out there right now we're going

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.569 
that's out there right now we're going
from<00:00:42.089> 20<00:00:42.449> years<00:00:42.659> ago<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.019> had<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.289> 207<00:00:44.159> that<00:00:44.370> was

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
from 20 years ago you had a 207 that was

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.149 
from 20 years ago you had a 207 that was
basically<00:00:45.149> totally<00:00:45.809> straight<00:00:46.139> to<00:00:46.800> his<00:00:46.949> ski

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
basically totally straight to his ski

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.789 
basically totally straight to his ski
nowadays<00:00:47.609> the<00:00:47.879> average<00:00:48.269> length<00:00:48.449> is<00:00:48.629> 170<00:00:49.409> fish

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:49.799 
nowadays the average length is 170 fish

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.700 
nowadays the average length is 170 fish
for<00:00:50.129> men<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.579> an<00:00:50.850> 80<00:00:51.120> millimeter<00:00:51.710> waist

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
for men with an 80 millimeter waist

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
for men with an 80 millimeter waist
width<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.339> totally<00:00:53.999> different<00:00:54.329> than

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
width it's just totally different than

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.459 
width it's just totally different than
it<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.949> 20<00:00:55.949> years<00:00:55.979> ago<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.209> we<00:00:57.749> really<00:00:58.049> focused

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it was 20 years ago so we really focused

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.410 
it was 20 years ago so we really focused
on<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> different<00:00:59.249> needs<00:00:59.429> are<00:00:59.729> of<00:00:59.879> these

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
on what the different needs are of these

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
on what the different needs are of these
skiers<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.959> one<00:01:01.139> of<00:01:01.229> the<00:01:01.319> big<00:01:01.559> things<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.949> we

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
skiers and one of the big things that we

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.369 
skiers and one of the big things that we
found<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.760> there's<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.209> lot<00:01:03.600> more<00:01:03.839> lateral

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
found is that there's a lot more lateral

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.590 
found is that there's a lot more lateral
forces<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:05.129> due<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.460> these<00:01:05.549> wider<00:01:05.909> skis<00:01:06.360> with

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
forces with due to these wider skis with

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.500 
forces with due to these wider skis with
a<00:01:06.630> ton<00:01:06.900> more<00:01:07.310> side<00:01:08.310> cut<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.300> first

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
a ton more side cut and so the first

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.230 
a ton more side cut and so the first
thing<00:01:09.690> we<00:01:09.810> did<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.200> address<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.190> we<00:01:11.730> built

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
thing we did to address that is we built

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.320 
thing we did to address that is we built
a<00:01:12.360> totally<00:01:12.750> new<00:01:12.900> shell<00:01:13.230> in<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.650> new<00:01:13.920> shell

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
a totally new shell in this new shell

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.430 
a totally new shell in this new shell
this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.390> an<00:01:15.600> old<00:01:15.780> shell<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.260> holding

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
this is an old shell that I'm holding

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.380 
this is an old shell that I'm holding
incident<00:01:16.980> more<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.550> real<00:01:17.730> four<00:01:18.060> buckle

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
incident more of a real four buckle

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.060 
incident more of a real four buckle
overlap<00:01:18.840> design<00:01:19.260> that<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:19.860> here

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
overlap design that you can see here

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.700 
overlap design that you can see here
really<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.480> the<00:01:21.510> attention<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
really all of the attention of this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.160 
really all of the attention of this
shell<00:01:22.980> is<00:01:23.010> focused<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.270> after<00:01:24.780> motion

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
shell is focused on the for after motion

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.770 
shell is focused on the for after motion
in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.560> boot<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.760> gave<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.300> power<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
in the boot so it gave you the power to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.680 
in the boot so it gave you the power to
steer<00:01:28.230> that<00:01:28.500> huge<00:01:29.100> 207<00:01:30.060> ski<00:01:30.300> that<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.570> in

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
steer that huge 207 ski that was in

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.590 
steer that huge 207 ski that was in
front<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.290> behind<00:01:31.410> you<00:01:32.300> with<00:01:33.300> those

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
front of you and behind you with those

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.450 
front of you and behind you with those
new<00:01:33.900> shape<00:01:34.260> skis<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.830> all<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.130> lateral

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
new shape skis and all that lateral

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340 
new shape skis and all that lateral
force<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.940> I<00:01:36.000> was<00:01:36.120> talking<00:01:36.450> about<00:01:36.510> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
force that I was talking about you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.910 
force that I was talking about you
really<00:01:37.710> need<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.330> support<00:01:39.930> laterally<00:01:40.890> on

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
really need to have support laterally on

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.830 
really need to have support laterally on
the<00:01:41.100> boot<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.670> almost<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.210> opposite<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the boot so it's almost the opposite of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
the boot so it's almost the opposite of
what<00:01:43.020> we've<00:01:43.140> done<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.740> overlap<00:01:44.430> design

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
what we've done with that overlap design

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.820 
what we've done with that overlap design
and<00:01:45.120> with<00:01:45.690> this<00:01:45.810> three-piece<00:01:46.290> design<00:01:46.650> it

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
and with this three-piece design it

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.590 
and with this three-piece design it
really<00:01:46.860> allows<00:01:47.340> us<00:01:47.370> to<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.940> maximum

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
really allows us to have the maximum

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.560 
really allows us to have the maximum
level<00:01:48.870> of<00:01:49.200> stiffness<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.580> lateral<00:01:51.000> way<00:01:51.270> on

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
level of stiffness in a lateral way on

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.570 
level of stiffness in a lateral way on
this<00:01:52.050> on<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.530> new<00:01:52.710> shell<00:01:52.950> design<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.460> we

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
this on this new shell design that we

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.140 
this on this new shell design that we
have<00:01:54.409> also<00:01:55.409> we've<00:01:55.920> incorporated<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.640> EDT

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
have also we've incorporated the EDT

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.830 
have also we've incorporated the EDT
which<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.920> hard<00:01:58.920> boot<00:01:59.190> board<00:01:59.490> into<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.000> into

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
which is a hard boot board into the into

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.570 
which is a hard boot board into the into
the<00:02:00.930> sole<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> boot<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.220> what

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
the sole of the boot and what that what

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.030 
the sole of the boot and what that what
that<00:02:02.610> boot<00:02:03.000> board<00:02:03.210> does<00:02:03.510> is<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.500> fixed<00:02:04.979> with

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that boot board does is it's fixed with

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.310 
that boot board does is it's fixed with
two<00:02:05.460> screws<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.240> front<00:02:06.390> two<00:02:06.870> screws<00:02:07.200> in

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
two screws in the front two screws in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.009 
two screws in the front two screws in
the<00:02:07.409> back<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.519> locks<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.420> food<00:02:09.720> so

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
the back and so it locks up that food so

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.539 
the back and so it locks up that food so
it's<00:02:10.170> much<00:02:10.500> stiffer<00:02:11.039> you're<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
it's much stiffer you're not going to

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.990 
it's much stiffer you're not going to
get<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.849> twisting<00:02:12.389> of<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.540> food

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
get that twisting of the food

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.910 
get that twisting of the food
it's<00:02:13.210> in<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.450> binding<00:02:13.780> system<00:02:14.170> which<00:02:14.620> allows

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
it's in the binding system which allows

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.560 
it's in the binding system which allows
you<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.190> highest<00:02:15.400> level<00:02:15.820> of<00:02:15.880> performance<00:02:16.030> but

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
you the highest level of performance but

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.050 
you the highest level of performance but
also<00:02:16.800> really<00:02:17.800> speaks<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.460> needs<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.940> these

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
also really speaks to the needs of these

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.360 
also really speaks to the needs of these
new<00:02:19.330> wider<00:02:19.660> skis<00:02:20.080> which<00:02:20.350> are<00:02:20.500> really<00:02:20.740> twisting

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
new wider skis which are really twisting

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.980 
new wider skis which are really twisting
and<00:02:21.520> I'm<00:02:21.790> sure<00:02:22.030> every<00:02:22.210> one<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.510> felt<00:02:22.840> that

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
and I'm sure every one of you felt that

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.620 
and I'm sure every one of you felt that
out<00:02:23.110> there<00:02:23.320> before
