00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.320 

I've<00:00:00.420> been<00:00:00.630> making<00:00:00.810> work<00:00:01.199> about<00:00:01.639> land<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.970> art

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
I've been making work about land and art

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.039 
I've been making work about land and art
and<00:00:03.750> our<00:00:03.959> connection<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.470> nature<00:00:04.620> for<00:00:06.049> 36

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
and our connection to nature for 36

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.009 
and our connection to nature for 36
years<00:00:07.140> or<00:00:07.529> so<00:00:10.040> site-specific<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:12.179> work<00:00:12.719> that

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
years or so site-specific is a work that

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.720 
years or so site-specific is a work that
is<00:00:13.259> about<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:14.130> place<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.330> place<00:00:15.599> using

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
is about a place in a place using

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.700 
is about a place in a place using
materials<00:00:17.730> from<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.180> place<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.500> it's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
materials from the place so that it's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.859 
materials from the place so that it's
about<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.340> context<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.119> place<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.630> well

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
about the context of the place as well

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.730 
about the context of the place as well
as<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.199> material<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:24.119> site<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.779> try<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
as the material and the site I try and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.480 
as the material and the site I try and
keep<00:00:25.980> an<00:00:26.160> open<00:00:26.279> mind<00:00:26.460> before<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.570> visit<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.019> place

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
keep an open mind before I visit a place

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.490 
keep an open mind before I visit a place
and<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.029> actually<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.480> conversation<00:00:30.750> with

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and it was actually a conversation with

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.080 
and it was actually a conversation with
somebody<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.719> gave<00:00:33.989> me<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.620> idea<00:00:35.090> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
somebody here that gave me the idea the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.220 
somebody here that gave me the idea the
idea<00:00:36.120> came<00:00:36.809> from<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:38.300> stuff<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.480> Wyoming<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
idea came from the stuff of Wyoming and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.729 
idea came from the stuff of Wyoming and
what<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.430> Wyoming<00:00:42.500> which<00:00:43.500> is

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
what is going on in in Wyoming which is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.069 
what is going on in in Wyoming which is
and<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.340> large<00:00:44.640> part<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.899> in

and a large part of what is going on in

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.850 
and a large part of what is going on in
Wyoming<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.070> mining<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:49.469> you've<00:00:49.649> got

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
Wyoming is mining and then you've got

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
Wyoming is mining and then you've got
the<00:00:49.980> landscape<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> forests<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.510> etc

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the landscape and the forests and etc

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.130 
the landscape and the forests and etc
and<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:53.360> know<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.600> Rockies<00:00:54.899> well

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
and and I know I know the Rockies well

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.360 
and and I know I know the Rockies well
you<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.469> I've<00:00:55.559> walked<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.250> I've

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you know I've walked in them and I've

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.680 
you know I've walked in them and I've
seen<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> red<00:00:57.600> dying<00:00:58.199> forests<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
seen the red dying forests and so a

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.920 
seen the red dying forests and so a
remark<00:01:00.690> by<00:01:00.899> somebody<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:02.219> what

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
remark by somebody here was what

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.690 
remark by somebody here was what
triggered<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.320> idea<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> sculpture<00:01:05.519> but

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
triggered the idea of the sculpture but

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.289 
triggered the idea of the sculpture but
the<00:01:05.820> actual<00:01:06.090> form<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> sculpture<00:01:08.299> goes

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the actual form of the sculpture goes

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.390 
the actual form of the sculpture goes
way<00:01:09.600> back<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.140> me<00:01:10.290> I've<00:01:11.100> been<00:01:11.369> using<00:01:11.610> this

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
way back for me I've been using this

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.870 
way back for me I've been using this
whirlpool<00:01:14.960> image<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.290> some<00:01:16.560> years<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
whirlpool image for some years the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.450 
whirlpool image for some years the
whirlpool<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> vortex<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.500> found

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
whirlpool or the vortex is found

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.200 
whirlpool or the vortex is found
throughout<00:01:20.880> nature<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:23.060> it's<00:01:24.060> an

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
throughout nature and it's it's an

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.640 
throughout nature and it's it's an
indication<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:25.049> energy<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.860> nature<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:27.650> it's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
indication of energy in nature and it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.679 
indication of energy in nature and it's
in<00:01:28.890> our<00:01:29.070> own<00:01:29.220> bodies<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.970> instance<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.659> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
in our own bodies for instance you get a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.990 
in our own bodies for instance you get a
double<00:01:31.049> vortex<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.740> flow<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.400> blood<00:01:32.729> in

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
double vortex in the flow of blood in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.749 
double vortex in the flow of blood in
the<00:01:33.060> heart<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.979> weather<00:01:35.250> systems

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the heart you get it in weather systems

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.660 
the heart you get it in weather systems
you<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.360> rivers<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.430> in

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you get it in rivers and you get it in

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.240 
you get it in rivers and you get it in
the<00:01:39.150> formation<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.920> galaxies<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the formation of galaxies in the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.200 
the formation of galaxies in the
universe<00:01:41.689> in<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.960> pulls<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.380> into<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.829> middle

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
universe in it pulls you into the middle

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.670 
universe in it pulls you into the middle
you've<00:01:45.210> noticed<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.960> while<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.409> works

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you've noticed here while this works

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.530 
you've noticed here while this works
been<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.250> people<00:01:47.579> are<00:01:47.729> pulled<00:01:48.090> drawn

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
been up that people are pulled drawn

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.480 
been up that people are pulled drawn
towards<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.680> they<00:01:49.799> want<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.130> walk<00:01:50.280> on

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
towards it and and they want to walk on

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.670 
towards it and and they want to walk on
it<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.700> want<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> look<00:01:51.149> down<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> hole<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it they want to look down the hole and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.950 
it they want to look down the hole and
that's<00:01:52.939> really<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.060> doing<00:01:54.360> its<00:01:54.509> job<00:01:54.720> that's

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
that's really it's doing its job that's

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.270 
that's really it's doing its job that's
what<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.290> doing<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.740> makes<00:01:55.950> people

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
what it's doing it makes people

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.940 
what it's doing it makes people
physically<00:01:56.820> engage<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:58.530> well<00:01:58.770> as

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
physically engage with it as well as

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
physically engage with it as well as
then<00:01:59.430> thinking<00:01:59.939> about<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.810> materials<00:02:01.350> that's

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
then thinking about the materials that's

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.660 
then thinking about the materials that's
been<00:02:01.740> used<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.610> might<00:02:02.820> mean

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
been used and what that might mean

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.780 
been used and what that might mean
you've<00:02:05.270> got<00:02:05.450> two<00:02:05.659> types<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.229> wood<00:02:06.530> really<00:02:06.890> or

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
you've got two types of wood really or

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.309 
you've got two types of wood really or
trees<00:02:08.979> divided<00:02:09.979> by<00:02:10.100> time<00:02:10.399> you've<00:02:10.670> got

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
trees divided by time you've got

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.520 
trees divided by time you've got
recently<00:02:12.550> dead<00:02:13.550> trees<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.330> you've<00:02:15.050> got<00:02:15.260> trees

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
recently dead trees and you've got trees

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.620 
recently dead trees and you've got trees
that<00:02:15.800> have<00:02:15.890> been<00:02:16.010> dead<00:02:16.250> for<00:02:16.520> millions<00:02:17.300> of

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
that have been dead for millions of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.350 
that have been dead for millions of
years<00:02:18.069> those<00:02:19.069> are<00:02:19.220> under<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.580> ground<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.180> so

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
years those are under the ground and so

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.790 
years those are under the ground and so
that<00:02:20.569> that's<00:02:21.110> there's<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.709> relationship

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
that that's there's that relationship

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.830 
that that's there's that relationship
carbon<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> basic<00:02:25.660> elements<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
carbon is a basic elements of the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.430 
carbon is a basic elements of the
universe<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.580> what<00:02:29.200> everything<00:02:30.200> is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
universe and it's what everything is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.250 
universe and it's what everything is
built<00:02:30.739> on<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.400> really<00:02:31.580> important<00:02:32.260> also

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
built on so it's really important also

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.860 
built on so it's really important also
the<00:02:33.680> materials<00:02:34.250> are<00:02:34.610> particularly<00:02:35.450> beautiful

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
the materials are particularly beautiful

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.250 
the materials are particularly beautiful
because<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.890> mean<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.370> black<00:02:37.580> coal<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.780> carbon

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
because I mean the black coal the carbon

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.210 
because I mean the black coal the carbon
as<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.560> were<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:41.390> very<00:02:41.750> very<00:02:41.989> powerful<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.739> and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
as it were is very very powerful and and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.680 
as it were is very very powerful and and
you<00:02:43.430> don't<00:02:43.580> often<00:02:43.940> see<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:45.290> as<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> material

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
you don't often see it as a material

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.990 
you don't often see it as a material
we'd<00:02:47.690> burn<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.080> but<00:02:48.260> we<00:02:48.410> don't<00:02:48.650> look<00:02:49.220> at<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.640> and

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
we'd burn it but we don't look at it and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.540 
we'd burn it but we don't look at it and
so<00:02:50.180> here<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.170> some<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:51.950> related

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
so here it is and it's some it's related

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.550 
so here it is and it's some it's related
to<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.850> wood<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.540> woods<00:02:53.780> charred<00:02:54.320> as

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
to the wood in that the woods charred as

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.880 
to the wood in that the woods charred as
well<00:02:54.830> so<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.370> wood<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.060> carbonized<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:57.140> work<00:02:57.680> is

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
well so the wood is carbonized a work is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.150 
well so the wood is carbonized a work is
never<00:02:58.160> just<00:02:58.730> one<00:02:59.239> thing<00:02:59.720> the<00:03:00.620> things<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.040> I

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
never just one thing the things that I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.120 
never just one thing the things that I
make<00:03:01.430> have<00:03:01.730> layers<00:03:02.110> in<00:03:03.110> them<00:03:03.440> if<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.739> look<00:03:03.950> at

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
make have layers in them if you look at

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.850 
make have layers in them if you look at
them<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.489> think<00:03:05.000> about<00:03:05.300> them<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.410> that's<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
them and think about them and that's the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.740 
them and think about them and that's the
point<00:03:07.070> of<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.459> work<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.970> has<00:03:08.150> many<00:03:08.420> many

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
point of this work it has many many

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.380 
point of this work it has many many
layers<00:03:09.079> it's<00:03:09.500> not<00:03:09.739> it's<00:03:10.340> not<00:03:10.549> just<00:03:10.850> about<00:03:11.000> one

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
layers it's not it's not just about one

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.810 
layers it's not it's not just about one
