00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.130
 hello today I will explain how to make a 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.130
 rise survey or ramp rise 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.830
 let's imagine that we are a situation in 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.720
 an uphill traffic light is worth 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.920
 as you already know here we have the clutch 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.920
 the brake and accelerator 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.360
 clutch tread depth 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.740
 we take and step on the brake 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.750
 OK 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.579
 and we have our first prepared 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.579
 we prepare our first 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.060
 and then we do the following 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.660
 the clutch 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.960
 in many cars are different there 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.810
 cars that with a point that is with 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.420
 lift a foot the car already 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.150
 begins to flex and the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.020
 clutch engage the engine and start 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.470
 how to walk 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.600
 there are cars that need like two points 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 like two thirds or there are cars that 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.900
 they need half pedal raised so that 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.160
 the car before 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.770
 then we test with our car worth 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.280
 we started with a third 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.740
 and if we see that the car does not start 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.299
 move starts as foot skill 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.119
 the more you live in the foot better by 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.670
 what because the car is almost there 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.179
 coupled the clutch is almost docked 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.829
 to the engine then we go testing 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.990
 we loose a clutch 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.450
 I have released two tips right now and 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.049
 I'm going to jump the brake 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.720
 and now if you realize the car is 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.650
 hold 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.810
 you are already seeing that the car we have it 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.690
 held by the clutch the brake 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.680
 stylizing and will realize that the car 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.890
 it holds 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.900
 Well, it's the point, look for point 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.170
 when the car starts as like 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.700
 vibrate and if it starts to vibrate in the foot and 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.700
 start looking at almost the entire car 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.780
 what we do 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.599
 in another traffic light for example it has 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.750
 put in green for himself without nerves 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:23.570
 or nothing we have the car almost ready 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.319
 If it's a lot of survey, we accelerate a 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.939
 little more 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.060
 and then we release the clutch 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:33.970
 little by little very little by little 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:39.020
 and we have it 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.420
 here we have the ramp up 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.100
 imagine that we are parked we are 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.040
 parked 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.050
 I'm good 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.860
 we are marked on a sidewalk worth 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.720
 then here 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.170
 put an example that is in the cars 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.170
 marked 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.360
 a trick 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.879
 if for whatever reason we get nervous 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.960
 at the time of going out and giving that there's a lot 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.400
 cost 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.400
 we have to do the following 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.819
 stop mom not removed 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.609
 OK 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.160
 and we step on the brake we are the brake and 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.050
 Pisa also expected fo 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.670
 and so 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.670
 if we see that our mirror 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.490
 in the car behind we had a 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.100
 margin 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.390
 we had a space 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.250
 then we will turn the steering wheel 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.100
 everything we could to the right 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.330
 what about turn right the car 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.400
 have today 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.090
 towards the sidewalk 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.090
 OK 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.459
 it does not look good here 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.630
 it looks good there is worth 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.880
 and then we can release the brake 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.030
 our car is supported by the 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:17.190
 steel vale 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:21.090
 for the same thing from before our fund 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:25.230
 and how do we have the car? 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.840
 sustained by the sidewalk we just have to 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.699
 catch our first 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:37.320
 turn the steering wheel all to the left 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:41.420
 ok we signaled then 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.710
 We seek the point of free or accelerate 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.689
 releasing clutch little by little 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.909
 and ready 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.809
 Well, nothing, these are both 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.809
 tips I give today
