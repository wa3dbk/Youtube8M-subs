00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.080
 polanski your ticket the sea 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.149
 if I decide to make this kind of video tutorial 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:13.539
 to show more - how is the process of making the table of san 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.119
 borja 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.269
 the wooden one I think very simple 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.269
 very clear for people who want to do this 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.339
 carmen flowers 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.999
 on the internet there is a lot of material about how the tables tell you a material 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.470
 to use 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.449
 the procedure to use 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.129
 but in most cases with a certain I have realized that no 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.290
 there is an accurate response 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.190
 mainly and if the table work as they finally work 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.970
 fruit of its preparation 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.970
 jpc important and that there is no more follow-up from the beginning 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.740
 of the golden harvest adapts to the end showing by the way some photos the 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.340
 arrival of the concession 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.990
 by which was made such n one of the pages that I recommend bari 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.620
 crucis on the subject of how to make the tables 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.800
 on the pages both points efe there based on a tutorial on images it 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.360
 show how to take the step by step the wigan it improvise invent 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.840
 Cuba with the measures and designs to get continued 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.250
 I leave it with the video lily 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.250
 explained - like oak palace room but that is to your liking 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.550
 ibeas 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.480
 good and I think that as the whole process is using 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.580
 of a shoe to perform 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.720
 in the sand 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 the main thing 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.540
 but obviously the wood 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.310
 the carnival against several spaces where you can be the first team in 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 use in this case the club and are the wine prices 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.950
 in about 1 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.190
 12 15 millimeters of you can already see the piece of wood in the Senate 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.870
 pt is approximately 28 centimeters in its base 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.720
 and with a total length of 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.890
 one meter thirty one meter forty one meter fifty the forum the sizes of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.450
 which can vary and well and as they say at the beginning the idea 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.610
 aburto person 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.680
 but depending on the size that one has 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.250
 As I said it is a theme of the third of pine 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.669
 you can see here 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:09.549
 The spesor 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.729
 they are approximately 15 millimeters 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.039
 You can see that I tell you, I do not have to be satisfied. 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.679
 He worked as a 15-mm citizen voice 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.179
 to be able to play with it but surprise since it has a direct layer 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.029
 in the 15 states 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.029
 that everything I can appreciate that is a hundred 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.009
 submerged in water 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.169
 on the internet expensive wood reader is mainly needed 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.939
 between them is a single day to do it darrat who had it again 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.629
 gave this race back and that is not enough 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.629
 ideally this shocking patience 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.269
 and around this week pretty much 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.169
 one can already achieve the bending that they want the wood in another very important 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.939
 which is to use a matrix 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.489
 always want it 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.659
 to survive 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.169
 ideal curro 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.169
 we know that you will be able to appreciate in the following photo ap below 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.769
 also as they tell you that the ideal of 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.599
 in the second the cidh to be able to facilitate his seat his place doubts his 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.429
 premiere 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:16.939
 telephone according to 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.639
 a matrix where to do it and in this case providers in a mother who has 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.069
 much more than a meter sixty since the zone of son bosc does not rise the nasa 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.269
 length 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.979
 and you can also appreciate 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.419
 what this place where according to the curve and we exert the pressure 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.979
 this also like the such action little criterion that is long what 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.370
 ideal would be to do this encierro but in my case he preferred to use wood for his 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:38.329
 ease 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.559
 to work the earth to walk and there are those who 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:45.609
 the pressure that is exerted when one has treated the washing machine does a lot 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.989
 strong which can deform the matrix 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.620
 end in this case showed band easy to climb repair 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:53.919
 ya but eye 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.379
 neither leave the multi long time inside the guayaquil 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.369
 remember that it is a precious thing that is 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.649
 a dome an employment coupling 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:08.439
 of a certain amount of layer of pine wood and which being low I do a lot 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.239
 time some of them may come off however, although I think that between 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.069
 5 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.879
 six days even certain is that the bonus to keep them under water to achieve 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:17.729
 a country 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.459
 a Syrian curve 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.030
 good that you can appreciate that on the other side this table is a table 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.319
 they think because it was submerged in water 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.189
 has already been fixed 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.750
 i one of your train with you can see 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.750
 Brazil a jury 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.090
 so it happens at 2 pm according to ana cities 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.699
 a table that has one 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.090
 a curve of approximately 1 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 17 centimeters 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.420
 iranzo claim straight because after a stop we want to work it and 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.960
 use them mainly speed football at the moment they are carlos luna 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.840
 as the table says and that's how it was 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.120
 choose does not have a final list you can appreciate what you are seeing 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.499
 sunburned 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:07.550
 thomas p 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.749
 for the feet 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.749
 the explanation is what they are called 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.720
 if you can see they are already marked, they are already perforated in the photo 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.139
 Responsible I know what are the best materials to use 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.330
 also as I told you the ideal percent manufactures the table 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.770
 well it has been in a model it is always good 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.370
 but do not stay with that but invite them to the afp 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.050
 to invent in a certain way to innovate the best table in which I 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.050
 you mÃ¡laga according to your needs here you can see that it is totally 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.609
 I fought scientific percentage in this plane where bullets perforations 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.710
 the block in the curves the length of the table and depending on the need 

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:51.629
 to promote hatred for this newspaper 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.639
 but finally in new york 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.249
 2 - the largest number of streets were made according to my perception and 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.249
 i anyway little 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.050
 well here you can appreciate four table nurturing a much bigger future 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.240
 of the money market really has a length of approximately 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.229
 one meter or 40 one meter 30 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:21.059
 in effect for the longer infant they are approximately one meter fifty 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:22.240
 of length 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.330
 with their respective juries 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.860
 in both extremes 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.110
 n the drought difference 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.719
 end in effect rebound after appreciating 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.729
 the curve more pronounced 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:33.699
 than in the previous 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:37.330
 independent that is an instant panacea also decided to leave this 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.830
 steeper curves of art 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.419
 by the fact of equiling has made sand many times that the table 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.139
 it's about the difference the previous the truth that 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.809
 the popular sectors 1 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.240
 he had a complete unique brain 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.670
 because it is still making certain modifications nadal itself 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:59.629
 another important thing to note that in this area it is reduced to being of greater 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:01.270
 length has been decided 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.960
 the embassy the professor of the same 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.870
 doing side approximately 15 millimeters leaving it welcomes mothers 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.430
 they are fixing the imperfection espinel 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.430
 on the front of the table to say it somehow 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.699
 in this sector you can also not reside in chile 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.599
 there is no listing or I have finished 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.199
 recommendation when they work how was the life of a potosÃ­ and oruro floor all 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:29.930
 timber 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.499
 patek essentially for 

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:35.649
 attached an adult of what work wood why do I say this 

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:39.709
 because many times he uses what is called the magic land lawyer a color 

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.889
 lead and moment of the rda 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:46.319
 not be operated any want in this coso 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.449
 beyond the tables that are paralyzed 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:51.929
 although I work with dignity in education to paint everything 

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:54.119
 heaven 

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:55.759
 the table have 

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:58.899
 they have a final and that painted with varnish 

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:00.610
 pt the most important part of what is
