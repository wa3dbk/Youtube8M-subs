00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.240
 sure everyone has their own boiling point 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.160
 when evil is captured 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.100
 head when you want to destroy 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.790
 troublemaker when 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.470
 words cut sharper than razor exists in 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.910
 alternate universe marpol 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.180
 a man whose best not to take out 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.670
 the consequences may be 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.279
 irreparable 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.039
 my name is romance and today we are together 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.199
 try to comprehend the court to grow 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:27.820
 hulk 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.610
 find out and maple is incredible 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.100
 how to describe it and understand why the phrase 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.100
 both already he turns into a hulk 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.990
 call incommensurable fear 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.179
 in the eyes of a superhero marvel universe 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.049
 nothing foretold trouble when in 2003 

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:43.149
 on the wide screen came out in the first hulk 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.839
 first week of the film is worthy 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.399
 collected 62 million dollars and here 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.869
 the next couple of weeks reduced income then 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:52.539
 which is half as much as 4 and later on he is eight 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.340
 times crazy numbers 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.630
 Naturally hulk failed not caused 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.230
 interest and ahead of time was announced 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.130
 failure project the reason for this 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.080
 powerful interest from the audience 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.540
 the screenplay was a film turned out 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.900
 hard fighters rather mediocre 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.090
 art house you feel too 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.010
 the absurdity of the situation try right 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.990
 now unite yourself in the head these two 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 words hal 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.000
 the house ended up with a shop until 2008 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.690
 when near term 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.720
 the avengers loomed and the green giant 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.900
 back studio marvel took up 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.270
 self remake hulk it 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.420
 the studio did everything it could to 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.910
 step on old rake 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.970
 the approach justified itself because their senate 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 the name has become so much that there is hardly any 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.360
 one unhappy 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.790
 if the action in the first movie 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.960
 spun mostly around military base 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.980
 then the new director sends his 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.320
 hero travel 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.360
 brisbane hiding in brazilian 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.959
 corrected 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.619
 and the thing is that after the accident 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.199
 case he was locked in a room with 

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:50.320
 deadly gas 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.180
 which instead of killing the main 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.940
 the hero gives him doubtful 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.070
 superpowers rage he 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.460
 turns green giant 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.220
 which has incredible power all 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.229
 nothing but he loses control of himself 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.910
 they are all thirsty 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:04.639
 destroy 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.699
 so hide catfish because behind it 

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:08.249
 include governments to 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.179
 grab the bruce explore the water 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.409
 use this data for 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.609
 making super soldier bayan 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.209
 The way the account differs because of 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.599
 secret correspondence with a specialist 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.299
 the essence of the matter to learn ways 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.469
 self control 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.040
 but also earn at a local factory by 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.790
 soda production 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.879
 he was let down by blood 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.529
 gets into the bottle you purchased 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.779
 an older american sat refrain from such 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:31.919
 cocktails significantly more than usual and 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.900
 soon the bruce had to do legs 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.750
 the most brilliant comics movies 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.480
 so this is what those for whom you are watching this 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.280
 the film does not appear immediately 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.800
 first tells the story of the appearance 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.260
 introduce all the characters 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.000
 tired of talking but only then when 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.080
 seemingly all hope is lost 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.110
 superhero appears it all 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.250
 concerns and hulka action and of course 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.240
 I want from the first minutes and instead 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.060
 we are looking at hljupika edward norton hulki 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.000
 like a product it wouldn't sound like that to me 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.459
 enough was the hulk and if you're a spectator 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.840
 I agree with me, that means I am alive for a reason 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.950
 In my opinion the movie a lot of water 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.400
 unnecessary conversations and take away the fact that I 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.360
 told you the very beginning about what 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.849
 you won't be bored either 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.209
 awake irresistible 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.769
 desire to rewind moments 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.620
 because hulk appears on the screen 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.230
 only four times to Athens goes two 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.239
 hours most of the time you will be 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.409
 try to impose the atmosphere and the spirit of it 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.250
 superhero 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.710
 forgetting that the hulk himself is a walking one 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.090
 the atmosphere but even more it is as if 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.950
 your friend would tell you 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.539
 how incredible she was in the sauna 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:37.809
 with three men 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.069
 sure you just remembered saying 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.359
 better to see also the hulks once 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.539
 how would not clog the us government about 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.689
 that the hulk is dangerous and destroy everything in its 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.309
 ways i would love to 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:50.889
 looked at it all personally than listen 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:51.980
 three military 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.080
 the film is generally not bad especially if 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.400
 consider special effects plot not 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.340
 Liv Tyler remembered at all 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.619
 lord of the rings 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.839
 even tears are missing in the same way 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.139
 The main cat of course was born in Russia 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.119
 although it has an unusual Russian surname 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:10.419
 Yablonski and the name is generally unspeakable but 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.159
 since the first half of the film he 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.159
 it seems like the interface script is not yet ready 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.589
 knurled us to 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.209
 this hero is very difficult for you to live in the USA 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.169
 say and a man is generally better not to have 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.469
 half sphere but the brain work a man on 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.650
 the parts are hit by the stupidity of passersby 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.599
 running back and forth along the street and 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.689
 waiting until the feet are sharp or 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.759
 brooch on the boomerang machine quality them 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.689
 the height to this hero I have a few 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.680
 logical questions and for example why hulk 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.610
 pants and increases with size 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.680
 body she is only 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.620
 a little rukhovtsy in the field of the knee or 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.370
 when the halg save to be from the explosion 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.729
 helicopter why in such a fire network 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.210
 what now burns to the ground 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.810
 it is not clear yablonski vkolol himself 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.770
 dhl hulk turns out to be no pants and genital 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.490
 signs here unwittingly die 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.789
 break right and left true 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.729
 the idea of ​​the film remained unclear 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.939
 two monsters overgrown half the city 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.089
 no all curtain 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:05.199
 no you I was waiting for the hulk to continue 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.819
 very disappointed this norton tap 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.869
 unpleasant tee does not look at all 

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:12.009
 This role is the place of Tim Company mercenary 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.109
 Russia is better to take on this place Dolph 

00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:16.229
 at least he would look worse 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.219
 the film was a sail dorovskih 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.169
 when a green man appeared 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.889
 was beginning to destroy the us army 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.800
 but between these moments stretched 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.499
 such a nude with obviously stretched boring 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:28.249
 stories that sometimes it would be possible 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.460
 hospital and not lose the essence of the plot 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.569
 looked ridiculous when hulk steadfastly 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.370
 endured a good portion of machine guns 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.990
 bursts of direct hit projectile 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.790
 to help 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.180
 and although dad here's a simple clumsiness 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.090
 hitting his head on the ceiling of the cave a little 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.290
 did not faint but the pros still have 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.760
 green monster himself for example which 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.720
 really scary 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.680
 when he starts turning into tula 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.190
 I think the whole calendar to all living things 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.090
 neglected the main villains 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.350
 Respectively I received a salmon 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.830
 in this moment even closed his eyes and squinted 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.289
 grimace soundless 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.750
 x yes it broke notably 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.200
 just like it so much 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.100
 echoes dramaturgy which 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.330
 in my opinion it remained a germ but 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.170
 for trying to introduce at least some 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.330
 extraneous idea not related to hulk 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.669
 honor and respect 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.029
 how can you destroy the enemy which 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:17.409
 his anger becomes in 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.840
 several times more powerful and so why 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.800
 the phrase tony stark from the movie the avengers has 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.499
 perfectly reasonable and motivated 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:27.499
 I have the right to the rocks 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.289
 in conclusion I want to say that he 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:30.879
 incredible 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.770
 Hulk cocktail in my opinion is not hopeless 0 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.809
 god knows i advise you to watch him 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:38.490
 using rewind take care of your time 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.520
 the hulk was the fourth superhero of 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.630
 media teams that will come together 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.530
 consequences for land protection 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.970
 Captain America Tony 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.410
 starku their conclusion holcomb turned for 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.480
 I am thorny I learned a lot from 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.870
 This time but experience as they say you will not drink 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.840
 so your whole urge to do something 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.060
 quality and interesting I left 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.949
 for our future stars 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.990
 film avengers to get familiar with 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.490
 review on the media personally and not listen to my 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.620
 The corpse in the review plowed as subscribe to 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.680
 channels do not forget to share your 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.860
 opinion with you was a sensual romance 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.409
 hul by chat beauty and yablonski with 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:15.509
 the endless effect of easy unshaven 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.330
 Best regards, thanks for watching and
