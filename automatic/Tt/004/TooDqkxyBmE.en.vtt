00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
maybe 2 to 3 spoons and then add the

maybe 2 to 3 spoons and then add the
date<00:04:28.750> paste<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.820> this<00:04:31.750> is<00:04:31.900> according<00:04:32.290> to

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
date paste and this is according to

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.470 
date paste and this is according to

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
taste because you know the dates vary in

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.390 
taste because you know the dates vary in
significance<00:04:34.690> okay<00:04:35.590> so<00:04:35.650> we'll<00:04:35.950> just<00:04:36.160> cook

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
significance okay so we'll just cook

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.840 
significance okay so we'll just cook
through<00:04:36.670> now<00:04:36.880> yeah<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:38.140> it<00:04:38.260> is<00:04:38.380> drier<00:04:39.100> it<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.670> I

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
through now yeah and it is drier it is I

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.870 
through now yeah and it is drier it is I
am<00:04:40.030> nicely<00:04:40.630> as<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:41.140> would<00:04:41.290> normally<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:42.430> also

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
am nicely as it would normally I also

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.330 
am nicely as it would normally I also
think<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.330> lot<00:04:43.510> to<00:04:43.540> do<00:04:43.750> with<00:04:43.780> taste<00:04:44.290> me<00:04:44.620> know<00:04:44.800> is

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
think a lot to do with taste me know is

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.940 
think a lot to do with taste me know is
how<00:04:45.850> you<00:04:45.910> train<00:04:46.390> your<00:04:46.690> brain<00:04:46.870> at<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.650> end<00:04:47.800> of

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
how you train your brain at the end of

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.670 
how you train your brain at the end of
the<00:04:48.070> day<00:04:48.220> because<00:04:49.030> if<00:04:49.240> you've<00:04:49.570> had<00:04:50.380> a

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
the day because if you've had a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.530 
the day because if you've had a
particular<00:04:51.250> taste<00:04:51.550> from<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.880> time<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.450> you

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
particular taste from the time that you

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.360 
particular taste from the time that you
were<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.690> kid

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
were a kid

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.320 
were a kid
obviously<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:54.520> taste<00:04:54.730> is<00:04:54.970> would<00:04:55.180> you<00:04:55.300> like

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
obviously that taste is would you like

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.930 
obviously that taste is would you like
for<00:04:55.630> example<00:04:56.050> make<00:04:56.260> then<00:04:57.070> when<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.370> make<00:04:57.610> say

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
for example make then when you make say

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.060 
for example make then when you make say
an<00:04:58.000> almond<00:04:58.330> milk<00:04:58.600> we<00:04:59.229> take<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.470> while

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
an almond milk we take a while

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.570 
an almond milk we take a while
then<00:05:00.280> we<00:05:00.430> imagine<00:05:01.090> there<00:05:01.360> is

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
then we imagine there is

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.820 
then we imagine there is
you<00:05:01.879> ever<00:05:02.060> get<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.300> brain<00:05:02.659> used<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.199> saying<00:05:03.439> yes

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
you ever get a brain used to saying yes

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.890 
you ever get a brain used to saying yes
this<00:05:04.129> is<00:05:04.280> another<00:05:04.520> sort<00:05:05.000> of<00:05:05.120> milk<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.659> it's

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
this is another sort of milk and it's

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.110 
this is another sort of milk and it's
slowly<00:05:06.169> but<00:05:06.470> surely<00:05:06.669> it's<00:05:07.669> not<00:05:07.879> accurate

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
slowly but surely it's not accurate

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.270 
slowly but surely it's not accurate
that's<00:05:08.689> the<00:05:08.900> thing<00:05:09.080> yeah<00:05:09.199> because<00:05:09.560> I'm<00:05:09.860> not

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
that's the thing yeah because I'm not

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.850 
that's the thing yeah because I'm not
trying<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.669> say<00:05:10.849> that<00:05:11.780> this<00:05:12.379> is<00:05:12.590> going<00:05:12.740> to

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
trying to say that this is going to

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.679 
trying to say that this is going to
taste<00:05:13.069> like<00:05:13.219> the<00:05:13.580> dude<00:05:13.759> that<00:05:13.939> you're<00:05:14.090> used<00:05:14.330> to

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:14.689 
taste like the dude that you're used to

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.770 
taste like the dude that you're used to
no<00:05:14.930> your<00:05:15.319> palate<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:15.919> going<00:05:16.370> to<00:05:16.580> change<00:05:16.969> you

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
no your palate is going to change you

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.209 
no your palate is going to change you

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
are going to find the difference you

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.980 
are going to find the difference you
might<00:05:19.460> actually<00:05:19.699> miss<00:05:20.150> the<00:05:20.330> Dairy<00:05:20.509> Milk<00:05:20.689> for<00:05:20.930> a

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
matter of time so as they say taste is

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.999 
matter of time so as they say taste is
all<00:05:25.009> in<00:05:25.159> the<00:05:25.280> head<00:05:25.930> okay<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:28.030> here<00:05:29.030> is<00:05:29.389> what<00:05:29.629> the

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.980 

huh<00:05:46.190> I<00:05:46.870> can<00:05:47.870> tell<00:05:48.310> it's<00:05:49.310> just<00:05:49.699> I'm<00:05:50.479> not<00:05:50.690> missing

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
the sugar it is really really good yeah

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.119 
the sugar it is really really good yeah
I<00:05:54.680> think<00:05:54.800> this<00:05:55.129> is<00:05:55.310> done<00:05:55.490> yeah<00:05:56.650> we<00:05:57.650> now<00:05:57.860> have<00:05:58.099> a

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
I think this is done yeah we now have a

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:59.019 
I think this is done yeah we now have a
Gajar<00:05:58.490> ka<00:05:58.520> halwa

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029 
Gajar ka halwa

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.850 
Gajar ka halwa
that<00:05:59.210> is<00:05:59.360> totally<00:05:59.810> dairy-free<00:06:00.169> made<00:06:00.680> with

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
that is totally dairy-free made with

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.850 
that is totally dairy-free made with
almond<00:06:01.310> milk<00:06:01.639> there's<00:06:02.360> no<00:06:02.659> sugar<00:06:02.900> instead<00:06:03.680> we

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
almond milk there's no sugar instead we

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.459 
almond milk there's no sugar instead we
have<00:06:04.009> dates<00:06:04.629> reason<00:06:05.629> enough<00:06:05.900> I<00:06:06.139> think<00:06:06.289> to

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469 
have dates reason enough I think to

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:33.129 
have dates reason enough I think to
certify<00:06:07.069> it<00:06:07.129> is<00:06:07.340> guilt<00:06:07.580> free

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.199 

you
