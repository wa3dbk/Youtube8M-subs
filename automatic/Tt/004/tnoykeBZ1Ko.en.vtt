00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:14.609
 it's not that the camper controls it in the camper 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:21.180
 in the middle of the ball 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:25.710
 here I am, here I am campaign songs or 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.240
 four goals for you are a nerve games from 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.600
 all day at this creed game 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.750
 that you are stronger sense 48 hours of play 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.570
 all of us have been here for ten minutes 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.090
 let's play 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.800
 what did you get i would say it is 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.110
 blame for the fact that Giovanni does not have 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.060
 made the tutorial as never says there 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.759
 will succeed tutorial that no done at 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.130
 forfait ruby do not vote it done the light 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:57.750
 maison parato da vecchio is for this 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:08.940
 what facts you make pretty good goals 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:12.030
 lately in the middle possible part 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:19.190
 the dinner meeting on the counterattack emma 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:24.800
 dexter the lack as it will be saved 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:32.120
 how unbelievable they will be given 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:34.070
 brazil 14 34 last 14 seconds we need it 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.360
 a goal from the midfield 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.880
 we get at stake we hold ball 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.310
 runs 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:57.250
 little luck for dealing of love that gives 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:59.180
 only in the smooth still second goal 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.860
 victory 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.140
 if we counterattack the referee who 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.350
 not from recovery arm you can say it loud 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:10.100
 who did nothing 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:14.840
 what made zero assists zero saves 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:18.490
 zero throws but I do zero throws but has 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:22.160
 done what we need to suck it 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:27.440
 so guys we can say who is strong 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:30.940
 is the winner of the winner and camper and 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.940
 ester because bracciano did 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.880
 think if you were at risk of being bought 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.470
 win a table 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:46.430
 maybe there's a lot of hidden understanding 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:49.700
 hidden but so much then we do 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.600
 I like the kings and the next challenge is 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:58.400
 let's do it and spawn against dexter e 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:01.300
 15 thousand campers instead of having ten 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.300
 goal in only one team 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:04.550

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:18.379
 take the last same islands and also 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:24.199

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:28.389
