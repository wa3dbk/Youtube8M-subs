 of all athletic history match 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.880
 national then very happy that

 we know that it is already very welcome in 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.360
 social networks write us many 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.090
 messages or then very happy and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.240
 expectant to see what is or is the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.479
 hobby is already you know doing the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.210
 program the hobby that is here for the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.459
 teams and obviously you are 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.259
 from the side of one of the most important 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.450
 that is national athletic obviously that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.000
 people want so much and that's a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.710
 question that has nothing to do but 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 that it is obligatory to do it 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.000
 they are fans of the national like 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.960
 Presenters have nothing to do 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.960
 but they are fans of the national 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.270
 perfect mariana also the two well 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.209
 both but how is it going to be let's say the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.739
 methodology or the theme of the program 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.900
 it's going to be a half-hour program going to 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.810
 be a problem one hour they go to 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.720
 interview what kind of characters 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.580
 they are going to be in the stadium this is going to be 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.260
 a half hour program for now 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.840
 I think it's going to touch us to extend 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.110
 we are sure that yes but we are going to 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.120
 start with a half hour program 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.040
 we are going to have guests we are going to have 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.739
 we're going to have to go to stadiums too 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.200
 to accompany the team and take notes of 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.120
 there then it will be very fun and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.100
 is to transport more for example from 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.510
 get to know parties from many years ago that 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.220
 people no longer remember then it is 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.430
 continue to transport us not again until 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.170
 and to remember how wonderful it is is more 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.500
 let's say give an opinion on 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.020
 the technique or how they played the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.090
 footballers is more like recreating the 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.849
 people and have a good time too 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.980
 with some personal things 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.650
 some players' technicians something like 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.540
 more informal than people love to know 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.940
 let's say of the personal life of each of 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.440
 each athlete more or less like that there 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.239
 We were watching some pictures where 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.209
 they are recording what the locations are like 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.489
 they have a cd they are outdoors we are 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.610
 in this we are recording it in the 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.980
 soccer restaurant 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.750
 in the shopping center the est 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.420
 which by the way is a wonderful place 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.180
 you have to go to meet him it's fantastic the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.190
 museum has a museum 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.959
 and he's very thematic and it's a list 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.330
 very recording the location of us is 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.930
 excellent very happy with those who have 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.540
 recorded so far for example good 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.700
 So far we have had the luck of 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.200
 Aristy interviewing think it's a great 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.200
 level or for all then 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.760
 Lopez also helps the actor who is very 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.010
 Fanatic fan is the only national 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.680
 then we also have a note that 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.210
 with him and we have to also already be in 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.520

 Aja fans what is to say the truth is 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.120
 that if I wanted to accompany them once to the 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.290
 stadium to see how that support is and this 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.290
 it's nice that it's a commitment 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.560
 I'm a fan of eleven caldas but 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.630
 I also love the national and 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.710
