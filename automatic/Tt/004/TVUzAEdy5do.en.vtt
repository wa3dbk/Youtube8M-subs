00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.320
 Good guys, welcome to my channel, once again 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.820
 today we are going to make this effect 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.940
 It's very disgusting ... getting ready for Halloween 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.040
 I used a jelly 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.500
 you know that I usually use other types of products 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.420
 or I always try new things 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.589
 Today I wanted to try this jelly 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.380
 in the last video I made one at home, so today I wanted 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.052
 try a bought 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.660
 and the truth is that the effect is very cool 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.320
 it is an effect like open wound and stapled so very disgusting 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.840
 so if you want to see how we do 

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:55.964
 and I would give you lots of kisses 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.520
 if I had you close if you shared this video on facebook, let's start 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.680
 all the gelatin must be heated and I've decided 

00:01:05.784 --> 00:01:08.004
 heat in a bathroom Maria to control more 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.480
 the density and also that the temperature does not rise much 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.260
 of the product but also I advise you to try it on the front of your hand 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.760
 so you can check that the temperature is not too hot to apply on your face 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.420
 let's apply it in small quantities 

00:01:21.558 --> 00:01:24.498
 we are going to apply it mostly the most in the center 

00:01:24.498 --> 00:01:26.265
 and we will blur the edges 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.860
 it's a pretty sticky product so 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.420
 try as much as you can to blur the edges but do not worry because then 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.300
 we are going to work with water and they stay pretty well integrated 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.480
 I'm going to apply several layers to get thickness 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.680
 especially in the central area that is where I want to make the opening 

00:01:41.937 --> 00:01:43.937
 to create this effect open and simply then go 

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.417
 working the product little by little and be careful not to burn too much 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.340
 once we are happy with the amount I will blur the edges 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.240
 wetting my finger in water, I'm going to use my finger as a tool 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.560
 It is very easy and it will simply give us a 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.040
 greater integration to the face, and when we are 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.040
 happy or let dry or accelerate the process 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.200
 using a dryer with the setting of cold air 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.600
 and we apply the base that we want 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.720
 that is our correct base 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.100
 to fit with our face 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.440
 and in this case I'm going to use scissors to start cutting 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.120
 Gelatin is not like other products that can be 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.000
 use tweezers, or other type of spatulas or whatever 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.536
 here we need to cut 

00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:37.611
 and to create an opening effect we have to remove 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.220
 parts of the gelatin so that you see a very open effect 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.540
 and to give the touch asquerosete let's use 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.700
 a clotted blood also from Harpo 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.860
 and I'm going to apply it to the entire intern area of ​​the wound and on the walls 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.618
 of the skin, of the inner area 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.020
 to create this effect as you see with a single product we 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.420
 It will give an effect of depth and also of bleeding 

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.686
 very very cool, and to give an irritated effect 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.560
 I'm going to blur a little pink around the top edge 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.140
 of the wound closest to the wound 

00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:15.164
 and since I have freckles I will need to apply some 

00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:17.301
 little dots 

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:19.551
 with a brush with a brown 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.080
 so more clearly around the edge area to 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.865
 that integrates more to my skin 

00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:26.805
 then we will seal everything with translucent powders to avoid 

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:28.620
 the brightness of gelatin 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.700
 and as a final touch I'm going to stick some staples, I'm going to hit them with 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.340
 eyelash glue 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.900
 and I have cut the final part so they are much shorter 

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:40.008
 we're going to hit them all over the wound and that's it! 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.460
 This is our open wound with a stapling, with some staples! 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.640
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.120
 (blow of work) are works on the top floor 

00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:58.787
 and it is impossible to record without noise, I am very sorry 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.740
 I hope you liked this effect, as I will always leave the whole list 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.000
