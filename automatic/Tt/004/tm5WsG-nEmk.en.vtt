the plant that were made a few years ago
read<00:00:51.539> logical<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.430> very<00:00:53.430> steep<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.420> why

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
read logical and very steep that's why

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
read logical and very steep that's why
they've<00:00:54.840> been<00:00:55.050> planned<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:56.039> techniques

they've been planned with a techniques

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.660 
they've been planned with a techniques
back<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:58.079> necessarily<00:00:58.260> very<00:00:59.039> dangerous

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
back then not necessarily very dangerous

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.599 
back then not necessarily very dangerous
because<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:01.250> steep<00:01:02.250> Rock

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609

toned<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.320> pretty<00:01:13.530> much<00:01:13.650> know<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:13.979> we

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
toned and so we pretty much know that we

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.780 
toned and so we pretty much know that we
can<00:01:14.490> always<00:01:15.030> plus<00:01:15.630> place<00:01:16.110> our<00:01:16.619> our<00:01:17.159> gear<00:01:17.549> which

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
can always plus place our our gear which

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.190 
can always plus place our our gear which
is<00:01:17.820> cans<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.490> if<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.670> can't<00:01:20.970> find<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.540> solution

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
is cans and if we can't find a solution

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.300 
is cans and if we can't find a solution
maybe<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:24.259> there<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:25.799> that's

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
maybe get on there and that's that's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.480 
maybe get on there and that's that's
pretty<00:01:26.490> funny

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
free climbing on the Sun on the east and

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.600 
free climbing on the Sun on the east and
south<00:02:05.750> face<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.429> they<00:02:07.429> had<00:02:07.610> no<00:02:08.239> repetition<00:02:08.899> see

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
south face it they had no repetition see

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.710 
south face it they had no repetition see
because<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.820> this<00:02:11.060> petite<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:13.580> D<00:02:14.120> tends<00:02:14.450> to

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
because of this petite the D tends to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.630 
because of this petite the D tends to
form<00:02:15.670> partly<00:02:16.670> or<00:02:16.880> totally<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.630> ice<00:02:18.640> that's

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
form partly or totally on ice that's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.520 
form partly or totally on ice that's
very<00:02:20.120> cool

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.130 

last<00:02:24.530> year<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:25.040> made<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> rare<00:02:26.360> repeat<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:27.020> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
last year you made a rare repeat of the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.470 
last year you made a rare repeat of the
rani<00:02:27.349> root<00:02:27.709> on<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.010> west<00:02:28.370> face<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.880> cerro

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.540 
rani root on the west face of cerro
torre<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:31.690> last<00:02:32.690> year<00:02:32.930> we<00:02:33.230> we<00:02:33.770> were<00:02:33.920> able<00:02:34.190> to

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
torre so last year we we were able to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.949 
torre so last year we we were able to
give<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.540> try<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.880> weather<00:02:38.120> didn't

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
give it a try but the the weather didn't

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.790 
give it a try but the the weather didn't
allow<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.290> complete<00:02:40.280> our<00:02:40.550> plan<00:02:41.200> we<00:02:42.200> did<00:02:42.410> only

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
allow to complete our plan we did only

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.059 
allow to complete our plan we did only
the<00:02:43.459> first<00:02:43.730> start<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.600> that's<00:02:45.410> why<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.650> want<00:02:45.980> to

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
the first start and that's why I want to
