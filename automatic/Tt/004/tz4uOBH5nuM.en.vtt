00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.520
 to prepare 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.720

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.140
 that today show you in my life 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.820
 of getting ready some tips for 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.470
 help you prepare much more 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.759
 quickly and to silence all 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.930
 people who take you for a 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.939
 eternal latecomers 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 everything is a question of organization 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.809
 so what do I do to prepare the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.840
 watch at least a few hours before 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.300
 everything I would need 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.280
 I prepare my makeup maintained on 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.750
 always a plan b outfit in case my 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.020
 holding is no longer because it happens to me 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.930
 often and I morice moroccan 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.810
 be if I can I'm also preparing to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.460
 in advance so I take my shower or the 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.530
 Homemade I had there would be two 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.989
 hours before not to waste time 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.180
 and having it all clear in 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.579
 your head will allow you to lose 0 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.710
 seconds to think about these points there 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.329
 that you will go much more I like 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 a lot prepare me for music 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.799
 and if I can give you some advice on 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.440
 but it's really not to put the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.020
 music 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.910
 pedant knows how much time I lost 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.130
 to dance instead of brushing your teeth or 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.400
 to comb my hair or do anything 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.470
 be and the japd now for some 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.540
 quiet songs that are rare 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.460
 who gives me both fishing but who 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.850
 stay calm and do not get me 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.950
 to actually dance so there in this 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.220
 I really love listening to the album 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.500
 and kz2 ed sheeran which is both sweet 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.120
 but that also gives fishing that is 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.230
 a little bit of rhythm so there is definitely 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.050
 his who make you dance is 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.370
 certainly what calms and I like 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.050
 a lot this album to prepare myself for 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.000
 makeup I really recommend 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.400
 to go to the basics is to do this 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.229
 that you did for my part I am 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.530
 no eye makeup I do not know 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.780
 not even make me a smoky a nice smoby 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.870
 but I know that 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.190
 professional fault fossils 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.550
 so when I want pretty eyes 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.050
 makeup measures game what am I doing 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.240
 it's just to put false eyelashes 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.340
 and unsweetened in the skin of all 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.410
 two continue to wear makeup during 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.870
 I'm waiting for the glue to dry in all 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.700
 little bit it's really a secret that 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.930
 that puts a lot because I win at 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.209
 less than 30 seconds 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.980
 the same I keep a very natural complexion and 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.780
 also focuses on the most 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.110
 important for me to know the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.110
 eyebrows 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.150
 if you want to know all the 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.430
 products that I use in this 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.799
 makeup do not click the info bar 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.720
 or I read all the targeted products we are going 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.409
 to go to hair and there too I took 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.879
 advanced 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.159
 that is, the day before I applied 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.629
 all my care and tied my hair in 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.670
 a nice ponytail because that 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.470
 take a little time and I got 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.349
 lying with I just protect my 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.790
 hair with a satin scarf and the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.099
 far from me my hair is ready to 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:10.700
 enjoy I opt for an ultra hairstyle 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:12.590
 simple that is to say a bun I you 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.180
 also advise to make a cut at 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.120
 sieve takes the least amount of time possible 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.540
 who is nice who is nice and who 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.540
 is beautiful too 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.489
 it only remains to put on our 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.170
 held and we really hope that the half 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.349
 no hour we like and we do not have 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.540
 to opt for the plan b we put a little 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.370
 of perfume and that's it we are ready for 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.540

 ideas to prepare you in less than 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.050

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.340
