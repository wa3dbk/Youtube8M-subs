why he needs to be eatin cinnamon what

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.849 
why he needs to be eatin cinnamon what
it<00:00:16.049> can<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.590> you

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
it can do for you

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.760 
it can do for you
first<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.400> all<00:00:17.520> blood<00:00:18.300> sugar<00:00:18.600> regulation<00:00:18.930> it's

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
first of all blood sugar regulation it's

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.570 
first of all blood sugar regulation it's
basically<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> keep<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.510> main<00:00:22.580> hormone

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
basically going to keep the main hormone

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.320 
basically going to keep the main hormone
called<00:00:24.390> insulin<00:00:24.859> to<00:00:25.859> not<00:00:26.189> increase<00:00:26.820> too<00:00:27.119> much

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
called insulin to not increase too much

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330 
called insulin to not increase too much
you<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.689> when<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.960> eat<00:00:28.109> sugary<00:00:28.800> foods<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
you see when you eat sugary foods with a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.999 
you see when you eat sugary foods with a
high<00:00:29.429> glucose<00:00:30.119> foods<00:00:30.449> high<00:00:30.900> glycemic<00:00:31.170> what

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
high glucose foods high glycemic what

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.970 
high glucose foods high glycemic what
happens<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.750> these<00:00:33.899> sugar<00:00:34.500> crashes

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
happens is is we get these sugar crashes

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.110 
happens is is we get these sugar crashes
and<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:36.420> goes<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:37.050> high<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
and it goes up really high and then it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.600 
and it goes up really high and then it
crashes<00:00:39.660> down<00:00:39.690> low<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.469> when<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.219> too

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
crashes down low or when you have too

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.630 
crashes down low or when you have too
much<00:00:42.020> glucose<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.260> insulin<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.160> gonna<00:00:44.370> grab

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
much glucose the insulin is gonna grab

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580 
much glucose the insulin is gonna grab
it<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.969> store<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.270> into<00:00:45.480> where<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.350> guess

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it and store it into where you guess

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.310 
it and store it into where you guess
that<00:00:46.800> your<00:00:46.950> fats<00:00:47.280> are<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.879> blood<00:00:48.870> sugar

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that your fats are so blood sugar

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.350 
that your fats are so blood sugar
regulation<00:00:49.649> through<00:00:50.219> cinnamon<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> must

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
regulation through cinnamon is a must

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.080 
regulation through cinnamon is a must
it's<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.899> good<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> keep<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
it's really good to keep your the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.580 
it's really good to keep your the
insulin<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.300> bay<00:00:54.570> because<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:55.320> want<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
insulin at bay because we don't want to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.709 
insulin at bay because we don't want to
spike<00:00:55.920> also<00:00:56.399> too<00:00:56.460> high<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.660> said

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
spike also too high because like I said

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.330 
spike also too high because like I said
when<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> comes<00:00:58.199> crashing<00:00:58.620> down<00:00:58.800> crashing

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
when it comes crashing down crashing

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.720 
when it comes crashing down crashing
down<00:00:59.520> that's<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.590> hungry<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.340> it's

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
down that's when we get hungry and it's

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.490 
down that's when we get hungry and it's
gonna<00:01:02.969> lead<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.239> more<00:01:03.390> calories<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:04.170> eaten

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
gonna lead to more calories more eaten

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
gonna lead to more calories more eaten
food<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.210> bad

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
food it's just going to be a really bad

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.200 
food it's just going to be a really bad
cycle<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:07.500> need<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.430> basically<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
cycle that we don't need so basically it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.080 
cycle that we don't need so basically it
can<00:01:09.330> help<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.500> keeps<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> away<00:01:11.520> from

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
storing fat into our fat cells which we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
storing fat into our fat cells which we
definitely<00:01:15.479> don't<00:01:15.990> want<00:01:16.170> especially<00:01:17.159> when
