00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.680
 hi i am andre and this is the fabric and 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.680
 waterproof samsung galaxy xcover 2 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.860
 since we have a demo models of this 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.270
 xcover 2 I don't have all accessories 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.890
 of course the device itself 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.420
 included with it you get anyway 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.730
 included and adapter 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.939
 a micro usb cable and the battery that is 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.939
 already in it 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 see that the I score closer and closer 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.160
 at the top we find a speaker 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.510
 grill with the adjacent sensors and a front 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 facing camera 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.600
 well below that we find the screen and 4 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.799
 inch screen with a 480 by 800 pixels 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.839
 now we are going to look all the way at the bottom 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:44.909
 we find three physical buttons 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.100
 so really turk now say int is but button 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.559
 really physical are also a bit yes matte 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.369
 finished in between are nicely ribbed 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.799
 we go all the way to the bottom 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:53.549
 You can find the microphone here and find it here 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.860
 behind a cover 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:57.659
 the micro-usb connection that fits 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.070
 waterproof hidden 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.960
 then find here on the right 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.400
 we have a physical camera button so that's it 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.030
 useful because the screen does not respond 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.470
 Underwater 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.600
 but you can just do it underwater 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.439
 Take photos for example in those that you still have 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.450
 an on and off button 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.820
 and when we find ourselves going upstairs 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.970
 here the headset port that sits again 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.560
 again behind a cover 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.410
 we find another one on the left 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.990
 hole for a keycord and we find it 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.430
 here the volume keys then you go 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.380
 men look at the back still find it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.930
 a flash a speaker grill and 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.830
 of course the camera are 5 megapixel 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.970
 camera 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.860
 well the back that can be 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.470
 removed and currently we see here 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.090
 at the bottom of that it is therefore lured 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.970
 thing points to the left and we see that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 a year closed lock is this and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.240
 to lure 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.230
 pick up the coin or one 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.760
 screwdriver and then you turn 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.710
 according to the other side 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.300
 to my to the piece that that just 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.409
 is running and then you can do the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.409
 just remove the tailgate 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.530
 well the retarded is we see 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.420
 also here that there is a rubber seal 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.210
 so that with the battery 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.720
 no water can come well from the inside 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.150
 look 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.010
 then we find the yes here 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.960
 the battery if the battery then even 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.179
 find lifting under the battery still 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.720
 a micro sd card slot and a sim card 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.580
 Finally, let 's see how the xcover 2 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.500
 will work exactly this purpose him as a 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.570
 locks we see the device 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.910
 ride on android android 4 point one point 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.590
 two in this case we see the standard 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.050
 android widgets 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.160
 we also find your shortcuts for you 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.600
 can of course also completely to your own 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.070
 arrange taste 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 there is still a shell over it 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.580
 samsung itself 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.959
 So you're seeing him put 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.420
 and the best that samsung has to offer 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.830
 and yet the notification center you 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.540
 so you can equate things quickly 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.220
 You can also adjust brightness 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.780
 adjust the screen you ca n't 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.850
 have it done automatically for that 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.840
 does not have this phone 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.160
 sensor 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.930
 we still find the settings menu here 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.540
 that is different from the older one 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.660
 Versions of Android speaks for itself 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.280
 all good yes reasonable for themselves 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.780
 can find physical buttons whatever 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.940
 is naturally also fine 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.070
 because you are like something dirty or something 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.470
 then the screen or a home button responds 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.700
 never responds so well to the rest 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.980
 from here for example the aprica belt 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.030
 see and see what it looks like 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.590
 we can easily go through emails 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.120
 scrolling nowadays as we meet here 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.709
 right side is grabbing we also see 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.730
 equal the date in the middle 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.380
 so then we can go right after a certain 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.989
 date jump handy if you have one 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.310
 very long inbox for example 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.080
 the rest find a number of standard ones 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.440
 included Samsung apps and widgets 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.489
 such as video help and my music widget 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.160
 if you click on this you will find a 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.900
 overview of all applications and those 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.120
 you can find it here 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.370
 then we go back for a moment you are all about one 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.930
 guide duo core processor so that takes care of it 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.670
 that everything is going well 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.170
 and sometimes if you have some really heavy ones 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.489
 open applications simultaneously has not 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.530
 somewhat trickier 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.030
 the screen has a resolution of 800 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.709
 at 480 pixels 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.780
 well what does that look like if we then 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.760
 just grab a nice trailer and 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.200
 those that are going to play can immediately see how 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.600
 This screen sees the skin as something 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.370
 to play 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.930
 so the sound 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.579
 yes it sounds pretty clean but it does 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.019
 came bill heart 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.690
 well it is of course a substance and 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.579
 Waterproof device can be one meter below 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.900
 water are half an hour before that 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.750
 is it certified 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.200
 well then we can test it right away 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.329
 if we hold the bucket of water there and we 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.359
 just a bowl of water here and we 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.340
 can just throw the device in here 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.950
 while the movie is playing 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.780
 the video will also continue to play 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.690
 can see that bothered by it 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.190
 water are some reflection but it 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.820
 movie will continue to play under 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.170
 water 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.820
 it's interesting because you also have one 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.220
 can take photo under water because there too 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.590
 just a normal camera button 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.610
 Talk about photo and video 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.440
 watch the photo and video 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.700
 functionalities of this device 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.900
 we can already have camera mutation on two 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.490
 Ways start because of the 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.010
 shortcut or simply by pressing the 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.930
 physical button like that then do 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.310
 can also immediately take a photo by pressing 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.350
 clicking the screen or the physical 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.190
 hold the buttons halfway and follow 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.170
 just by pressing 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.030
 well we see it then very quickly and 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.740
 can easily take a photo for it 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.850
 you can right at the bottom in the gallery 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.870
 see back 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.370
 I can here on the right 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.950
 of course also with screen a photo 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.480
 and you can still sit here 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.870
 video modes we will soon go to 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.820
 look 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.410
 well on the left you can switch 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.410
 between the front and back facing camera 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.140
 then you see the front facing camera that 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.570
 not of very high quality but he 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.010
 makes sure you just yes 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.900
 easy as can video call or so 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.200
 see and yet could see then go again 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.630
 back to the beak facing camera in that 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.870
 the flash settings 4 the scene for 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.160
 choice or the photo in your file 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.200
 for example, I have a panorama one 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.480
 make a shot or a continuous shop 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.790
 which continues to fail to find row 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.410
 another setting here sort of yes 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.180
 instagram mighty settings you see 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.330
 that they are applied equally to 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.040
 the screen will momentarily put normal and 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.840
 below you will find standard 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.490
 normal settings 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.080
 so year example as white balance iso 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.700
 values ​​can also be done manually here 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.590
 To adjust 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.000
 and you can do everything yourself on the left 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.320
 organizer is no tomorrow 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.150
 flash setting that want to see how they 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.220
 pressed longer and you can just do this 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.380
 for example with the white balance 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.030
 settings then grab those and drag 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.680
 who go there and you can do this completely 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.030
 to your own liking 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.240
 we now also have a look at one 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.740
 movie what was made with this device 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.140
 we see shot in a movie with the 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.020
 samsung galaxy xcover 2 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.300
 the movie shot in 27 b which is also the 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.170
 Maximum resolution is the sound coming 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.170
 from the device itself 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.960
 the color reproduction of the screen of the 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.580
 xcover 2 is not as good as we are 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.810
 are accustomed to samsung 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.060
 in addition, the device is also not 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.040
 complete back the ice ie 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.040
 It is not entirely made to care the 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.710
 to survive 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.120
 the xcover 2 is dust and waterproof he 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.530
 can be submerged for half an hour 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.120
 without any problems 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.560
 in addition, it is what you would 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.030
 expect from this unit 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.800
 well put together and get through 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.240
 fine materials
