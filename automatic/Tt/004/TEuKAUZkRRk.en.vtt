00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
those were the guys who made the other

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.490 
those were the guys who made the other
fantastic<00:00:47.989> Transformers<00:00:48.989> titles<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.469> are

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
fantastic Transformers titles they are

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.729 
fantastic Transformers titles they are
not<00:00:49.710> making<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.750> too<00:00:51.780> Activision

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.279 
pushed it out in time for the movie's
release<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.739> chances<00:00:56.190> are<00:00:56.340> developer<00:00:57.329> can't

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
release so chances are developer can't

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.810 
release so chances are developer can't
remember<00:00:58.469> exactly<00:00:58.649> who's<00:00:59.190> developing<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> but

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
remember exactly who's developing it but

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.790 
remember exactly who's developing it but
chances<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:01.079> did<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:01.680> enough

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
chances are that they did not get enough

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.039 
chances are that they did not get enough
time<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.760> fully<00:01:03.090> make<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> game<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.930> they
