00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello today I'm going to show you how to use 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.149
 the grip straps also known 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.249
 as lifting scraps happened 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.980
 workshop that enters the deadlift sumo 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:17.709
 so you can see exactly how it 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.709
 employ in the exercise come we start 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.920
 to 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.770
 well yesterday was my first day using 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.020
 the grip straps so I was going a 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.870
 little lost to the truth sometimes 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.420
 rolled the bar in one direction and in 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.700
 others on the contrary this then made me 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.970
 think about if there was some method let's say 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.610
 to follow when we use we employ 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.059
 these straps and good after looking 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.040
 it turns out that there is a better one 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.650
 way to perform one more way 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.619
 advantageous let's say so I decided 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.050
 make a video for those people 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.899
 that as I start to use these 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.140
 Straps on your workouts well 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.119
 first how to put the strap 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.759
 we started by putting the end of the 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.360
 strap by the loop without leaving any 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.250
 piece of strap folded all flat what 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.229
 most important here is that the tip of 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.200
 the strap slopes between the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.060
 thumb and index finger if not what 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.640
 Chances are you have not gotten good 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.310
 the strap by the loop or simply you 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.740
 you have wrong of hand this is how not 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.400
 should be remembered between the finger 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.470
 index 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.200
 then if we make a mistake of hand 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 we change the strap to the right hand and 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.300
 we proceed to roll it to the bar os 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.820
 I will teach the most used way 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.310
 which is from the bottom up and how it 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.620
 does that simply by squeezing the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.470
 strap with your thumb against the 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.930
 bar from bottom to top giving the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.420
 turns that you need what yes it is 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.050
 important not to spin around 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.530
 same but we will create a fatter bar 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.420
 of what it really is and the grip will be 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.730
 consequently much more difficult by 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.459
 that would advise you to roll it up 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.800
 more elongated shape than let's say 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.440
 cover the entire surface where 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.670
 your hand can have contact with the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.610
 bar 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.590
 since you know how to use them I'm going to 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.650
 give my opinion about when 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.410
 use them I'll start by saying that I think 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.810
 that its use must be quite specific 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.209
 since depending on the modality that 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.700
 train you can favor or 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.090
 harm for example if you're a 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.950
 bodybuilder and you use a lot of belts 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.560
 nothing would happen if you throw some 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.860
 forearm exercises from time to time 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.560
 in your routine that sometimes progressing in 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.900
 one side let's go back in another if 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.760
 you keep what is I want to say 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.890
 well, I personally only 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.110
 would use when the mixed grip me 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.170
 will fail and when they do not allow me to use 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.970
 magnesium in the gym that would be what 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.250
 better than we could do to not 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.950
 use the straps one way 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.459
 continued let's say and lose our 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.319
 strength in the hands and forearms I 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.870
 his hands were pretty dusty 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.810
 with injuries so I decided to give them a 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.370
 opportunity and try the straps and the 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.190
 I really did not feel any discomfort 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.860
 they worked 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.470
 they worked very well what yes it is 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.960
 true that what I did not like is that a 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.050
 once you choose the grip and you can not 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.000
 change you can not adjust no longer to me 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.340
 I like to do as a kind of rhythm 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.380
 before doing the exercise that bending 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.810
 a little the dorsals extending a little 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.760
 hands and I take the bar in a way 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.430
 natural I do not know is a way of 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.200
 concentrate on strength and with the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.040
 straps well let's say that this loses a 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.410
 little bit all that I feel a bit uncomfortable 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.140
 caged I'm almost sure that now 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.720
 he could then lift about 20 kilos 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.000
 more without straps just for the sake of it 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.670
 to be more comfortable and feel more 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.100
 concentrate and feel the grip of how 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.299
 I tell you in a natural but good way 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.980
 there goes my opinion on the subject 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.480
 Regarding the belts and I hope that you 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.360
 have helped in some way this 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.860
 video a pleasure guys like always and I 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.099
 can follow on Instagram 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.659
