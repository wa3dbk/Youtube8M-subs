you're after is the standard thin piece

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.340 
you're after is the standard thin piece
of<00:00:53.640> metal<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.449> might<00:00:54.660> want<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> with

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
of metal you might want to do it with

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.220 
of metal you might want to do it with
another<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:56.270> cuz<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.570> two<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:58.020> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
another one cuz with two of them it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.670 
another one cuz with two of them it's
much<00:00:58.680> easier<00:00:59.780> thicker<00:01:00.780> paper<00:01:01.079> clips<00:01:01.440> are

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
much easier thicker paper clips are

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.179 
much easier thicker paper clips are
better<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:03.140> when<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.260> break<00:01:04.500> inside<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
better but when they break inside that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.570 
better but when they break inside that
they're<00:01:05.610> much<00:01:06.090> much<00:01:06.420> harder<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:09.020> so

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
they're much much harder to get out so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.330 
they're much much harder to get out so
Pat<00:01:11.580> walk<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.600> got<00:01:12.750> two<00:01:12.930> parts<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.560> bottom

methods<00:02:50.110> but<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.860> can't<00:02:51.160> be<00:02:51.310> bothered<00:02:51.640> with

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
methods but I can't be bothered with

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.910 
methods but I can't be bothered with
those<00:02:57.690> if<00:02:58.690> after<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.140> few<00:02:59.380> tries<00:02:59.710> you're

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
those if after a few tries you're

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.400 
those if after a few tries you're
starting<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.280> get<00:03:00.370> fed<00:03:00.640> up<00:03:00.670> with<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.410> sometimes

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
starting to get fed up with it sometimes

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.670 
starting to get fed up with it sometimes
it<00:03:02.710> does<00:03:02.860> take<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:03.160> couple<00:03:03.460> minutes<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:04.150> I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
it does take a couple minutes but I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.720 
it does take a couple minutes but I
don't<00:03:05.680> want<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:05.890> have<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.130> upload<00:03:06.460> a<00:03:06.490> few

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
don't want to have to upload a few

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.810 
don't want to have to upload a few
minutes<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.180> video<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:09.280> paper<00:03:09.520> clips<00:03:11.820> roughly

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
minutes of video to paper clips roughly

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.650 
minutes of video to paper clips roughly
the<00:03:12.970> same<00:03:15.660> stick<00:03:16.660> them<00:03:16.780> both<00:03:16.990> in<00:03:17.230> there<00:03:18.660> just

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
and there you go it's been popped like I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.410 
and there you go it's been popped like I
said<00:04:01.890> one<00:04:02.099> paperclip<00:04:02.700> it'll<00:04:03.120> do<00:04:03.269> it

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
said one paperclip it'll do it

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.229 
said one paperclip it'll do it
eventually<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:04.260> if<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.370> breaks<00:04:05.610> there's<00:04:06.180> a

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
eventually and if it breaks there's a

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.110 
eventually and if it breaks there's a
lot<00:04:06.450> less<00:04:06.659> risky<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.290> destroying<00:04:07.680> your<00:04:07.860> lock

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
lot less risky you destroying your lock

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.850 
lot less risky you destroying your lock
if<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.299> do<00:04:09.480> this<00:04:09.659> on<00:04:09.840> your<00:04:09.959> door<00:04:10.140> just<00:04:10.470> use<00:04:10.620> one

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
if you do this on your door just use one

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.800 
if you do this on your door just use one
paperclip<00:04:11.519> don't<00:04:12.150> be<00:04:12.299> stupid

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
paperclip don't be stupid

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.219 
paperclip don't be stupid
I've<00:04:13.019> already<00:04:13.200> had<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.680> problem<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:15.229> was

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
I've already had that problem and was

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.390 
I've already had that problem and was
panicking<00:04:17.039> for<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.220> bit<00:04:18.289> two<00:04:19.289> paper<00:04:19.530> clips<00:04:19.889> if

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
panicking for a bit two paper clips if

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.050 
panicking for a bit two paper clips if
they<00:04:21.090> snap<00:04:21.740> usually<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:22.949> one<00:04:23.130> snaps<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:26.060> the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
they snap usually just one snaps and the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.510 
they snap usually just one snaps and the
whole<00:04:27.240> idea<00:04:27.570> behind<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.430> there's<00:04:29.430> a

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
whole idea behind it is there's a

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.000 
whole idea behind it is there's a
cylinder<00:04:30.090> with<00:04:30.870> some<00:04:31.020> small<00:04:31.289> pins<00:04:31.590> hanging

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
cylinder with some small pins hanging

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.879 
cylinder with some small pins hanging
downward<00:04:32.960> these<00:04:33.960> paper<00:04:34.199> clips<00:04:34.440> are<00:04:34.560> pushing

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
downward these paper clips are pushing

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.629 
downward these paper clips are pushing
those<00:04:35.010> pins<00:04:35.310> upward<00:04:36.889> two<00:04:37.889> paper<00:04:38.130> clips

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
those pins upward two paper clips

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.529 
those pins upward two paper clips
it's<00:04:39.300> just<00:04:39.600> doubling<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.260> chaos<00:04:40.590> in<00:04:40.860> there

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
it's just doubling the chaos in there

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.310 
it's just doubling the chaos in there
eventually<00:04:42.539> you'll<00:04:42.690> hit<00:04:42.810> all<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.139> pins

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
eventually you'll hit all the pins

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.029 
eventually you'll hit all the pins
upward<00:04:44.180> you'll<00:04:45.180> feel<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.539> suddenly<00:04:45.870> drop<00:04:46.229> the

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
upward you'll feel it suddenly drop the

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.560 
upward you'll feel it suddenly drop the
paper<00:04:47.280> clips<00:04:47.550> will<00:04:47.669> just<00:04:47.850> suddenly<00:04:48.000> jolt

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
paper clips will just suddenly jolt

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.620 
paper clips will just suddenly jolt
inwards<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:50.060> that's<00:04:51.060> when<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:51.360> know<00:04:51.479> you're

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
inwards and that's when you know you're

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.029 
inwards and that's when you know you're
on<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.780> last<00:04:52.020> pin<00:04:53.090> bit<00:04:54.090> more<00:04:54.270> wiggling<00:04:55.039> you'll

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
on the last pin bit more wiggling you'll

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.930 
on the last pin bit more wiggling you'll
hear<00:04:56.220> it<00:04:56.340> pop<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:58.520> if<00:04:59.520> you've<00:04:59.669> got<00:04:59.820> your

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
hear it pop and if you've got your

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.200 
hear it pop and if you've got your
fingers<00:05:00.300> pushing<00:05:00.780> down<00:05:01.050> on<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.349> still<00:05:02.210> just

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
fingers pushing down on that still just

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.339 
fingers pushing down on that still just
a<00:05:03.270> little<00:05:03.510> nudge<00:05:03.690> will<00:05:04.050> open<00:05:04.320> it<00:05:06.110> let's<00:05:07.110> pull

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
a little nudge will open it let's pull

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:20.060 
a little nudge will open it let's pull
them<00:05:07.470> out<00:05:11.090> also<00:05:14.060> once<00:05:15.060> you've<00:05:15.210> closed<00:05:15.510> it<00:05:19.070> it's
