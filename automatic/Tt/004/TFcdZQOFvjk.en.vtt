have an animation already loaded in the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.630 
have an animation already loaded in the
scene<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:51.360> can<00:02:52.360> use<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> animation<00:02:53.350> control<00:02:53.770> to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
scene I can use the animation control to

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.350 
scene I can use the animation control to
preview<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.330> animation<00:02:57.180> beside<00:02:58.180> the
