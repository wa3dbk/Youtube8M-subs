00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.429

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.189
 but not in paris 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.189

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 She turns 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
 it's a sentence 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.130
 and then that's all 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.130
 as for its further counterpart or in a few days just as with the tsl 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.070

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.680
 n access 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.130
 I am happy 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.130
 why according to the sociologist 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 may it be my home for this event 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 tc but 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.970

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.980
 whether you can 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.470

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.470
 during the weekend 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.390
 first attempt 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.780
 like that if not why so early for self-production 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.350
 in which these massacres 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 suddenly a teenager 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.400
 iter 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.820

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.119
 suddenly the police 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:01.769
