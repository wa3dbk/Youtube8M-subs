00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello it again I would like today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.950
 talk about video filming on digital 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.179
 SLR camera canon 1100d 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.639
 some time I shoot a video on this 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.370
 camera and I already have a cube 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.619
 experience and can tell about the benefits and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.640
 disadvantages of using 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.119
 camera as a video camera 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.369
 if we talk about the benefits 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.740
 use of a reflex camera as 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.330
 camcorder of course 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.929
 clear picture how does hd and 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 quite good 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.660
 part image and would still like to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.870
 say that you can on digital 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.610
 camera shoot just such more 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.390
 art stories that is possible 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 focus catch on different objects on 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.660
 foreground and background let's say 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.890
 some kind of phone with quality 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.969
 video filming is hardly possible 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 do as it turned out in the process of shooting 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.460
 prove to be a disadvantage times more than 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.890
 advantages now tell you about them first 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.850
 of these, of course, the absence of a complete 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.290
 lack of autofocus that is 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.260
 some dynamic objects are shooting 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.340
 almost impossible because they 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.799
 sooner or later there will be no trick that is 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.960
 much easier to shoot fixed 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.180
 objects that are on 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.430
 a certain distance from the camera 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.650
 then you can catch this trick and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.650
 in principle, very good sound itself 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.540
 focus which is recorded on 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.740
 the microphone is very audible on 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.460
 videos you now 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.460
 will demonstrate 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.940
 that is, if you will while shooting 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.850
 change focus on different objects 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.190
 the sound will accompany all your videos 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.720
 record the next flaw about which 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.000
 I would like to say this lack 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.300
 any video settings ie 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.869
 everything happens automatically 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.090
 the only possibility is something 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.569
 configure this change the number of frames 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.739
 per second from 25 to 30 is still one of 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.900
 inconvenience is 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.420
 the size of the captured video files they are very 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.280
 great i have a minute video 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.410
 approximately takes 200 megabytes 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.750
 general maximum funk that can 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.600
 write this four gigabytes this 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.340
 about 16 minutes so here for 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.769
 people who are not very powerful 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.170
 computer and installation of such a video will be 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.760
 problematic and the last thing you can 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.470
 say about the shortcomings is the lack 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.230
 external connectivity 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.660
 microphone that is for example lapel 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.760
 or some other principle is built 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.820
 the microphone writes a good sound but I wanted 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.470
 would say go out for some other 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.120
 were higher level that is 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.890
 record sound with an external microphone but 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.989
 unfortunately this possibility is not 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.410
 provided on this like 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.209
 I donâ€™t see a shortage but I forgot 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.540
 say another advantage of this 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.340
 camera video quality this 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.530
 Of course the fact that all the same it is a camera 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.430
 yourself have the opportunity to take a picture 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.549
 good and shot good video thanks for 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.549
