00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.990

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.029
 participants are there until half past 3 and I there 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.590

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.840

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.010
 Mate Sultan so see 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.019
 and then we see the first candidate there 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.109
 busy and that is correct 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.789
 first pot but we call it correct 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:44.199
 so that easy 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.199
 looks good it is there 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.190

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.740
 it gives one of the envies 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.740
 but because I say a little receivers 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.860
 look this is it 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.750
 it had already laid out the garden can 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.240
 which previously seen neat and then has 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.400
 who made a picture of himself here 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.400
 Also not so strange if you sit out 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.740
 so do n't do that alone he has april 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.479
 secretly 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.200
 our flies are the chicken that everyone else had 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.200
 that you need 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:43.450
 so and then we go to candidate now 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:45.800
 number 2 and that's such a neighborhood wants there 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.170
 so on i wish there was just very busy here 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.170
 at work i also look there istie 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.460
 and hope to lay the entire floor 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:05.470
 you get work with if you have an awful lot 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:07.380
 something big he builds is even that big 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.780
 that you like it at the front 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.230
 oh you see the back just it 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.230
 is not left 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.550
 and of course there will also be monsters 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.960
 now waiting not bother you that the door 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.970
 you know them 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.130
 and then this has become it you saw 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.820
 by the way, in my announcement of 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.820
 the match 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.720
 hs pretty nice big but nice 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.209
 so a plane around it 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.420
 and the dome he did well 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.420
 men wear 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.670
 I am curious what the jury thinks 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.760
 and then we see the third candidate here 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.470
 to once again help with our flying 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.220
 chicken 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.580
 this is gust and it laid a floor 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.580
 made of glass 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.560
 there is a little silence, he is resting 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:36.230
 he makes it to the police officer and rests it 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:41.650
 says himself a kingdom 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.650
 the minute is quite a big wall 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.220
 nice big project k that will be there 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.220
 to the great lighter this 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.120
 It is now on Wednesday and he says about it 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.830
 he made a how long such 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.530
 almost every candidate 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.130
 we still have one to go so then live 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.130
 we are going such a v 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 but before going to yes before the nano 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.140
 I have to let go live twice now 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.890
 see 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.890
 has made stabbing 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.280
 I think it's a young one and that's me 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.750
 I 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.750
 museum and all of them museum 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.570
 look with all the stuff i ever had 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.850
 who apparently has rest 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.030
 also collected and yes we here but i like 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.030
 the fun 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.540
 have you set the tone again? 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:58.530
 very well done ' rest would go 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.060
 Now to know them myself no to the young 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.350
 in that one makes something here in the desert 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.350
 near the castle 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.250
 let's see if we can spot 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:15.180
 stiga that he is what it is 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.740
 He calls it a house, well, that 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.370
 you can call it indeed it is one 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.370
 nice house 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.550
 see if they can still come in somewhere 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.550
 so surely a door or something like that there 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.309
 f of horses oh man this is pretty fun 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.929
 that is not at all on the outside 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.929
 it looks cool 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.919
 well he does pretty well 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.139
 it splashed the already called the water dream 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.580
 I thought it was exaggerating 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.580
 so nice but where the young is you 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:12.630
 oh look there that was all that up to it 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:12.630
 are busy with the stairs 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.349
 music on looks good 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:28.460
 well those were the candidates so i think 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.240
 it's really cool 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.240
 they are all enjoying themselves 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:35.050
 and of course it is the intention 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:40.069
 that you will vote 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:41.870
 so if you are yes they are all set 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:44.060
 of course i leave that 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.759
 to maybe Friday or so or Saturday 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.939
 I think I show how far they all go 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.939
 to be 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:51.400
 linda 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.430
 but you can just vote on it 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.810
 put your name in the comments you can now 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.000
 already going to vote for me concerns 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:03.340
 it doesn't matter 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.340
 and then we'll see who won 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:08.289
