00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 neatly we go with the first step 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.919
 to make the dough but it happened to me 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.679
 make the dough here we have 500 grams of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.809
 flour 500 grams of flour I'm going to 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.330
 put three eggs three months of a 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.619
 little story please click I do not want 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.619
 this little egg is wrong 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.560
 thank you then for safety and 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.650
 comfort the egg you break it in a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.140
 deposit aside and you're pulling and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.110
 seat regular half a kilo of flour 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.260
 we are in the first step that is to do 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.660
 the mass for these similar gallarin is 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.610
 open to sing or the way you want 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.559
 give it but first we have to make a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.630
 mass a mass that is not a march of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.900
 pure egg not much less 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.630
 500 grams of flour and three eggs 33 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.970
 little eggs that unfortunately 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.520
 supersaludable came out was not very 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.510
 well in the 500 grams of flours 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.540
 we put the three eggs and it's not going to be 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.490
 a mass then following the step that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.860
 is to make the dough here we make a blur 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.870
 tomorrow that you buy would lose it 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.450
 you wash a little bit directly they put it 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.710
 on the one already makes it burn what 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.410
 more but what I missed the most once 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.450
 that is absolutely black, you take it out 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.970
 the burner with great care you put it 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.460
 downstream tap water and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.830
 what peels insists with the sun is that more 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.810
 that the skin and does not peel and now then what 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.330
 will open to the middle to take out the nuggets of 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.750
 take out the seeds and take out the heart and 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.150
 pure meat that smoky blur the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.659
 put here and we will mix it with a 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.700
 generous jet 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.979
 where olive oil so that this 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.990
 pasta come out to morron I saw it 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.770
 finished look what they are like 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.560
 orange the spaghetti videos is 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.200
 for the reason and the reason is the above 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.000
 morrón quoted separately that we are going to put 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.990
 here apart from the morrón 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.340
 apart from olive oil salt salt 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.170
 I'm putting a generous amount 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.170
 but where you need 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.670
 now you are going to put a device in fact 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.879
 and you're going to make a single one said a 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.989
 liquefied and around the liquefied thread 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:28.470
 morrón previously aguadito peladito 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.470
 olive oil 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.019
 and nothing else loves 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.939
 with spinach and you can do it with 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.680
 spinach my old directly has 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.620
 quite does not want to do good stretched 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.980
 logical base said 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.980
 do not 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.330
 we continue with step 1 which is to do the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.050
 mass we remember half a kilo of flour there 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.050
 people who use flour like a 30 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.050
 40 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.599
 three eggs the half pound of flour and the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.870
 liquefied processed and now if you have to 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.060
 put your hand to knead and do the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.450
 mass of future spaghetti facts 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.790
 noodles to the morrón as he says 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.709
 well we mix this first if you have 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.910
 that put your hand your hand well clean the 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.560
 battery several times but in the first 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.170
 the first scrambled way we do it with 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.170
 one a teaspoon people 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.830
 the trevi fontana with credit anita 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.200
 it seems to me that it is a chase I prefer 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.110
 take the dough in a bowl notice that no 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.370
 we have put extra fluid beyond 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.489
 of the same water as the eggs and 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.400
 a little gold from the same morrón that 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.079
 has some liquid logically but 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.090
 There you knead it, you knead it and you 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.470
 is taking quickly if you see that this 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.470
 measure is to leave it there 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.189
 a little too much that maybe as in 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.590
 this case humidity because the in 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.480
 proportion the morrón was very large and 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.799
 it gave a lot of good humidity there is to the side 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.240
 you have a little extra flour 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:18.739
 marcucci put a little please 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.739
 to this one when living 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:24.650
 why 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.389
 then a little extra sand the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.850
 matter is to do it from a little bit from 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.130
 a base of a half pound of flour with 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.810
 three eggs of standard size and then 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.229
 is the processed sole of the morrón 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.870
 jemad and pela seen and of pitalito and 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.360
 this one as flame and a little oil of 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.120
 olive the dough once this ball 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.669
 would have to knead and knead and has sent 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.229
 but I do not have time because this is 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.139
 a five steps so I'm going to stick 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.720
 a pure dicta I'm going to put the flour 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.620
 respective and relevant and this same 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.990
 dough 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.970
 revilla we should let her rest 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.400
 tapaditas I'm going to take out that refuel 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.500
 all the handshake and in this 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.870
 case we have a machine if one 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.960
 has the good old-fashioned machine the 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.090
 traditional to the how to the canvas 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.330
 apart from the kneading the stretched you're going to 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.669
 do this with the corresponding handle 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.780
 but if you have the benefit of this 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.990
 little machine 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.080
 barbarian is welcome be it helps you 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.350
 very much very much the step number 1 that 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.889
 is to make the dough was already concluded the 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:34.370
 recommendation is that this mass is not even 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.470
 very large or very hard and very dry or very 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.840
 wet and let it stand like 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.030
 corresponds after having given it for 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.730
 at least about 8 or 10 minutes of kneading 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.210
 as appropriate after you leave an average 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.450
 rest hour and the step is started 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.250
 number 2 which is Saturday and stretched from 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.450
 the mass so let's go to the place do 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.450
 have a husband 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.120
 the flowerpot we start with the most open 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.969
 of the rolls that are wide open 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.969
 the twin of that side 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.949
 and this is a very important issue because 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:15.699
 It will give you a very good texture the most 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:18.789
 yesterday on Saturday which means to pass it 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.409
 several times by the hello machine and each 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.169
 time but fails it can unfold 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:26.499
 please folds that way and 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.959
 that is Saturday puts you between past and 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:31.389
 passed a little bit of flour or a lot 

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:34.659
 better if you can get mill 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.759
 but there is much much better if they go 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:39.039
 going clear and as far as it goes 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:41.799
 going on stretching the dough goes 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.619
 losing moisture so it stays 

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:47.949
 that end caress the infinite but 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:50.049
 that if you do not have it perfectly use 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.710
 the same flour that had made the 

00:06:50.049 --> 00:06:57.060
 original mass and decide identity 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:59.740
 and they say those who know that using the 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.980
 machine or the gravel bending and the going 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:06.040
 passing the dough goes dry and when 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.630
 make a noise type of explosion 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.640
 that is, the dough is installed as a 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.460
 balloon and explode but nobody is the 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.170
 moment to start stretching wants 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.900
 say that the dough has been tested 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.330
 perfectly allows me to fold 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.810
 so I'll go and I'll send 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.540
 from this side 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.970
 always as he calls with the open 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.750
 completely with the open rollers of 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.790
 the shape and we are going to stretch it I continue with 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.870
 Saturday because it is extremely 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:37.270
 wet 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:41.300
 come come come a little bit of grind 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.680
 and we're going like this, stretching, we're still in the 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.800
 step number 2 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:49.100
 we will continue to stretch stealing and 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.139
 stretching in step number two we're not going 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.300
 to follow a short pause and after 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:56.300
 cut also cited the step 3 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.850
 where you are going to cut the pasta in the 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.130
 step number 4 where he will cook and 

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:04.240
 make the sauce and dispatch number 

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.240
 5 where will you put together
