00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.369
 today we go to Korea we did 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.320

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.129
 but where can we taste something that 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.230
 in Italy you don't eat is one thing 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:59.109

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:32.209
 desperate , it takes so much and I like it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:40.070
 needed for me to understand 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:43.810
 goodbye blog would aim at professor il 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.810

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:20.230
 turkey the shoulder of mexico china 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:27.359
 typical dish seen that would have 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:31.389
 eaten is called cctc chemical folds 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:35.290
 and it is Korea to enjoy orca waiting for you to 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:40.859
 that nymphs way is no different 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.859
 but can you decide Chinese cabbage is certain 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.689
 it is not the field I really got all 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.760
 they are two equal mixed the cabbage is 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:58.359
 another one 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.329
 first between the two truths for a power of his own 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:05.459
 video that of the fermented terminal 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:09.159
 complete not stooped of truth 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.500
 here is the theme of fennel and onion not 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:15.310
 I could understand it was the ring that already 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.120
 of his is 2 pike fermented so I am 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.930
 I certainly know that 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.919
 very healthy I like singing a lot 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.919
 I think this stalled 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.490
 the purpose of this rolo that is so 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.650
 insightful and well served as 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.650
 accompaniment itself says with dishes 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:45.950
 carnicella awakens each other if only for 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:49.250
 the breath notices however the good is 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.020
 spicy never arrangement in the non sense 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.170
 faraway if he did n't kill me 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:58.420
 I could have a lot of people from 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.420
 disgusting I told you down ever 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.880
 the vegetables that are inside or maybe 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.160
 individually done differently ti 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.770
 but it continues maybe used a little less 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.530
 spicy also pleasant accompanied 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.120
 as does accompanied that covers the flavor 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.450
 of the others but let's say he ate 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.240
 this year nothing but if maybe 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.310
 less spicy goes well with ginger 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.720
 mixed cabbage is a politician with 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.280

 Korean is sought that the 53 yes 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.040
 even if in Korean they are spicy 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.639
 I'll leave the ancient recipe 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.830
 also dates back to over 3,000 years ago and 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.669
 origin of Perugino was not there why not 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.520
 they knew him 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.349
 then when they discovered the chili pepper 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.560
 Instead they gave him a shot of life 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:18.009
 straca misere antal pro perhaps the manthoc 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:20.440

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:24.669
 consider it acquired in scaffolds of the 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.349
 community like both gods and Koreans mi 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.810

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.990
 general to say of my spicy of 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:41.710
 this we have a safe fool though 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.259
 there is a slight vegetables is like 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.969
 indeed, we know that as a side dish for 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:47.969
 something must be charity 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:58.229
 not having played only peperonata 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.840
