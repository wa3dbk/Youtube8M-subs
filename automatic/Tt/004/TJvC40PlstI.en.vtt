00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
know the power and after that I will

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.130 
know the power and after that I will
pluck<00:01:21.509> my<00:01:21.720> plug<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> power<00:01:22.619> back<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.140> then

pluck my plug the power back in and then

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.100 
pluck my plug the power back in and then
reboot<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.100> hopefully<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.850> will<00:01:27.030> work<00:01:27.110> so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
let's try that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.609 
let's try that
first<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.000> let's<00:01:30.799> shut<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.979> down

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
