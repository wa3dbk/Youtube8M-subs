Fox would and I did some things

Fox would and I did some things
differently<00:00:15.910> a<00:00:16.660> couple<00:00:17.140> years<00:00:17.320> ago<00:00:17.410> in<00:00:17.620> 2004

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
differently a couple years ago in 2004

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.230 
differently a couple years ago in 2004
when<00:00:18.220> I<00:00:18.280> was<00:00:18.370> winning<00:00:18.490> like<00:00:18.700> every<00:00:18.970> tournament

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
when I was winning like every tournament

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.210 
when I was winning like every tournament
site<00:00:19.539> I<00:00:19.960> had<00:00:20.410> an<00:00:20.500> approach<00:00:20.710> that<00:00:20.740> was<00:00:20.980> slightly

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
site I had an approach that was slightly

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.460 
site I had an approach that was slightly
different<00:00:21.670> but<00:00:21.940> last<00:00:22.539> year<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:23.080> this<00:00:23.200> year<00:00:23.260> I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
different but last year and this year I

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.660 
different but last year and this year I
kind<00:00:23.800> of<00:00:23.860> was<00:00:24.039> thinking<00:00:24.340> more<00:00:24.490> about

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
kind of was thinking more about

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.520 
kind of was thinking more about
adjusting<00:00:25.570> to<00:00:25.690> some<00:00:25.810> of<00:00:25.900> the<00:00:25.960> newer<00:00:26.110> online

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
adjusting to some of the newer online

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.870 
adjusting to some of the newer online
players<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:27.010> know<00:00:27.100> so<00:00:27.520> i<00:00:27.550> was<00:00:27.670> making

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
players you know so i was making

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.310 
players you know so i was making
adjustments<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.420> my<00:00:28.510> game<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:28.990> some<00:00:29.110> of<00:00:29.199> them

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
adjustments to my game and some of them

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.720 
adjustments to my game and some of them
I<00:00:29.529> just<00:00:29.800> think<00:00:29.949> I<00:00:30.100> was<00:00:30.220> uncomfortable<00:00:30.369> with<00:00:30.640> a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
I just think I was uncomfortable with a

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.980 
I just think I was uncomfortable with a
little<00:00:30.850> bit<00:00:31.000> you<00:00:31.090> know<00:00:31.119> what<00:00:31.420> and<00:00:31.660> I've<00:00:31.840> gone

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
little bit you know what and I've gone

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.899 
little bit you know what and I've gone
back<00:00:32.199> to<00:00:32.409> just<00:00:32.559> thinking<00:00:32.859> you<00:00:32.949> know<00:00:33.069> what<00:00:33.280> my

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:33.909 
back to just thinking you know what my

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.639 
back to just thinking you know what my
game<00:00:34.149> is<00:00:34.300> good<00:00:34.510> enough<00:00:34.690> and<00:00:34.960> my<00:00:35.289> game<00:00:35.499> is

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
game is good enough and my game is

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:36.989 
game is good enough and my game is
strong<00:00:35.920> so<00:00:36.129> I<00:00:36.309> don't<00:00:36.460> have<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:36.670> make<00:00:36.850> the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:36.999 
strong so I don't have to make the

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:39.059 
strong so I don't have to make the
adjustments<00:00:37.420> they<00:00:37.719> gotta<00:00:38.079> make<00:00:38.289> husband<00:00:38.890> so

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:39.069 
adjustments they gotta make husband so

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:41.790 
adjustments they gotta make husband so
now<00:00:39.519> basically<00:00:39.760> i've<00:00:40.030> reverted<00:00:40.329> back<00:00:40.479> to<00:00:40.800> just

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
now basically i've reverted back to just

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.110 
now basically i've reverted back to just
the<00:00:41.829> way<00:00:41.890> I<00:00:41.979> like<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.249> play<00:00:42.399> ivory<00:00:42.879> raised

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
the way I like to play ivory raised

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.149 
the way I like to play ivory raised
before<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.479> flop<00:00:43.659> precisely<00:00:44.199> zero<00:00:44.710> times<00:00:44.979> its

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
before the flop precisely zero times its

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.369 
before the flop precisely zero times its
entire<00:00:45.429> tournament<00:00:45.670> zero<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.389> just<00:00:46.870> attempted

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
entire tournament zero I just attempted

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.959 
entire tournament zero I just attempted
my<00:00:47.710> first<00:00:47.949> two<00:00:48.100> bluffs<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> tournament

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
my first two bluffs of the tournament

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.239 
my first two bluffs of the tournament
and<00:00:49.089> I<00:00:49.420> lost<00:00:49.690> two<00:00:49.929> small<00:00:50.139> pots<00:00:50.409> just<00:00:50.679> like<00:00:50.829> flop

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
and I lost two small pots just like flop

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.090 
and I lost two small pots just like flop
bets<00:00:51.489> but<00:00:51.670> basically<00:00:52.420> I'm<00:00:52.960> banking<00:00:53.829> on<00:00:53.949> my

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
bets but basically I'm banking on my

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.469 
bets but basically I'm banking on my
opponents<00:00:54.519> making<00:00:54.789> mistakes<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.239> I'd<00:00:55.329> never

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
opponents making mistakes that I'd never

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.360 
opponents making mistakes that I'd never
make<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.229> I<00:00:56.589> really<00:00:57.010> feel<00:00:57.190> comfortable

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
make and and I really feel comfortable

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.360 
make and and I really feel comfortable
