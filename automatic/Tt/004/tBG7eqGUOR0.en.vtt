00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
number four technol number four is a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.210 
number four technol number four is a
little<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.659> more<00:01:09.810> technical<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:11.010> it's

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
little bit more technical but it's

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.469 
little bit more technical but it's
something<00:01:11.400> values<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> time<00:01:12.299> because

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
something values all the time because

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.600 
something values all the time because
it's<00:01:12.840> basically<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.290> safety<00:01:13.740> net<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.040> me<00:01:14.189> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
it's basically a safety net for me so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.640 
it's basically a safety net for me so
what<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> second<00:01:15.509> before<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.080> me<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
what a second before for me is that I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
what a second before for me is that I
break<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> sales<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> ps3<00:01:18.210> system

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
break up the sales of the ps3 system

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.070 
break up the sales of the ps3 system

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
360 so basically tactic number four is

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.320 
360 so basically tactic number four is
that<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:21.010> don't<00:03:21.160> have<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.370> necessarily<00:03:21.610> sell

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330

all the bundle that you bought you don't
have<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.630> sell<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.930> all<00:03:26.110> at<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.350> same<00:03:26.590> time<00:03:26.650> you

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
have to sell it all at the same time you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.070 
have to sell it all at the same time you
can<00:03:27.489> still<00:03:27.730> make<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:27.940> money<00:03:28.269> from<00:03:28.600> left<00:03:28.840> and

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
can still make that money from left and

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.310 
can still make that money from left and
right<00:03:29.370> from<00:03:30.370> one<00:03:31.209> person<00:03:31.570> here<00:03:31.750> one<00:03:31.930> person

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
right from one person here one person

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.560 
right from one person here one person
there<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.680> way<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.310> total<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:34.030> would<00:03:34.330> add<00:03:34.540> up

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
there that way in total it would add up

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.150 
there that way in total it would add up
to<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.959> amount<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.530> originally<00:03:35.739> made

to the amount that you originally made

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.920 
to the amount that you originally made
so<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.549> have<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.790> have<00:03:36.910> foresight<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.810> have

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
so you have to have foresight you have

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.080 
so you have to have foresight you have
to<00:03:38.110> be<00:03:38.200> patient<00:03:38.410> about<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:39.010> if<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.400> persistent
