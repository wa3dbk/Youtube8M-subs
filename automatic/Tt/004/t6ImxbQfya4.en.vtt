00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.240
 for comparison to Bayern 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.390
 about how and where exactly they have to play it only in written air 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.320
 out and 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.870
 New Green Borussia Dortmund of this model wore dark to 2 Kaka's 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.090
 Of course, Nef wants the machine to move forward 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.980
 interrupted for the drive shaft and Nuristan close 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.000
 and of course Bus also has some problems to deal with 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.569
 fields 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.949
 Thomas agree that this is not allowed to be the whole game in lethargy 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.459
 Verdi had to go to Alba three quarters of an hour to find her again 

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:33.089
 They were thrown back on the weakness of the previous season namely the 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:36.089
 opportunity assessment 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.970
 Min no yardstick in the first games were early backlog and 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.510
 even it has been pointed out 2% important players off there can 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.770
 you ever lose Hoffenheim 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.710
 No, I think 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.200
 For finance, difference between Dortmund and Bayern seem the difference 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.270
 Bavaria is about to break away from the systems 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.290
 Philipp Lahm said it yesterday, we did not hamm-hamm we all yet 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.210
 out man had with them before every purchase the whole do not want 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.130
 have out and Dornburg practiced for two or three years brings what 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.950
 my observation even before Klopp 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.600
 Amnesty Martic you otherwise in the Bundesliga except at Hannover 96 at 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.350
 Hoffenheim stayed Mainz 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.990
 alone in the top group does not really know Â» 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.350
 um and that is the decisive difference between Dortmund and Bavaria 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.880
 So far, I am very sure that Dortmund is long and well 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.109
 medium term 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.759
 and if at 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.430
 No, be a real competitor 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.470
 Construction time is always difficult because Bayern has the options 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.930
 always react and then percent again 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.930
 To buy the food immediately becomes a success 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.869
 you have experienced that too p I think after this second Hoffer must 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.920
 Let's also say so games has Dortmund in the last year too 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.640
 Percentage of the App Store he already has there with great regularity 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.439
 times lost in Frankfurt Hoffmann Perry MÃ¶nchengladbach and what 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.940
 Percent notable were faded that they always when the skepticism 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.830
 Suddenly she was brought up from the environment and she was the one to grow up 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.050
 So I think that doctors have the next answer 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.910
 Game against OM works of elementary importance is when Dortmund then shows 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.470
 that they have easily put it away then it's good if only now 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.809
 A tie follows then 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.629
 you get a lot of what you wrote about busses on the first day of play 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:14.779
 Has
