00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
people I would do update on my amaryllis

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.510 
people I would do update on my amaryllis
bulbs<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.670> show<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.910> how<00:00:18.060> fast<00:00:18.359> they<00:00:18.600> grow<00:00:19.520> in

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
bulbs to show you how fast they grow in

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.160 
bulbs to show you how fast they grow in
the<00:00:20.820> back<00:00:21.029> there<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.630> my<00:00:22.160> J<00:00:23.160> plants<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
the back there are my J plants and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.170 
the back there are my J plants and
they've<00:00:25.170> been<00:00:25.410> there<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.189> little<00:00:26.760> over<00:00:26.910> two

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
they've been there for a little over two

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.779 
they've been there for a little over two
weeks<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.920> you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.130> see<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.580> they're<00:00:29.760> very

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
weeks and you can see that they're very

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.299 
weeks and you can see that they're very
healthy<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:31.109> sprayed<00:00:31.679> them<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.070> water

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
healthy I have sprayed them with water

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.660 
healthy I have sprayed them with water
occasionally<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:33.120> keeping<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> damp<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.670> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
occasionally I'm keeping it damp and you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610 
occasionally I'm keeping it damp and you
saw<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.120> these<00:00:36.300> look<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:37.079> couple<00:00:37.440> weeks

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
saw what these look like a couple weeks

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
saw what these look like a couple weeks
ago<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.760> reason<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.180> didn't<00:00:39.450> film<00:00:39.690> them

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
ago and the reason I didn't film them

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.780 
ago and the reason I didn't film them
after<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> week<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.190> roots<00:00:41.430> took

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
after a week is because the roots took

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.280 
after a week is because the roots took
probably<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.239> week<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.079> acclimated

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
probably a week to just get acclimated

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.760 
probably a week to just get acclimated
in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> soil<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.450> able<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> start<00:00:46.079> growing

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.680 

and<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.399> said<00:00:50.670> don't<00:00:50.879> give<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.480> these

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and I said don't give up on these

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
and I said don't give up on these
because<00:00:52.079> they<00:00:52.440> haven't<00:00:52.649> started<00:00:53.129> shooting

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
because they haven't started shooting

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.299 
because they haven't started shooting
her<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.329> one's<00:00:54.719> coming<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.860> we

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
her but see that one's coming up and we

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.130 
her but see that one's coming up and we
still<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.510> something<00:00:57.960> but

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
still have this one to do something but

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.380 
still have this one to do something but
see<00:00:58.410> there's<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:59.309> bit<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.520> color<00:01:00.030> there

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
see there's a little bit of color there

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.209 
see there's a little bit of color there
there<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> something<00:01:01.440> coming<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.039> looks

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
there is something coming out it looks

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.310 
there is something coming out it looks
like<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> tip<00:01:02.789> got<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> little<00:01:03.329> Brown<00:01:03.539> from

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
like the tip got a little Brown from

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.609 
like the tip got a little Brown from
being<00:01:04.589> dry<00:01:05.780> they<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:07.049> inside<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
being dry they all go inside and do the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.890 
being dry they all go inside and do the
rest<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.119> now<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> big<00:01:09.479> difference

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
rest of them now the big difference

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.810 
rest of them now the big difference
between<00:01:09.960> these<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.040> ones<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.700> in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
between these and the ones that are in

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850 
between these and the ones that are in
the<00:01:11.939> greenhouse<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> greenhouse<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.650> nice

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
house but at night I just heat it to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.630 
house but at night I just heat it to
keep<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.799> from<00:01:20.009> freezing

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
keep it from freezing

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.539 
keep it from freezing
if<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.299> greenhouse<00:01:21.720> gets<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.259> 37<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> 40

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
if the greenhouse gets to 37 to 40

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.960 
if the greenhouse gets to 37 to 40
degrees<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.210> don't<00:01:24.479> mind<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.400> see<00:01:26.400> these<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
degrees I don't mind and see these are a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.490 
degrees I don't mind and see these are a
lot<00:01:27.270> bigger<00:01:27.509> yes

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
most of these are bigger bulbs be the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.170 
most of these are bigger bulbs be the
one<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.060> I'm<00:01:33.479> watching<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> most<00:01:34.530> is

one that really I'm watching the most is
this<00:01:36.180> little<00:01:36.600> rascal<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:40.229> say<00:01:40.500> yeah<00:01:40.650> I

this little rascal here and say yeah I
put<00:01:40.890> an<00:01:41.009> X<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.460> pot<00:01:42.710> because<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.610> bulb

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
put an X on that pot because this bulb

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.510 
put an X on that pot because this bulb
had<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:46.290> white<00:01:46.560> root<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:47.340> an

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
had one a little white root about an

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
had one a little white root about an
inch<00:01:47.729> long<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.530> two<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.740> them<00:01:49.920> maybe<00:01:50.549> 3/8<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
inch long and two of them maybe 3/8 of

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.679 
inch long and two of them maybe 3/8 of
an<00:01:51.689> inch<00:01:51.810> long<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.850> knew<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.329> would<00:01:54.450> take<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
an inch long and I knew it would take a

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.990 
an inch long and I knew it would take a
while<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.960> come<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:55.950> an<00:01:56.130> older<00:01:56.729> bulb

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
while to come up but it's an older bulb

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.980 
while to come up but it's an older bulb
and<00:01:57.860> even<00:01:58.860> though<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.189> brown<00:01:59.460> tip<00:02:00.390> shows<00:02:00.750> that

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and even though the brown tip shows that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.020 
and even though the brown tip shows that
it<00:02:01.140> got<00:02:01.350> dry<00:02:01.740> when<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.159> first<00:02:02.399> started<00:02:02.850> because

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
it got dry when it first started because

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.639 
it got dry when it first started because
it<00:02:03.329> didn't<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.659> enough<00:02:03.689> roots<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.350> pick<00:02:04.500> up

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
it didn't have enough roots to pick up

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.280 
it didn't have enough roots to pick up
any<00:02:04.799> moisture<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:06.180> wanted<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.630> mark<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.020> so

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
any moisture and I wanted to mark it so

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.749 
any moisture and I wanted to mark it so
I<00:02:07.320> could<00:02:07.590> make<00:02:07.740> sure<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> knew<00:02:08.220> which<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
I could make sure I knew which one it

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.669 
I could make sure I knew which one it
was

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
was

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.949 
was
and<00:02:10.009> see<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.340> one<00:02:10.759> has<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.030> first<00:02:11.510> flower

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
and see that one has the first flower

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.970 
and see that one has the first flower
spike<00:02:13.390> flower<00:02:14.390> still<00:02:14.780> none<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.650> others

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
spike flower still none of the others

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.160 
spike flower still none of the others
have<00:02:16.190> developed<00:02:16.400> any<00:02:16.849> of<00:02:17.060> them<00:02:17.239> yet<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:18.019> you

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
have developed any of them yet but you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.960 
have developed any of them yet but you
can<00:02:18.349> see<00:02:18.500> their<00:02:18.709> big<00:02:18.920> flower<00:02:19.190> coming<00:02:19.640> out<00:02:19.849> of

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
can see their big flower coming out of

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.170 
can see their big flower coming out of
there<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:21.470> was<00:02:21.709> from<00:02:22.010> three<00:02:22.790> little

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
there and that was from three little

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.270 
there and that was from three little
teeny<00:02:23.720> brutes<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.409> rest<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.799> roots<00:02:24.980> about

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
teeny brutes the rest of the roots about

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.399 
teeny brutes the rest of the roots about
six<00:02:25.580> inches<00:02:25.849> home<00:02:27.459> anyway<00:02:29.019> that's<00:02:30.019> what<00:02:30.230> they

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
six inches home anyway that's what they

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.850 
six inches home anyway that's what they
look<00:02:30.590> like<00:02:30.620> now<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:32.349> should<00:02:33.349> have<00:02:33.470> done<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:33.799> a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
look like now I should have done this a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.199 
look like now I should have done this a
little<00:02:34.129> earlier<00:02:34.310> when<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.670> had<00:02:34.849> more<00:02:34.970> sunlight

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
little earlier when I had more sunlight

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.309 
little earlier when I had more sunlight
in<00:02:35.540> here<00:02:35.569> but<00:02:35.870> hopefully<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.260> can<00:02:36.319> see<00:02:36.590> it

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
in here but hopefully you can see it

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.830 
in here but hopefully you can see it
we'll<00:02:39.319> do<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.650> every<00:02:40.010> week<00:02:40.190> from<00:02:40.549> now<00:02:40.700> on

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
we'll do this every week from now on

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.900 
we'll do this every week from now on
waited<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.590> while<00:02:42.739> for<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.430> roots<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> get

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
waited a while for the roots to get

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.000 
waited a while for the roots to get
acclimated<00:02:44.200> before<00:02:45.200> they<00:02:45.349> really<00:02:45.590> take<00:02:45.799> off

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
acclimated before they really take off

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.940

and<00:02:46.579> in<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.209> next<00:02:47.540> couple<00:02:47.720> days<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.379> will<00:02:48.769> put

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
and in the next couple days I will put

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.860 
and in the next couple days I will put
these<00:02:49.099> little<00:02:49.400> bamboo<00:02:49.549> rods<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.269> each<00:02:50.480> one<00:02:50.660> of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
these little bamboo rods in each one of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.050 
these little bamboo rods in each one of
them<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.200> start<00:02:52.069> tying<00:02:52.250> them<00:02:52.430> up<00:02:52.519> so<00:02:52.910> they

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
them and start tying them up so they

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.800 
them and start tying them up so they
won't<00:02:53.150> fall<00:02:53.390> over<00:02:53.769> if<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:54.950> don't<00:02:55.159> tie<00:02:55.340> them<00:02:55.579> up

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
won't fall over if you don't tie them up

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.180 
won't fall over if you don't tie them up
like<00:02:56.810> if<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.019> don't<00:02:57.079> tie<00:02:57.349> that<00:02:57.590> one<00:02:57.709> up<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.099> a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
like if I don't tie that one up it's a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.789 
like if I don't tie that one up it's a
pretty<00:02:58.519> healthy<00:02:58.790> one<00:02:59.120> but<00:03:00.079> if<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.319> don't<00:03:00.379> tie<00:03:00.739> it

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
pretty healthy one but if I don't tie it

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.920 
pretty healthy one but if I don't tie it
up<00:03:01.099> this<00:03:01.549> whole<00:03:01.790> thing<00:03:02.060> could<00:03:02.209> just<00:03:02.239> fold<00:03:02.659> over

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
up this whole thing could just fold over

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.199 
up this whole thing could just fold over
and<00:03:03.200> once<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.859> creases<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.549> you<00:03:04.670> lift<00:03:04.909> it<00:03:05.090> up

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
and once it creases and you lift it up

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.869 
and once it creases and you lift it up
it<00:03:05.480> will<00:03:06.019> start<00:03:06.260> cutting<00:03:06.859> through<00:03:07.099> it<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.430> if

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
it will start cutting through it and if

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.610 
it will start cutting through it and if
you<00:03:08.030> didn't<00:03:08.390> let<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.510> happen<00:03:08.629> two<00:03:09.170> three<00:03:09.440> four

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
you didn't let it happen two three four

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.530 
you didn't let it happen two three four
times<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:10.099> would<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:11.209> wouldn't<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.510> a

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
times it would you wouldn't have a

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.240 
times it would you wouldn't have a
leaves<00:03:11.810> left<00:03:12.049> so<00:03:12.260> you've<00:03:12.409> got<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.799> stake<00:03:13.040> them

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
leaves left so you've got to stake them

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.479 
leaves left so you've got to stake them
up<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.669> support<00:03:14.000> them<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:15.889> big<00:03:16.040> secret<00:03:16.400> to

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
up to support them and the big secret to

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.250 
up to support them and the big secret to
make<00:03:16.639> them<00:03:16.790> rebloom<00:03:17.419> is<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.810> got<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.019> get<00:03:18.109> as

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
make them rebloom is you got to get as

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.740 
make them rebloom is you got to get as
many<00:03:18.470> leaves<00:03:18.680> as<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.099> can<00:03:19.389> so<00:03:20.389> you<00:03:20.450> want<00:03:20.660> to

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
many leaves as you can so you want to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.839 
many leaves as you can so you want to
protect<00:03:21.049> all<00:03:21.230> these<00:03:21.380> leaves<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:22.099> then<00:03:22.700> when

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
protect all these leaves and then when

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.400 
protect all these leaves and then when
you<00:03:22.940> plant<00:03:23.180> them<00:03:23.299> in<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:23.419> ground<00:03:23.599> to

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
you plant them in the ground to

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.170 
you plant them in the ground to
rejuvenate<00:03:24.739> them<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.519> got<00:03:25.669> a<00:03:25.700> lot<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.060> leaves

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
rejuvenate them you got a lot of leaves

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.360 
rejuvenate them you got a lot of leaves
to<00:03:26.419> turn<00:03:26.599> that<00:03:26.720> sunlight<00:03:27.169> into<00:03:27.680> energy<00:03:27.709> and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
to turn that sunlight into energy and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.099 
to turn that sunlight into energy and
put<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.910> back<00:03:29.180> into<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.569> boat<00:03:29.810> for<00:03:30.049> the

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
put that back into that boat for the

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.920 
put that back into that boat for the
next<00:03:30.379> year<00:03:30.819> so<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:31.970> next<00:03:32.180> time<00:03:32.389> you<00:03:32.569> see<00:03:32.780> these

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
next year so the next time you see these

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.379 
next year so the next time you see these
in<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.319> week<00:03:33.500> they'll<00:03:34.129> all<00:03:34.459> be<00:03:34.489> bigger<00:03:34.970> taller

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
in a week they'll all be bigger taller

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.979 
in a week they'll all be bigger taller
and<00:03:35.750> they'll<00:03:35.870> all<00:03:36.019> have<00:03:36.260> bamboo<00:03:36.739> uh<00:03:37.989> tiny

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
and they'll all have bamboo uh tiny

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.370 
and they'll all have bamboo uh tiny
bamboo<00:03:39.470> rods<00:03:39.859> holding<00:03:40.160> them<00:03:40.280> up
