00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 these huge designs on the water parts 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.879
 floating bridge military cars and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.370
 railroad workers suggests crossing length 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.530
 350 meters for cars and trains 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 just an hour after starting work on 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.440
 the ferry begins the movement of combat 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.859
 equipment 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.650
 Mi-24 helicopters will be pronounced 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.380
 as long as the last BTR and crosses 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.210
 river using radio electronic station 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.010
 wrestling specialists jam signals and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.840
 intercept enemy messages 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.789
 so when on the water appear 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.560
 several people with guns and in 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.899
 there is an explosion at the crossing 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.520
 Russian military give lightning 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.520
 repulse from land and air 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.280
 the enemy blew one of the pontoons on which 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.829
 keep crossing bridge disabled 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.390
 but it is not for long hard ural 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.910
 turn into a car with 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.280
 railway carts in this way 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 reveal exactly which section of the crossing 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.140
 got damaged and if on rails 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.269
 more explosive further military eyes 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.850
 change the damaged part as part 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.309
 giant puzzle check carried out 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.890
 and under water we made a combined 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.619
 the bridge that passes troops then 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.869
 pontoon bridge is output skipped 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.160
 ships that are necessary for the movement 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.310
 cargo security 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.800
 I do not care about the population of the army 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.320
 no then scheduled again 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.360
 and can again works for crossing 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.490
 army or other directions 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.649
 while the repair is going, the equipment is shipped to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.020
 ferries speed 2 meters per second 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.619
 despite the strong wind and powerful 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.869
 flow 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.240
 as soon as the crossing is restored the way 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.429
 multi-ton BTR and 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.259
 pontoon ammunition trucks 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.780
 structures on a smooth rail 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.970
 the bridge can easily withstand even echelon 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.970
 with equipment up to 3000 tons 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.510
 and here is another way to overcome 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.400
 an obstacle but it is no longer water 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.500
 tank rock bridge for lenovo 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.750
 the truck served as the roof of the armored vehicle 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.340
 off-road typhoon armor 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.040
 only withstand collisions with 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.390
 a truck but also explosions up to 8 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.390
 kilograms of TNT 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.630
