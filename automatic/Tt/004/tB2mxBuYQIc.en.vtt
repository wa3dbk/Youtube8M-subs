again<00:02:51.519> i'd<00:02:51.640> be<00:02:51.730> very<00:02:51.760> very<00:02:52.060> happy<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:52.540> again

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
again i'd be very very happy but again

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.030 
again i'd be very very happy but again
its<00:02:53.050> left<00:02:53.230> wing<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.530> doesn't<00:02:53.769> make<00:02:53.830> all

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
its left wing so it doesn't make all

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.990 
its left wing so it doesn't make all
that<00:02:54.160> much<00:02:54.310> difference<00:02:54.670> because<00:02:54.850> there's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
that much difference because there's

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.059 
that much difference because there's
already<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.239> 99<00:02:55.690> rate<00:02:55.870> version<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.380> him<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:56.980> he

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
already a 99 rate version of him but he

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.600
