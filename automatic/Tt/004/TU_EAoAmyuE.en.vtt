00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.900 
single day on my hair I think this just
has<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.200> be<00:04:17.229> chopped<00:04:17.799> off<00:04:18.010> but<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.459> think<00:04:18.760> it's

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
has to be chopped off but I think it's

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.750 
has to be chopped off but I think it's
really<00:04:19.090> good<00:04:19.389> for<00:04:19.570> your<00:04:19.720> natural<00:04:20.470> hair<00:04:20.709> if<00:04:21.549> you

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
really good for your natural hair if you

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.000 
really good for your natural hair if you
haven't<00:04:21.970> really<00:04:22.389> done<00:04:22.840> anything<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.860> it's

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
haven't really done anything and it's

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.430 
haven't really done anything and it's
not<00:04:24.250> that<00:04:24.460> damage<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.210> think<00:04:25.690> it's<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.930> great<00:04:26.110> way

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
not that damage I think it's a great way

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.510 
not that damage I think it's a great way
to<00:04:26.500> keep<00:04:26.950> your<00:04:27.220> help<00:04:27.460> here<00:04:28.260> healthy<00:04:29.260> and

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
to keep your help here healthy and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.010 
to keep your help here healthy and
preventing<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.669> from<00:04:30.700> becoming<00:04:31.270> even<00:04:31.990> more

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
preventing it from becoming even more

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.320 
preventing it from becoming even more
damaged<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.860> do<00:04:33.099> this<00:04:33.490> almost<00:04:34.030> every<00:04:34.690> day<00:04:34.720> and

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
damaged I do this almost every day and

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.760 
damaged I do this almost every day and
honestly<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.450> think<00:04:37.630> this<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.050> less<00:04:38.470> work

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
honestly I think this is less work

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.490 
honestly I think this is less work
because<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:39.190> want<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.639> do<00:04:39.820> anything<00:04:40.330> after<00:04:41.229> and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
because I want to do anything after and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.379 
because I want to do anything after and
it<00:04:41.680> keeps<00:04:41.919> my<00:04:42.099> hair<00:04:42.310> very<00:04:42.340> moisturized<00:04:43.150> in

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
it keeps my hair very moisturized in

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.870 
it keeps my hair very moisturized in
instead<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:44.050> having<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.410> wash<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:45.010> again<00:04:45.190> and

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
instead of having to wash it again and

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.659 
instead of having to wash it again and
it<00:04:46.030> takes<00:04:46.300> such<00:04:46.510> a<00:04:46.539> long<00:04:46.810> time<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.320> wash<00:04:47.530> out<00:04:47.830> so

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
it takes such a long time to wash out so

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.760 
it takes such a long time to wash out so
far<00:04:48.940> i'm<00:04:49.240> loving<00:04:49.599> coconut<00:04:50.289> oil<00:04:50.470> and

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
far i'm loving coconut oil and

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.040 
far i'm loving coconut oil and
especially<00:04:51.340> because<00:04:51.700> its<00:04:51.970> chemical<00:04:52.479> free<00:04:52.810> and

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
especially because its chemical free and

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.700 
especially because its chemical free and
the<00:04:53.919> one<00:04:54.130> I<00:04:54.160> use<00:04:54.610> is<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.510> Kirkland<00:04:56.110> organic

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
the one I use is the Kirkland organic

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.129 
the one I use is the Kirkland organic
coconut<00:04:56.979> oil<00:04:57.250> but<00:04:57.880> if<00:04:58.000> you're<00:04:58.150> in<00:04:58.300> Korea<00:04:58.690> it's

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
coconut oil but if you're in Korea it's

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.119 
coconut oil but if you're in Korea it's
so<00:04:59.770> hard<00:05:00.160> to<00:05:00.280> find

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
so hard to find

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.449 
so hard to find
oil<00:05:01.429> so<00:05:02.119> i<00:05:02.149> actually<00:05:02.629> had<00:05:03.139> to<00:05:03.469> ask<00:05:03.830> someone<00:05:04.219> in

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:04.459 
oil so i actually had to ask someone in

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:06.669 
oil so i actually had to ask someone in
the<00:05:04.550> states<00:05:04.879> to<00:05:05.179> send<00:05:05.449> me<00:05:05.629> the<00:05:05.839> coconut<00:05:06.499> oil

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:06.679 
the states to send me the coconut oil

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:09.309 
the states to send me the coconut oil
you<00:05:07.279> can<00:05:07.459> still<00:05:07.759> find<00:05:08.209> it<00:05:08.419> but<00:05:08.719> it's<00:05:08.899> rare<00:05:09.289> and

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
you can still find it but it's rare and

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.249 
you can still find it but it's rare and
it's<00:05:10.099> also<00:05:10.429> a<00:05:10.639> little<00:05:10.879> bit<00:05:10.999> pricier<00:05:11.779> I<00:05:11.809> think

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
it's also a little bit pricier I think

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.499 
it's also a little bit pricier I think
it<00:05:12.379> depends<00:05:12.709> on<00:05:12.889> where<00:05:13.129> you<00:05:13.279> live<00:05:13.519> so<00:05:14.059> that's

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
it depends on where you live so that's

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.469 
it depends on where you live so that's
my<00:05:14.749> review<00:05:14.809> on<00:05:15.259> coconut<00:05:16.009> oil<00:05:16.249> in<00:05:16.610> I<00:05:16.969> just<00:05:17.300> like
