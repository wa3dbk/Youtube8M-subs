something like this as much as I don't
want<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.710> potentially<00:00:59.699> having<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.329> trade

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
after I castle this position is

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.410 
after I castle this position is
definitely<00:01:11.159> messy<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.119> looks<00:01:12.299> like

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
definitely messy and one that looks like

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
definitely messy and one that looks like
a<00:01:12.479> ton<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> fun<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> play<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.560> bullitt<00:01:14.010> I'd

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
a ton of fun to play in bullitt I'd

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.999 
a ton of fun to play in bullitt I'd
rather<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.580> black<00:01:14.820> hair<00:01:15.439> even<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.770> turns

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
rather be black hair even if it turns

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
rather be black hair even if it turns
out<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.280> don't<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.820> enough<00:01:18.470> playing

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
out I don't have enough playing

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.520 
out I don't have enough playing
instinctively<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.900> assuming<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> c2

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
instinctively here assuming that the c2

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.080 
instinctively here assuming that the c2
might<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:23.430> tricky<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.759> him<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
might be a little bit tricky for him to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.760 
might be a little bit tricky for him to
guard<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.630> he<00:01:24.810> goes<00:01:24.960> ahead<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.470> deals

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
guard but he goes ahead and just deals

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.469 
guard but he goes ahead and just deals
with<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.310> guess<00:01:26.549> I'll<00:01:26.700> give<00:01:26.850> check<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.390> then

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
with it I guess I'll give check and then

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.850 
with it I guess I'll give check and then
take<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:28.159> attacking<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:30.350> 7<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.619> maybe

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
take here attacking on a 7 and maybe

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.649 
take here attacking on a 7 and maybe
threatening<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.460> bring<00:01:32.640> rook<00:01:32.909> takes<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.420> two

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
threatening to bring rook takes see two

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.800 
threatening to bring rook takes see two

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
though and I do not really like my

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.249 
though and I do not really like my
position<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.969> that's<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.630> irritating

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
position so that's kind of irritating

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
really so sure how I can do now you can

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.600 
really so sure how I can do now you can
just<00:02:08.069> take<00:02:08.250> their<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:09.539> that's<00:02:09.720> not<00:02:09.959> good

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610

lose down seven seconds like last game
which<00:02:55.599> is<00:02:55.750> way<00:02:55.930> too<00:02:55.989> big<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.500> time

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
over here today this game looks like it

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.100 
over here today this game looks like it
should<00:03:08.470> be<00:03:08.500> fun<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:10.420> go<00:03:10.540> ahead<00:03:10.629> and<00:03:10.720> sack

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
should be fun I can go ahead and sack

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.920 
should be fun I can go ahead and sack
and<00:03:11.140> then<00:03:11.440> play<00:03:11.709> g6<00:03:12.280> while<00:03:13.209> his<00:03:13.420> pieces<00:03:13.690> are

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
and then play g6 while his pieces are

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.610 
and then play g6 while his pieces are
sidelined<00:03:15.239> over<00:03:16.239> there<00:03:16.480> on<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.840> queenside

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
sidelined over there on the queenside

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.920 
sidelined over there on the queenside
particularly<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.459> Queen<00:03:18.810> liking<00:03:19.810> my

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
particularly the Queen liking my

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.870 
particularly the Queen liking my
attacking<00:03:20.380> chances<00:03:20.739> here<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.130> thought<00:03:21.730> he

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
attacking chances here I thought he

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.520 
attacking chances here I thought he
might<00:03:22.090> play<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.510> which<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.079> course<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.410> have

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
might play this which of course I have

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.470 
might play this which of course I have
two<00:03:23.709> good<00:03:23.889> moves<00:03:24.160> including<00:03:24.730> just<00:03:24.940> Bishop<00:03:25.359> to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
two good moves including just Bishop to

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.039 
two good moves including just Bishop to
e2<00:03:25.630> actually<00:03:26.910> maybe<00:03:27.910> f3<00:03:28.359> was<00:03:28.480> better<00:03:28.690> than

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
e2 actually maybe f3 was better than

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.420 
e2 actually maybe f3 was better than
taking<00:03:29.230> up<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:29.620> much<00:03:29.650> check<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.130> then<00:03:30.190> clean

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
taking up so much check and then clean

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.390 
taking up so much check and then clean
up<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.670> pin<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> bishop<00:03:31.380> darn<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.620> didn't

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
up to pin the bishop darn I didn't

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.099 
up to pin the bishop darn I didn't
really<00:03:33.489> see<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:33.910> idea<00:03:36.239> but<00:03:37.239> this<00:03:37.660> looks<00:03:37.870> like

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
really see that idea but this looks like

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.699 
really see that idea but this looks like
it<00:03:38.290> should<00:03:38.500> also<00:03:38.680> be<00:03:39.269> doing<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.389> trick

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
it should also be doing the trick

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.659 
it should also be doing the trick
bringing<00:03:41.709> this<00:03:41.799> thing<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.099> a<00:03:42.130> rubber<00:03:42.400> match

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
bringing this thing to a rubber match

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.550 
bringing this thing to a rubber match
