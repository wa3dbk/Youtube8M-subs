well<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.240> had<00:01:42.360> two<00:01:42.540> things<00:01:42.810> down<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.380> had

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
well it had two things down there it had

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
well it had two things down there it had
a<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.159> equivalent<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.700> what<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.030> used<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
a the equivalent of what they used for a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.300 
a the equivalent of what they used for a
Jake<00:01:45.810> brake<00:01:45.840> which<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.100> reach<00:01:47.280> down

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
Jake brake which I would reach down

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
Jake brake which I would reach down
there<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.820> flip<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:49.049> I've

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
there and flip that and then I've

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.719 
there and flip that and then I've
reached<00:01:49.380> down<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> little<00:01:49.799> lower<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.399> cut<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
reached down a little lower to cut the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.560 
reached down a little lower to cut the
truck<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.540> was<00:01:51.570> coming<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> stop<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
truck off as I was coming to a stop and

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
truck off as I was coming to a stop and
to<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.750> day<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.649> slow<00:01:55.950> down<00:01:56.130> my

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
to this day when i go to slow down my

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.800 
to this day when i go to slow down my
right<00:01:56.579> hand<00:01:56.909> goes<00:01:57.149> down<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.540> floor

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
right hand goes down in the floor

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.410 
right hand goes down in the floor
looking<00:01:58.369> looking<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.670> Jake<00:01:59.939> brake<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
looking looking for that Jake brake and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.870 
looking looking for that Jake brake and
looking<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.930> cut<00:02:01.200> off<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.579> seemed<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
looking for that cut off so it seemed to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.340 
looking for that cut off so it seemed to
me<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.390> right<00:02:03.570> place<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:04.020> put<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
me like the right place to put it is

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.260 
me like the right place to put it is
right<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:04.680> when<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.490> sitting<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> seat

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
right there when I'm sitting in the seat

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.059 
right there when I'm sitting in the seat
my<00:02:06.509> right<00:02:06.719> hand<00:02:06.990> falls<00:02:07.229> down<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> spot

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
my right hand falls down to the spot

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.999 
my right hand falls down to the spot
goes<00:02:08.459> looking

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
goes looking

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.410 
goes looking
or<00:02:09.099> they<00:02:09.159> fought<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.610> falls<00:02:09.819> right<00:02:09.970> onto<00:02:10.299> that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
or they fought it falls right onto that

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.350 
or they fought it falls right onto that
spot<00:02:10.780> there's<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.680> metal<00:02:12.159> plate<00:02:12.340> up<00:02:12.700> under<00:02:13.120> here

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
spot there's a metal plate up under here

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.440 
spot there's a metal plate up under here
I've<00:02:13.480> cut<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.069> oak<00:02:15.069> out<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.670> I'm<00:02:16.209> going<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
I've cut the oak out and I'm going to

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.360 
I've cut the oak out and I'm going to
cut<00:02:16.659> this<00:02:17.200> square<00:02:17.650> out<00:02:17.860> where<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.159> metal

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
cut this square out where the metal

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.220 
cut this square out where the metal
plate<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.909> I'm<00:02:19.209> going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.480> mount<00:02:19.689> this<00:02:19.930> thing

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
plate is I'm going to mount this thing

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.309 
plate is I'm going to mount this thing
down<00:02:20.439> in<00:02:20.680> there<00:02:20.920> run<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.970> brake<00:02:22.659> lines<00:02:22.989> from

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
down in there run the brake lines from

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.020 
down in there run the brake lines from
I'm<00:02:23.620> going<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.829> actually<00:02:24.370> take<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.849> brake

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
I'm going to actually take the brake

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.119 
I'm going to actually take the brake
lines<00:02:25.269> loose<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.870> there's<00:02:26.560> actually<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> place

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
lines loose and there's actually a place

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.440 
lines loose and there's actually a place
where<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.459> front<00:02:27.700> brake<00:02:27.909> line<00:02:28.150> has<00:02:28.420> a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
where the front brake line has a

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.170 
where the front brake line has a
connection<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.220> see<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.549> right<00:02:30.730> there<00:02:30.790> so

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
connection you can see it right there so

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.789 
connection you can see it right there so
I<00:02:31.209> should<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.480> able<00:02:31.629> to<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:31.930> unbolt<00:02:32.530> that

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
I should be able to just unbolt that

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.399 
I should be able to just unbolt that
connection<00:02:33.340> come<00:02:34.120> off<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.510> one<00:02:34.720> side<00:02:35.019> of<00:02:35.049> it

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
connection come off of one side of it

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.740 
connection come off of one side of it
back<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.859> hear<00:02:36.159> off<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.760> other<00:02:36.909> side<00:02:37.209> back<00:02:37.540> to

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
back to hear off the other side back to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.170 
back to hear off the other side back to
that<00:02:37.930> line<00:02:38.189> we'd<00:02:39.189> all<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.489> air<00:02:39.609> out<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
that line we'd all the air out of it and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.970 
that line we'd all the air out of it and
that<00:02:40.209> should<00:02:40.510> pretty<00:02:40.720> well<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.470> she<00:02:41.739> pretty

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
that should pretty well and she pretty

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.430 
that should pretty well and she pretty
will<00:02:42.010> take<00:02:42.340> care<00:02:42.549> of<00:02:42.609> that<00:02:42.870> my<00:02:43.870> brake<00:02:44.170> lines

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
will take care of that my brake lines

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.069 
will take care of that my brake lines
will<00:02:44.680> probably<00:02:45.159> run<00:02:45.370> over<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.690> under

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
will probably run over this and under

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.199 
will probably run over this and under
this<00:02:47.769> piece<00:02:48.069> of<00:02:48.250> oak<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.670> I'll<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:48.909> to<00:02:48.940> notch

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
this piece of oak so I'll have to notch

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.270 
this piece of oak so I'll have to notch
out<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.629> oak<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.440> my<00:02:50.560> brake<00:02:50.769> lines<00:02:51.010> can

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
out the oak so that my brake lines can

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.309 
out the oak so that my brake lines can
sit<00:02:51.489> up<00:02:51.519> in<00:02:51.730> there<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.120> not<00:02:52.329> you<00:02:53.079> know<00:02:53.109> that

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
sit up in there and not you know that

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.809 
sit up in there and not you know that
oak<00:02:53.500> can<00:02:53.769> kind<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.040> sit<00:02:54.250> over<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.579> kind<00:02:54.700> of

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
oak can kind of sit over and kind of

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.970 
oak can kind of sit over and kind of
protect<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.329> that<00:02:56.109> should<00:02:56.290> work<00:02:56.319> beautifully

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
protect it that should work beautifully

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.490 
protect it that should work beautifully
this<00:02:57.129> whole<00:02:57.340> thing<00:02:57.549> will<00:02:57.700> fall<00:02:57.730> down<00:02:58.500> about

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
this whole thing will fall down about

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.339 
this whole thing will fall down about
probably<00:03:00.489> about<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.909> much<00:03:01.409> and<00:03:03.299> I'll<00:03:04.299> rig<00:03:05.200> up

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
probably about this much and I'll rig up

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.080 
probably about this much and I'll rig up
a<00:03:05.500> place<00:03:05.829> where<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.069> can<00:03:06.159> bolt<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.639> into<00:03:06.790> place

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
a place where I can bolt it into place

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.140 
a place where I can bolt it into place
there<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:08.129> that<00:03:09.129> should<00:03:09.310> be<00:03:09.430> just<00:03:09.609> ideal<00:03:09.970> so

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
there and that should be just ideal so

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.210 
there and that should be just ideal so
that<00:03:10.269> this<00:03:10.420> will<00:03:10.599> probably<00:03:10.629> sit<00:03:11.409> almost<00:03:11.950> flush

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
that this will probably sit almost flush

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.589 
that this will probably sit almost flush
with<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.459> floor<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:13.000> little<00:03:13.299> handle

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
with the floor this little handle

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.759 
with the floor this little handle
sticking<00:03:13.810> up<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.199> I've<00:03:14.260> just<00:03:14.290> reached<00:03:14.620> down

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
sticking up and I've just reached down
