so<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.799> hit<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> enemy<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> will<00:01:39.000> apply

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so you will hit the enemy and will apply

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.630 
so you will hit the enemy and will apply
damage<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.079> slow<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> enemy<00:01:41.130> that's

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
damage and a slow to the enemy that's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.120 
damage and a slow to the enemy that's
also<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.509> fast<00:01:42.780> way<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> hit<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
also a really fast way to hit with the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
also a really fast way to hit with the
Year<00:01:44.280> fist<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> he's<00:01:45.149> probably<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.600> highest

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
Year fist and he's probably the highest

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.960 
Year fist and he's probably the highest
damage<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.549> really<00:01:47.640> important

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
damage of this so it's really important

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.030 
damage of this so it's really important
to<00:01:48.000> hit<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:49.320> next<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.710> Malphite
