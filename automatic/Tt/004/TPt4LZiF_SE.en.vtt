00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.570
 ok we are here again in the channel 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.790
 your automotive mechanics channel 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.400
 of electro efe 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.029
 and today I'm here to talk 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.650
 a little bit quickly what is the 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.500
 how to test a car battery with the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.580
 Multimeter 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.250
 in this case I have a multimeter here 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.100
 of the most basic of the cheapest 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.619
 I found that it even looks like a toy 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.540
 but good first thing we have to 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.700
 do the first step we have to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.590
 continue is to turn on the multimeter and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.790
 Take it to our voltage scale 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.940
 direct 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.410
 what is it that you can also see if what 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.420
 you see the direct voltage dsb here 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.870
 and as in the case of these multimeters 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.870
 that are from 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.760
 are from that reader that have a selector 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.649
 wheel 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.420
 but what do we have to do in our 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:06.570
 case as the battery the battery has a 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.540
 voltage in a range of 12 volts 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.100
 so we're going to send the first stop 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.070
 that we see is that of 200 people 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.030
 millivolts the second of 2000 also 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.820
 millivolts 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.369
 and this one that tells us 20 another of 200 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.010
 and another thousand volts good let's go to 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.610
 the one of 20 that is the one in the range 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.890
 they are two digits 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.909
 two digits that are 20 and we're going 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.439
 Let's measure 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.369
 we are going to measure 12 volts and that is 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.369
 let's choose this one 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.170
 that scale in the case of multimeters 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.520
 autoscale we just have to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.520
 put in the direct voltage 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.810
 and also to help me do this 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.420
 video I have 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 I have this table that is the table of 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.090
 capacity estimation according to voltage 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.440
 according to the voltage that we give 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.180
 this table will help us 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.310
 to have an idea of ​​what percentage 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.960
 is our charging battery or what 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.539
 percentage of life is more or less 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.200
 our battery 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.920
 to tell us feeling 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.410
 Now I'm going to measure the load 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.240
 of the battery with the multimeter 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.590
 and let's aim the value and let's see 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.590
 more or less like where this bacterium 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.180
 the steps are easy just him 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.920
 the black tip we send it to negative 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.390
 always comes gripping the post and the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.560
 positive 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.150
 and the red the positive 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.689
 and how can you see 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.440
 clearly it is indicating us 12.44 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.920
 volts 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.720
 ah 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.420
 so now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.470
 bring for 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.470
 bring the board closer 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.120
 I hope it looks there 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:24.630
 ok already as of the table and let's see the 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.630
 value that we got was d 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:35.829
 12.44 volts this our value and the 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:40.239
 table tells us that 12.65 up the 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:45.819
 battery is 100% tells us 12.45 for 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:50.420
 up is 75 12 points 24 volts at 50 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:54.170
 and above 12 points 6 volts 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.410
 to approximately 25% 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.680
 I want you to notice that 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.140
 it seems that we sometimes when 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.670
 we started measuring we measure 12 volts and 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.950
 sometimes we assume that the battery 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.140
 it's okay with 12 volts and it's very 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.570
 important that we have in mind 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.480
 that one volt makes the point a long time 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.110
 volt long ago the difference point a 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.350
 volt or 100 thousand volts does a lot 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:24.490
 difference for example from here from 65 to 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.740
 45 there's only 2 volts point and the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.290
 difference is 25% as you can see 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.480
 here it is very important that we notice it is 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.820
 very important to see if the voltage the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.010
 voltage that the whole numbers like that 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.540
 is 12 but always see also the 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.980
 two other numbers coming soon 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.560
 or the immediate number that comes in 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.520
 followed because it is the one that will give us 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.770
 will give us the good reference in addition 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.900
 of how our battery is like in 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.660
 this case mine is in 2 is battery 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.410
 is at 12.44 it means that it is 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.900
 around 70 75% 15 that still 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.550
 Battery 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.300
 the battery can be said to be good 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.759
 he still has life 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.400
 if we find it around 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:09.099
 the 12 points 2 volts because we already have 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.039
 so you have to go thinking about changing 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.960
 the battery if the car still starts 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.750
 well, we still have time to put together 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.879
 money and buy another battery if 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.350
 we have a battery with 12 volts 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.760
 Closed 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.380
 with 12 volts closed 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.840
 and say we're going to start and have 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.820
 problems and if still still our 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.139
 car rips is the most likely in that 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.030
 be at any time 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.219
 it starts to give us problems or we go to 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.230
 leave lying around or we're not going to 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:42.260
 occupy being passing load 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.250
 before finishing the video I want 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.250
 mention what else 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.470
 if you decide for example right now I'm 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.720
 testing the battery with him with the car 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.330
 cold but if you come you're going to make a 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.000
 sent you light the car warms it not 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.470
 you make a turn and return the car 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.780
 It's hot and you want to try the 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.400
 drums 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.230
 I recommend that if the car is 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.130
 hot the battery was charged by the 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.570
 alternator but I know he was working 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.850
 immediately before you go to 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.330
 do the test of him the test with 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:19.240
 multimeter I recommend that clothes that 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.730
 garments your with the engine turned off 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.970
 the front lights of the car for 5 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.860
 or 10 seconds from 5 to 10 seconds this 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.020
 so that you eliminate the voltage 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.630
 superficial I'm not going to get too much 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.460
 explain about surface voltage 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.800
 I'm just going to tell you that it's 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.540
 convenient that you do that because the 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.340
 battery when it is newly charged by the 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.290
 alternator 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.139
 and that you just turn off the car later 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.460
 that the car has already warmed up 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.949
 always a voltage a voltage 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.650
 superficial which can reach us 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.020
 lie in 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.690
 if we do the test like this with the 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.120
 hot battery but I suggest you 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.490
 turn on the headlights about 5 to 10 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.800
 seconds with that you eliminate the voltage 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:06.340
 superficial and already your reading is going to be more 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.909
 is going to be more correct is going to be more more 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.909
 true 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.530
 Well, for me, it's all not 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.400
 forget to subscribe I will continue 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.400
 uploading more videos 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.240
 and well thank you for watching this video other 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.240
 time
