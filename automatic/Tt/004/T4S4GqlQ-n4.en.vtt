00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.900
 unscrewed us water flows i thought up 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.369
 economical washstand in our 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.520
 present conditions need tough 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.690
 saving water so you need to start 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.550
 that moment when you need water you open 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.040
 close when you do not need only then yes 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.140

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.760
 that one of the main elements of this is that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.729
 here it is the cork here this here from 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.680

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.700
 emery paper and emery paper 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.450
 a knife but the main thing less 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.020
 there are different irregularities that 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:29.090
 it is clear so now we need 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:30.240
 hammer for 70 legs scissors 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.850
 rubber 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.110
 softer risen this noumea in this case 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.880
 rubber from the bicycle chamber so 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:44.460
 slate carnation slate carnation 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.110
 Is Scotch tape number here 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.040
 this is this ribbon which products are there 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.540
 packaged so softly because I mean 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.549
 already done here not to take much 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.240
 we take slate guest out of time 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.079
 get out of the camera 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.479
 square here is a square and cut out 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.379
 we put a small hole on here 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.709
 slate guest here are our strengths 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:21.030
 power and then scissors extra you 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.860
 just so we cut off here 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.810
 such here so let prokladochka 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.930
 and gasket tires now take 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.440
 bottle cap and drill 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.290
 bore slightly larger diameter than 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.210
 this is the diameter of this day that is what 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.910
 nail loose here now 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.310
 drilled a hole here so that it 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.330
 smooth sanding like this 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.910
 insert it st it is like i tried 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.280
 I did not succeed in doing so 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.740
 you spin water here but weights 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.040
 the section is small so the valve 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.260
 closes are not really bad for this 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.250
 that the product came up with a long thought 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.580
 some spring is worthless 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.820
 I just took again from the camera here 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:22.550
 so thin rezinochku cut off here it is 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:27.940
 and here and here and so here I wear the connection 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.959
 so here I take this freak his 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:37.070
 made from this way 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:40.720
 and twisting tight everything now 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.640
 carnation this gum carnation 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.980
 pushes someone or valve rezinochki 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.340
 and here it is clamped here the water is not 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.730
 It should take place but just in case here 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.260
 if a 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:00.170
 to avoid I took here and so more 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:02.570
 here it is now tapes for the mat you can roll 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.640
 and guzzle it with tape can be tape 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.459
 confuse anyone what is 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.700
 but you so quickly show it to everyone 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:15.080
 because it comes up with something to do but 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.780
 the most important thing is to show the principle 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.550
 working principle of this 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:29.110
 washstand made it economically 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:29.110
 it is clear now we take a hammer 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:37.300
 knife here from cut out cut out 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.490
 here it is the valve here on the nail here and 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.990
