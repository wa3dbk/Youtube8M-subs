I'm here to bring you a video review of

the new trail runner the hook of my
fight<00:00:12.269> take<00:00:13.049> one<00:00:13.320> look<00:00:13.559> at<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> Hoka

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
fight take one look at the Hoka

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.680 
fight take one look at the Hoka
and<00:00:14.429> it's<00:00:14.610> obvious<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.240> shoe<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.660> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
and it's obvious that this shoe is a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.510 
and it's obvious that this shoe is a
little<00:00:16.049> bit<00:00:16.170> different<00:00:16.590> than<00:00:17.070> others<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520

well most shoe companies are doing

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
well most shoe companies are doing
everything<00:00:26.400> they<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.269> make<00:00:27.930> their<00:00:28.109> shoes

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
everything they can to make their shoes

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.070 
everything they can to make their shoes
a<00:00:28.380> little<00:00:28.680> bit<00:00:28.769> more<00:00:28.949> minimalist<00:00:29.490> Hoka<00:00:30.240> took

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
a little bit more minimalist Hoka took

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.650 
a little bit more minimalist Hoka took
another<00:00:31.349> direction<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> masa<00:00:32.420> the<00:00:33.420> shoe

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
another direction with the masa the shoe

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.830 
another direction with the masa the shoe
has<00:00:33.930> 50%<00:00:34.559> more<00:00:35.010> surface<00:00:35.700> area<00:00:35.910> than<00:00:36.719> other

now all that extra cushioning is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.080 
now all that extra cushioning is
designed<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.800> minimalize<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.860> impact<00:00:53.670> from

strike in addition they've added a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.830 
strike in addition they've added a
rocker<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.740> shoe<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.610> move<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.270> heel

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
to forefoot as quickly as possible now

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.090 
to forefoot as quickly as possible now
you're<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> notice<00:01:12.990> both<00:01:13.320> technologies

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you're going to notice both technologies

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.640 
you're going to notice both technologies
the<00:01:14.280> minute<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> put<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> shoe<00:01:15.530> it's<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the minute you put on the shoe it's a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.980 
the minute you put on the shoe it's a
very<00:01:16.860> cushy<00:01:17.310> shoe<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.030> when<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.720> start

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
very cushy shoe and when you start

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
very cushy shoe and when you start
running<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.680> has<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> very<00:01:20.100> springy

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
running in it it has a very springy

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
running in it it has a very springy
effect<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.659> you're<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.140> feel<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
effect and you're also gonna feel that

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.830 
effect and you're also gonna feel that
rocker<00:01:22.920> go<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> work<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.119> move<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.570> heel

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
rocker go to work as you move from heel

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.380 
rocker go to work as you move from heel
to<00:01:24.869> forefoot<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.979> each<00:01:26.159> stroke<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.909> was

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to forefoot with each stroke I was

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.840 
to forefoot with each stroke I was
actually<00:01:27.570> nervous<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.400> taking<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> Hoka

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
actually nervous about taking the Hoka

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.230 
actually nervous about taking the Hoka
on<00:01:30.060> technical<00:01:30.869> trails<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> started<00:01:33.090> out

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
on technical trails so I started out

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.910 
on technical trails so I started out
with<00:01:33.720> some<00:01:33.960> road<00:01:34.200> runs

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.850 

if<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:38.940> notice<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.780> actually<00:01:40.229> standing

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
if you notice you're actually standing

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.460 
if you notice you're actually standing
up<00:01:40.979> quite<00:01:41.370> high<00:01:41.420> with<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.110> cushion

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
up quite high with all of this cushion

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.710 
up quite high with all of this cushion
beneath<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.010> foot<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:44.790> was<00:01:45.000> worried<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:45.479> was

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
beneath your foot so I was worried I was

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.149 
beneath your foot so I was worried I was
gonna<00:01:45.840> twist<00:01:46.170> an<00:01:46.290> ankle<00:01:46.440> if<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.830> started

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
gonna twist an ankle if I started

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.550 
gonna twist an ankle if I started
hitting<00:01:47.280> rooster<00:01:47.729> rocks<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.990> perform<00:01:49.380> great

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560

on<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> road<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.400> I<00:01:50.460> decided<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.940> take<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.270> on

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
on the road so I decided I take it on

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.300 
on the road so I decided I take it on
trails<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> decided<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> take<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.010> on<00:01:53.130> some

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
trails and I decided to take it on some

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.670 
trails and I decided to take it on some
pretty<00:01:53.820> technical<00:01:54.119> single<00:01:54.840> track<00:01:55.050> in<00:01:55.229> Pisgah

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
pretty technical single track in Pisgah

I<00:02:03.950> was<00:02:04.950> amazed<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:05.729> comfortable<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
I was amazed at how comfortable and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.130 
I was amazed at how comfortable and
stable<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.259> felt<00:02:07.789> while<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.060> rocks<00:02:09.600> really

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
stable I felt while on rocks really

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.000 
stable I felt while on rocks really
great<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.739> steeps<00:02:11.780> now<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> did<00:02:13.260> feel<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.650> bit

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
