wouldn't be like the AIRAID offensive it
actually<00:03:41.639> having<00:03:41.819> establish<00:03:42.209> running<00:03:42.389> game

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
actually having establish running game

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.240 
actually having establish running game
is<00:03:42.599> a<00:03:42.659> fucking<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:43.680> know<00:03:43.769> he's<00:03:43.919> probably<00:03:44.010> most

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
is a fucking you know he's probably most

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.050 
is a fucking you know he's probably most
electrifying<00:03:44.699> running<00:03:45.120> back<00:03:45.239> in<00:03:45.389> college<00:03:47.060> but

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
electrifying running back in college but

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.140 
electrifying running back in college but
yes<00:03:48.419> I<00:03:48.720> do<00:03:49.109> think<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.889> Baylor's<00:03:50.669> offense<00:03:51.030> is

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
yes I do think that Baylor's offense is

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.280 
yes I do think that Baylor's offense is
gonna<00:03:51.239> be<00:03:51.359> too<00:03:51.599> much<00:03:51.720> for<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.989> so<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.169> have<00:03:52.260> to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
gonna be too much for you so you have to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.909 
gonna be too much for you so you have to
handle<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:53.129> this<00:03:53.340> game<00:03:54.109> I'm<00:03:55.109> gonna<00:03:55.290> say<00:03:55.590> that

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
handle in this game I'm gonna say that

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.189 
handle in this game I'm gonna say that
Bainer<00:03:56.760> might<00:03:57.030> keep<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:57.419> close<00:03:57.659> for<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.930> first

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
Bainer might keep it close for the first

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.240 
Bainer might keep it close for the first
a<00:03:58.290> little<00:03:58.379> bit<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.799> think<00:03:58.979> it's<00:03:59.069> gonna<00:03:59.159> be

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
a little bit but I think it's gonna be

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.280 
a little bit but I think it's gonna be
only<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.400> matter<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.609> time<00:03:59.699> if<00:04:00.599> they<00:04:00.720> are<00:04:00.930> unable

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
only a matter of time if they are unable

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.929 
only a matter of time if they are unable
to<00:04:01.470> establish<00:04:01.859> a<00:04:01.889> run<00:04:02.129> games<00:04:02.370> or<00:04:02.519> divas<00:04:02.760> gonna

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
to establish a run games or divas gonna

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.420 
to establish a run games or divas gonna
get<00:04:03.090> tired<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:04.530> don't<00:04:04.650> have<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.040> offensive

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
get tired you don't have the offensive

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.949 
get tired you don't have the offensive
firepower<00:04:05.639> that<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.209> Chicago<00:04:06.510> area<00:04:06.780> that

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
firepower that the Chicago area that

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.589 
firepower that the Chicago area that
Baylor<00:04:07.319> Bears<00:04:07.530> have<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:08.099> think<00:04:09.060> Baylor<00:04:09.299> will

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
Baylor Bears have I think Baylor will

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.559 
Baylor Bears have I think Baylor will
this<00:04:10.079> game<00:04:10.319> will<00:04:10.470> be<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.620> high-scoring<00:04:11.099> game

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
this game will be a high-scoring game

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.819 
this game will be a high-scoring game
especially<00:04:12.569> for<00:04:12.900> Baylor<00:04:13.079> son<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.439> think<00:04:13.620> Baylor

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
especially for Baylor son I think Baylor

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.029 
especially for Baylor son I think Baylor
will<00:04:14.009> put<00:04:14.189> up<00:04:14.310> 48<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.299> think<00:04:15.479> we<00:04:15.569> Baylor<00:04:15.810> 48<00:04:16.409> UCF

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
will put up 48 I think we Baylor 48 UCF

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.159 
will put up 48 I think we Baylor 48 UCF
28<00:04:17.609> also<00:04:18.479> there'll<00:04:18.599> be<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.720> 20<00:04:19.049> point

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
28 also there'll be a 20 point

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.289 
28 also there'll be a 20 point
difference<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.889> then<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.729> game<00:04:20.940> that<00:04:21.120> I

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
difference and then the game that I

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.850 
difference and then the game that I
