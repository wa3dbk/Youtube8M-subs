00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Do you like music if so, then? 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.569
 You can not miss your wedding. 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.569
 indeed realize one of the priorities 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.230
 Who does he use like I am? 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.330
 priority things in a wedding 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.680
 in fact when it comes to budgeting you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.660
 have to establish things that do not 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.780
 may be lacking in my case 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.270
 these things have been stopped and I make music 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.610
 for the ceremony you have three options of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.430
 urban coral gei 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.199
 can the band be with voice or 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.329
 only instrumental there are also people 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.640
 which invites the contact only a person who 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.769
 sing and she'll sing with playback not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.290
 It's all ugly but I particularly 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.480
 do not put on my wedding grooms 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.719
 brides and other actors kan wedding 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.699
 It's cool too, but it could be a fiasco. 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.609
 You can not understand anything about tuning. 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.369
 rhythm and melody but nobody is deaf 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.100
 that the choice of songs can be 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.910
 be made in two ways the face that is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.759
 difficult 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.950
 the songs should reflect the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.840
 time and the couple does not give to a girl 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.280
 who enjoys samba and is heavy metal 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 very heavy right? 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 duh damage than traditional now 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.190
 day is a choice of the couple you do not 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.650
 must necessarily be with the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.930
 official margin only if you want do not have 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.560
 nothing more of that of the bride however 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.979
 with the death of the officer or with hallelujah or 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.869
 with lino sei or mari necklace does not have 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.369
 everyone is free to us musicians who 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.890
 like your wedding 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.820
 after all, your marriage is not from the others 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.009
 people right 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.229
 hello and such is the song that I enter 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.149
 Nice to see a bit of my wedding like 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.920
 I said in the previous video to hype 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.990
 marcinho coming on the soundtrack 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 love diary is one of the songs that makes 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.320
 part of my client 's marriage but 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.119
 I will not tell you when 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.950
 do not ruin the surprise, do not create a 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.590
 list of songs was not so difficult 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.329
 because I really like and I get involved 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.729
 with this in an amateur way or not since 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.860
 17 year old who was the first time 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.170
 that the rival declared good I do not know how to play 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.910
 keyboard for 12 years already wasted 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.350
 Sorry mom, I did not have the patience to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.360
 she 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.420
 in your but the other thing that I do 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.230
 sing since the age of nine . 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.450
 age 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.040
 I will not sing here has a lot of 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.480
 people asking me if I go to my 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.660
 marriage looks nobody will sing in my 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.760
 marriage but because it 's simple because I 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.620
 I'm very psychotic with rhythm tuning 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.630
 melody all the things that surround 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.550
 music and yours is between someone 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.230
 to detune in my music 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.210
 My god, I do not even want to see how it goes. 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.760
 Yes so I opted only for the instrumental 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.250
 It's something that I understand - and that I 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.140
 I will realize - the errors that will suffer 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.200
 some small may be playing a 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.540
 A lot of instruments and I love you 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.420
 You're going to suffer, God give me people. 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.800
 it is not so the music was one of the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.210
 things that we prioritized I wanted 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.010
 because I wanted it to be a band because I 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.260
 I think it's more beautiful and it suits us. 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.240
 because we are involved in the middle of the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.840
 music we do the ministry 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.640
 praise of the congregating church is 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.950
 thing that is part of the route in my 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.290
 The list of songs has only two 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.660
 I was sure there was no more than 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.610
 remaining five years are songs that I 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.080
 taste 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.150
 currently but I know I 'm going to like it 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.320
 for the rest of your life as you may have 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.640
 sure this is so is because search 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.080
 a very particular thing as per 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.350
 For example, I 'm not much of a sertanejo fan. 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.680
 You pay for these things so in my 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.720
 marriage but not the nape but if it's a thing 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.180
 which is part of the bride's identity and 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.020
 of the groom people have to be part 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.530
 because the music reflects the couple and nothing 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.510
 better to pack this ceremony of the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.070
 that a soundtrack corresponding to the 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.660
 people who are getting married for what 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.730
 I'm not much of a fan of music. 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.830
 traditional wedding because you 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.780
 do not listen to the nuptial march and get excited 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.270
 on your ipod because the maria ave is not the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.100
 your music and your fiancÃ© you have to 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.860
 put songs that are part of the 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.540
 history of you if not seizure not 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.340
 it makes a lot of sense unless this 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.440
 make a difference to you makes me 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.260
 because I invite you too, so I 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.270
 really I think much of it were indeed 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.680
 the first things that I set this way 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.420
 to set a wedding date 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.120
 first thing 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.420
 after the stage in logic then you 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.250
 You did not change your mind, did not you? 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.630
 I did not change I do not I 'm sure 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.880
 It was the best choice I made of all 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.430
 the songs and then you can ask 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.780
 lucas liked looks he liked it so 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.520
 liked a lot 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.160
 or else you do not think very well 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.450
 chair will not be there I liked the 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:51.060
 was very different from the 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:54.370
 traditional that you chose and juliana only knot 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.770
 day my suggestion well than I thought 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.170
 in the end I found it very interesting for 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.170
 instrumental facts has a new football 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.910
 field and the ink band running behind the 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.020
 house of the murderer error 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.780
 where are you going to have guitar and guitar 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.880
 battery arrives here is fine paper 15 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:19.930
 thousandth worst option will have a muffle 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:23.170
 wedding ballad not only the bride 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:28.990
 will make me hope the band 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:31.060
 good because after dark and in the 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.610
 mean I think the band too coins 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.810
 also that among him maggi in the choice 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.580
 of songs 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.500
 It seems like I liked it if he thought 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.690
 combined and he agreed to all 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.460
 including his that ours does not 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.260
 like music as much as I used to 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.110
 this video is not health 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.270
 but one thing is the trick of putting 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.710
 songs that have to do with you with the 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.240
 your relationship with history 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.890
 Because you 're going to talk a lot about 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.670
 respect and will stay in the memory for 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.440
 ever 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.810
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:17.350
 Let's see how many days are left for my 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:19.870
 married for 83 days 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:24.620
 My god, I'm going to be crazy, alias series. 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:28.220
 I'm already well what's new 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.610
 but I've been a bit stressed out and 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.050
 anxious of course to hit some 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.970
 details of the wedding but it is already 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.770
 practically all ready 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.780
 a secret our apartment bought 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.490
 is very excited, he said that the 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.280
 People are going to start organizing things. 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.750
 I think I 'll have this practice 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.580
 This week I had to jump in Brazil. 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.110
 because he did not give time of previous edital 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.910
 before recording this as I did not want 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.430
 stop the rhythm of the recordings not lost 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.380
 in clay I decided to jump all of one 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.490
 instead as I managed to be dictated if 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.340
 We want to make a very great time. 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.600
 no son no longer 17 and he soon the 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.150
 Arrival I hope you have enjoyed 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.910
 A kiss for everyone 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.210
 click and liked it here and it is written 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.060
 channel 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.550
 on what he shares with 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.000
 personal and home to the next 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.000
 kisses 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.400
 I built my note 

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:41.209
 already act 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.050
 where 

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.490
 was also champion
