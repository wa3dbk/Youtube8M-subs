there<00:00:04.020> was<00:00:04.140> another<00:00:04.500> massive<00:00:05.339> solar<00:00:05.670> flare

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
there was another massive solar flare

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.530 
there was another massive solar flare

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
flares one after another there was two

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.619 
flares one after another there was two

m5 class solar flare now it could

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
m5 class solar flare now it could
produce<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.110> low<00:00:49.289> frequency<00:00:49.469> radio<00:00:49.950> blackout

lift up your heads look up for your
redemption<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.320> drawing<00:01:58.969> nigh<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.000> we're

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
redemption is drawing nigh and we're

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.130 
redemption is drawing nigh and we're
truly<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.619> those<00:02:02.579> days<00:02:02.820> now<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.630> could<00:02:03.869> this

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
truly in those days now there could this

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.940 
truly in those days now there could this
could<00:02:04.409> affect<00:02:04.549> radio<00:02:05.549> burst<00:02:06.799> power<00:02:07.799> grids

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
could affect radio burst power grids

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.010 
could affect radio burst power grids
could<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.759> affected<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.629> hits<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.989> just

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
could be affected if it hits it just

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.670 
could be affected if it hits it just
right<00:02:11.270> so<00:02:12.270> again<00:02:12.780> we'll<00:02:12.930> keep<00:02:13.140> an<00:02:13.260> eye<00:02:13.379> on

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
right so again we'll keep an eye on

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.250 
right so again we'll keep an eye on
things<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.459> course<00:02:14.790> my<00:02:15.629> biggest<00:02:16.049> thing<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
things and of course my biggest thing to

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.670 
things and of course my biggest thing to
watch<00:02:16.530> out<00:02:16.709> for<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:17.189> volcanic<00:02:17.730> activity<00:02:18.680> that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
watch out for is volcanic activity that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.699 
watch out for is volcanic activity that
can<00:02:19.799> be<00:02:19.920> triggered<00:02:20.189> by<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:21.290> pressure<00:02:22.290> that

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
can be triggered by the pressure that

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.130 
can be triggered by the pressure that
comes<00:02:23.400> from<00:02:23.640> these<00:02:23.849> CMEs<00:02:24.359> on<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.989> earth

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
comes from these CMEs on the earth

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.429 
comes from these CMEs on the earth
especially<00:02:25.829> when<00:02:25.950> they're<00:02:26.069> earth<00:02:26.219> facing<00:02:26.879> or

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
especially when they're earth facing or

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.479 
especially when they're earth facing or
and<00:02:28.439> or<00:02:28.859> earthquakes<00:02:30.530> it's<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.799> the

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
and or earthquakes it's just the
