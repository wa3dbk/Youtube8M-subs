00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
that you really don't have any kind of a

that you really don't have any kind of a
scramble<00:01:12.300> at<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.360> end<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:15.460> I'm<00:01:16.000> really

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
think that to get to this development

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.250 
think that to get to this development
turnaround<00:01:23.340> from<00:01:24.340> last<00:01:24.670> year<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:26.140> were

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
turnaround from last year we were

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.440 
turnaround from last year we were
thinking<00:01:26.710> at<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.400> point<00:01:27.790> last<00:01:27.970> year<00:01:28.420> I

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
thinking at this point last year I

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.680 
thinking at this point last year I
wonder<00:01:28.900> if<00:01:29.140> we<00:01:29.350> have<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.560> chance<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.040> go<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:31.330> MIT

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
wonder if we have a chance to go to MIT

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.780 
wonder if we have a chance to go to MIT
and<00:01:32.440> I<00:01:33.220> think<00:01:33.760> that<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.450> Michigan<00:01:35.020> can<00:01:35.290> be<00:01:35.790> as

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
and I think that that Michigan can be as

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.420 
and I think that that Michigan can be as
good<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.210> team<00:01:37.540> as<00:01:37.870> they<00:01:38.080> look<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.650> thank<00:01:38.890> you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
good a team as they look to thank you

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.850 
good a team as they look to thank you
know<00:01:39.550> they<00:01:39.730> take<00:01:40.030> played<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.990> lot<00:01:41.440> of<00:01:41.620> really

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
know they take played a lot of really

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.100 
know they take played a lot of really
good<00:01:42.160> basketball<00:01:42.370> defensively<00:01:42.970> today<00:01:43.810> they

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
good basketball defensively today they

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.340 
good basketball defensively today they
boarded<00:01:44.560> extremely<00:01:45.220> well<00:01:45.690> but<00:01:46.690> we're<00:01:46.900> not<00:01:47.110> I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
boarded extremely well but we're not I

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.780 
boarded extremely well but we're not I
don't<00:01:47.470> think<00:01:47.620> that<00:01:47.980> we're<00:01:48.190> as<00:01:48.310> bad<00:01:48.550> at

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
don't think that we're as bad at

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.100 
don't think that we're as bad at
basketball<00:01:48.940> team

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
basketball team

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.010 
basketball team
as<00:01:50.650> they<00:01:51.160> made<00:01:51.430> us<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.790> be<00:01:51.820> and<00:01:52.300> I<00:01:52.360> think<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.990> I

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
as they made us to be and I think that I

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.410 
as they made us to be and I think that I
use<00:01:53.770> that<00:01:54.160> term<00:01:54.460> because<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:55.060> think<00:01:55.270> they

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
use that term because I think they

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.530 
use that term because I think they
really<00:01:56.190> played<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.400> game<00:01:57.610> away<00:01:57.910> from<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.450> don't

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
really played the game away from I don't

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.900 
really played the game away from I don't
think<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:58.990> was<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.170> case<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.530> our<00:02:00.490> playing

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
think it was a case of our playing

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.140 
think it was a case of our playing
poorly<00:02:01.390> or<00:02:01.780> are<00:02:02.050> not<00:02:02.260> doing<00:02:02.740> thanks<00:02:03.790> what<00:02:03.970> we

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
poorly or are not doing thanks what we

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.600 
poorly or are not doing thanks what we
couldn't<00:02:04.450> do<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:05.170> think<00:02:05.830> they<00:02:05.980> really<00:02:06.010> made<00:02:06.580> a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
couldn't do I think they really made a

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.449 
couldn't do I think they really made a
tough<00:02:06.940> course<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.870> think<00:02:08.110> they<00:02:08.320> pretty<00:02:09.220> much

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
tough course I think they pretty much

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.199 
tough course I think they pretty much
dominated<00:02:10.330> us<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:12.430> from<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.670> beginning<00:02:12.790> so

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
dominated us right from the beginning so

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.110 
dominated us right from the beginning so

weeks and practice and play very well
first<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:35.940> think<00:03:36.390> beyond<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:38.760> we<00:03:38.970> did

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
first and think beyond that that we did

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:53.809 
first and think beyond that that we did
very<00:03:39.360> much<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.810> get<00:03:39.959> their<00:03:40.620> side

no<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.329> just<00:03:54.599> think<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.319> what<00:03:56.310> they're

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
no I just think that what they're

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.729 
no I just think that what they're
producing<00:03:56.730> my<00:03:57.030> utility<00:03:57.689> plan<00:03:57.959> their<00:03:58.260> mental

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
producing my utility plan their mental

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.009 
producing my utility plan their mental
to<00:03:58.980> have<00:03:59.250> every<00:03:59.579> document<00:04:02.599> play<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.629> pair<00:04:03.989> of

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
to have every document play a pair of

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:11.400 
to have every document play a pair of
their<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:05.099> what<00:04:05.280> decisions<00:04:05.760> like<00:04:06.329> a<00:04:06.480> player's

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.970 

well<00:04:12.160> I<00:04:12.190> think<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.760> depends<00:04:13.209> on<00:04:13.680> our<00:04:14.680> being

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
well I think it depends on our being

00:04:14.980 --> 00:05:37.740
