called upper structures okay so this is
my<00:00:36.540> these<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.170> my<00:00:37.290> chord<00:00:37.710> tones<00:00:38.010> down<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.820> if

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
my these are my chord tones down here if

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.049 
my these are my chord tones down here if
I<00:00:39.329> continue<00:00:39.870> stacking<00:00:40.200> thirds<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> get

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
I continue stacking thirds you see I get

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.880 
I continue stacking thirds you see I get
these<00:00:42.180> upper<00:00:42.570> structures<00:00:42.989> until<00:00:43.320> finally

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
these upper structures until finally

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.040 
these upper structures until finally
well<00:00:44.250> guess<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.120> back<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.930> my

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
route so this is 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.410 
route so this is 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 and
then<00:00:55.440> back<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.800> my<00:00:55.949> route<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.789> right<00:00:56.969> now<00:00:57.360> if

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
then back to my route all right now if

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.490 
then back to my route all right now if
you<00:00:57.539> already<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:57.989> tensions<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
you already know about tensions you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.599 
you already know about tensions you
might<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.800> saying<00:00:58.949> well<00:00:59.039> wait<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.309> second

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
might be saying well wait a second

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
might be saying well wait a second
that's<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.879> exactly<00:01:00.149> 13<00:01:00.840> right<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.620> that's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
that's not exactly 13 right it's that's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.789 
that's not exactly 13 right it's that's
13<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.730> would<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:02.969> flat<00:01:03.270> 13<00:01:03.750> let's<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.619> worry

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
13 this would be flat 13 let's not worry

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.109 
13 this would be flat 13 let's not worry
about<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.309> right<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:05.700> okay<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
about that for right now okay so you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.700 
about that for right now okay so you
might<00:01:09.299> also<00:01:09.450> think<00:01:09.810> well<00:01:10.080> wait<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.290> second

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
might also think well wait a second

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.530 
might also think well wait a second
that's<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> same<00:01:11.189> thing<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.430> too<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.420> the
