down<00:00:07.319> I'm<00:00:07.980> not<00:00:08.220> kidding<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:09.440> yes<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.469> is

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.290 
down I'm not kidding and yes that is
disappointing<00:00:11.160> because<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.880> would<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.090> liked

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
to have the kill switches and there

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.919 
to have the kill switches and there
certainly<00:00:14.190> was<00:00:14.610> enough<00:00:14.849> room<00:00:15.269> here<00:00:15.299> because

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
certainly was enough room here because

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.390 
certainly was enough room here because

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
buttons have enough some of the rotary

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.800 
buttons have enough some of the rotary
knobs<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.859> enough<00:00:20.100> room<00:00:20.730> there<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
knobs have enough room there for the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.410 
knobs have enough room there for the
buttons<00:00:22.080> underneath<00:00:22.350> but<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> EQ<00:00:24.269> but

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
buttons underneath but for the EQ but

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.410 
buttons underneath but for the EQ but
our<00:00:24.660> knobs<00:00:25.400> no<00:00:26.400> buttons<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.150> could<00:00:27.330> have

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
our knobs no buttons and they could have

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.540 
our knobs no buttons and they could have
fit<00:00:27.570> them<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.500> they<00:00:28.619> chose<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.470 
controller feel the the plotters feel
amazing<00:00:43.860> they're<00:00:44.489> magnetically<00:00:45.180> driven

that's<00:01:42.090> good<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.750> want<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that's good because you want to have a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.350 
that's good because you want to have a
nice<00:01:43.259> loose<00:01:43.500> cross<00:01:43.740> fader<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
nice loose cross fader and then of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.530 
nice loose cross fader and then of
course<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.590> pitch<00:01:47.340> faders<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.820> felt<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> pitch

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
course the pitch faders I felt the pitch

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.770 
course the pitch faders I felt the pitch
faders<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.890> volume<00:01:50.820> faders<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
faders and the volume faders or the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.230 
faders and the volume faders or the
level<00:01:52.079> faders<00:01:52.439> were<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.549> same<00:01:53.579> stiffness

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
level faders were all the same stiffness

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.440 
level faders were all the same stiffness
in<00:01:54.780> terms<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.320> moving<00:01:55.649> them<00:01:55.890> back<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.159> forth

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
in terms of moving them back and forth

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.209 
in terms of moving them back and forth
the<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.020> crossfader<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:59.130> bit

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the the crossfader was a little bit

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.850 
the the crossfader was a little bit
looser<00:01:59.640> than<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> thing<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.590> they

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
looser than that but the thing that they

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.740 
looser than that but the thing that they
all<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.430> common<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:03.140> these<00:02:04.140> plastic

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
all have in common is these plastic

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.249 
all have in common is these plastic
knobs<00:02:07.580> these<00:02:08.580> plastic<00:02:09.090> knobs<00:02:09.270> right<00:02:09.509> here

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
knobs these plastic knobs right here

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.440 
knobs these plastic knobs right here
they<00:02:10.950> feel<00:02:11.280> cheap<00:02:11.910> they<00:02:12.390> feel<00:02:12.629> very

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
they feel cheap they feel very

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.550 
they feel cheap they feel very
light<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.989> plasticky<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:16.750> again<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.290> am

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
light and plasticky and but again I am

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.979 
light and plasticky and but again I am
and<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.069> can<00:02:18.220> tell<00:02:18.430> by<00:02:19.360> touching<00:02:19.599> them<00:02:19.810> that

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
and you can tell by touching them that

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.809 
and you can tell by touching them that
they're<00:02:20.110> hollow<00:02:20.379> they're<00:02:21.190> hollow<00:02:21.400> plastic

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
they're hollow they're hollow plastic

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.550 
they're hollow they're hollow plastic
they're<00:02:22.239> not<00:02:22.390> even<00:02:22.660> solid<00:02:23.050> plastic<00:02:23.410> it's

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
they're not even solid plastic it's

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.160 
they're not even solid plastic it's
hollow<00:02:23.769> plastic<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.720> considering<00:02:25.720> how<00:02:25.900> well

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
hollow plastic and considering how well

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.140 
hollow plastic and considering how well
everything<00:02:26.590> else<00:02:26.860> feels<00:02:27.129> I'm<00:02:27.430> very<00:02:27.700> surprised

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
everything else feels I'm very surprised

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.940 
everything else feels I'm very surprised
by<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.569> it<00:02:29.200> wouldn't<00:02:29.410> have<00:02:29.500> cost<00:02:29.680> them<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.920> lot

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
by that it wouldn't have cost them a lot

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.979 
by that it wouldn't have cost them a lot
more<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.700> put<00:02:30.910> maybe<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.239> rubberized<00:02:31.750> coating

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
more to put maybe a rubberized coating

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.320 
more to put maybe a rubberized coating
on<00:02:32.290> them<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.470> like<00:02:32.709> they<00:02:32.860> did<00:02:32.920> for<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.340> knobs

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
on them just like they did for the knobs

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.570 
on them just like they did for the knobs
which<00:02:34.540> are<00:02:34.690> all<00:02:34.870> amazing<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:36.130> knobs<00:02:36.370> are

which are all amazing the knobs are

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.550 
which are all amazing the knobs are

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
yeah they use some really cheap plastic

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.900 
yeah they use some really cheap plastic
for<00:02:44.140> these<00:02:44.260> for<00:02:44.890> these<00:02:44.950> fader<00:02:45.280> tips<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.819> i'm

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
for these for these fader tips and i'm

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.479 
for these for these fader tips and i'm
not<00:02:46.569> sure<00:02:46.630> why<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.709> rest<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.130> controller

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
not sure why the rest of the controller

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.440 
not sure why the rest of the controller
was<00:02:49.330> all<00:02:49.540> built<00:02:49.810> really<00:02:50.230> well<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:52.000> yeah<00:02:52.269> they

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
was all built really well but yeah they

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.050 
was all built really well but yeah they
chose<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.380> go<00:02:53.560> with<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:56.069> you<00:02:57.069> know<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.400> plot<00:02:57.940> on

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
chose to go with a you know with plot on

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.530 
chose to go with a you know with plot on
these<00:02:58.209> cheap<00:02:58.630> plastic<00:02:58.870> knobs<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.160> anyway<00:03:01.060> you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
these cheap plastic knobs so anyway you

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.970 
these cheap plastic knobs so anyway you
can't<00:03:01.750> have<00:03:01.870> everything<00:03:01.989> i<00:03:02.290> guess<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.680> at<00:03:02.799> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
can't have everything i guess and at the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.410 
can't have everything i guess and at the
end<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.190> day<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.489> was<00:03:03.519> only<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.940> thousand

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
end of the day it was only a thousand

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.150 
end of the day it was only a thousand
dollars<00:03:04.720> for<00:03:05.019> controller<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.650> software<00:03:06.099> i

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
dollars for controller and software i

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.800 
dollars for controller and software i
mean<00:03:06.400> if<00:03:06.819> you<00:03:06.940> consider<00:03:07.299> that<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.599> software

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
mean if you consider that the software

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.050 
mean if you consider that the software
alone<00:03:08.260> was<00:03:08.530> 200<00:03:09.400> bucks<00:03:09.610> or<00:03:09.819> something<00:03:09.880> like

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
alone was 200 bucks or something like

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.900 
alone was 200 bucks or something like
that<00:03:10.799> that's<00:03:11.799> actually<00:03:12.099> only<00:03:12.250> 800<00:03:12.640> bucks<00:03:12.790> for

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
that that's actually only 800 bucks for

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.140 
that that's actually only 800 bucks for
the<00:03:13.000> controller<00:03:13.360> itself<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.459> not<00:03:15.459> bad<00:03:15.700> not<00:03:16.120> bad

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
the controller itself so not bad not bad

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.970 
the controller itself so not bad not bad
at<00:03:16.360> all<00:03:16.569> when<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.470> compare<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:17.950> other

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
at all when you compare it to other

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.650 
at all when you compare it to other
controllers<00:03:18.700> i<00:03:18.790> know<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.000> allen<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.480> heath

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
controllers i know the allen and heath

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.150 
controllers i know the allen and heath
xone<00:03:20.620> x<00:03:21.340> sorry<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.389> allen<00:03:22.569> and<00:03:22.690> heath<00:03:22.889> xone<00:03:23.889> is

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160

is going for 1299 so big big difference
in<00:03:30.130> price<00:03:30.310> there<00:03:30.609> and<00:03:30.790> i<00:03:31.329> haven't<00:03:31.540> had<00:03:31.600> a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
in price there and i haven't had a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.500 
in price there and i haven't had a
chance<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.930> play<00:03:32.079> with<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.290> controller<00:03:32.650> yet

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
chance to play with that controller yet

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.129 
chance to play with that controller yet
but<00:03:35.190> yeah<00:03:36.269> those<00:03:37.269> are<00:03:37.450> my<00:03:37.540> initial<00:03:37.870> thoughts

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
but yeah those are my initial thoughts

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.590 
but yeah those are my initial thoughts
so<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.370> i'm<00:03:39.519> up<00:03:39.639> to<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.850> 33<00:03:40.389> mark

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
so that is it i'm up to the 33 mark

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.900
