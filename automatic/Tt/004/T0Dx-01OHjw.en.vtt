00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.620
 the count youtube people good 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.469
 welcome to this new video this 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.259
 tutorial is going to be very fast and then the 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.660
 reason is because I came across a problem 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:20.500
 I wanted to enter my minecraft 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.580
 and I was giving this error obviously because we 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.600
 we saw it with our account 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.279
 and then I wanted to enter a server 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.540
 multiplayer and I gave this error 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.790
 probably many people have the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.530
 same mistake and good then in this 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.739
 in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.170
 will teach how to solve it is about this 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.570
 error here you can see it 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.199
 it says error when starting java session 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.140
 dot net point 1 that mother I do not know anymore 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.019
 pronounce and says point session minecraft 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.140
 dot net ok 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:05.110
 do not even try to get into the folder 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.869
 of minecraft and so on does not work 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.960
 what we are going to do is what makes us 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.360
 missing an address from 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.550
 minecraft itself that is being this 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.070
 address is the video information 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.590
 I will leave the address so that 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.710
 just the cope or the paste and I'm going to give it 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.250
 copy and what we are going to do is that we 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.750
 let's go to home team let's go to 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.690
 local disk I know 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 let's go to windows next let's go 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.590
 to attend 32 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:45.799
 and then let's go to drivers here is 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.420
 and then we go to the folder etc ok 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.520
 and here if you can see we have host ok 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.110
 if you have the program that is 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.180
 notepad more more 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.930
 I recommend that you download it in the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.090
 tutorial on how to create a web page in 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.530
 wordpress I give you the program so that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.030
 download it in this program is 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.000
 free like in the information of 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.899
 this video I'm going to leave the name is 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.290
 not bad 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.760
 more more or you can open it by giving it in 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.150
 open and then in notebook or that 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.920
 let's go to something else if not the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.459
 they let the file save what they have 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.770
 what to do is go to copy and here in the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.900
 they are going to paste it here 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.760
 to edit and everything and then since it's 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.940
 edited will be dragged to the folder 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.850
 etc is going to tell you to move and replace it 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.610
 are going to give then that if true and I will 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.440
 cancel because if he leaves me if he gives you 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.270
 problems is because you do not have all the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.390
 let's say that the permits 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.160
 administrator but in itself it does not owe you 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.890
 cause problems editing it in the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.450
 good desk itself let's fix 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.870
 this problem what we are going to do is 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.860
 open the folder and well what are we going to 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.830
 to do is to paste 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.820
 to the address that will subtract the 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.820
 video information 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.070
 what we are doing is blocking it 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:18.020
 unax is good to block read this ip the 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:20.710
 internet access ok and good we are going to 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.710
 give in save 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.260
 and then we can close it now 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.510
 Once it is saved, we can already 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.160
 close all the folders we will go to 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.550
 Minecraft 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.010
 and we will realize that we 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.540
 obviously we are already going to give 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.570
 realize that the problem is already 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.570
 solved 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.600
 we wait for minecraft to open 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.940
 ok it took over but good already opened 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.530
 let's go to multiplayer let's go 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.840
 at the same server or any 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.420
 server itself and as you can see here already 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.770

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.670
