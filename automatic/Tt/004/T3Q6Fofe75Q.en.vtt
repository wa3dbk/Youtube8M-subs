00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
so it's kind of Airy does that make any

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.260 
so it's kind of Airy does that make any
sense<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:24.200> melts<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> chalk<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.970> cookie

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
sense and it melts the chalk the cookie

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.460 
sense and it melts the chalk the cookie
as<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.510> comes<00:02:26.690> through<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.230> get<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.380> little

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
as it comes through so you get a little

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.230 
as it comes through so you get a little
bits<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.860> cookie<00:02:28.220> then<00:02:28.790> you're<00:02:28.940> supposed<00:02:29.210> to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
bits of cookie then you're supposed to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.610 
bits of cookie then you're supposed to
just<00:02:29.480> eat<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.630> whole<00:02:29.840> cookie<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.170> guess<00:02:30.410> but

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
just eat the whole cookie I guess but

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.490 
just eat the whole cookie I guess but
that's<00:02:31.130> not<00:02:31.340> ladylike<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:33.080> I'm<00:02:33.140> going<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.350> go

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
that's not ladylike so I'm going to go

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:43.320 
that's not ladylike so I'm going to go
bite<00:02:34.720> mmm<00:02:40.360> that's<00:02:41.360> terrific

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
bite mmm that's terrific

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.640 
bite mmm that's terrific
so<00:02:44.330> what<00:02:44.480> happens<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.080> milk<00:02:45.290> kind<00:02:45.560> of

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
so what happens is the milk kind of

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.950 
so what happens is the milk kind of
melts<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.190> inside<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.940> cookie<00:02:47.240> so<00:02:47.900> it

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
melts the inside of the cookie so it

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.050 
melts the inside of the cookie so it
becomes<00:02:48.260> almost<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.740> pudding<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.550> then

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
becomes almost like a pudding and then

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.610 
becomes almost like a pudding and then
it's<00:02:50.240> coated<00:02:50.510> with<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.260> chocolate

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
it's coated with this the chocolate

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.310 
it's coated with this the chocolate
layer<00:02:51.710> stays<00:02:52.040> intact<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.660> when<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.900> bite<00:02:54.110> into

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
layer stays intact so when you bite into

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.630 
layer stays intact so when you bite into
it<00:02:54.500> you've<00:02:54.740> got<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:54.950> chocolate<00:02:55.430> on<00:02:55.550> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
it you've got the chocolate on the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.610 
it you've got the chocolate on the
outside<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.570> this<00:02:56.780> kind<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.050> put<00:02:57.320> in<00:02:57.440> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
outside and this kind of put in the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.970
