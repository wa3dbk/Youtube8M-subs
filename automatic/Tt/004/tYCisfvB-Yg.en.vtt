00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
essentially connect is just going to be

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040 
essentially connect is just going to be
another<00:02:25.160> way<00:02:25.459> for<00:02:25.640> artists<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.510> connect

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
another way for artists to connect

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.610 
another way for artists to connect
socially<00:02:27.680> with<00:02:28.400> their<00:02:28.820> fans<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.140> lot<00:02:30.590> of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
socially with their fans so a lot of

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.990 
socially with their fans so a lot of
people<00:02:30.800> don't<00:02:31.100> know<00:02:31.250> how<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.459> feel<00:02:31.700> about<00:02:31.760> it

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
people don't know how to feel about it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.850 
people don't know how to feel about it
yet<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.540> will<00:02:32.750> be<00:02:32.870> launching<00:02:33.350> on<00:02:33.560> june

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
thirtieth so we'll have to see how that

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.199 
thirtieth so we'll have to see how that
goes<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:37.040> will<00:02:37.250> probably<00:02:37.459> do<00:02:37.760> any<00:02:37.970> more

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
goes I will probably do any more

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.270 
goes I will probably do any more
in-depth<00:02:38.690> video<00:02:38.989> about<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.290> then<00:02:39.530> but<00:02:39.980> if<00:02:40.250> the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
in-depth video about it then but if the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.070 
in-depth video about it then but if the
feel<00:02:40.550> for<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.820> Connect<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.540> going<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.959> be

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
feel for it Connect is going to be

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.979 
feel for it Connect is going to be
launching<00:02:42.260> videos<00:02:43.220> streaming<00:02:43.940> music<00:02:44.239> photos

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
launching videos streaming music photos

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.100 
launching videos streaming music photos

going<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.830> go<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.489> it's<00:02:52.520> definitely<00:02:52.940> what

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
going to go but it's definitely what

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.300

I've<00:03:12.080> always<00:03:12.380> had<00:03:12.799> this<00:03:13.040> favorite<00:03:13.400> time<00:03:13.580> of

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
I've always had this favorite time of

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.640 
I've always had this favorite time of
day<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.480> didn't<00:03:14.690> even<00:03:14.750> know<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.170> had<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.590> name

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
day and I didn't even know it had a name

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.910 
day and I didn't even know it had a name
and<00:03:16.420> apparently<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:17.630> called<00:03:17.959> old<00:03:18.440> an<00:03:18.650> hour

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
and apparently it's called old an hour

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.240 
and apparently it's called old an hour
so<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:20.180> just<00:03:21.019> recently<00:03:21.230> found<00:03:21.470> out<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:21.890> that's

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
so I just recently found out that that's

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.340 
so I just recently found out that that's
the<00:03:22.459> best<00:03:22.760> time<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.330> film<00:03:23.600> or<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.170> take

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
the best time to film or to take

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.880 
the best time to film or to take
photographs<00:03:24.880> just<00:03:25.880> because<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.540> Sun<00:03:26.750> is

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
photographs just because the Sun is

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.470 
photographs just because the Sun is
softer<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.340> can<00:03:28.519> directly<00:03:28.880> look<00:03:29.150> at<00:03:29.329> it

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
softer and you can directly look at it

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.890 
softer and you can directly look at it
