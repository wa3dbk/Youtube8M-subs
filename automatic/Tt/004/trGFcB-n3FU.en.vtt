00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello I will introduce you 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.920
 today a new editing will be 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.590
 the little this young black so I 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.289
 positioned on my eto'o we like his 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 number 14 years of tmc 100 on which well 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.570
 obviously I crushed them say who 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.530
 reposition myself are so I 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.100
 starts with a black silk 6 0 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.399
 mounting windings at the level of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.399
 rent 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:55.329
 I bring the mounting silk we sigh 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:02.110
 attached to the curvature I cut 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:04.089
 the surplus so I recovered in 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.670
 strolling by the water we more 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.930
 black I think it's raven 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.729
 I'm going to take a part of it 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.259
 saw the not in very good condition but it serves 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:20.110
 even if we can redo a fly 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:22.380
 with so I position it points towards 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.380
 front 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.550
 and you see that I secure it on 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:43.270
 the whole length of the shame of 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:51.150
 the hook I take the fibers I'm going 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.150
 put them in a bag and I will train 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:03.560
 the body of my little one at home with his 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.560
 fibers 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.140
 I secure by three assembly rounds 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.239
 and over cutting it just has it 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.800
 selected a feather of pardo on 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:30.239
 which I am going to very high fiber 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:33.500
 so I flap this fiber backwards 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.500
 it's a lot easier to catch 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.530
 so here are the girls we feel 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:53.160
 almost aligned I only have to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:57.470
 position on the pole two laps not 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.470
 tight three rounds is a tight game 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:10.700
 you can not notice that the fibers 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.700
 have already positioned themselves 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.950
 so I'm going to lock in by a few 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.950
 additional towers 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.880
 I will cut the excellent weapons 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:50.530
 I take the brown starwing khl see 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.740
 the quality of the fibers I remove small 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.740
 parts 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.320
 I prepare the fixation 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.810
 I'm going to take the nail nipper 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.130
 I will start 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.910
 the windings 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.159
 years more dotted 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.260
 three laps will suffice 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:45.150
 I keep my saddle up I have 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.880
 more than stop by a few laps of 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.390
 I cut myself 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.390
 excess 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.530
 I do not flap the fibers back and I 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.530
 do my head 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.010
 the white finish 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.970
 a second 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.420
 here 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.930
 but here is my little give up still beautiful and 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.930
 pardo
