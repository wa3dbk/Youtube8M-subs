lavender<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.319> rosemary<00:00:05.009> indoors<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.210> couple

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
lavender and rosemary indoors a couple

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.560 
lavender and rosemary indoors a couple
things<00:00:07.140> about<00:00:07.410> lavender<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.980> rosemary<00:00:08.099> are

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
things about lavender and rosemary are

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.290 
things about lavender and rosemary are
one<00:00:09.570> they<00:00:10.170> germinate<00:00:10.469> slowly<00:00:11.130> they<00:00:11.910> grow

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
one they germinate slowly they grow

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.150 
one they germinate slowly they grow
slowly<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.230> these<00:00:13.349> are<00:00:13.559> really<00:00:13.679> some<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
slowly so these are really some of the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.400 
slowly so these are really some of the
first<00:00:14.460> seed<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.420> can<00:00:15.570> start<00:00:15.900> indoors<00:00:16.260> they

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
first seed you can start indoors they

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.980 
first seed you can start indoors they
can<00:00:16.560> take<00:00:16.770> 14<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.369> 28<00:00:17.730> days<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.240> even<00:00:18.420> germinate

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
can take 14 to 28 days to even germinate

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.980 
can take 14 to 28 days to even germinate
and<00:00:19.170> they<00:00:19.680> don't<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.699> great<00:00:21.359> germination

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and they don't have a great germination

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.450 
and they don't have a great germination
rate<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.560> when<00:00:22.769> when<00:00:22.890> you're<00:00:23.010> gonna<00:00:23.130> plant

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
rate so when when you're gonna plant

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.529 
rate so when when you're gonna plant
these<00:00:23.580> we're<00:00:23.910> going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> put<00:00:24.210> more<00:00:24.330> than<00:00:24.480> one

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
these we're going to put more than one

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.470 
these we're going to put more than one
seed<00:00:24.960> per<00:00:25.199> cell<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:26.279> also<00:00:26.430> grow<00:00:26.789> slowly<00:00:27.180> so

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
seed per cell they also grow slowly so

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.500 
seed per cell they also grow slowly so
they<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.779> grow<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.619> 10<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.130> 12<00:00:29.400> weeks

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
they can grow in here for 10 to 12 weeks

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.700 
they can grow in here for 10 to 12 weeks
before<00:00:30.510> they<00:00:30.599> even<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> size<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.380> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
before they even get to a size that you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.049 
before they even get to a size that you
would<00:00:31.800> put<00:00:31.980> them<00:00:32.099> outside<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.730> sort

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
would put them outside so you can sort

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.030 
would put them outside so you can sort
of<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> math<00:00:33.450> today's<00:00:33.960> December<00:00:34.469> 24th

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
of do the math today's December 24th

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.400 
of do the math today's December 24th
this<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.390> 3<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:36.719> 4<00:00:37.050> months

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
this is going to be about 3 or 4 months

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410 
this is going to be about 3 or 4 months
worth<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.860> growing<00:00:38.219> time<00:00:38.460> they'll<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.390> out

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
worth of growing time they'll get out

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.030 
worth of growing time they'll get out
into<00:00:39.780> my<00:00:39.870> garden<00:00:40.110> when<00:00:40.350> frost<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.829> still

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
into my garden when frost is still

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.369 
into my garden when frost is still
around<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.850> take<00:00:42.059> light<00:00:42.480> frost<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
around but they can take light frost and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.630 
around but they can take light frost and
do<00:00:43.530> perfectly<00:00:44.010> fine<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> I'll<00:00:44.460> probably

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
do perfectly fine and I'll probably

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.610 
do perfectly fine and I'll probably
actually<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.570> put<00:00:45.750> them<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.020> two<00:00:46.140> cups<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
actually just put them in two cups and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.279 
actually just put them in two cups and
then<00:00:47.100> pull<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.809> yard<00:00:49.079> or

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
then pull them in and out of the yard or

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.619 
then pull them in and out of the yard or
put<00:00:49.440> them<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.649> my<00:00:49.770> greenhouse<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:51.449> can

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
put them in my greenhouse so you can

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.709 
put them in my greenhouse so you can
start<00:00:51.930> lavender<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.500> rosemary<00:00:53.360> three<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
start lavender and rosemary three to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
start lavender and rosemary three to
four<00:00:54.930> months<00:00:55.260> before<00:00:55.710> they<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:55.980> even<00:00:56.100> go

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
four months before they would even go

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.830 
four months before they would even go
outside<00:00:56.730> into<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.180> garden<00:00:57.360> they're<00:00:57.629> not

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
outside into your garden they're not

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.799 
outside into your garden they're not
going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.230> big<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> control

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
going to get big or out of control

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.660 
going to get big or out of control
lavender<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.170> press<00:01:01.500> into<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.100> soil<00:01:02.370> I've

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
lavender you press into the soil I've

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.369 
lavender you press into the soil I've
covered<00:01:03.120> them<00:01:03.300> lightly<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> past<00:01:04.080> this

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
covered them lightly in the past this

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.600 
covered them lightly in the past this
year<00:01:04.439> I'm<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.739> good<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.309> pressing

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
year I'm just good to go with pressing

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
year I'm just good to go with pressing
them<00:01:05.880> into<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.240> soil<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:07.170> rosemary

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
them into the soil and then rosemary

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.789 
them into the soil and then rosemary
gets<00:01:07.920> lightly<00:01:08.369> covered<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.590> then<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> other

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
gets lightly covered and then the other

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
gets lightly covered and then the other
thing<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.400> both<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.090> these<00:01:12.360> plants<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
thing about both of these plants and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.539 
thing about both of these plants and
that's<00:01:13.020> why<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> usually<00:01:13.409> grow<00:01:14.100> them<00:01:14.340> together

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that's why I usually grow them together

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.980 
that's why I usually grow them together
is<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.220> germinate<00:01:17.659> extremely<00:01:18.659> slowly

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
is that they germinate extremely slowly

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.109 
is that they germinate extremely slowly
most<00:01:19.500> other<00:01:19.799> seeds<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.400> recommend<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> put

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
most other seeds I recommend you put

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.550 
most other seeds I recommend you put
them<00:01:21.180> into<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.570> grow<00:01:21.780> closet<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.409> them

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
them into your grow closet get them

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.080 
them into your grow closet get them
under<00:01:22.740> your<00:01:22.770> grow<00:01:23.070> lights<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.610> instance<00:01:23.939> when

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
under your grow lights for instance when

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.570 
under your grow lights for instance when
tomatoes<00:01:24.509> pop<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.770> come<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.159> at<00:01:26.310> once

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
tomatoes pop they all come up at once

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.580 
tomatoes pop they all come up at once
they<00:01:26.939> need<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.420> met<00:01:27.659> by<00:01:27.869> intense<00:01:28.380> light

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
they need to be met by intense light

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.580 
they need to be met by intense light
right<00:01:28.799> away<00:01:29.659> lavender<00:01:30.659> rosemary<00:01:30.869> germinate

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
right away lavender rosemary germinate

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.679 
right away lavender rosemary germinate
so<00:01:31.770> slowly<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.610> keep<00:01:32.820> these<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.540> your

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so slowly you can keep these out of your

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.240 
so slowly you can keep these out of your
grow<00:01:33.900> closet<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> light<00:01:34.860> until<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
grow closet out of the light until you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.219 
grow closet out of the light until you
see<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.729> pop-up<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.479> once<00:01:36.630> once<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.079> see

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
see one pop-up and once once you see

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.050 
see one pop-up and once once you see
that<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.590> plant<00:01:37.799> pop-up<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.700> them<00:01:38.850> into

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that one plant pop-up then get them into

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.280 
that one plant pop-up then get them into
your<00:01:39.150> grow<00:01:39.329> closet<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> saves<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.229> a

your grow closet and it saves you a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.160 
your grow closet and it saves you a
little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.710> energy<00:01:41.630> by<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.659> having<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
little bit of energy by not having to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.539 
little bit of energy by not having to

starting to germinate I use popsicle

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.850 
starting to germinate I use popsicle
sticks<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.740> mark<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.460> cells<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.560> let's<00:01:52.560> start

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
sticks to mark my cells and let's start

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.609

with the lavender lavender seeds are

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.350 
with the lavender lavender seeds are
really<00:01:56.100> small<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.549> said<00:01:59.610> lavender

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360

temperature always stays in the low 70s
and<00:02:22.680> perhaps<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.730> had<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.880> heating<00:02:24.240> mat

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and perhaps if I had a heating mat

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.780 
and perhaps if I had a heating mat
lavender<00:02:25.380> rosemary<00:02:25.560> would<00:02:25.890> germinate<00:02:26.070> better

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.690 

but<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.820> don't<00:02:30.060> use<00:02:30.270> them<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:32.040> once<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.430> seeds

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
but I don't use them so once the seeds

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.350 
but I don't use them so once the seeds
are<00:02:32.880> down

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
are down

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.050

I<00:02:33.390> already<00:02:33.690> pre-packed<00:02:34.920> my<00:02:35.520> cells<00:02:35.820> with

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I already pre-packed my cells with

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.940 
I already pre-packed my cells with
growing<00:02:36.330> medium<00:02:36.690> I'm<00:02:36.810> using<00:02:36.990> coco<00:02:37.470> coir<00:02:37.770> and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
growing medium I'm using coco coir and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.860 
growing medium I'm using coco coir and
then<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.100> thumb<00:02:38.370> pack<00:02:38.610> them<00:02:38.820> down<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.690> that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
then I thumb pack them down so that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.110 
then I thumb pack them down so that
there's<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.170> good<00:02:40.320> amount<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.920> starting<00:02:41.790> mix<00:02:41.940> in

there's a good amount of starting mix in

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.540 
there's a good amount of starting mix in
there<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:43.530> I'm<00:02:43.680> just<00:02:43.710> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:45.470> press

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
there and then I'm just going to press

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.300 
there and then I'm just going to press
the<00:02:47.550> coco<00:02:47.940> coir<00:02:48.150> down<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.860> little<00:02:49.860> bit<00:02:50.040> more

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
the coco coir down a little bit more

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.160 
the coco coir down a little bit more
making<00:02:51.030> sure<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:52.080> seeds<00:02:52.410> get<00:02:52.710> pressed<00:02:53.070> into

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
making sure the seeds get pressed into

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.710 
making sure the seeds get pressed into
the<00:02:55.170> growing<00:02:55.410> medium<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:57.150> reason<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.540> want

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
the growing medium the reason you want

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.750 
the growing medium the reason you want
to<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.350> want<00:02:58.470> good<00:02:58.740> seed<00:02:59.100> contact

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
to do that is you want good seed contact

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.060 
to do that is you want good seed contact
with<00:03:00.690> your<00:03:00.840> growing<00:03:01.200> mediums<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
with your growing mediums so that the

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.280 
with your growing mediums so that the
water<00:03:02.280> gets<00:03:02.520> absorbed<00:03:02.760> by<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.300> seed<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.080> seed

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
water gets absorbed by the seed the seed

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.130 
water gets absorbed by the seed the seed
swells<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.120> germination<00:03:06.120> will<00:03:06.420> start<00:03:06.690> so

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
swells and the germination will start so

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.990 
swells and the germination will start so
that's<00:03:07.320> all<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.980> setup<00:03:08.190> lavender<00:03:08.820> and

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
that's all you do to setup lavender and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.890 
that's all you do to setup lavender and
then<00:03:09.210> I<00:03:09.330> give<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:11.270> popsicle<00:03:12.270> stick<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.750> that

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
then I give it a popsicle stick and that

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.740 
then I give it a popsicle stick and that
will<00:03:13.050> mark<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.470> now<00:03:15.590> rosemary<00:03:17.150> they<00:03:18.150> also<00:03:18.390> have

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
will mark it now rosemary they also have

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.820 
will mark it now rosemary they also have
small<00:03:19.080> seeds<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:23.700> want<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.680> put<00:03:25.680> them

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
small seeds and you want to put them

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.350 
small seeds and you want to put them
down<00:03:26.010> about<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> quarter<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.850> an<00:03:26.970> inch<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.300> I

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
down about a quarter of an inch and I

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.330 
down about a quarter of an inch and I
find<00:03:27.690> usually<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.560> instructions<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.250> the

packet they're hard to find so hard to

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.060 
packet they're hard to find so hard to
get<00:03:31.709> your<00:03:32.250> seeds<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.730> exact<00:03:33.180> depth

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
get your seeds to the exact depth

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.380 
get your seeds to the exact depth
doesn't<00:03:35.070> really<00:03:35.250> matter<00:03:35.520> they<00:03:35.910> say<00:03:36.120> put<00:03:36.300> them

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
doesn't really matter they say put them

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.670 
doesn't really matter they say put them
down<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.600> quarter<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.020> an<00:03:37.080> inch<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.530> want

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
down a quarter of an inch you just want

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.610 
down a quarter of an inch you just want
to<00:03:37.709> get<00:03:37.830> soil<00:03:38.190> over<00:03:38.400> them<00:03:38.640> but<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.540> put<00:03:39.840> two<00:03:40.590> or

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
to get soil over them but I put two or

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.910 
to get soil over them but I put two or
three<00:03:40.770> seeds<00:03:41.340> into<00:03:41.670> each<00:03:41.850> corner

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.490 

well<00:03:49.550> I<00:03:49.730> put<00:03:50.030> one<00:03:50.270> seed<00:03:50.510> into<00:03:50.720> each<00:03:50.930> corner<00:03:51.230> two

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
well I put one seed into each corner two

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.760 
well I put one seed into each corner two
or<00:03:51.650> three<00:03:51.860> seeds<00:03:52.100> into<00:03:52.310> each<00:03:52.550> cell<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.770> each

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
or three seeds into each cell so each

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:02.050 
or three seeds into each cell so each
corner<00:03:55.250> gets<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:56.410> seed<00:03:59.260> and<00:04:00.580> then<00:04:01.580> once<00:04:01.760> they're

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
corner gets a seed and then once they're

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.420 
corner gets a seed and then once they're
in<00:04:02.330> there<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.350> know<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.620> they're<00:04:03.950> also<00:04:04.069> in<00:04:04.340> a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
in there I know that they're also in a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.090 
in there I know that they're also in a
corner<00:04:04.760> sometimes<00:04:05.209> it's<00:04:05.390> hard<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.630> see<00:04:06.100> the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
corner sometimes it's hard to see the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.530 
corner sometimes it's hard to see the
smaller<00:04:07.430> seeds<00:04:07.760> especially<00:04:07.970> when<00:04:08.360> you<00:04:08.450> get

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
smaller seeds especially when you get

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.370 
smaller seeds especially when you get
older<00:04:08.600> like<00:04:09.110> me<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:10.660> need<00:04:11.660> glasses<00:04:11.990> but

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
older like me and you need glasses but

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.010 
older like me and you need glasses but
refuse<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.770> get<00:04:13.040> them<00:04:13.270> so<00:04:14.270> I<00:04:14.300> just<00:04:14.540> press<00:04:14.780> in

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
refuse to get them so I just press in

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:26.920 
refuse to get them so I just press in
the<00:04:15.140> corners<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.830> seeds<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.690> that's

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
the corners and the seeds so that's

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.659 
the corners and the seeds so that's
about<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.290> quarter<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.740> an<00:04:27.830> inch<00:04:27.950> then<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.370> little

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
about a quarter of an inch then a little

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.380 
about a quarter of an inch then a little
bit<00:04:28.820> more<00:04:28.880> growing<00:04:29.330> medium<00:04:29.720> right<00:04:30.470> on<00:04:30.650> top

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
bit more growing medium right on top

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.300 
bit more growing medium right on top
cover<00:04:32.390> up<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.690> holes<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.890> then<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.100> same

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
cover up the holes and then the same

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.830 
cover up the holes and then the same
thing<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:34.970> did<00:04:35.120> with<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.270> lavender<00:04:35.450> you

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
thing that you did with the lavender you

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.740 
thing that you did with the lavender you
want<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.200> lightly<00:04:37.070> press<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.400> in<00:04:37.730> so<00:04:38.390> that<00:04:38.419> the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
want to lightly press it in so that the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.590 
want to lightly press it in so that the
seed<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:40.100> growing<00:04:40.430> medium<00:04:40.790> cocoa<00:04:41.150> core<00:04:41.510> in

seed the growing medium cocoa core in

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.600 
seed the growing medium cocoa core in
this<00:04:41.690> case<00:04:41.990> make<00:04:42.740> good<00:04:42.950> contact<00:04:43.430> with<00:04:43.490> the

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
this case make good contact with the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.560 
this case make good contact with the
seeds<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:45.290> your<00:04:45.770> lavender<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.430> rosemary<00:04:46.669> are

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
seeds and your lavender and rosemary are

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.370 
seeds and your lavender and rosemary are
set<00:04:47.960> up<00:04:49.090> now<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.210> coco<00:04:50.510> coir<00:04:50.870> my<00:04:51.140> growing

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
set up now the coco coir my growing

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.520 
set up now the coco coir my growing
medium<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:52.300> pre-moistened<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:53.930> this<00:04:54.200> dark

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
medium is pre-moistened so this dark

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.730 
medium is pre-moistened so this dark
color<00:04:54.740> is<00:04:55.040> what<00:04:55.220> it<00:04:55.310> looks<00:04:55.490> like<00:04:55.630> when<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:57.590> has

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
color is what it looks like when it has

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.469 
color is what it looks like when it has
moisture<00:04:57.979> in<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.580> lot<00:04:58.880> of<00:04:59.000> people<00:04:59.210> say<00:04:59.360> well

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
moisture in it a lot of people say well

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.300 
moisture in it a lot of people say well
when<00:04:59.600> do<00:04:59.720> you<00:04:59.810> water<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.350> always<00:05:00.530> bottom<00:05:01.130> water

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
when do you water I always bottom water

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.280 
when do you water I always bottom water
so<00:05:02.060> I<00:05:02.120> would<00:05:02.270> fill<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.600> bottom<00:05:02.900> of<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.080> tray

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
so I would fill the bottom of the tray

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.740 
so I would fill the bottom of the tray
up<00:05:03.440> let<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:04.010> water<00:05:04.190> absorb<00:05:04.610> in<00:05:04.820> dump<00:05:05.450> out<00:05:05.600> the

up let the water absorb in dump out the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.200 
up let the water absorb in dump out the
excess<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.229> have<00:05:06.350> videos<00:05:06.680> on<00:05:06.890> that<00:05:07.070> but<00:05:07.700> you

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
excess I have videos on that but you

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.890 
excess I have videos on that but you
water<00:05:08.479> when<00:05:08.950> here's<00:05:09.950> some<00:05:10.130> coco<00:05:10.520> coir<00:05:10.760> that<00:05:11.690> is

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
water when here's some coco coir that is

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.610 
water when here's some coco coir that is
a<00:05:11.930> light<00:05:12.229> color<00:05:12.260> when<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.130> top<00:05:14.260> you<00:05:15.260> can<00:05:15.290> see

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
a light color when the top you can see

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.010 
a light color when the top you can see
the<00:05:15.770> contrast<00:05:16.280> when<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:16.970> top<00:05:17.210> starts<00:05:17.660> to<00:05:17.840> go

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
the contrast when the top starts to go

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.020 
the contrast when the top starts to go
from<00:05:18.320> this<00:05:18.440> dark<00:05:18.770> color<00:05:19.190> when<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.640> has<00:05:19.760> water

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
from this dark color when it has water

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.270 
from this dark color when it has water
to<00:05:20.570> this<00:05:20.690> light<00:05:20.930> color<00:05:21.200> that's<00:05:21.860> when<00:05:22.160> you

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
to this light color that's when you

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.490 
to this light color that's when you
water<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:23.120> top<00:05:23.390> will<00:05:23.570> always<00:05:23.870> dry<00:05:24.110> out<00:05:24.229> first

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
water the top will always dry out first

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.740 
water the top will always dry out first
Moisture<00:05:25.160> will<00:05:25.190> be<00:05:25.490> down<00:05:26.030> here<00:05:26.060> in<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.510> cell

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
Moisture will be down here in the cell

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.810 
Moisture will be down here in the cell
supporting<00:05:27.290> the<00:05:27.380> seed<00:05:27.590> so<00:05:28.190> when<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.580> top

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
supporting the seed so when the top

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.420 
supporting the seed so when the top
begins<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.540> change<00:05:29.810> to<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.620> lighter<00:05:30.830> color<00:05:31.160> in

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
begins to change to the lighter color in

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.820 
begins to change to the lighter color in
this<00:05:31.910> case<00:05:32.150> it's<00:05:32.930> coco<00:05:33.289> coir<00:05:33.500> but<00:05:33.710> your

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
this case it's coco coir but your

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.350 
this case it's coco coir but your
growing<00:05:34.010> medium<00:05:34.130> whatever<00:05:34.729> you<00:05:34.880> use<00:05:35.060> will<00:05:35.240> do

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
growing medium whatever you use will do

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.480 
growing medium whatever you use will do
the<00:05:35.479> same<00:05:35.660> that's<00:05:36.050> when<00:05:36.260> you<00:05:36.350> water<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.830> hope
