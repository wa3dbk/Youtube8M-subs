00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.480
 the benefits of incipient technology dyn alive or dead 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.930
 so that related to technology we have it in our 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.809
 eta section that precisely to talk about a very specific topic 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.300
 today we will have from the reaction of time to fernando muñoz reactors d 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.380
 enter meadow with the good morning 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.689
 we sin to lara 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.900
 good that there is firewood 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.999
 for that reason and with we are going to speak to them of the last tennis players they think to consider two 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.190
 the people who are 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.399
 thinking about buying a new computer 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.000
 I do not know if you find this in this group and elena yes gentlemen of the 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.379
 last week we're looking to see what could be good to buy because yes 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.649
 I'm thinking of buying 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.130
 serene and is that they pay that same plan to walk 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.730
 I feel only thousands of people in the country millions around the world 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.880
 because the arrival of the new operating system of Microsoft Windows Vista 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.570
 is revolutionizing is saying is that technology and is forcing 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.770
 Many people to change already when updating their equipment 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.889
 of computation you want 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.310
 after that day of the people 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.100
 Occasionally it is said it is common 98 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.940
 here we must be aware of the last advances of last week 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.750
 we are talking about shortages in technologies 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.320
 everything is so high we send a note with the wings the subject it to know 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.229
 exactly what I had to do is take into account at the correct time if 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.229
 let's see we scored first post 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.520
 these are the yahoo all the assistants part scares the team 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.730
 this blade times the mother card 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.040
 although many at the popular level give it the name said 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.460
 This card contains all electrical circuits that assume their 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.730
 craftsmen 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.560
 also 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.350
 is the one that hosts the main components of the team 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.510
 between those who are processed 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.810
 ram memory a graphics card 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.590
 this is the processed 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.940
 which is nothing other than a chip that acts as the brain of the tc 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.530
 so it is the most important component in a computer 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.860
 next to him are some visitors who are in charge of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.200
 that idea of ​​the processor because this is the part that gets hottest when used 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.919
 a pc 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.709
 the hard disk is the internal component in which all its 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.719
 programs 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.959
 windows the games hugo 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.249
 and all your files like those two documents photos songs 7 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:24.670
 the capacity of the disk 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.479
 the aliens and horses 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.319
 The more country girl has 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.970
 more things you can save on your pc ram memory is an internal joke in 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.859
 how the processor temporarily stores the information with which 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:36.949
 work 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.339
 the more ram memory your pc has 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:43.449
 more programs can open at the same time and faster will work 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.659
 the capacity of the ram are measured me horses 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:48.699
 olympic country 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.369
 most pc today 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:53.129
 has an expansion slot 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.089
 that allow you to add more memory to your computer 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:00.039
 remember that the more memory the better the computer performance 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.099
 so it does have 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.029
 one eat five modes giga country 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.179
 it will be much better 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.239
 Many computers also include expansion slot 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.419
 that allows you to install network cards 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.789
 of graphic acceleration was capture and export of video 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:16.229
 for example to watch TV signal on your computer 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:20.079
 When installing a card of these you have to remove the can so that the ports 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.979
 that in exposed from the outside 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:26.369
 so new devices can be connected to the PC without having to open the 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:27.829
 team at all times 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.180
 the optical units are the units of citi divided by burner of 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.669
 divided civic 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.539
 bush that at least one unit that can read civil victims and 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.539
 although it is better if you have a foreign currency burner 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.659
 ferrando this type of facts that Cáceres is something that is considered a 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.760
 computer should be taken into account 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.879
 for any type of assault voice vote to avoid shaw in the office is 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.149
 even in a general way 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.709
 because it varies according to the type of virus or several internal but by the 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.359
 catastrophe for work is supposed to work 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.599
 you need a certain series of benefits that these characteristics 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.609
 more advanced 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.160
 but but in general the habit with a change view wines 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.870
 d surely when you go to buy a computer n in the warehouse leana 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.099
 question what characteristics p 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.980
 wants gap 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.110
 oo you should have the on the computer that this is looking for that's why you wanted that 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.289
 they saw this note first to know what 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.759
 that d of being talking when buying a pc was operated on topics 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.069
 of the lobbies let's say what it does 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.419
 small serrano the ones that also exist the computers to place 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.340
 the waste 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.560
 while many people who have already used only use 'by saying 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.560
 something 'the earthquake I did 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.529
 this maneuver as the own 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.870
 she denied that obviously she still discreet but they do not get anywhere 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.270
 and already very few people get you you met in on diskette 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.599
 for that because that month it is required that the computer rather have 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.810
 center your desire instead of it people charge is in their files in on these 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.529
 memoirs

 to visit for example p 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.259
 already visit now the unit decided to be relevant 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.240
 because the heavens percent
