00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
to use in a situation like this there

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.170 
to use in a situation like this there
you<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.859> see<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.370> pin<00:02:54.209> go<00:02:54.480> in

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.530 

and<00:02:58.480> once<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.930> get<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.790> flush<00:03:00.790> with<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.209> log

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
where the holes are lined up and then

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.350 
where the holes are lined up and then
tap<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.890> pin<00:03:09.099> in<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.489> rest<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:09.909> way<00:03:12.360> okay

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
tap the pin in the rest of the way okay

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.530
