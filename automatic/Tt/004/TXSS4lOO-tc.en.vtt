00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 exactly my just looked what 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.350
 material from the forefront thank you for 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.059
 this plot it was a look well that's how i feel 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.400
 it seemed from was a civilian look 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.290
 a man who went to war and tell me 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.710
 what remains behind the scenes that the military itself 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.779
 say dima new you know the words 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.359
 truce from the military here I can not hear 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.519
 here you can hear another word on the letter n 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.130
 the word betrayal well, what are you talking about 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.660
 thought at all you know that any 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.899
 the war is the worst loss 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.980
 of human lives and now being in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.100
 epicenter from his 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.579
 which is extremely rare for journalists 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 for civilian people I did not seem 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.579
 concluded that it would be possible 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.739
 avoid many victims 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.920
 if personal security measures 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.170
 composition were at a higher level and I 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 I will give specific examples to be 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.340
 I understand what you are talking about here in this story 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.289
 have seen 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.480
 Ukrainian armored personnel carrier new btr-4 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.670
 bit it is easy to learn so it is such 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.180
 characteristic lattice framework to which 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.729
 prevents from entering 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.450
 Living battle with when fired at 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.810
 grenade launcher 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.369
 the problem is most of ours 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.250
 Ukrainian armored vehicles obsolete 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.409
 modifications this btr-80 which such 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.470
 frame they have and when hit 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.360
 rocket launcher they just burn out and this 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.040
 is it not a problem yes to discuss all the BTR and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.619
 who in the zone of atoms such a lattice is 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 it's not so expensive here in the past 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 the plot we showed the photo I ask her 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.850
 now also demonstrate yes it 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.619
 kevlar casco driver btr who 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.600
 here were the stricken grenade launchers here 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.850
 look what remains of her and 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.130
 imagine what's left of all those 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.909
 the guys who were at that moment 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.500
 Here in this armored personnel carrier 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.079
 such is the situation we are literally 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.460
 yesterday communicated with one crew these 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.310
 the guys told us that they are now 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.439
 just collect their money themselves 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.329
 in order to talk about your car 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.579
 such a framework and the price of issue is 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.610
 about four five thousand hryvnia a 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.619
 another type scalded his bronnik well 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.250
 just here are such pan cheese nets with 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.380
 the beds 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:26.190
 perhaps not quite aesthetically pleasing 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:28.200
 well, life is more expensive there are no questions 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.680
 on aviation we saw you flew on 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.690
 helicopters mi-8 so here unfortunately to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.490
 sorry these helicopters nobody 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.980
 covers all the rules 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.540
 transport helicopters should 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.670
 accompanied by military helicopters but in 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.130
 Ideally, of course it was always like this 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.850
 during the war in afghanistan mi-8 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.130
 raised under cover of EI 24 combat 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.710
 with us and unfortunately in the zone of it it 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.930
 happens extremely rarely as a rule mi-8 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.840
 transport fly without any 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.840
 escorts just on your own and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.400
 risk and well that's just like living targets in 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.840
 dash 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.420
 pilots all pilots do not just go 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.940
 blacks are buried almost every week 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.040
 his fellow colleagues but nothing 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.140
 can do and if also others 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.790
 causes of the crash about which one of 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.620
 the pilots told us but he didn't want 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:36.900
 show your face there damn it all 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:39.240
 that was obsolete iron well and committing 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.250
 good paratroopers 95 airmobile 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.260
 brigade in battle 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.690
 managed to discourage the terrorists 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.120
 arsenal of weapons here by account numbers and 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.610
 modifications of this weapon can be made 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.830
 the conclusion that she came to Ukraine from 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.910
 Russia and now I ask to demonstrate 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.200
 this is lpg 18 so called fly rbg 22 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.850
 this is ak-74 with an underground grenade launcher 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.370
 Kalashnikov machine guns are also some 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.440
 types of weapons that just can be 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.100
 call trophy in Ukraine such 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.350
 just no please show 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.290
 you see artua 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.080
 so-called bumblebee means from a flamethrower 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.230
 not a single sample before being put into service 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.020
 Ukraine, no, see how much is the last 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.420
 modification in service with the red army 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.840
 on not worth plastic goes plastic 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.260
 butt 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.290
 plastic forearm non-removable cheek paint 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.110
 arnis stand with wooden 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.790
 butt and strength on the cheek so we 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:45.210
 she could not yet be through 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:47.100
 borders of the neighboring state are also 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.050
 now so now at least from 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.510
 This weapon is certainly no Ukrainian 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.070
 a soldier will not be killed or injured 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.630
 there could still be a lot of things 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.420
 telling dima but i think that 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.840
 colleagues also have something to say thanks 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.210
 great 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.670
 stay in touch well let's talk i 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.140
 I understand that for other issues you 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.330
 also you will make the plot thank you 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.400
 huge for the plot in the details of the week 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.240
 please take care of yourself and yourself 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.240
