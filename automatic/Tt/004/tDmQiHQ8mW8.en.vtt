okay distance Dave here we've talked a
lot<00:00:02.520> about<00:00:02.820> patience<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:04.110> stroke<00:00:04.350> about

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
lot about patience in the stroke about

lot about patience in the stroke about
how<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.859> start<00:00:05.250> implementing<00:00:05.700> front<00:00:06.029> quadrant

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
how to start implementing front quadrant

timing<00:00:06.660> today<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:06.990> do<00:00:07.259> want<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.710> talk<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.950> little

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
timing today I do want to talk a little

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.980 
timing today I do want to talk a little
bit<00:00:08.250> about<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.519> power<00:00:08.670> side<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:09.750> very

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
bit about the power side and it's very

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.629 
bit about the power side and it's very
important<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.860> get<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> video

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
important to this that I get a video

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.039 
important to this that I get a video
demonstration<00:00:12.150> because<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:12.780> very

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
demonstration because it's very

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.570 
demonstration because it's very
different<00:00:13.320> it's<00:00:13.679> hard<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.130> describe<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.549> words

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
different it's hard to describe in words

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.700 
different it's hard to describe in words
to<00:00:14.940> get<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.150> right<00:00:15.269> kind<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.509> angles<00:00:15.809> I'm

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
to get the right kind of angles I'm

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.410 
to get the right kind of angles I'm
assuming<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> stroke<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.180> were<00:00:18.330> in

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
assuming in the stroke that were in

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.480 
assuming in the stroke that were in
building<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.869> front<00:00:19.260> quadrant<00:00:19.500> timing<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
building up front quadrant timing that

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.250 
building up front quadrant timing that
delay<00:00:20.820> out<00:00:20.970> front<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> shift<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.080> weight

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
delay out front so the shift of weight

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.259 
delay out front so the shift of weight
comes<00:00:22.529> primarily<00:00:22.769> from<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.730> drive<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
comes primarily from the drive of the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.000 
comes primarily from the drive of the
hip<00:00:24.449> through<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> obliques<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.920> the

that's<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.470> source<00:00:28.740> rotation<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> don't

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
that's the source rotation so I don't

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.700 
that's the source rotation so I don't
need<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> pull<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.539> arm<00:00:30.750> early<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.590> make

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
need to pull on this arm early to make

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.970 
need to pull on this arm early to make
rotation<00:00:32.369> happen<00:00:33.050> now<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.530> other<00:00:34.710> thing

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
rotation happen now the other thing

rotation happen now the other thing
that's<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> help<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.930> true<00:00:36.930> front

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
that's going to help with a true front

that's going to help with a true front
quadrant<00:00:37.500> stroke<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.790> just<00:00:39.030> about<00:00:39.120> how

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
quadrant stroke it's not just about how

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.060 
quadrant stroke it's not just about how
long<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.570> wait<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.840> front<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.500> also<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
long you wait out front it's also the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.110 
long you wait out front it's also the
strategy<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> arm<00:00:41.670> that's<00:00:41.850> starting<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
come back as it comes up it's important

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
way down as we're going through here

what<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> slight

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
what we want to do is have a slight

what we want to do is have a slight
hinging<00:01:08.549> motion<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> rotation<00:01:09.990> happens

there this time the lead arm is going to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.469 
there this time the lead arm is going to
simply<00:01:13.590> bend<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.430> elbow<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.210> does

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
simply bend at the elbow and that does

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.420 
simply bend at the elbow and that does
depend<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> arm<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.710> being<00:01:16.950> across<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
will drop through like that and just

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.969 
will drop through like that and just
pull<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> hand<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.200> find<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.590> strong

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that 10 degree trick we've talked about

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.380 
that 10 degree trick we've talked about
before<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.520> hit<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:33.000> moment

setting up this true perpendicular the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.289 
setting up this true perpendicular the
fact<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.280> can't<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.640> my<00:01:41.790> elbow<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.119> now

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
fact you can't see my elbow right now

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.440 
fact you can't see my elbow right now
because<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.659> perpendicular<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.189> view

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.300 
because it's perpendicular to the view
when<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.720> into<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.890> next

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
when you get into that the next

when you get into that the next
challenge<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.110> much<00:01:49.350> stronger

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
challenge is that you are much stronger

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.609

closer<00:01:50.460> into<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.820> body<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.409> at

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
closer into the body then you are out at

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
closer into the body then you are out at
the<00:01:52.649> hand<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.850> somebody<00:01:54.210> hold<00:01:54.420> back<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.869> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the hand have somebody hold back on you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.990 
the hand have somebody hold back on you
and<00:01:55.170> push<00:01:55.770> down<00:01:55.979> through<00:01:56.250> here<00:01:56.430> push<00:01:56.969> down

and push down through here push down

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120 
and push down through here push down
through<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:58.530> we've<00:01:58.680> got<00:01:58.710> access<00:01:59.070> to

through here because we've got access to
more<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.610> much<00:01:59.729> more<00:01:59.909> strength<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
more so much more strength in here and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.660 
more so much more strength in here and
it's<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.899> close<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.500> closer<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it's a close it's closer in then that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.639 
it's a close it's closer in then that
long<00:02:02.909> lever<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:04.320> want<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.530> make

long lever out there we want to make

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.170 
long lever out there we want to make

elbow because if I'm stronger here that

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.330 
elbow because if I'm stronger here that
will<00:02:12.030> come

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
will come

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.220 
will come
faster<00:02:12.879> we<00:02:13.599> want<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.019> hold<00:02:14.140> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230

and don't cup it because if you cup it

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.830

you're<00:02:30.430> losing<00:02:30.700> some<00:02:30.849> surface<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.360> if<00:02:31.720> you

you're losing some surface and if you

you're losing some surface and if you

put ultimate tension in there it'll

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.180 
put ultimate tension in there it'll
curve<00:02:33.940> back<00:02:34.150> up<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.690> hook<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.560> round<00:02:35.769> I<00:02:35.920> like<00:02:36.069> to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
curve back up so hook it round I like to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.030 
curve back up so hook it round I like to

through if this is done correctly what

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.270 
should feel pretty much straight back
but<00:02:55.450> if<00:02:55.569> you<00:02:55.599> notice<00:02:56.019> right<00:02:56.079> now<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.980> your<00:02:57.069> view

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
but if you notice right now to your view

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.630 
but if you notice right now to your view
right<00:02:57.489> now<00:02:57.720> my<00:02:58.720> I've<00:02:59.230> got<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.560> narrow<00:02:59.950> distance

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
right now my I've got a narrow distance

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.150 
right now my I've got a narrow distance
between<00:03:00.849> my<00:03:01.180> shoulders<00:03:01.660> as<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.470> rotate<00:03:02.890> it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.030 
between my shoulders as I rotate it
widens<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.120> then<00:03:04.239> narrows<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.709> that's<00:03:05.890> the

widens and then narrows so that's the

conscious<00:03:16.600> wiggle<00:03:17.350> in<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.650> out<00:03:17.739> unless<00:03:18.430> you

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
conscious wiggle in and out unless you

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.030 
conscious wiggle in and out unless you
want<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.819> really<00:03:19.030> rip<00:03:19.209> up<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.540> rotator<00:03:19.870> cuff

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
want to really rip up the rotator cuff

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.509 
want to really rip up the rotator cuff
okay<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.670> there<00:03:21.910> main<00:03:22.569> points<00:03:22.959> on<00:03:23.079> this<00:03:23.519> front

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
okay so there main points on this front

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.340 
okay so there main points on this front
quadrant<00:03:24.760> timing<00:03:25.180> provides<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.930> opportunity

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
quadrant timing provides the opportunity

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.660 
quadrant timing provides the opportunity
for<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.560> happen<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:27.040> can't<00:03:27.280> be<00:03:27.400> done<00:03:27.519> on

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
for this to happen it can't be done on

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.370 
for this to happen it can't be done on
its<00:03:27.819> own<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.090> can't<00:03:28.299> be<00:03:28.420> over<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.930> arm<00:03:29.079> trying

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
its own you can't be over the arm trying

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.839 
its own you can't be over the arm trying
to<00:03:29.440> get<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.709> twist<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.160> there<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.700> gotta

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
to get that twist in there you gotta

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.339 
to get that twist in there you gotta
wait<00:03:31.000> until<00:03:31.180> something<00:03:31.510> else<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.930> rolling<00:03:32.230> you

wait until something else is rolling you
off<00:03:32.549> once<00:03:33.549> you're<00:03:33.760> in<00:03:33.910> there<00:03:34.090> we've<00:03:34.209> got<00:03:34.239> to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
off once you're in there we've got to

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.500 
off once you're in there we've got to
manage<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.440> that<00:03:35.590> we<00:03:35.680> can<00:03:35.859> maintain<00:03:36.040> that

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
manage it so that we can maintain that

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.000 
manage it so that we can maintain that
exact<00:03:37.510> perpendicular<00:03:38.109> surface<00:03:38.470> by<00:03:38.650> how<00:03:38.859> much

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
exact perpendicular surface by how much

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.559 
exact perpendicular surface by how much
right<00:03:39.220> they've<00:03:39.340> gotten<00:03:39.609> they're<00:03:39.790> not<00:03:40.329> how

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
right they've gotten they're not how

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:41.819 
right they've gotten they're not how
much<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.780> can<00:03:41.019> simply<00:03:41.290> put<00:03:41.440> through<00:03:41.650> or

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
much you can simply put through or

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.349 
much you can simply put through or
you'll<00:03:41.980> lose<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.430> grip<00:03:42.639> and<00:03:43.090> have<00:03:43.239> an

you'll lose the grip and have an

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.349 
you'll lose the grip and have an
ineffective<00:03:43.810> downward<00:03:44.470> push<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.040> then<00:03:45.910> don't

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
ineffective downward push and then don't

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.909 
ineffective downward push and then don't
worry<00:03:46.630> about<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.049> curve<00:03:47.290> it'll<00:03:47.739> happen

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
worry about the curve it'll happen

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.470 
worry about the curve it'll happen
naturally<00:03:48.099> on<00:03:48.549> its<00:03:48.579> own<00:03:48.849> if<00:03:49.090> you're<00:03:49.209> timing

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
naturally on its own if you're timing

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.599 
naturally on its own if you're timing
the<00:03:49.540> rotation<00:03:49.959> correctly<00:03:50.380> any<00:03:50.590> curve<00:03:51.459> you're

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
the rotation correctly any curve you're

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.180 
the rotation correctly any curve you're
doing<00:03:51.849> is<00:03:51.970> providing<00:03:52.870> indirect<00:03:53.709> tension<00:03:54.069> in

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
doing is providing indirect tension in

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.059 
doing is providing indirect tension in
the<00:03:54.280> wrong<00:03:54.489> directions<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.680> you're<00:03:56.680> going<00:03:56.919> to

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
the wrong directions and you're going to

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.800 
the wrong directions and you're going to
do<00:03:57.579> some<00:03:57.760> naughty<00:03:58.030> things<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.389> your<00:03:58.480> shoulder

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
do some naughty things to your shoulder

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.690 
do some naughty things to your shoulder
so<00:03:59.200> some<00:04:00.010> things<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.250> work<00:04:00.430> on<00:04:00.519> in<00:04:00.579> practice

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
so some things to work on in practice

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.750 
so some things to work on in practice
this<00:04:01.090> week<00:04:01.269> good<00:04:01.569> luck
