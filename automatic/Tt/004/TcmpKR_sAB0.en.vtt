00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
the new tier 9 Japanese medium tank that

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.360 
the new tier 9 Japanese medium tank that
type<00:00:06.000> 61<00:00:06.450> on<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.259> eight<00:00:07.649> point<00:00:07.919> 10<00:00:08.099> test

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370

server<00:00:10.099> as<00:00:11.269> you<00:00:12.269> see<00:00:12.480> here<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.900> tank<00:00:13.170> it's

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
server as you see here the tank it's

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.189 
server as you see here the tank it's
kind<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.400> tall<00:00:15.710> but<00:00:17.000> at<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.539> same<00:00:18.750> time<00:00:18.990> it

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
kind of tall but at the same time it

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.750 
kind of tall but at the same time it
doesn't<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.560> much<00:00:19.770> gun<00:00:20.039> depression<00:00:20.279> which

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
doesn't have much gun depression which

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.019 
doesn't have much gun depression which
is<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> main<00:00:22.699> downsides<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.850> this

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
is one of the main downsides of this

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.120 
is one of the main downsides of this
tank<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.539> you're<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.289> spotted<00:00:25.650> way

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
tank is you're going to be spotted way

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.759 
tank is you're going to be spotted way
before<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.730> actually<00:00:27.080> cross<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> hill<00:00:28.410> we're

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
before you actually cross the hill we're

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.279 
before you actually cross the hill we're
going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.130> shot<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.490> pieces<00:00:30.140> because<00:00:31.140> your

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
going to be shot to pieces because your

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.709 
going to be shot to pieces because your
armor<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.830> actually<00:00:32.219> closer<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.210> light<00:00:33.450> tank

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
armor is actually closer to a light tank

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.200 
armor is actually closer to a light tank
than<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.170> medium<00:00:34.530> tank<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.969> thin

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
than a medium tank it's really thin

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.750 
than a medium tank it's really thin
there's<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.350> really<00:00:37.590> any<00:00:37.800> spots<00:00:38.190> thicker

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
there's not really any spots thicker

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.200 
there's not really any spots thicker
than<00:00:39.710> say<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.920> 75<00:00:41.399> millimeters<00:00:43.879> on<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> plus

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
than say like 75 millimeters on the plus

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.600 
than say like 75 millimeters on the plus
side<00:00:45.239> though<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.690> gain<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.860> tier<00:00:47.100> 10<00:00:47.370> gun

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
side though you gain the tier 10 gun

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.229 
side though you gain the tier 10 gun
which<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.390> st<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.590> there<00:00:50.000> which<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
which is on st be one there which is a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.420 
which is on st be one there which is a
el<00:00:51.660> seven<00:00:52.020> clone<00:00:52.789> but<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.930> good

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
el seven clone but you have really good

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.529 
el seven clone but you have really good
you<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.789> good<00:00:56.969> rate<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.300> fire<00:00:57.510> i

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
you have a really good rate of fire i

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.369 
you have a really good rate of fire i
think<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.050> around<00:00:58.170> six<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.949> base<00:00:59.219> and

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
think it's around six for the base and

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.330 
think it's around six for the base and
right<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:01.530> i'm<00:01:01.649> using<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.920> hundred<00:01:02.219> percent

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
right now i'm using a hundred percent

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.030 
right now i'm using a hundred percent
crew<00:01:02.789> rammer<00:01:03.180> fence<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.409> no<00:01:04.530> brothers<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
crew rammer fence but no brothers in

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.490 
crew rammer fence but no brothers in
arms<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> reload<00:01:06.030> time<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.600> very<00:01:07.110> good

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
arms so the reload time is very good

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
arms so the reload time is very good
it's<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:08.159> almost<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> tier<00:01:09.390> 10

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it's actually almost like a tier 10

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.310 
it's actually almost like a tier 10
medium<00:01:10.850> packaged<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.090> tier<00:01:12.330> nine<00:01:12.570> so

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
medium packaged into a tier nine so

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.520 
medium packaged into a tier nine so
basically<00:01:13.830> you're<00:01:14.280> running<00:01:14.610> around<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
basically you're running around with a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
basically you're running around with a
very<00:01:16.530> frail<00:01:16.979> tier<00:01:17.909> 10<00:01:18.150> medium<00:01:18.570> tank<00:01:18.840> per<00:01:19.320> se<00:01:20.240> as

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
very frail tier 10 medium tank per se as

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
very frail tier 10 medium tank per se as
you<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.869> not<00:01:21.930> exactly<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> fastest

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you see it's not exactly the fastest

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.719 
you see it's not exactly the fastest
mover<00:01:23.640> either<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:25.470> kind<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> heavy

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
mover either it's kind of like a heavy

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
mover either it's kind of like a heavy
tank<00:01:27.060> per<00:01:27.240> se<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.080> would<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.530> would

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
tank per se you would think that would

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.730 
tank per se you would think that would
be<00:01:28.950> faster<00:01:29.490> giving<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> has<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.590> any

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
be faster giving that has not really any

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.789 
be faster giving that has not really any
armor<00:01:32.420> but<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.840> not<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.860> fast<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
armor but it's not that fast at all so I

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.499 
armor but it's not that fast at all so I
have<00:01:37.920> no<00:01:38.189> idea<00:01:38.490> where<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.299> map

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
have no idea where I'm going on this map

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
have no idea where I'm going on this map
so<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.290> kind<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.650> keep<00:01:41.040> coming<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.430> here

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
so I'm just kind of keep coming up here

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.880 
so I'm just kind of keep coming up here
hopefully<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.630> die<00:01:42.899> everyone<00:01:43.649> else<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
hopefully I do not die everyone else is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.800 
hopefully I do not die everyone else is
stopping<00:01:44.280> there<00:01:44.490> which<00:01:45.500> says<00:01:46.500> something<00:01:46.530> but

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
stopping there which says something but

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
stopping there which says something but
I<00:01:49.990> like<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.110> take<00:01:51.290> risks

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.790 

basically<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.000> point<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.050> this<00:01:56.170> tank<00:01:56.470> is<00:01:56.620> to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
basically the point of this tank is to

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.220 
basically the point of this tank is to
use<00:01:56.980> your<00:01:57.130> good<00:01:57.340> range<00:01:57.790> has<00:01:58.210> 400<00:01:58.810> vsphere

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
use your good range has 400 vsphere

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.190 
use your good range has 400 vsphere
range<00:01:59.500> and<00:02:00.000> your<00:02:01.000> good<00:02:01.180> firepower<00:02:01.720> basically

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
range and your good firepower basically

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.440 
range and your good firepower basically
to<00:02:02.350> scoot<00:02:02.740> around<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.070> mat<00:02:03.220> spot<00:02:03.970> some<00:02:04.210> things

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
to scoot around the mat spot some things

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:13.070 
to scoot around the mat spot some things
hopefully<00:02:04.840> don't<00:02:05.140> get<00:02:05.290> shot<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.590> pieces<00:02:05.740> and

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.480 

try<00:02:14.080> not<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.290> get<00:02:14.440> hit<00:02:14.590> by<00:02:14.740> already<00:02:14.890> directly

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
try not to get hit by already directly

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.910 
try not to get hit by already directly
because<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.480> rule<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:17.140> will<00:02:17.380> hurt<00:02:17.530> for<00:02:17.800> every

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
because it rule it will hurt for every

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.070 
because it rule it will hurt for every
much

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
got walls for a second this motion blur

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.980 
got walls for a second this motion blur
and<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.840> different<00:02:27.330> zoom<00:02:28.330> mechanic<00:02:28.870> they

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
and the different zoom mechanic they

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.590 
and the different zoom mechanic they
have<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:30.400> confusing<00:02:31.060> me<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.210> little<00:02:31.390> bit

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
have a now is confusing me a little bit

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.140 
have a now is confusing me a little bit
they<00:02:32.590> did<00:02:32.800> change<00:02:33.040> how<00:02:34.380> your<00:02:35.670> zoom<00:02:36.670> works<00:02:36.940> a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
they did change how your zoom works a

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.210 
they did change how your zoom works a
little<00:02:37.480> bit<00:02:37.660> smoother<00:02:38.230> but<00:02:38.530> at<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.800> same<00:02:38.980> time

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
little bit smoother but at the same time

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.670 
little bit smoother but at the same time
combined<00:02:39.760> with<00:02:39.970> motion<00:02:40.360> blur<00:02:40.540> which<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:41.590> have

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
combined with motion blur which I have

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.920 
combined with motion blur which I have
set<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.040> low<00:02:42.310> fairly<00:02:43.240> sure<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.450> I'm<00:02:43.780> gonna

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
set on low fairly sure that I'm gonna

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.580 
set on low fairly sure that I'm gonna
see<00:02:44.650> what<00:02:44.880> completely<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.810> makes<00:02:47.020> it<00:02:47.200> very

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
see what completely it makes it very

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:06.140 
see what completely it makes it very
confusing<00:02:49.410> at<00:02:50.410> times

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
anyway not exactly my best game since

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.460 
anyway not exactly my best game since
this<00:05:21.560> tank<00:05:21.889> doesn't<00:05:22.759> exactly<00:05:23.150> bode<00:05:23.990> well<00:05:24.020> two

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
this tank doesn't exactly bode well two

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
and pick your shots without actually

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.219 
and pick your shots without actually
being<00:05:36.229> seen<00:05:37.389> so<00:05:38.389> I<00:05:38.419> did<00:05:38.630> lose<00:05:38.840> a<00:05:38.870> little<00:05:39.050> bit<00:05:39.139> of

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
being seen so I did lose a little bit of

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.760 
being seen so I did lose a little bit of
credit<00:05:39.560> since<00:05:39.770> I<00:05:39.919> fired<00:05:40.250> some<00:05:40.610> premium<00:05:41.180> rounds

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
credit since I fired some premium rounds

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.709 
credit since I fired some premium rounds
but<00:05:42.770> as<00:05:43.099> you<00:05:43.250> see<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.909> rate<00:05:44.060> of<00:05:44.090> fire<00:05:44.360> on<00:05:44.570> this

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
but as you see the rate of fire on this

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.490 
but as you see the rate of fire on this
thing<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.080> six<00:05:45.440> was<00:05:45.979> correct<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:47.229> the<00:05:48.229> gun<00:05:48.469> on

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
thing is six was correct and the gun on

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.490 
thing is six was correct and the gun on
it<00:05:48.800> is<00:05:48.979> fucking<00:05:49.699> awesome<00:05:49.880> in<00:05:50.240> my<00:05:50.360> opinion<00:05:50.659> for

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
tier nine medium it's definitely the

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.439 
tier nine medium it's definitely the
best<00:05:53.960> gun<00:05:54.229> out<00:05:54.440> there<00:05:54.680> in<00:05:55.039> my<00:05:55.250> opinion<00:05:55.449> maybe

best gun out there in my opinion maybe

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.040 
best gun out there in my opinion maybe
for<00:05:56.780> every<00:05:57.229> tier<00:05:57.680> nine<00:05:57.860> out<00:05:58.039> there
