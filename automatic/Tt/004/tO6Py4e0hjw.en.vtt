nothing<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.689> simplifies<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.290> lot<00:01:43.500> of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
nothing like that it simplifies a lot of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.810 
nothing like that it simplifies a lot of
things<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:45.979> guess<00:01:46.979> let's<00:01:47.130> talk<00:01:47.369> about<00:01:47.520> what

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820

things so I guess let's talk about what
we're<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> talk<00:01:48.270> about<00:01:48.329> alright<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
we're here to talk about alright the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.289 
we're here to talk about alright the
motor<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.729> me<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> looks<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.210> lot

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
motor so this is to me it looks a lot

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.510 
motor so this is to me it looks a lot
like<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.540> Tekin<00:01:51.930> motor<00:01:52.140> I'm<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.280> sure

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
like a Tekin motor I'm not really sure

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.580 
like a Tekin motor I'm not really sure
why<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.549> don't<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
why I don't know just it's just the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
why I don't know just it's just the
front<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> endcap<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.820> everything<00:02:00.479> else

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
front of the endcap and everything else

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.539 
front of the endcap and everything else
but<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.320> solder<00:02:01.680> tabs<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.250> or<00:02:02.369> high-current

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
but the solder tabs do or high-current

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.590 
but the solder tabs do or high-current
solder<00:02:03.119> tabs<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.689> pretty<00:02:03.869> nice<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.329> guess

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
solder tabs are pretty nice but I guess

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.180 
solder tabs are pretty nice but I guess
let's<00:02:06.810> get<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.049> over<00:02:07.140> blocks<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.829> what<00:02:07.950> we<00:02:08.039> got

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
let's get it over blocks see what we got

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.820 
let's get it over blocks see what we got
here

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
here

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.229 
here
well<00:02:10.830> first<00:02:11.220> things<00:02:11.459> first<00:02:11.550> one<00:02:12.000> thing<00:02:12.090> that

well first things first one thing that

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.699 
well first things first one thing that
bugs<00:02:12.540> me<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.110> sticker

this<00:02:58.069> this<00:02:59.069> is<00:02:59.219> the<00:02:59.340> sensor<00:02:59.700> cable<00:03:00.090> which<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
this this is the sensor cable which is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.940 
this this is the sensor cable which is
included<00:03:01.079> with<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.319> motor<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:01.829> they

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
included with the motor but they

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.149 
included with the motor but they
actually<00:03:02.099> wrap<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:02.819> any<00:03:03.090> mesh<00:03:04.159> protective

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
actually wrap it any mesh protective

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.809 
actually wrap it any mesh protective
mesh<00:03:05.569> layer<00:03:07.129> which<00:03:08.129> i<00:03:08.310> think<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.609> pretty

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
mesh layer which i think is pretty

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:09.440 
mesh layer which i think is pretty
awesome

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
awesome

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.629 
awesome
I<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.409> lot<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.069> use<00:03:11.250> for<00:03:11.519> my

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
I have a lot of this that I use for my

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.610 
I have a lot of this that I use for my
own<00:03:11.669> stuff<00:03:12.150> but<00:03:12.419> I<00:03:12.810> think<00:03:12.870> that's<00:03:13.169> pretty<00:03:13.349> cool

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
own stuff but I think that's pretty cool

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.530 
own stuff but I think that's pretty cool
that<00:03:13.769> they<00:03:13.919> include<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.639> there<00:03:14.819> and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
that they include that in there and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.580 
that they include that in there and
here's<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.409> motor<00:03:16.909> over<00:03:17.909> there<00:03:18.379> see<00:03:19.379> what

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
here's the motor over there see what

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.449 
here's the motor over there see what
it's<00:03:19.709> all<00:03:19.889> about<00:03:19.919> here<00:03:20.430> oh<00:03:22.069> definitely<00:03:23.069> got

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
it's all about here oh definitely got

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.619 
it's all about here oh definitely got
some<00:03:23.609> weight<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.060> feels<00:03:24.780> really<00:03:25.139> nice<00:03:26.629> it's

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
some weight to it feels really nice it's

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.500 
some weight to it feels really nice it's
all<00:03:27.840> aluminum<00:03:28.280> high-current<00:03:29.280> solder<00:03:29.909> tabs<00:03:30.239> on

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
all aluminum high-current solder tabs on

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.689 
all aluminum high-current solder tabs on
the<00:03:30.629> back<00:03:30.780> there<00:03:32.930> nice<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:33.959> labeled<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:35.519> the

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
the back there nice and labeled like the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.189 
the back there nice and labeled like the
ribs<00:03:35.939> on<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.299> can<00:03:36.540> help<00:03:36.870> with<00:03:37.049> heat

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
ribs on the can help with heat

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.270 
ribs on the can help with heat
dissipation<00:03:38.720> it's<00:03:39.720> got<00:03:40.019> some<00:03:40.799> pretty<00:03:41.010> crazy

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
dissipation it's got some pretty crazy

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.099 
dissipation it's got some pretty crazy
stuff<00:03:41.489> it's<00:03:41.909> a<00:03:42.000> new<00:03:42.150> motor<00:03:42.419> right<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:42.930> there's

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
stuff it's a new motor right so there's

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.780 
stuff it's a new motor right so there's
some<00:03:43.290> technology<00:03:43.829> in<00:03:43.859> here<00:03:44.250> like<00:03:44.400> see<00:03:44.639> they

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
some technology in here like see they

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.569 
some technology in here like see they
have<00:03:44.879> call<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.900> super<00:03:46.199> thin<00:03:46.229> laminations<00:03:47.159> to

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
have call it super thin laminations to

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.490
