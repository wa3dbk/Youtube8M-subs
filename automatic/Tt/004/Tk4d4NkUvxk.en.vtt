00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.210
 and 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.820
 ah 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.020
 Well, normally, here we are in the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.630
 state of mexico about we are 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.870
 in the puddle in the compass event that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.600
 Korea and Tomba until we're 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.680
 our good friend guillermo taxi that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.540
 it came to be in this event what is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.210
 one of the things that you have seen that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.879
 has changed in the competition and towards 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.110
 official events or with shows but before 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.809
 that swims many times for the invitation 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.860
 It's the first time that I do a job 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.809
 judge 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.909
 I took all the courses equally for 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.940
 to make scholarships in oslo not what 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.339
 I did better because of my own tradition 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.080
 but our friends a cordial 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.780
 invitation and here we are accessing very 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.790
 all right 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.140
 notice that what I have seen again 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.920
 that has changed in all men 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.299
 official and with shows is the competition 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.250
 notice that I feel that you are 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.979
 distorting a little bit all this in 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.009
 that all of us who are nothing else 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.170
 thinking about taking our males to 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.200
 take our express johnny females 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.509
 and sell either litter or sell a little 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.659
 but it's getting lost at the level of 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.860
 competition of the greens are empty 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.710
 that is something personal 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:45.230
 9 and I think something motivate people 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.660
 to participate in the first 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.660
 for our elders 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.660
 d 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.060
 what little things can the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.119
 organizers so that people are encouraged 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.729
 more to compete look at me by not coming 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.369
 the organizer I thought about topic 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.560
 right now I do not know if God wants more function 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.289
 of event for November in Guadalajara 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.720
 in which you will not be charged entry 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.730
 they charge it to be but it is going to enter 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.560
 foresee it by people and dog with 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.959
 slopes 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.450
 and that topic I think we're going to minimize 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.420
 the pretexts for us to keep all 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.340
 in the rhythm and we're going to scale by 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.580
 there I think it promises more could I do 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.010
 is to offer some bag or preserved in 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.019
 the awards unfortunately 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.780
 and I tell you as an organizer there is no 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.670
 sponsorships for our races look 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.950
 that very few people have touched many 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.620
 gardens forces people and very little 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.940
 people have the spirit to get involved 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.070
 After these races yet 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.400
 afraid to say good I'm going to 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.010
 promote my extraction croquette 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.079
 micro who is with him and they are afraid 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.629
 we are still not reliable 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.510
 for sponsorships I understand in this 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.600
 organizers issue that we can not 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.460
 give better prizes 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.680
 we do but we are tied hands 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.360
 because unfortunately many people 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.040
 think that as organizer you do 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.040
 millionaire and it is not like that 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.920
 find sponsors and motivation 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.750
 would give better prize give bags 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.580
 approve is the subject that we have personal 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.940
 to see if we can have a ring of 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.470
 competition very very good ideas some 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.020
 another thing he wants to say to those who 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.930
 us that in the future they will attend 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.300
 one of your events not with anything all 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.610
 let's go think that in my events are 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.980
 welcome I try and obviously give a 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.380
 little bit of benefits to the people who were going 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.980
 from outside I do not have to see that I do not 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.530
 they bother I have people because I know that they 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.150
 throws 2000 kilometers in a stretch that 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.640
 Take your dogs and they will compete 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.840
 then we must do as a filmmaker 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.080
 explain it 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.080
 and greet people who somehow 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.300
 discount and that's a way of 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.900
 prudish to try to get into it 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.810
 outside but up to our events very 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.270
 very good ideas and hopefully god 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.500
 wants we can see us in November said 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.050
 truth does not come from eating or from 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.600
 Guadalajara we can be there and then 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.210
 supporting all the actors we are here 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.180
 it's government to support all of that 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.490
 take this positive movement and for 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.280
 show people that we are for 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.840
 support them help us and motivate us and bring 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.620
 new people and see something positive 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.620
 nothing negative 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.310
 it is important also as organizers 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:56.430
 try to do our job of 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:03.789
 circle promotion because 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:06.210
 we are hardly in our 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.210
 production 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.730
 very good with everyone 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.550
 Y 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.570
 to 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.790
 ah 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.210
 or not
