00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.709
 Hello, welcome to Todd's kitchen 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.940
 Butter is the ingredient I use in many recipes, but most people don't know, you can take it at home 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.940
 So, one day with me, I will tell you how to make domestic butter. 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.169
 Pour into the mixing bowl and pour it in our 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.980
 Thickening cream 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.889
 In the United States, it is also known as heavy frost 

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:32.650
 It is basically a very thick milk 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.200
 There are about 35% fat. If you choose, but I'm using, you can use a hand mixer 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.430
 Standing on the mixer 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.770
 Therefore, whipping cream is high 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.470
 It was very thick until it came. 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.470
 Other ways can do this, turn it into a jar and shake it, but it can take about twenty minutes and it will hurt your arm 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.260
 So it's part of the way 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.239
 It has begun to thicken 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.050
 This is the soft peak period, so keep mixing 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.060
 So at this point IM wants to change the head 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.530
 If you use a normal hand mixer you don't need 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.240
 But if you use a mixer, you will 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.820
 Now I add the paddle attachment 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.370
 Again, if you have a hand mixer to keep mixing 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.370
 But if you have a blender 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.370
 Switch to paddle 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.040
 So you can see it soon 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 This will begin to separate into solids and liquids. Liquid is butter milk 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.280
 And solid, butter 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.430
 Separation of solids, butter milk 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.910
 Turn the speed to prevent splashing 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.340
 It has been mixed 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.870
 About five minutes 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.690
 What can you really think? 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.510
 Solid cream and butter milk 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.439
 Keep mixing low for one minute 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.909
 You can see the butter on the paddle 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.469
 So what will we do next? 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.199
 Pour the butter into the container 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:29.759
 Don't throw it away because it has a lot of uses in cooking butter milk 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.269
 Instantly put another recipe used in this refrigerator 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.699
 Now if you want to use butter right away 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.329
 Then you don't have to do anything and use it as 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.809
 But if you want it to be stored in the refrigerator for a longer period of time 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.189
 Then you need to remove excess butter and butter 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.049
 So I have some ice water here. 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.159
 It must be ice water 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.639
 Pour some 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.899
 And justice 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:59.739
 By pushing butter 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.369
 Seeing the water become cloudy 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.369
 This means it's mixed butter milk 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.180
 So we will continue to do this 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.119
 If you don't put all the butter out of milk 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:10.610
 It will destroy 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.779
 Butter after the day or so 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:17.069
 This will be useless. So if you want to store it in the fridge 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.779
 About a week or so, then you have to do this 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.199
 Once you have completed the first batch 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:29.919
 pour out 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.400
 Then pour in more ice water and continue until 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.739
 Water comes out clearly 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.349
 Hard push because you will 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.369
 Found a bag of butter in the air 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:43.999
 Leave the butter itself 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:50.999
 You can see that the water is turbid, so there are still some there. 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.869
 So this is the last time I need to do 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:59.839
 Turbid water is almost non-existent 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.699
 The water is still very clear 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:06.449
 So this should be the last time 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.199
 Some fresh-keeping places in the future 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.589
 But butter is all right. 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.809
 And justice 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:20.199
 Cover it up, this is what we need to do. Ensure its airtightness 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.800
 That's all we need to do, just put it in the fridge, when you use it, whatever you want 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.440
 How simple it is, it is a kind of butter 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.229
 Just remember, if you want to use it, don't use water right away. 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.659
 But if you want to store it in a refrigerator for a week or so 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.629
 Then use ice water 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.120
