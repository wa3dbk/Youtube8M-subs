00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
sucker back in so here is the OEM light

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.560 
sucker back in so here is the OEM light
here<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.199> obviously<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.430> new<00:00:23.730> DRLs

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
here and obviously this is the new DRLs

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.259 
here and obviously this is the new DRLs
here<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.650> once<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.189> put<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.460> card<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.970> here

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
forth just to make sure I mean the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.690 
forth just to make sure I mean the
polarity<00:02:11.840> just<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.650> make<00:02:12.830> sure<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.460> have

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
once this is in it's extremely difficult

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.940 
once this is in it's extremely difficult
to<00:02:19.730> remove<00:02:20.120> I'm<00:02:20.300> sure<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.810> other<00:02:20.930> people<00:02:21.230> may

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
to remove I'm sure that other people may

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.130 
to remove I'm sure that other people may
have<00:02:21.980> different<00:02:22.700> stories<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.840> took<00:02:23.959> me

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
have different stories but it took me

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.070 
have different stories but it took me
almost<00:02:24.290> half<00:02:24.920> an<00:02:25.040> hour<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.660> gave<00:02:26.840> up

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
almost half an hour and I just gave up

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.860 
almost half an hour and I just gave up
but<00:02:27.470> fortunately<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.370> was<00:02:28.520> able<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.970> test<00:02:29.720> it

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
but fortunately I was able to test it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.110 
but fortunately I was able to test it
out<00:02:29.959> before<00:02:30.320> i<00:02:30.560> plug<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:30.920> back<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.910> that's

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
out before i plug it back in so that's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.410 
out before i plug it back in so that's
it<00:02:32.270> hope<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.050> guys<00:02:33.200> said<00:02:33.850> get<00:02:34.850> your<00:02:34.940> stunt<00:02:35.270> and
