here<00:04:04.780> we<00:04:05.620> stretched<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.160> roof<00:04:06.340> right<00:04:06.580> here<00:04:06.790> we

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
here we stretched a roof right here we

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.640 
here we stretched a roof right here we
cut<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.270> half<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.510> put<00:04:07.750> four<00:04:08.140> inches<00:04:08.380> in<00:04:08.440> it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
cut it in half and put four inches in it

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.460 
cut it in half and put four inches in it
right<00:04:08.770> here<00:04:09.070> most<00:04:09.790> even<00:04:10.150> Corvette<00:04:10.510> fanatics

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
right here most even Corvette fanatics

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.080 
right here most even Corvette fanatics
don't<00:04:11.680> even<00:04:11.890> notice<00:04:12.160> that<00:04:12.190> until<00:04:12.490> I<00:04:12.640> show<00:04:12.910> it

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
don't even notice that until I show it

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.240 
don't even notice that until I show it
here<00:04:13.750> we<00:04:13.960> put<00:04:14.170> two<00:04:14.410> inches<00:04:14.710> in<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.920> here<00:04:15.130> right

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
here we put two inches in it here right

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.490 
here we put two inches in it here right
above<00:04:15.490> the<00:04:15.550> axle<00:04:16.000> centerline<00:04:16.480> so<00:04:17.200> we've<00:04:17.350> got

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
above the axle centerline so we've got

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.060 
above the axle centerline so we've got
four<00:04:17.850> two<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.180> then<00:04:19.660> up<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:19.989> front<00:04:20.350> the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
four two and then up in the front the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.950 
four two and then up in the front the
front<00:04:21.370> fenders<00:04:21.970> are<00:04:22.120> lengthened<00:04:22.510> right<00:04:22.690> here

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
front fenders are lengthened right here

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.770 
front fenders are lengthened right here
six<00:04:23.380> inches<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.580> we've<00:04:25.090> got<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.300> total<00:04:25.570> of

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
six inches so we've got a total of

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.360 
six inches so we've got a total of
twelve<00:04:26.080> inches<00:04:26.320> in<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.560> car<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.920> I<00:04:27.010> think<00:04:27.250> if

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
twelve inches in the car and I think if

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.650 
twelve inches in the car and I think if
you<00:04:27.490> stand<00:04:27.730> back<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.060> look<00:04:28.150> at<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.360> car<00:04:28.540> it's

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
you stand back and look at the car it's

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.720 
you stand back and look at the car it's
really<00:04:28.990> hard<00:04:29.170> to<00:04:29.290> tell<00:04:29.560> then<00:04:30.130> it's<00:04:30.310> lengthened

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
really hard to tell then it's lengthened

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.490 
really hard to tell then it's lengthened
and<00:04:30.850> where<00:04:31.000> we<00:04:31.150> did<00:04:31.300> it<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:31.600> was<00:04:31.780> our<00:04:31.930> goal<00:04:32.230> it

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
and where we did it that was our goal it

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.920 
and where we did it that was our goal it
was<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.650> lot<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:32.890> work<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.160> do<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.550> way<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
was a lot of work to do it that way the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.220 
was a lot of work to do it that way the
front<00:04:35.170> of<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.410> car<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:35.890> absolutely<00:04:36.510> 100%<00:04:37.510> stop

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230
