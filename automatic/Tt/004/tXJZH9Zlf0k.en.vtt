00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
we can do saturation of two hundred

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.660 
we can do saturation of two hundred
percent<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.239> zero<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.649> point<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.399> want<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
percent or zero the point is we want to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.639 
percent or zero the point is we want to
see<00:00:44.820> exactly<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:45.629> affecting<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.559> you

excuse me a little bit right that goes
more<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.000> yellow<00:01:03.350> finally<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.500> six<00:01:04.860> or

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
more to the yellow finally about six or

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.980 
more to the yellow finally about six or
seven<00:01:06.320> saturation<00:01:09.080> down<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.619> same

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
seven saturation down about the same

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.710 
seven saturation down about the same
okay<00:01:12.990> let's<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.500> zoom<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:17.720> okay

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
okay let's really zoom in on this okay

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.710 
okay let's really zoom in on this okay
so<00:01:19.200> here's<00:01:19.619> our<00:01:19.830> before<00:01:21.049> yours<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.290> after

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
so here's our before yours are after

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.530 
so here's our before yours are after
much<00:01:24.720> better<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> problem<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.540> it's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
much better but the problem is it's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.390 
much better but the problem is it's
affecting<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> background<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> Reds

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
affecting the background to all the Reds

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.960 
affecting the background to all the Reds
in<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> background<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:30.600> also<00:01:30.990> yellow<00:01:31.970> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
in the background or now also yellow so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.990 
in the background or now also yellow so
what<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.390> do<00:01:34.159> take<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.310> mask<00:01:35.520> remember

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
what you can do take your mask remember

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.609 
what you can do take your mask remember
the<00:01:36.090> mask<00:01:36.329> white<00:01:36.750> means<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.290> showing

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the mask white means it's showing

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
the mask white means it's showing
through<00:01:37.950> black<00:01:38.340> means<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.119> showing

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
through black means it's not showing

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.249 
through black means it's not showing
through<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.119> fill<00:01:43.110> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
through so we can do is we can fill it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:54.260 
through so we can do is we can fill it
with<00:01:43.409> black<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.990> take<00:01:49.619> our<00:01:49.799> brush<00:01:53.000> make<00:01:54.000> our

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
with black and take our brush make our

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.499 
with black and take our brush make our
opacity<00:01:54.689> 100<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:56.520> paint<00:01:57.090> over<00:01:57.360> their

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
opacity 100 and then paint over their

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:07.700 
opacity 100 and then paint over their
faces<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:59.790> their<00:02:00.890> arms<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:05.640> way<00:02:06.710> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
faces and their arms this way the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.770 
faces and their arms this way the
background<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.520> affected<00:02:09.149> only

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.780 

the<00:02:15.780> areas<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.170> we've<00:02:16.440> painted<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.970> now<00:02:19.790> when

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the areas that we've painted so now when

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.010 
the areas that we've painted so now when
we<00:02:20.970> click<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.570> see<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> background

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
we click it you can see the background

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.490 
we click it you can see the background
is<00:02:22.320> unaffected<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:23.040> only<00:02:23.280> their<00:02:23.430> faces<00:02:24.500> and

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
is unaffected it's only their faces and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.770 
is unaffected it's only their faces and
that's<00:02:25.770> how<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.460> would<00:02:26.730> do<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.270> can<00:02:27.450> kind<00:02:27.720> of

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
that's how I would do it you can kind of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.470 
that's how I would do it you can kind of
adjust<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.290> opacity<00:02:29.060> dragging<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.180> down

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
adjust the opacity dragging this down

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.210 
adjust the opacity dragging this down
maybe<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.110> too<00:02:31.290> much<00:02:31.530> maybe<00:02:31.890> it's<00:02:32.100> not

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
maybe it's too much maybe it's not

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.660 
maybe it's too much maybe it's not
enough<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.000> go<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.310> select

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
enough you can go in and and select

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.160 
enough you can go in and and select
maybe<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> yellows<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.480> try<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:36.990> get<00:02:37.140> a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
maybe the yellows and try and get a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.950 
maybe the yellows and try and get a
little<00:02:37.350> bit<00:02:37.470> more<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:38.060> little<00:02:39.060> bit<00:02:39.270> closer<00:02:39.660> in

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
little bit more a little bit closer in

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.750 
little bit more a little bit closer in
there<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.410> yeah<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.590> would<00:02:40.890> say<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.340> too

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
there but yeah I would say this is too

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.810 
there but yeah I would say this is too
much<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.360> would<00:02:42.480> bring<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.780> down<00:02:42.960> to<00:02:43.140> about<00:02:43.820> 90

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
much I would bring it down to about 90
