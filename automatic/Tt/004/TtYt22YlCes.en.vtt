 Wladek let us enter 23-26 April, we drive from Krakow and further north, only then are the finals of 31 PAKI. The best Polish cabarets, in the best Krakow spots. 

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:22.397
 We will go in a week later, let them play, I like cabarets very much. 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.417
 Boss, there apparently ... there is also some .... 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:33.863
 Some stand-uper, apparently on Wosz-u and has the chance to enter the final ... 

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:37.468
 It's called Pacześ, it's supposed to be very funny ... 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.567
 They are: Kajtek, Józek, Kleks and Bogdan 

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:17.175
 I knew it would be so! I knew it would finally happen! 

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:24.115
 All these people..take God's comedians, nothing but fuck about sex, religion and politics! 

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.686
 No, no! Enough of that! 

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:35.526
 One sees Comedy Central and thinks that he will conquer the world! 

00:01:34.013 --> 00:01:39.813
 Nothing to do with the cabaret tradition, nothing only blasphemes, curses and offends! 

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:44.322
 My uncle was and said that you do not blaspheme at all. 

00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:46.087
 And I have your uncle somewhere, what Russian pipe is! 

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:49.585
 My uncle, he said, even the message is ... 

00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:54.083
 Your uncle has a wife with a mustache, and the 'message' last seen in the post office! 

00:01:54.127 --> 00:01:55.127
 I SAY NO! 

00:01:56.786 --> 00:02:04.786
 They will bring everything from this America, like some pumpkins, it's a stand-up! 

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:10.886
 People! To make the viewer laugh, you need to have props, costumes, or at least be able to sing! 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.790
 These are beaten hours of rehearsals, and when I hear an "open mic", the pelvis shoots! 

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:22.866
 First, they will confuse us with some points, and then they will make me gossip, like this stalemate Stalin! 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.910
 I bought the tickets a week ago ... I thought that he would get dressed up as a cloak-man and, as always, I would squat somewhere on the balcony .... 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.633
 No, I can not take it! I bought a pipe and socks in a spider-man. And he is leaving me with a stand-up! 

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:53.936
 At home, I was tipping carpets, I washed the aquarium, I even cleaned up the cupboard! 

00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:01.936
 I did everything to let Eva give me a day off. 

00:03:00.031 --> 00:03:03.731
 You had to put him on the preliminaries! 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.933
 Stop it, it may not be released ... 

00:03:14.836 --> 00:03:18.636
 It hurts because I used to go on stand-up open mic ... 

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:23.261
 They said: "... you can check your Adi material here ..." 

00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:30.028
 I wrote all night ... about you ... 

00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:32.861
 About everything... 

00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:49.937
 They told me: "... Adi, you can not be so tense, you have to relax and start thinking with panache, more ideas and abstraction, that I look stupid as I stand with this hand" 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.813
 I went into politics ...
