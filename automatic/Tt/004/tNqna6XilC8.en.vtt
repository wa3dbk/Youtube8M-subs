we chose it spell first and foremost

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.810 
we chose it spell first and foremost
because<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> amount<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> patterns<00:01:05.670> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
because of the amount of patterns you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.060

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.870 
protection industry was really
installing<00:01:12.930> kits<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> bulk<00:01:13.890> work<00:01:14.130> we

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
installing kits not the bulk work we

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.039 
installing kits not the bulk work we
like<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> fact<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.630> kept<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
like the fact that it kept the the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.770 
like the fact that it kept the the
knives<00:01:16.439> off<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> car<00:01:17.040> obviously<00:01:18.000> made<00:01:18.360> us<00:01:18.509> far

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
knives off the car obviously made us far
