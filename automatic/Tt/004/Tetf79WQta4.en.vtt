00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
others were largely variations on those

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.410 
others were largely variations on those
twenty-four<00:02:00.930> core<00:02:01.229> movements<00:02:02.149> some<00:02:03.149> people

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
twenty-four core movements some people

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.120 
twenty-four core movements some people
will<00:02:03.570> say<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.110> are<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.350> only<00:02:04.469> 24

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
will say that there are really only 24

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.100 
will say that there are really only 24
things<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> body<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.299> there<00:02:06.990> are

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
things that the body can do there are

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.630 
things that the body can do there are
variations<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:08.099> them<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.459> they're

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
variations on them but they're

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.160 
variations on them but they're
essentially<00:02:09.300> twenty-four<00:02:10.170> basic<00:02:10.560> movements

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
essentially twenty-four basic movements

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.530 
essentially twenty-four basic movements
so<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.950> 24<00:02:12.310> form<00:02:12.550> became<00:02:12.790> extremely<00:02:13.150> popular

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
so the 24 form became extremely popular

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.160 
so the 24 form became extremely popular
and<00:02:14.020> enabled<00:02:14.470> Taiji<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.819> spread<00:02:16.480> around<00:02:16.840> the

8 to 12 weeks it was still a little
complicated<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:26.110> some<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.920> even<00:02:27.160> more

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
complicated for some so that even more

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.490 
complicated for some so that even more
