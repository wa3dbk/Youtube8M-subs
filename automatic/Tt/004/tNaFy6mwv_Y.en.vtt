00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
is actually gonna be pretty tough but

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.710 
is actually gonna be pretty tough but
let's<00:03:54.140> look<00:03:54.709> at<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:55.040> there's<00:03:56.000> no<00:03:56.120> programming

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
let's look at it there's no programming

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.440

issues<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.200> i've<00:03:57.290> come<00:03:57.470> across

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
issues that i've come across

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.860 
issues that i've come across
however<00:03:59.500> it's<00:04:00.500> been<00:04:00.739> done<00:04:00.950> before<00:04:01.340> and

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
however it's been done before and

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.090 
however it's been done before and
there's<00:04:02.870> nothing<00:04:03.140> special<00:04:03.350> about<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:03.890> one

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
there's nothing special about this one

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.060
