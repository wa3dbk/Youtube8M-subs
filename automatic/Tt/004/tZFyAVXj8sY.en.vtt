00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.010
 in front of the national park in bogotá today 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.990
 there works a university that 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.880
 first asked for license to reform the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.009
 building and how he was denied his 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.660
 pretension did the works saying that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.170
 it was just repairs 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.730
 locatives how about this the residents 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.470

 the university university of colombia 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.170
 they say that the tranquility of which 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.490
 they enjoyed in their apartments they saw 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.560
 interrupted at the end of last year 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.539
 since the end of October and we observed 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 us who started doing here I'm going 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 to raise walls as soon as 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.390
 started the construction the building put the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.890
 complaint she ensures that since 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.890
 they started the works their privacy is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.160
 ended up I filed a complaint for disturbance 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.780
 to the position because permanently I 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.090
 I have the workers here and I've had 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.550
 several incidents they with only 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.840
 take a step are in my terrace 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.680
 the university that is a property 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.629
 cataloged as heritage 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.550
 architectural and protected as a good 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.350
 cultural is property is congressman 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.699
 Carlos Moreno declared the institution 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.380
 responded in writing that it was about 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.630
 some minor works 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.060
 since he had requested a permit 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.840
 for locative repairs in the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.730
 district heritage institute 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
 there is evidence that the 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.910
 Moreno University declared requested 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.980
 the process for the improvements really 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.320
 they came to ask 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.760
 minor adjustments but something else 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.960
 think the authorities after having 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 seen these images recorded by 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.410
 news one from the neighboring building to 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.450
 backyard of the university the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.060
 truth is that this is not a minor work 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.160
 this alters the volumetry of the good 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.800
 cultural is evident not by the images 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.630
 for the images it would seem to be that 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.280
 they are clothing repairs the parties is not 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.770
 deal but amount is a building 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.120
 again they are two buildings in the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.600
 patio of the house 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.450
 damaging here are three stories and if it's a 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.190
 quite large area completely damaging 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.110
 the architectural and urban landscape 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.700
 In the local mayor's office, the process began 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.230
 to establish if the university had 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.140
 everything in order to advance this class 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.900
 of works based on that initial visit 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.360
 a seal was made a seal was sealed the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.370
 work 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.350
 in a preventive way but to the few 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.940
 days the works continued and the mayor's office 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.530
 could not enter to verify again 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.400
 the estate as it had gone into cessation of 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.229
 activities 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.870
 the person who was left who was a 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.420
 The warder did not have the order to let 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.240
 to nobody the part of works of the mayor's office 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.100
 santafé de bogotá says that is that the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.590
 sir he has not let them in that the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.750
 sir is not in bogotá that could not 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.400
 attending in Bogota did not find it in the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.930
 university and the best style of tan 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.500
 of expensive greeting to the journalistic team of 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.500
 news one 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.900
 d 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.230
 the coach chose not to speak in 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.230
 camera 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.069
 the works obey the repairs 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.069
 minor locatives 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.690
 I have him 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.770
 but in the preparation of the region it is 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.770
 impossible 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.340
 the director of university welfare 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.750
 ensures that the works are necessary I 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.819
 it was a requirement of other 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.380
 district authorities took those 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.380
 decisions to make some repairs 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.220
 locative required by the secretariat of 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.810
 health as are mandatory 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.000
 repairs that were made on roof in 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.010
 cultural heritage stairs insists on 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.680
 that the work is illegal they gave up 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.690
 of a procedure that they brought and built 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.360
 the work illegally because they have to 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.860
 Stick to the consequences we have to 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.840
 end of the month an appointment with the mayor's office 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.549
 that has been putting all of us 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.160
 obstacles and for having in some 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.480
 moment and here we are waiting for you and 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.700
 We are the requirement, we are going to 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.380
 meet at the end of the month to carry all 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.390
 the respective documentation that 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.620
 We are doing things legally 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.480
 university says that the only thing 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.310
 they want is to improve their education is for 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.680
 giving education to the most needy is 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.140
 a social project great god and ximo well 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.230
 that I wish the private universities or 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.500
 universities of another category to the 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.690
 our at some point they could take out 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.640
 some time and come visit us to see what 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.930
 is what we are doing with whom 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.620
 says let's play 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.419
 let us play what we are doing 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.919
 but heritage on the contrary thinks 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.419
 that the works are doing poorly 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.210
 this work has to stop 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.820
 there must be fines immediately 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.760
 police actions because they are 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.010
 infringing urban codes and 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.500
 patrimonial codes is affecting us 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.449
 structurally the noise the invasion the 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.160
 invasion that we have structurally 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.650
 because they are hitting against 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.780
 walls is totally forbidden to paste 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.669
 a work against the walls of this 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.990
 building while local mayoralty that is 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.729
 the highest authority resolves whether the 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.199
 works continue or not selected 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.610
 will continue to insist on his famous phrase 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.500
 campaign let the tan play 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.939
 Well of course you can play the tan 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.330
 but with the rules that apply to 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.330
 everyone
