00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
to the act that teleporter color that of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.290 
to the act that teleporter color that of
the<00:00:52.739> stone<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.070> actually<00:00:53.399> picks<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.789> since<00:00:54.239> I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the stone you actually picks so since I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.459 
the stone you actually picks so since I
picked<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> yellow<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.320> go

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
picked the yellow one I'm going to go

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.020 
picked the yellow one I'm going to go
onto<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.039> yellow<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.850> use

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
onto the yellow one and I'm going to use

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.939 
onto the yellow one and I'm going to use
a<00:00:57.149> teleporter<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.620> thought<00:00:58.649> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
a teleporter and here we thought that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.380 
a teleporter and here we thought that
would<00:00:59.070> actually<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.550> teleport<00:00:59.940> us<00:01:00.000> back<00:01:00.210> but

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
would actually just teleport us back but

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.670 
would actually just teleport us back but
no<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.020> rebuild<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
no it's just going to rebuild the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.729 
no it's just going to rebuild the
teleporter<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.690> it<00:01:03.690> did<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> first<00:01:04.049> time<00:01:04.350> once

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
teleporter as it did the first time once

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.100 
teleporter as it did the first time once
we<00:01:04.830> arrived<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.400> Agatha<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.390> leaving<00:01:06.720> agartha

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
we arrived to Agatha so leaving agartha

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.359 
we arrived to Agatha so leaving agartha
will<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> same<00:01:07.619> it'll<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.070> build<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
will be the same it'll just build a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.760 
will be the same it'll just build a
teleporter<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.810> kind<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.110> fell<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.500> here

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
teleporter and I kind of fell right here

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
teleporter and I kind of fell right here
when<00:01:11.040> trying<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.549> leave<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.240> don't<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:12.810> fun

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
of me much and once we get back to the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.350 
of me much and once we get back to the
map<00:01:16.229> origins<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.100> leave<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> garter<00:01:17.850> you

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
map origins and we leave a garter you

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.850 
map origins and we leave a garter you
can<00:01:18.509> actually<00:01:18.659> pick<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> record<00:01:19.650> player

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860

and<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.310> take<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> another<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and you can take it to another of the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.359 
and you can take it to another of the
four<00:01:21.960> spots<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> different
