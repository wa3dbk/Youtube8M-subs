all people with proper trial tips we

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.039 
all people with proper trial tips we
drew<00:00:05.250> up<00:00:05.279> with<00:00:05.460> Roald<00:00:05.700> Dahl<00:00:05.910> books<00:00:06.150> recently

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
Dahl's molding recipes and so we thought

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.789 
Dahl's molding recipes and so we thought
we'd<00:00:11.400> bake<00:00:11.610> something<00:00:11.880> specifically<00:00:12.799> Bruce

cake pan we just bought two 50 cent ones
at<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.739> super<00:00:54.190> food<00:00:54.309> town<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.879> so<00:00:55.120> we<00:00:55.809> double

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
at a super food town and so we double

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.020 
at a super food town and so we double
layer<00:00:56.470> those<00:00:56.650> together<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.160> then<00:00:57.550> we<00:00:57.760> curled

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
layer those together and then we curled

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.610 
layer those together and then we curled
up<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.239> edges<00:00:58.540> of<00:00:58.630> the<00:00:58.720> inside<00:00:58.989> one<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.380> get<00:00:59.500> it

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
up the edges of the inside one to get it

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.030 
up the edges of the inside one to get it
higher<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.480> you<00:01:01.540> take<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.620> cake<00:01:02.800> pan<00:01:03.010> and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
higher and so you take the cake pan and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.710 
higher and so you take the cake pan and
then<00:01:03.370> line<00:01:03.610> it<00:01:03.640> with<00:01:03.880> wax<00:01:04.000> paper<00:01:04.300> and<00:01:04.540> grease

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
then line it with wax paper and grease

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.499 
then line it with wax paper and grease
that<00:01:04.899> up<00:01:05.020> but<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.560> oven<00:01:05.890> preheat<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.880> 350

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
that up but the oven preheat to 350

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.020 
that up but the oven preheat to 350
degrees<00:01:08.160> then<00:01:09.160> you<00:01:09.220> throw<00:01:09.399> 8<00:01:09.610> ounces<00:01:09.910> of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
degrees then you throw 8 ounces of

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.060 
degrees then you throw 8 ounces of
semi-sweet<00:01:10.210> chocolate<00:01:10.750> into<00:01:11.200> saucepan<00:01:11.680> and

semi-sweet chocolate into saucepan and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.650 
semi-sweet chocolate into saucepan and
put<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.520> inside<00:01:12.640> another<00:01:12.880> saucepan<00:01:13.390> with

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
put it inside another saucepan with

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.960 
put it inside another saucepan with
water<00:01:13.720> Innes<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.350> melt<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.310> with<00:01:15.550> indirect

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
water Innes and melt that with indirect

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.840 
water Innes and melt that with indirect
heat<00:01:16.860> yes<00:01:17.860> so<00:01:18.009> we're<00:01:18.130> getting<00:01:18.250> all<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.700> major

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
and it looks delicious and then you have

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.870 
and it looks delicious and then you have
to<00:02:03.710> whisk<00:02:03.890> or<00:02:04.070> beat<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.340> egg<00:02:04.460> whites<00:02:04.670> until

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
they get stiff so this is by far the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.140 
they get stiff so this is by far the
worst<00:02:08.479> electric<00:02:08.960> mixer<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.710> all<00:02:10.220> time<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.910> cost

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
about either four or five dollars it is

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:31.350 
about either four or five dollars it is
the<00:02:14.480> worst<00:02:14.920> observe
