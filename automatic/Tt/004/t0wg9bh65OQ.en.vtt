00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it was just a brain stem you know I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.340 
it was just a brain stem you know I
think<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.240> game<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.510> here<00:01:42.660> as<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.900> had<00:01:43.050> it<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
then I made the probably the worst was

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.300 
then I made the probably the worst was
taking<00:01:47.730> my<00:01:47.820> regular<00:01:48.180> curry
