way that I decided to arrange this this
tune<00:03:44.709> as<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.520> know<00:03:45.640> Canon<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.180> D<00:03:46.300> is<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:46.750> the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
tune as you know Canon and D is in the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.810 
tune as you know Canon and D is in the
key<00:03:46.990> of<00:03:47.020> D<00:03:47.500> D<00:03:48.340> major<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.900> decided<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.820> change

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
key of D D major and I decided to change

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.670 
key of D D major and I decided to change
a<00:03:51.910> few<00:03:52.060> things<00:03:52.120> in<00:03:52.540> there<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.900> incorporate<00:03:53.530> a

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
a few things in there and incorporate a

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.750 
a few things in there and incorporate a
different<00:03:54.300> key<00:03:55.300> in<00:03:56.140> here<00:03:56.350> most<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.520> is

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
different key in here most of it is is

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.550 
different key in here most of it is is
written<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.270> key<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.450> D<00:03:58.570> major<00:03:58.810> but

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
written in the key of D major but

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.840 
written in the key of D major but
there's<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.770> little<00:04:00.010> twist<00:04:00.160> we're<00:04:00.670> going<00:04:00.790> to

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
there's a little twist we're going to

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.900 
there's a little twist we're going to
use<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.180> key<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.450> D<00:04:01.660> minor<00:04:01.930> on<00:04:02.830> one<00:04:03.250> chord<00:04:03.610> only

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
use the key of D minor on one chord only

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.340 
use the key of D minor on one chord only
and<00:04:04.060> that's<00:04:04.209> maybe<00:04:04.540> what<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.900> heard<00:04:05.140> at<00:04:05.320> some

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
and that's maybe what you heard at some

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.560 
and that's maybe what you heard at some
point<00:04:05.800> you<00:04:06.580> know<00:04:06.700> when<00:04:06.880> I<00:04:06.910> was<00:04:07.090> playing<00:04:07.390> the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
point you know when I was playing the

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.100 
point you know when I was playing the
the<00:04:08.110> opening<00:04:12.390> here's<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.450> little<00:04:13.720> twist<00:04:13.989> here

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
the opening here's a little twist here

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.920 
the opening here's a little twist here
that<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.769> original<00:04:15.610> original<00:04:15.880> tune<00:04:16.359> is

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.260 

this<00:04:20.930> scale<00:04:21.709> right<00:04:21.859> there<00:04:22.810> which<00:04:23.810> is<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:26.090> key

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
this scale right there which is the key

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.260 
this scale right there which is the key
of<00:04:26.360> D<00:04:26.480> major<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:27.130> twisted<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.280> little<00:04:28.460> bit

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.520 

that's<00:04:32.270> where<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.660> key<00:04:32.870> change<00:04:33.200> is<00:04:33.350> happening

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
that's where the key change is happening

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.650 
that's where the key change is happening
most<00:04:33.980> of<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.250> is<00:04:34.340> in<00:04:34.460> D<00:04:34.580> major<00:04:34.730> in<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.240> little

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
most of it is in D major in that little

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.830 
most of it is in D major in that little
twist<00:04:36.290> there<00:04:36.410> isn't<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:36.950> key<00:04:37.100> of<00:04:37.220> D<00:04:37.430> minor<00:04:37.840> so

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
twist there isn't a key of D minor so

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.110 
twist there isn't a key of D minor so
let's<00:04:39.770> talk<00:04:39.919> a<00:04:39.980> little<00:04:40.220> bit<00:04:40.370> about<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.700> chords

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
let's talk a little bit about the chords

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.300 
let's talk a little bit about the chords
that<00:04:41.240> are<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.690> are<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:42.110> are<00:04:42.800> underneath

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310

we're<00:05:10.910> going<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.120> use<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.270> G<00:05:12.229> minor<00:05:13.210> chord<00:05:14.210> with

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
we're going to use a G minor chord with

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.080 
we're going to use a G minor chord with
a<00:05:14.450> D<00:05:14.720> on<00:05:14.840> bass

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.330 

opens<00:05:18.900> things<00:05:19.050> up<00:05:19.260> a<00:05:19.380> little<00:05:19.500> bit<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.310> can

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
opens things up a little bit and you can

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.980 
opens things up a little bit and you can
really<00:05:20.580> hear<00:05:20.850> that<00:05:20.910> there<00:05:21.240> is<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.420> change<00:05:21.810> of

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
really hear that there is a change of

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.120 
really hear that there is a change of
keys<00:05:22.230> there<00:05:24.470> you<00:05:25.470> can<00:05:25.590> hear<00:05:25.770> that<00:05:25.890> something

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
keys there you can hear that something

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.270 
keys there you can hear that something
is<00:05:26.310> happening<00:05:26.820> there<00:05:27.620> because<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:28.800> G<00:05:28.860> minor

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
is happening there because that G minor

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.990 
is happening there because that G minor
is<00:05:29.780> borrowed<00:05:30.780> from<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:31.050> key<00:05:31.290> of<00:05:31.410> G<00:05:31.620> minor

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
is borrowed from the key of G minor

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.940 
is borrowed from the key of G minor
we're<00:05:33.000> going<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.180> talk<00:05:33.360> more<00:05:33.950> specifically

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
we're going to talk more specifically

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.830 
we're going to talk more specifically
about<00:05:35.250> these<00:05:35.400> two<00:05:35.700> different<00:05:36.060> T's<00:05:36.270> but<00:05:36.570> I<00:05:36.630> just

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
about these two different T's but I just

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.330 
about these two different T's but I just
wanted<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.170> point<00:05:37.380> that<00:05:37.500> out<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.770> second

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
wanted to point that out that second

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.090 
wanted to point that out that second
chord<00:05:38.580> there<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:38.970> then<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.740> following

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
chord there and then the following

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.880 
chord there and then the following
chords<00:05:41.550> from<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:41.910> theme<00:05:42.180> are<00:05:42.990> all<00:05:43.230> extracted

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
chords from the theme are all extracted

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.060 
chords from the theme are all extracted
from<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.790> common<00:05:45.120> key<00:05:45.270> of<00:05:45.480> D<00:05:45.750> major<00:05:45.920> so<00:05:46.920> let's

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
from the common key of D major so let's

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.560 
from the common key of D major so let's
go<00:05:47.220> through<00:05:47.430> these<00:05:47.610> chords<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:48.030> then<00:05:48.150> we'll

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
go through these chords and then we'll

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.620 
go through these chords and then we'll
go<00:05:48.720> more<00:05:48.870> into<00:05:49.020> detail<00:05:49.500> about<00:05:49.530> how<00:05:50.570> how<00:05:51.570> to

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
go more into detail about how how to

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.780 
go more into detail about how how to
play<00:05:51.870> them<00:05:52.140> and<00:05:52.380> and<00:05:52.590> why<00:05:52.890> they<00:05:53.310> work<00:05:53.520> so<00:05:53.760> well

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
play them and and why they work so well

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.890 
play them and and why they work so well
we're<00:05:54.600> starting<00:05:54.870> with<00:05:54.960> D<00:05:55.230> major<00:05:55.410> seven

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
we're starting with D major seven

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.000 
we're starting with D major seven
followed<00:05:57.900> by<00:05:58.050> G<00:05:58.320> minor<00:05:58.560> with<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:58.830> D<00:05:59.130> on<00:05:59.280> base<00:06:01.010> B

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.190 
a minor F sharp minor G and a major
all<00:06:18.890> of<00:06:19.250> these<00:06:19.340> chords<00:06:19.790> are<00:06:20.140> extracted<00:06:21.140> from

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
all of these chords are extracted from

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.000 
all of these chords are extracted from
the<00:06:21.350> key<00:06:21.500> of<00:06:21.590> D<00:06:21.710> major

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
the key of D major

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.860 
the key of D major
except<00:06:22.460> for<00:06:22.670> that<00:06:22.790> second<00:06:23.180> chord<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:23.480> G<00:06:23.510> minor

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
except for that second chord the G minor

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.440 
except for that second chord the G minor
with<00:06:24.080> a<00:06:24.110> D<00:06:24.320> on<00:06:24.410> bass<00:06:24.850> you<00:06:25.850> can<00:06:25.970> really<00:06:26.270> hear

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
with a D on bass you can really hear

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.760 
with a D on bass you can really hear
that<00:06:26.480> once<00:06:26.840> again<00:06:29.230> something<00:06:30.230> is<00:06:30.350> happening

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
that once again something is happening

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.100 
that once again something is happening
there<00:06:30.920> in<00:06:31.070> the<00:06:31.760> following<00:06:32.150> section<00:06:32.900> we're

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
there in the following section we're

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.140 
there in the following section we're
gonna<00:06:33.230> look<00:06:33.890> at<00:06:34.160> these<00:06:34.400> two<00:06:34.640> different<00:06:34.970> keys

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
gonna look at these two different keys

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.230 
gonna look at these two different keys
and<00:06:35.510> see<00:06:35.780> why<00:06:36.460> we<00:06:37.460> can<00:06:37.700> borrow<00:06:38.480> from<00:06:38.630> one<00:06:38.960> key

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
and see why we can borrow from one key

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.600 
and see why we can borrow from one key
into<00:06:41.240> the<00:06:41.270> other<00:06:41.680> making<00:06:42.680> what<00:06:43.280> is<00:06:43.370> called<00:06:43.550> a

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
into the other making what is called a

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.040 
into the other making what is called a
modulation<00:06:44.030> a<00:06:44.240> change<00:06:44.480> of<00:06:44.600> keys<00:06:44.810> so<00:06:44.960> we're

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
modulation a change of keys so we're

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.270 
modulation a change of keys so we're
going<00:06:45.140> to<00:06:45.230> check<00:06:45.410> that<00:06:45.440> out<00:06:45.620> in<00:06:45.860> the<00:06:45.980> following

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
going to check that out in the following

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.610 
going to check that out in the following
scene
