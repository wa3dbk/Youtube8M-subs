00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
than 15 reps is a bit like using a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.400 
than 15 reps is a bit like using a
dumbbell<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:28.160> do<00:00:28.429> cardio<00:00:28.699> because<00:00:29.509> if<00:00:30.170> you<00:00:30.289> go

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
dumbbell to do cardio because if you go

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.560 
dumbbell to do cardio because if you go
for<00:00:30.619> more<00:00:30.769> than<00:00:30.949> 15<00:00:31.339> reps<00:00:31.550> per<00:00:31.730> set<00:00:31.910> you<00:00:32.269> are

for more than 15 reps per set you are

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.950 
for more than 15 reps per set you are
training<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.250> urine<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.460> you<00:00:35.030> may<00:00:35.330> have<00:00:35.629> also

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
training and urine and you may have also

seen<00:00:36.350> all<00:00:36.710> these<00:00:36.920> flame<00:00:37.549> wars<00:00:37.879> about<00:00:38.449> this<00:00:38.720> rep

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
seen all these flame wars about this rep

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.250 
seen all these flame wars about this rep
ranges<00:00:39.589> where<00:00:40.280> people<00:00:40.940> insult<00:00:41.570> each<00:00:41.930> other

and whatever now right at the beginning

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.270 
and whatever now right at the beginning
of<00:00:50.089> this<00:00:50.210> video<00:00:50.390> two<00:00:51.140> things<00:00:51.500> about<00:00:51.830> these

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
of this video two things about these

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.299 
of this video two things about these
rules<00:00:52.549> number<00:00:53.479> one<00:00:53.839> these<00:00:54.589> routes<00:00:55.129> are

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
rules number one these routes are

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.740 
rules number one these routes are
correct<00:00:55.939> and<00:00:56.210> number<00:00:57.049> two<00:00:57.280> too<00:00:58.280> many<00:00:58.460> guys

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
correct and number two too many guys

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.600 
correct and number two too many guys
misunderstand<00:00:59.750> them<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.199> that's<00:01:00.739> why<00:01:01.159> there

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
misunderstand them and that's why there

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.600 
misunderstand them and that's why there
are<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:01.970> many<00:01:02.119> fighting<00:01:02.659> about<00:01:03.439> these<00:01:03.949> ideal

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
are so many fighting about these ideal

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.030 
are so many fighting about these ideal
rep<00:01:05.210> ranges

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.220 

now<00:01:11.520> let's<00:01:11.700> explain<00:01:12.060> why<00:01:12.390> these<00:01:12.450> rules<00:01:12.870> can<00:01:13.170> be

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
now let's explain why these rules can be

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.060 
now let's explain why these rules can be
correct<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.950> still<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.790> many<00:01:15.030> guys<00:01:15.830> get<00:01:16.830> into

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
correct and still so many guys get into

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
correct and still so many guys get into
discussions<00:01:17.700> about<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.150> being<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.660> correct

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
discussions about them being not correct

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.470 
discussions about them being not correct
let's<00:01:19.500> say<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.800> were<00:01:19.920> power<00:01:20.190> lifter<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:21.030> yes

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
let's say you were power lifter then yes

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.680 
let's say you were power lifter then yes
you<00:01:22.020> should<00:01:22.160> mostly<00:01:23.160> do<00:01:23.400> your<00:01:23.580> work<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
you should mostly do your work in the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.810 
you should mostly do your work in the
low<00:01:25.260> rep<00:01:25.530> range<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
low rep range because that really is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.260 
low rep range because that really is
ideal<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.900> your<00:01:28.350> goals<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.580> if<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.120> are

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
ideal for your goals and if you are

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
ideal for your goals and if you are
bodybuilders<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.140> yes<00:01:31.350> most<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.370> your<00:01:32.550> work

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
bodybuilders and yes most of your work

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.850 
bodybuilders and yes most of your work
should<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.330> in<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.750> 6<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.050> 12<00:01:34.290> rep<00:01:34.590> range

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
should be in the 6 to 12 rep range

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.240 
should be in the 6 to 12 rep range
because<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> ideal<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.660> more<00:01:37.530> size<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
because that is ideal for more size and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.620 
because that is ideal for more size and
definition<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.080> say<00:01:41.070> most<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:41.910> what<00:01:42.420> many

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
definition but I say most and what many

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.440 
definition but I say most and what many
guys<00:01:42.900> do<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.440> they<00:01:43.650> do<00:01:44.190> all<00:01:44.490> their<00:01:44.790> work<00:01:44.820> in

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
guys do is they do all their work in

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.990 
guys do is they do all their work in
their<00:01:46.020> target<00:01:46.590> rep<00:01:46.770> range<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> when<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.820> do

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
their target rep range and when you do

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.090 
their target rep range and when you do
something<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> time<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.530> working<00:01:49.830> out

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
something all the time in working out

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.640 
something all the time in working out
what<00:01:50.430> happens<00:01:50.730> as<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:51.180> body<00:01:51.420> gets<00:01:51.690> used<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
what happens as your body gets used to

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.380 
what happens as your body gets used to
it<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.250> when<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.580> used<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
it and when you get used to it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.040 
it and when you get used to it
you<00:01:55.320> stop<00:01:55.530> making<00:01:55.680> progress<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:56.790> Pluto<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
you stop making progress you Pluto and

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.320 
you stop making progress you Pluto and
to<00:01:58.500> prevent<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.190> from<00:01:59.250> happening<00:01:59.490> what<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
to prevent that from happening what you

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.460 
to prevent that from happening what you
should<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.900> you<00:02:01.620> do<00:02:01.830> 80%<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:03.030> your<00:02:03.720> work<00:02:03.930> in

should do is you do 80% of your work in

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.130 
should do is you do 80% of your work in
