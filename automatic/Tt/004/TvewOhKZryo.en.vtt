00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.110
 Marquis character 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.599
 lean 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.430
 the moored stock 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.020
 it is in pucela 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.360
 the monoculture google 6 more 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.360
 with taiwan 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.720
 what super mario 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.560
 hello everyone today I bring you a new 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.720
 video of the worst games for ps2 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.690
 well the game in question is' â€‹â€‹resident 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.520
 evil 'a survival 2 code veronica in 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.440
 view that this game does not have a 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.780
 story and just take the elements that 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.790
 appear in the code game veronica x 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.030
 I'll give a brief review of the saga 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.860
 survivor of 'resident evil' on the ps1 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.780
 there once was a game in the saga 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.420
 'resident evil' that was considered the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.490
 Resident evil 4 original was called 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.440
 'resident evil' survivor and it was nothing 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.540
 from the other world rather everything 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.390
 otherwise the game disappointed to own 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.149
 and strangers of the saga now capcom still 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.100
 with the survivor franchise but in ps2 and 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.950
 based on the characters and scenarios 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.899
 of resident evil code veronica x el 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.940
 result is being worse than the 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.610
 first title of the saga that disappointed 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.789
 to many although next to this game the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.710
 first survival is one of the best 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.990
 some south force 2 was originally a 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.690
 arcade game that used the technology of 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.250
 guns of light then was ported for 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.440
 the ps2 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.400
 well first things first we go with the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.230
 technical section by god the paragraph 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.970
 technical does not take advantage or the miserable 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.560
 amount of 1 percent of the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.270
 ability of the ps2 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.250
 the game presents modeling 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.140
 disappointing more than all the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.060
 enemies that disappear when killing them 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.770
 as if it were a game of nes in 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.500
 that the enemies disappeared that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.330
 pulling the only means of zenten are the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.100
 modeled and even that is not used because 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.050
 sometimes we see as our 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.600
 partner moves with more animation 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.580
 Robotic than the same robocop the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.590
 scenarios besides being short are 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.300
 done in an extremely flat way and 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.070
 They are very crappy without details and with 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.620
 elements that like zombies 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.239
 disappear that pulling the weapons are 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.280
 made in a horrible way barely 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.230
 distinguishes the gun the shots do not 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.180
 they illuminate the scenario that by the way 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.040
 use lights in real time and the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.020
 exteriors are full of fog to 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.840
 hide the large number of errors of 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.910
 sincerely horrible programming the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.760
 hands of the character leave quite 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.620
 wish the zombies are polygonal and what 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.350
 only thing that will scare you of them is to see 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.280
 his orthopedic animations in addition to 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.319
 that the game suffers 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.380
 slowdowns to million even more than 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.050
 robocop as music because it 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.050
 you expected the music of the whole game to be 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.880
 summarize with a reggaeton word a 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.830
 element that in the other games of the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.810
 saga were indisputable protagonists 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.640
 because of the ambience and tension that 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.590
 they gave the game they get in this 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.360
 shred the eardrums to the player a 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.310
 music that seems to be based on 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.170
 previous soundtracks but 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.050
 shattered and repeated to limits 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.360
 unsuspected do not set the least 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.280
 Well the truth is that a little scary 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.170
 continue but how bad they are and what 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.050
 they manage to put the nerves to the few 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.650
 minutes of game really is comparable 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.440
 to reggaeton the sound of the game we're going to 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.410
 case is a secret is comparable to the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.350
 rest of the technical sections mediocre 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.390
 to start all the weapons sound almost 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.970
 there does not seem to be any difference between 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.850
 a magnum and a beretta in the game do not 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.769
 there are voices only subtitles in English and 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.600
 besides that the sounds produced by 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.600
 the zombies can be anything 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.190
 less a scream or a lament now let's go 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.320
 with the gameplay 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.510
 if you still were not surprised with the 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.610
 analysis to the technical section then 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.410
 prepare to see the playable device 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.500
 that they guessed is just as crap 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.450
 the previous ones to start the game is 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.030
 Compatible with light gun for 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.070
 ps2 but this is just a stupid 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.650
 option since we play a lot better 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.720
 with control the game is distinguished 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.610
 simply because it's not like the rest 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.680
 of gun games in which we follow 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.290
 a predetermined path shooting 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.660
 objectives when you move the camera here 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.180
 not here we can move and explore the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.920
 scenarios this brings endless 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.320
 playable problems as it is very difficult 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.030
 shoot and move at once what is 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.590
 even worse is that the shots alone 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.630
 affect the central part of the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.850
 screen the shots towards the edges and 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.920
 corners are not managed effectively 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.050
 with which you will almost have to center 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.230
 ok the screen on each objective to 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.140
 to be able to shoot them the game modes are 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.360
 Two arcade mode and dungeon mode mode 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.220
 arcade would be the story mode but that 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.290
 the truth is that it has little history 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.480
 and adventure just pick up some items 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.580
 scattered around the scenes and that 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.150
 they also look perfectly because they are 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.010
 modeling 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.170
 in a strangely giant way and very 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.540
 striking as wanting to achieve that not 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.850
 have not a moment of inspection alone 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.040
 get to pick them up shoot and leave 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.380
 there are many areas that you have to achieve 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.420
 perform in a given time since 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.050
 If you do not succeed in that time, 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.360
 the ever fearsome nemesis wait before 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.730
 to get excited about the presence of this 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.380
 mythical character do not get excited about this 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.840
 nemesis makes the original cry 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.330
 we saw in the resident evil 3 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.290
 it's just filling when it appears 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.150
 it will be better to leave then if in a 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.010
 game that wants to call itself 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.530
 shooter the best option is to leave 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.530
 running instead of shooting them 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.570
 makes think that the game that occupies us 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.660
 just deserves the qualification that there is 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.490
 take it literally as it sounds horrible 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.410
 outdated graphics and control 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.420
 which is less difficult with the pack than with 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.030
 the gun that is very sad for a 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.100
 100% disappointing shooting game 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.710
 graphics of very low quality music and 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.110
 sounds of the same level good this game 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.210
 It notes that is purely commercial is 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.080
 at the height of mythical games like books 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.530
 and 3d 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.330
 superman 64 is really a pity that 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.580
 capcom released games from the saga of 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.740
 resident evil on ps2 that did not have the 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.900
 quality of the exclusives for game cube 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.840
 as the already very great 'resident 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.330
 evil 'remake good i say goodbye this has 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.240
 been the end of this video I hope that 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.680
 you liked it and thanks for watching 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.939
 remember if you do not buy it and go from 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.939
 he as soul that leads the devil
