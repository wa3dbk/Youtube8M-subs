00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.970
 everyone will 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.790
 today I came here to record a video of day 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.400
 Go to you and the theme. 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.230
 customizing men's t-shirts 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.270
 I'm here at the time shop invitation 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.040
 that a store specializing in 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.050
 marketing not only T-shirts 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.040
 band with the various t-shirts 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.930
 prints 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.640
 they also sell their shoes 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.119
 eyes at last sweatshirts 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.430
 but the great focus only the T-shirts and I 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.339
 I'm a big fan of men's t-shirt 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.370
 for the possibility of people doing 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:43.820
 a thousand things in her become singular 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.829
 unique to you and today, that I 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.140
 I'll give you three options for customizing 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.929
 men's t-shirt and I hope you 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.859
 Enjoy this one I'm using is a 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.899
 from them 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:58.100
 and if you want to see how I see 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.039
 I just kept watching you will 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.420
 need scissors to cut fabric and 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.089
 have to decorate that in my case with 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.800
 six pacs and security guards and of course the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.710
 our men's t-shirts 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.240
 I'll start by cutting the ball that what 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.030
 I like what I most like to do in 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.350
 all t-shirts for this I divide 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.719
 she's halfway down the brudden halfway and 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.719
 short around the ball this way 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:27.259
 bending it in the middle the cut will stay 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.000
 same will not get crooked that is the 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.090
 great danger we end up spoiling the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.460
 shirt is only to fold in the middle well 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.340
 straight and cut the ball with scissors 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.750
 for fabric 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.719
 now we are going to the second part of 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.729
 I will unfold t-shirt and 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.719
 I'll open the seam of it to start 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.219
 cut from shoulder seam 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.679
 involves all sewing and when it comes to 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.890
 where there is no stitching I go 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.340
 follow the same straight line by cutting until the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.340
 Last 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.240
 If I need the help I put a 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.490
 heavier box to keep the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.570
 straight fabric the cut is also retained 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.570
 ok and cut to the end 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.680
 an important part when it comes to 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.900
 finish is to remove the entire 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.070
 seam that appears when people 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.070
 opened the shirt 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.030
 now it's time to close our 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.510
 t-shirts I chose securities for 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.440
 do this I start starting from the collar 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.010
 and I'm applying security to and 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.709
 closing the cut that we made I go 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.660
 giving two finger space for each 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.770
 security to see 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.880
 uniformity 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.280
 I apply to the end and is thus is 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.730
 Of course I will repeat the same process in 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.730
 another band 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.040
 repeat the process with the side of the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.510
 I'm going to cut following 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:11.120
 and I will cut to the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.120
 almost like four fingers below the armpit 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.230
 to close I will also use 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.870
 but choose a size as well 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.819
 of the minutes that we used in the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.569
 Our order, I'll apply the same 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.610
 form 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.730
 I'll put a wheel and spacing of 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.409
 two fingers and putting it all the way to 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.420
 close the whole side of our shirt 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:36.329
 ok the end result of our shirt 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.739
 I thought it was the second model of 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:43.739
 shirt collar the same way leftovers 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.040
 medium and cut following the format of the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.659
 little ball 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.170
 now I'll cut the sleeves of my 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.239
 I'm going to leave her double in the 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.579
 I'll put the feet on the side 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.579
 I'll leave the tissue nearby. 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.470
 measure how much I want to take and I do not 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.569
 I like to take my whole hand but that's 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.060
 matter of taste you can take and do 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.370
 The regatÃ£o and will cut diagonally 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.370
 toward the side seam of the shirt 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.099
 seam 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.810
 and if I feel the need I want 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.879
 open a little bit more just follow the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.389
 own lateral culture and open a little 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.389
 more her 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.630
 now I'll make a detail in my 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.320
 shirt putting spex on that line in the 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.300
 shoulder 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.130
 It's very easy, I'll get a knife and I'll go. 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.290
 make a punch on the shirt 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.900
 You'll see that it does not work 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.850
 It's super easy and as soon as you 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.580
 I'll get our spike 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.080
 put the back of it and even find 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.470
 the little feet you'll see he's going 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.450
 stand firm or put the team of the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.190
 way you find more creative. 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.380
 cool and this is the result of our 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.480
 according to the shirt for our third 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.250
 shirt I want to cut the ball out of shape 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.320
 different in v 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.410
 for this I will do the same technique 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.210
 but I'm going to cut it straight and not 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.640
 following the shape of the original collar 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.720
 so it'll make a ball look good 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.850
 cool 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.400
 in the second part of our customization 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.020
 I 'll keep the gold shirt on 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.240
 half because then everything I do 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.700
 will look exactly the same in both 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.190
 sides and I'll make parallel cuts in 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.630
 all the side entrance of the shirt I 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.940
 I'll mark more or less four fingers. 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.040
 under the armpit and I will make cuts with 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.320
 spacing of two fingers each 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.760
 you can make minor major cuts 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.430
 according to your taste 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.290
 I will do this until the end and this is the 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.600
 result of our shirt you can 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.310
 access the blog to see before and 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.470
 then and now, just let go of your 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.690
 creativity to produce their 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.080
 I hope you have enjoyed a kiss and even 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.080
 the next
