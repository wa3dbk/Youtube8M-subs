00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello today we are going to learn to put or to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.950
 remove what are being fringes 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.790
 black ones that come out to the sides 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.130
 of our games mainly in the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.910
 counter strike global offensive is for 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.350
 this video that I do 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:28.009
 this on video cards or chipsets 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.780
 integrated to you if it is a chipset 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.320
 integrated is going to be from md obviously 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.380
 okay 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
 First 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 to know 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.310
 what I mean is the relationship of 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.940
 aspect that is to say for people who 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.149
 we have panoramic monitors 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.090
 and that we have been playing for 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.070
 example context the global offensive is 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.199
 difficult to get used to a new 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.570
 resolution because it would have to be done 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.159
 changes in the configuration regarding 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.859
 the sensitivity of the mouse 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:12.609
 and good for this we do not need any 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:16.420
 software more than having updated 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:19.520
 our video driver 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.469
 what is the catalyst 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.479
 and good if you do not have it 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.670
 updated, I will recommend you 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.030
 update it to download it 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.649
 updated I'm going to leave this page 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.390
 this is for the integrated chipset if 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.909
 you have a video card like that 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.630
 it will surely come with the disk 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.140
 installation ok 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.289
 and well now they're just going to give 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.920
 who download link will open the 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.920
 program 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.620
 how good this application 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.050
 what it helps us to do is to download 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.780
 our correct driver if you already 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.100
 you have and you know what it is or you already have it 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.710
 update you do not need to do 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.690
 this but good happens here in download 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.890
 now and then the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.130
 installation assistant 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.630
 it is installed like any other program 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.720
 will surely ask you to restart your 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.020
 computer so good once done 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.100
 this since you have updated your driver 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.170
 Of video 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.450
 let's proceed to put or remove what 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.540
 that we know as the black bands that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.810
 it's really in the aspect ratio 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.230
 ok first we have to if you do not know to 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.600
 What do you mean, I'm going to give you 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.800
 an example that is the aspect ratio 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.800
 so now I go back 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.189
 do not 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.660
 two 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:22.310
 ok once done this let's continue 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.310
 now yes first of all if you have 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.130
 a widescreen monitor and you have a 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.200
 integrated chipset to you 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.500
 The first thing we have to do is go to 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.100
 screen resolution and being here 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.260
 let's put it as low as possible or 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.740
 in one of the last three resolutions 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.770
 lower please because if not no 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.190
 You can do what is being this 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.370
 so well I'm going to apply and come back in 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.280
 the moments 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.280
 good once the changes have been applied 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.280
 let's open the catalyst 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.370
 Yes now 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.209
 When you open your catalyst, you will see it 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.920
 so that's what we're going to do to 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.110
 do it in a simpler way and that 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.260
 do not miss me 11 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.190
 advanced view preferences when I did 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:23.630
 my gea screens here on this scale 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:28.689
 of image and you will have disabled 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:33.039
 this option is going to be here and here 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:35.139
 ok well come on I'll give you a apply 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.469
 and you will notice the change that will happen 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.469
 this 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.500
 As you can see, the screen stretched 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.400
 whole ok then what are we going to 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.050
 perform on activate gpu scales 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.360
 we apply 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.539
 and now if they are going to unblock these 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.979
 options we are going to keep relation of 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.979
 aspect we apply 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:07.699
 good and now we can close this 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:11.160
 we go to screen resolution and we can 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:14.280
 return to our original resolution 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.860
 so well I'm going to apply and now 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.460
 I come back 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.160
 and good once the changes have been applied 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:26.290
 you can open your counter strike 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.290
 the accounts that no longer 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.830
 we have what they are 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.020
 for the stretched screen 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.220
 and now the aspect ratio 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.000
 It is the correct one 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.860
 let's wait for it to load and it will look a little 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.500
 slow since I'm recording with 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.280
 qantas already and it is a program in which 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.000
 he obviously does not record video games 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.070
 okay 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.020
 good as you can see is opening not 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.320
 I know if you can see the stripes 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.320
 black 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.250
 and good 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:11.390
 that's the aspect ratio and good if 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:15.770
 you on the contrary you love 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:19.380
 then return to the stretched screen 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:23.520
 you will have to do the opposite 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:27.180
 you will lower your resolution again you will give in 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.060
 activate gpu you will put in stretch all the 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.280
 you apply it and then you can 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.070
 remove it from the gpu or leave it does not matter 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.190
 well this would be everything I hope has you 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.950
 liked this video if you liked give me 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:45.020
 like and subscribe to my channel and good 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.020
 we are watching in a next video
