00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 people ans program is as always here 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.529
 welcome especially in the third and last 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.639
 group game just a lot of fun cup in the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.780
 So far we have two matches 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.250
 you could say something lucky 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.019
 in the first match a bit and in the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.639
 second match a bit more on 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.320
 each case the first match with 3 to 1 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.720
 won against the tv procedure and that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 I have a second match with 2 to 1 against 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.170
 blow fifa foreseen exactly on the team itself 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 I have not changed anything if it always 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.689
 should run like that again 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.740
 somebody does not like me then if 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.359
 Of course, I'll switch again 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.920
 during the game and people all the way 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.990
 important I am now almost in the last 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.489
 match in this group speak all 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.450
 others have already played and we 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.910
 already know results already 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.219
 that's how it looks right now you see 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.510
 it already people i am already through now 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.770
 I have to get a single point 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.059
 namely, as well as doctors in this group 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.800
 So always say people 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.719
 let us follow the point or if then 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.430
 even three and we have ours now 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.559
 last opponent timo my god vinco team 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.530
 of the season sanchez team of the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.829
 seasons award in form smalling in form 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.180
 loris also a hulk striker why not 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.710
 He then wishes us good luck 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.789
 for the last match already needed 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.519
 actually only a single point then 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.530
 we are group-first exactly the same 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.110
 very long ball on messi and the in 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.060
 the middle of GrieÃŸmann and the worries 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.409
 for a god for the first 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.420
 disappointment in playing yes he should 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.900
 actually to worry about 10 but he wanted 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.900
 probably not like that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:30.810
 oh oh, if that's not terrific 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.969
 Absolutely beautiful pro template was it was 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.439
 over the entire playing field passed since 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.509
 came even more precisely wanted so 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.460
 Now, really, in the course of kries man 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.689
 Can make fit over 100 meters 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.340
 which really comes on you but 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.920
 almost two meters is of course too deep 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.229
 long in any case, we have the 1 0 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.569
 a really absolute grandiose suits 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.640
 and soon leaves continue to tevez 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.250
 hopefully fast enough and hamilton 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.229
 Regens had to be at 2 10 o'clock so 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.539
 fast it can go two long balls 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.590
 clapping forward and two once 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.869
 afterwards hit 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.099
 once, of course, in mac crisis will be 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.159
 once tablets but it is not yet 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.159
 past 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.269
 that was precise sting so completely 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.700
 good two single beds that unfortunately not 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.110
 without a go, we can do it somehow 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.430
 never in such a tournament is it still 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.349
 understandable that we are a goal 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.760
 but we get online as well 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.620
 even more goals as already mentioned 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.130
 Since then, this is the 0 gates 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.720
 have introduced problems yes 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.430
 understandable is indeed a hammer ball 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:42.930
 been 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:45.120
 messi messi and my god oh my god 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.430
 was that really happening? 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.370
 Messi was already by the warsaw he 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.230
 should be about so yes from 11 meters 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.230
 about to fight air 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.370
 otherwise there is such a big market 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.260
 Of course, I need a rocket for that 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.570
 once messi makes it big date right 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.940
 even biceps out house like we do 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.680
 Everyone knows the biceps are burning now 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.740
 This is understandable 3 3 2 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.440
 1 after his action with messi we have 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:22.710
 then really the big rocket rausgehauen 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.810
 and the biceps brandon lee kroos shot 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:33.650
 is blocked 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:33.650
 the bodyguard and viscom behind hayes 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:43.260
 what's up what does hamilton no 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.850
 God be ups ups ups step 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.650
 Loris is really good at it 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.360
 dresses and big rocket at this time 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.980
 by the way, the opponent short break 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.380
 pressed last as thought really 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.270
 also once again from harmful teterow 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.190
 pack it out really great 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.890
 rocket par excellence 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.510
 what it is now and for big 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.590
 instead ibrahimovic rows come 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.610
 Of course, not in the middle field 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.810
 but war man moves into midfield 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.760
 god before god 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.100
 waving header here is awesome 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.260
 absolutely ingenious the guy is hardly bigger 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.630
 As an ant , well, we get up 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.400
 every time this time moves into the right 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.919
 mittelfeld has played big and 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.280
 of course it moves to the right in the 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.280
 Storm 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.500
 and that's how fast it can be done 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.280
 33 it's a real torch now 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.470
 I can not believe it 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.520
 Hardly the nose is on the field 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.509
 We look at the nose 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.560
 In any case 3 3 at half-time from the 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.340
 sound balanced I had 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.530
 maybe a few more chances 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.840
 you would have had the one or the other 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.080
 others can still do because I have 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.080
 still time 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.669
 left one now, for example, is time 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.410
 to save another gate of course 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.580
 will Klinsmann have who else would I have 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.139
 Not this time I do not know what I am 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.910
 maybe heiko westermann should do that 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.260
 to put the storm but one is natural 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.919
 also a pretty good option 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.260
 there we have the goal in this game and 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.500
 yes it is we are only 45 minutes 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.550
 let's see how many still fall longer 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.550
 ball on the long nose 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.630
 no, it does not exist, it does not exist 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.139
 There is no doubt that it can be so tight 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.050
 build up 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:28.400
 but now said weeks of no evidential 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.789
 messi messi so good grabs the 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.680
 ball 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.780
 that's not what it's made of, it's there 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.010
 not we have so many opportunities and 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:42.620
 just do not use with the body 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.240
 face and nose with the 5 2 already eight 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.130
 Gates have fallen here already that is 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.560
 unbelievable that is really only one 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.470
 deeper with the combo braker par excellence 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.800
 double bodypaint absolutely deadly ins 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:58.599
 heads of the nose ibrahimovic at the 5 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.599
 3 and it's not over yet 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:11.520
 This is almost a big rocket and 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.740
 it 's just a hit 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.900
 at riis man is growing to the place 3 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.640
 there was his giovinco on the post that 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.930
 Of course, it's not so intoxicating now 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.030
 It's like taking to the post 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.730
 would provide as somehow less 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.040
 so ibrahimovic 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:29.990
 which makes the ba makes brought a 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.990
 body paint and children 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:37.650
 the nose also turns the fans it is the 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.720
 grad at ibrahimovic really a very 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:50.660
 Good substitution where we flew 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:56.250
 the daddy after henry makes messi 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:59.280
 bodypaint what a nice thing eight 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:03.780
 people eight to three degrees 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:07.170
 oh my god everyone can be off easy 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:10.260
 praised over there we have the 9 to 3 12 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.090
 gates in a game on the main opponent 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.950
 i am really sorry i try 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.750
 really every chance to use 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.630
 and if you're out of it I have to 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.220
 a few lupfen but every case 93 me 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.810
 strongly believe that you are the gate 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.880
 is the match will not please no 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.040
 please not there he apparently has property 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.990
 make it unnecessary between hold that 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.390
 Now what you have to see, you see 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.200
 I have redeemed against it 19 3 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.580
 won 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.230
 Let's see if it's still in this tournament 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.480
 will be a scorching game 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:39.510
 of course ibrahimovic with a new one 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.430
 eighth to score three goals from ebra three 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.340
 by grieÃŸmann 1 by messi 1 by tewes 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.600
 and once by great minions what now 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.680
 from this video if you like it 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.000
 did not forget then in any case 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.560

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.520

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.380
 in the ko phase 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.090
 even unbeaten so far so well 

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.770
 here you see again the table of 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.790
 my group now as a conclusion and 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.110
 you can of course like the 

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.550
 look at the description and look into the 

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.780
 Get a taste of other groups 

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.919
 So many thanks for watching

 and I forget the video with one 

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.430
 Then thumb up then rate 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.720
