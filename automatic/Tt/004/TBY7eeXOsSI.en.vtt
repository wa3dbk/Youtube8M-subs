00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Octopus salad with citrus fruits and fennel 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Welcome to Academia Barilla, I'm Mario Grazia 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 today we will prepare a tasty recipe together 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Octopus, citrus and fennel salad 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 The ingredients we need are 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 1 octopus of about 0.5 kg 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 1 onion, 1 carrot, a stalk of celery 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 1 fennel, 1 grapefruit, 1 orange, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 80g of black olives, salt, pepper 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 9cl of Ligurian extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 selected by Academia Barilla. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Let's start by boiling the octopus 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 with onion, carrot and celery, 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 in already salted water. We peel the onion, 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 and the carrot. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 So we wash the vegetables 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 and cut them into large pieces. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Let's put them in boiling water 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 to prepare the broth 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 add a little salt. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 After 5 minutes we can put the octopus 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 1, 2, 3 this is an old technique 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 of fishermen to give to the octopus 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 a nice shape and make it stay soft. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 The cooking time is about an hour 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 based on weight 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 I'd say 45 minutes to about an hour. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Meanwhile we can prepare the rest of the ingredients, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 let's start by cutting fennel 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 let's cut it as thin as possible 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 I recommend using a mandolin. Let's make 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 watch out for your fingers, don't cut us. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Put the fennel slices in cold water 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 to prevent them from becoming dark. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Now let's prepare the grapefruit and orange: 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 we remove the peel and cut them into slices. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 We cut the two ends and peel it, like this. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 We take away all the white, which is bitter, and we keep 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 only the pulp of the fruit, removing the membrane 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 white that exists between one slice and another. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 We squeeze to get the juice. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 We do the same with the orange 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 We will use to season this salad 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 citrus juice, salt, pepper and olive oil. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Now let's check the octopus, take a knife, 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 if it comes in easily it means it's ready. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 It is quite soft. We turn off the stove, 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 let's cover and let it cool. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 After 1 hour when the octopus is cold and ready 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 we can cut it into slices, this way 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 and is ready for our salad. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 If we want to give the recipe a personal touch 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 instead of cutting the octopus in this way 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 we can cut it this way 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 pass it quickly to the grill. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Now we can serve our salad. 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Drain the fennel, 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 let's put it on the plate 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 we add citrus fruits 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 black olives 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 and the octopus 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 finally the sauce. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Please let us add some 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 wild fennel on the plate, black pepper 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 and a few drops of extra virgin olive oil 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Ligurian Riviera. 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 I hope you enjoy this salad 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 I think fennel, octopus and citrus fruits 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 is a great combination. Enjoy your meal!
