that<00:02:13.090> got<00:02:13.300> flipped<00:02:14.110> but<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.560> inside<00:02:14.980> edges

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
that got flipped but the inside edges

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.640 
that got flipped but the inside edges
when<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.790> reach<00:02:15.970> behind<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.260> I'm<00:02:17.410> going

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
when you reach behind you and I'm going

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.260 
when you reach behind you and I'm going
to<00:02:17.830> be<00:02:18.040> careful<00:02:18.400> not<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.730> twist<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.090> just

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
to be careful not to twist I just

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.780 
to be careful not to twist I just
gathered<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.780> up<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.200> tuck<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.310> between<00:02:21.460> my

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
gathered that up and tuck it between my

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:32.040 
gathered that up and tuck it between my
legs<00:02:21.820> go<00:02:22.690> get<00:02:22.840> my<00:02:22.930> baby<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:31.480> I'm<00:02:31.690> going<00:02:32.020> to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
legs go get my baby so I'm going to

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.730 
legs go get my baby so I'm going to
lower<00:02:32.410> her<00:02:32.740> feet<00:02:33.700> inside<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.960> carry<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.620> I'm

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
lower her feet inside the carry and I'm

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.910 
lower her feet inside the carry and I'm
going<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.070> go<00:02:36.250> through<00:02:36.850> both<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.530> passes

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
going to go through both of the passes

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.630 
going to go through both of the passes
of<00:02:38.950> fabric<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:40.180> she's<00:02:40.360> going<00:02:40.720> through<00:02:41.640> both

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
of fabric so she's going through both

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.450 
of fabric so she's going through both
layers<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.450> stick<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> hand<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.410> from<00:02:45.160> underneath

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
layers I stick a hand in from underneath

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.420 
layers I stick a hand in from underneath
to<00:02:45.790> grab<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.360> instead<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.410> with<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.130> front

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
to grab that instead of with the front

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.070 
to grab that instead of with the front
cross<00:02:48.640> carrier<00:02:49.030> or<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.180> X<00:02:49.420> one<00:02:49.810> leg<00:02:50.050> goes

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
cross carrier or the X one leg goes

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.750 
cross carrier or the X one leg goes
through<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.800> side<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.340> other<00:02:51.370> leg<00:02:51.730> goes

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
through one side and the other leg goes

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.000 
through one side and the other leg goes
to<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> other<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.900> she'll<00:02:53.080> end<00:02:53.230> up<00:02:53.410> sitting<00:02:53.709> in

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
to the other so she'll end up sitting in

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.300 
to the other so she'll end up sitting in
this<00:02:54.310> almost<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.420> ring<00:02:56.350> sling<00:02:56.770> but<00:02:57.010> think

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
this almost like a ring sling but think

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.280 
this almost like a ring sling but think
of<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.520> as<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.670> double<00:02:58.120> layer<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.600> ring<00:02:58.810> sling<00:02:59.050> so

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
of it as a double layer of ring sling so

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.720 
of it as a double layer of ring sling so
ring<00:02:59.440> sling<00:02:59.620> going<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.010> way<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.580> link

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
ring sling going this way and a link

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.250 
ring sling going this way and a link
sling<00:03:00.910> going<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.330> way<00:03:01.510> that's<00:03:01.959> why<00:03:02.140> it's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
sling going this way that's why it's

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.400 
sling going this way that's why it's
called<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.530> double<00:03:02.650> hammock<00:03:03.010> she's<00:03:03.790> sitting<00:03:04.180> in

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
called a double hammock she's sitting in

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.590 
called a double hammock she's sitting in
rebozo<00:03:05.410> passes<00:03:06.070> or<00:03:06.280> hammock<00:03:06.580> passes<00:03:07.030> not

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
rebozo passes or hammock passes not

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.420 
rebozo passes or hammock passes not
cross<00:03:07.840> passes<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:12.040> know<00:03:12.070> very<00:03:12.370> carefully

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
cross passes you know very carefully

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:23.690 
cross passes you know very carefully
lower<00:03:15.430> her<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:20.700> being<00:03:21.700> careful<00:03:21.910> not<00:03:22.209> to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
lower her in being careful not to

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:38.089 
lower her in being careful not to
untwist<00:03:24.700> my<00:03:25.630> twists

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.319 

and<00:03:38.819> as<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.569> pull<00:03:39.870> up<00:03:40.549> we're<00:03:41.549> starting<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.180> the

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
and as I pull up we're starting with the

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.500 
and as I pull up we're starting with the
inside<00:03:43.319> pass<00:03:43.680> as<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.609> pull<00:03:44.819> up<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:45.060> fabric<00:03:45.420> I

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
inside pass as I pull up the fabric I

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.270 
inside pass as I pull up the fabric I
want<00:03:45.689> to<00:03:45.749> make<00:03:45.870> sure<00:03:46.019> not<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.319> untwist<00:03:46.859> it<00:03:47.099> so

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
want to make sure not to untwist it so

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.690 
want to make sure not to untwist it so
it<00:03:47.370> really<00:03:47.430> helps<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.329> have<00:03:48.749> a<00:03:48.810> carrier<00:03:49.700> that

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
it really helps to have a carrier that

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.940 
it really helps to have a carrier that
has<00:03:50.939> different<00:03:51.480> colored<00:03:51.870> edges<00:03:52.349> for<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:52.799> so

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
has different colored edges for this so

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.729 
has different colored edges for this so
there's<00:03:53.129> a<00:03:53.189> few<00:03:53.430> Rhapsody<00:03:54.030> stretches<00:03:54.989> that

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
there's a few Rhapsody stretches that

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.459 
there's a few Rhapsody stretches that
have<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.219> gradation<00:03:56.819> like<00:03:57.000> mine<00:03:57.269> does<00:03:57.540> where

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:58.469 
have that gradation like mine does where

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.319 
have that gradation like mine does where
they<00:03:58.650> have<00:03:58.859> one<00:03:59.189> color<00:03:59.459> on<00:03:59.549> one<00:03:59.790> edge<00:04:00.000> another

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
they have one color on one edge another

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.849 
they have one color on one edge another
color<00:04:00.689> on<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.989> other<00:04:01.019> so<00:04:01.349> you<00:04:01.439> can<00:04:01.469> really

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
color on the other so you can really

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.369 
color on the other so you can really
tell<00:04:02.069> which<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.879> grab<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:03.450> if<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.689> don't<00:04:04.049> have

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
tell which to grab but if you don't have

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.190 
tell which to grab but if you don't have
a<00:04:04.709> stretch<00:04:05.099> wrap<00:04:05.370> or<00:04:05.879> a<00:04:05.939> wrap<00:04:06.329> with<00:04:06.989> that

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
a stretch wrap or a wrap with that

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.289 
a stretch wrap or a wrap with that
gradation<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:08.129> just<00:04:08.340> kind<00:04:08.549> of<00:04:08.609> look<00:04:08.849> at<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
gradation you just kind of look at the

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.440 
gradation you just kind of look at the
cross<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:09.989> look<00:04:10.859> at<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.069> flip<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.579> you<00:04:11.609> make

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
cross and look at the flip and you make

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.099 
cross and look at the flip and you make
sure<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:13.109> follow<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:15.269> edge<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.689> fabric<00:04:16.079> that

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
sure to follow the edge of fabric that

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.259 
sure to follow the edge of fabric that
you<00:04:16.320> flipped<00:04:16.680> out<00:04:16.889> toward<00:04:17.340> your<00:04:17.489> shoulder<00:04:17.519> if

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
you flipped out toward your shoulder if

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.039 
you flipped out toward your shoulder if
you<00:04:18.329> just<00:04:18.630> follow<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:20.509> you'll<00:04:21.509> grab<00:04:21.780> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
you just follow that in you'll grab the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.740 
you just follow that in you'll grab the
right<00:04:22.229> piece<00:04:22.470> of<00:04:22.650> fabric<00:04:23.310> again<00:04:24.120> since<00:04:24.449> my

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
right piece of fabric again since my

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.749 
right piece of fabric again since my
wrap<00:04:25.080> has<00:04:25.470> those<00:04:25.889> different<00:04:26.250> colors<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.699> can

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
wrap has those different colors I can

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.779 
wrap has those different colors I can
look<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.180> say<00:04:27.389> okay<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:29.340> edge<00:04:29.520> I'm

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
look and say okay so the edge I'm

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.850 
look and say okay so the edge I'm
looking<00:04:30.120> forward<00:04:30.389> to<00:04:30.449> pull<00:04:30.720> up<00:04:30.900> is<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.620> one

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
looking forward to pull up is the one

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.839 
looking forward to pull up is the one
that<00:04:32.070> goes<00:04:34.039> horizontally<00:04:35.039> across<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.699> my

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
that goes horizontally across to my

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.640 
that goes horizontally across to my
shoulder<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.509> was<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.780> dark<00:04:37.020> blue<00:04:37.349> so<00:04:37.590> I

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
shoulder and that was the dark blue so I

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.630 

and<00:05:53.350> we<00:05:53.500> are<00:05:53.620> a<00:05:53.650> leaner<00:05:53.920> huh

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
and we are a leaner huh

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.540 
and we are a leaner huh
get<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.210> up<00:05:55.270> a<00:05:55.480> little<00:05:55.720> bit<00:05:55.870> higher<00:05:56.080> on<00:05:56.230> you

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
get that up a little bit higher on you

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:10.850 
get that up a little bit higher on you
good<00:05:57.550> do<00:05:57.700> the<00:05:57.850> same<00:05:58.150> at<00:05:58.720> the<00:05:58.870> other<00:05:58.900> side

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.620 

typically<00:06:11.860> I<00:06:11.980> have<00:06:12.280> her<00:06:12.430> arms<00:06:12.640> in<00:06:13.060> but<00:06:13.330> we<00:06:13.540> are

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
typically I have her arms in but we are

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.540 
typically I have her arms in but we are
not<00:06:13.780> cooperating<00:06:14.050> right<00:06:14.590> now<00:06:14.920> and<00:06:15.190> she's<00:06:15.430> an

not cooperating right now and she's an
older<00:06:15.820> baby<00:06:16.000> so<00:06:16.270> she's<00:06:17.110> okay<00:06:17.410> and<00:06:17.440> I<00:06:17.680> have

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
those tough edges really tight um so she

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.220 
those tough edges really tight um so she
can't<00:06:20.920> lean<00:06:21.130> out<00:06:21.370> of<00:06:21.550> it<00:06:21.700> but<00:06:21.940> I<00:06:22.180> would<00:06:22.990> like

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
can't lean out of it but I would like

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.800

if I want a little more support I spread
out<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.300> fabric<00:06:44.040> and<00:06:45.040> go<00:06:45.250> across<00:06:45.580> her

a woven wrap I might do it a little bit

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.420 
a woven wrap I might do it a little bit
differently<00:08:04.360> but<00:08:04.690> with<00:08:04.810> the<00:08:04.930> Rhapsody<00:08:05.530> it's

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:06.430
