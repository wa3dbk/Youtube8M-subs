00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
year and the first thing on my list was

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.039 
year and the first thing on my list was
to<00:01:26.170> do<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.549> chicken<00:01:27.549> picking<00:01:27.999> guitar<00:01:28.119> is<00:01:28.630> how<00:01:29.020> I

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
to do a chicken picking guitar is how I

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.959 
to do a chicken picking guitar is how I
like<00:01:29.319> to<00:01:29.350> term<00:01:29.679> it<00:01:29.829> it<00:01:30.249> really<00:01:30.490> ends<00:01:30.609> up<00:01:30.819> that

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
like to term it it really ends up that

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.819 
like to term it it really ends up that
it's<00:01:31.119> pretty<00:01:31.359> flexible<00:01:31.569> over<00:01:32.049> a<00:01:32.079> cross<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.619> a

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
it's pretty flexible over a cross of a

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.319 
it's pretty flexible over a cross of a
lot<00:01:33.009> of<00:01:33.130> genres<00:01:33.159> because<00:01:33.759> we<00:01:33.880> have<00:01:34.090> different

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
lot of genres because we have different

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.989 
lot of genres because we have different
pickups<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.140> we<00:01:35.350> can<00:01:35.530> do<00:01:35.649> with<00:01:35.799> it

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
pickups that we can do with it

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.270 
pickups that we can do with it
but<00:01:37.479> this<00:01:37.840> has<00:01:37.960> been<00:01:38.109> on<00:01:38.229> my<00:01:38.350> list<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.740> do<00:01:38.859> for<00:01:39.100> a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
but this has been on my list to do for a

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.480 
but this has been on my list to do for a
long<00:01:39.579> time<00:01:40.060> great<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.200> now<00:01:41.350> this<00:01:41.649> is<00:01:41.889> this<00:01:42.429> is
