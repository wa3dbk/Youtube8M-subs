it's a big big hard question trying to

it's a big big hard question trying to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
strongly and comfortable that I can look

strongly and comfortable that I can look
you<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> eye<00:00:54.719> tell<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.890> are

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
you in the eye tell you that there are

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.819 
you in the eye tell you that there are

is benign to our environment as wind
energy<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> yes<00:01:02.660> occasionally<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.870> bird<00:01:04.199> go

get<00:01:04.650> killed<00:01:04.890> by<00:01:05.040> wind<00:01:05.339> turbine<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.780> know

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
get killed by wind turbine and we know

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
get killed by wind turbine and we know
that<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that but it's not going to have a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.350 
that but it's not going to have a
biological<00:01:09.540> effect<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> species<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.640> it's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
biological effect on species at all it's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.899 
biological effect on species at all it's
you<00:01:12.720> know<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.380> had<00:01:13.500> an<00:01:13.650> extreme<00:01:14.610> case

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
you know if you had an extreme case

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.969 
you know if you had an extreme case
might<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.540> couple<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.140> birds<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.500> year<00:01:16.740> per

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
might be a couple of birds a year per

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.609 
might be a couple of birds a year per
turbine<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.670> burning<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.659> birds<00:01:18.900> basically

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
turbine in burning of birds basically

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
turbine in burning of birds basically
are<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.430> dumb<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.240> might<00:01:21.420> think<00:01:21.450> if

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
are not as dumb as you might think if

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
are not as dumb as you might think if
you<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> pane<00:01:22.200> glass<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.680> can't<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.189> if

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you have a pane glass they can't see if

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.940 
you have a pane glass they can't see if
these<00:01:23.400> gobain<00:01:24.030> right<00:01:24.299> into<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.380> birds<00:01:25.650> can

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
these gobain right into it but birds can

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.940 
these gobain right into it but birds can
see<00:01:26.189> these<00:01:26.400> wind<00:01:26.700> turbines<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.560> blades<00:01:28.560> on

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
see these wind turbines and blades on

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.490 
see these wind turbines and blades on
these<00:01:29.100> huge<00:01:29.490> turbines<00:01:29.880> turn<00:01:30.299> relatively<00:01:31.170> slow

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
these huge turbines turn relatively slow

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.850 
these huge turbines turn relatively slow
it's<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.920> 25<00:01:32.540> rpms

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
it's like 25 rpms

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.010 
it's like 25 rpms
so<00:01:34.100> it's<00:01:34.280> not<00:01:34.430> like<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.700> big<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.600> know<00:01:35.690> there's

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
so it's not like a big you know there's

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.070 
so it's not like a big you know there's
the<00:01:36.230> perception<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.010> like<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.570> you<00:01:38.570> know<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.690> fan

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
the perception of like a you know a fan

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.870 
the perception of like a you know a fan
it<00:01:39.290> just<00:01:39.320> tears<00:01:39.770> them<00:01:39.980> all<00:01:40.130> up<00:01:40.340> it's<00:01:40.580> just<00:01:40.700> not

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
it just tears them all up it's just not

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.870 
it just tears them all up it's just not
that<00:01:40.910> much<00:01:41.240> now<00:01:41.960> do<00:01:42.890> birds<00:01:43.160> in<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.580> condition

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
that much now do birds in a condition

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.210 
that much now do birds in a condition
where<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:44.300> have<00:01:44.480> a<00:01:44.510> storming<00:01:45.500> condition<00:01:46.010> you

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
where you have a storming condition you

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.150 
where you have a storming condition you
haven't<00:01:46.930> low<00:01:47.930> visibility<00:01:48.140> due<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.920> fog

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
haven't low visibility due to fog

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.030 
haven't low visibility due to fog
conditions<00:01:49.580> that's<00:01:50.510> when<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:51.140> could<00:01:51.620> have<00:01:51.650> to

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
conditions that's when you could have to

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.610 
conditions that's when you could have to
talent<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.610> if<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.479> did<00:01:53.600> by<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.750> way<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.440> do

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
talent and if you did by the way you do

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.620 
talent and if you did by the way you do
have<00:01:54.830> that<00:01:54.860> same<00:01:55.310> conditions<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:56.120> were

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
have that same conditions that were

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.630 
have that same conditions that were
birds<00:01:56.900> running<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.350> windows<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:58.070> lots<00:01:58.490> of

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
birds running the windows and lots of

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.580 
birds running the windows and lots of
other<00:01:58.850> things<00:01:58.940> so<00:01:59.360> if<00:01:59.870> you<00:02:00.170> know<00:02:00.260> there<00:02:00.410> are

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
other things so if you know there are

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.280 
other things so if you know there are
conditions<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:01.190> aren't<00:02:01.520> favorable<00:02:02.000> but<00:02:02.450> you

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
conditions that aren't favorable but you

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.900 
conditions that aren't favorable but you
know<00:02:03.410> I<00:02:03.650> don't<00:02:04.160> know<00:02:04.340> if<00:02:04.430> there's<00:02:04.580> any<00:02:04.790> other

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
know I don't know if there's any other

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.290 
know I don't know if there's any other
choices<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:07.280> know<00:02:07.400> when<00:02:07.910> I<00:02:07.940> think<00:02:08.209> about

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
choices so you know when I think about

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.540 
choices so you know when I think about
wind<00:02:08.630> energy<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.229> never<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.890> we<00:02:10.190> don't

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
wind energy and never that we don't

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.479 
wind energy and never that we don't
deplete<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.090> like<00:02:11.630> oil<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:11.989> gas<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.890> produces

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
deplete it like oil and gas it produces

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.850 
deplete it like oil and gas it produces
forever<00:02:13.970> we'll<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:14.930> keep<00:02:15.110> blowing<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.709> but

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
forever we'll just keep blowing it but

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.160 
forever we'll just keep blowing it but
wouldn't<00:02:16.100> blow<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.880> it's<00:02:17.330> dan<00:02:17.570> exhaustible

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
wouldn't blow it so it's dan exhaustible

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.720 
wouldn't blow it so it's dan exhaustible
and<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:18.800> think<00:02:19.010> that's<00:02:19.190> something<00:02:19.400> is

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
and I think that's something is

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.300 
and I think that's something is
Americans<00:02:20.300> we<00:02:20.450> need<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.690> keep<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.350> mind<00:02:21.560> and

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
Americans we need to keep in mind and

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.620 
Americans we need to keep in mind and
you<00:02:23.120> know<00:02:23.150> it's<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> domestic<00:02:24.800> resource

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
you know it's it is a domestic resource

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.030 
you know it's it is a domestic resource
you<00:02:26.630> know<00:02:26.720> we're<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.989> middle<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.290> war<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
you know we're in the middle of war and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.690 
you know we're in the middle of war and
a<00:02:28.100> half<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.090> over<00:02:29.510> energy<00:02:30.500> security<00:02:31.130> so

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
a half of that's over energy security so

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.000 
a half of that's over energy security so
America<00:02:32.540> could<00:02:32.690> do<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.840> lot<00:02:33.140> better<00:02:33.200> job<00:02:33.709> and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
America could do a lot better job and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.710 
America could do a lot better job and
our<00:02:34.310> leadership<00:02:34.790> could<00:02:34.940> do<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> better<00:02:35.270> job<00:02:35.390> and

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
our leadership could do a better job and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.380 
our leadership could do a better job and
I<00:02:35.780> think<00:02:35.959> they're<00:02:36.080> trying<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:38.299> know

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
I think they're trying to in you know

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.360 
I think they're trying to in you know
really<00:02:38.720> having<00:02:39.140> kind<00:02:39.320> of<00:02:39.380> an<00:02:39.500> Apollo<00:02:39.799> mission

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
really having kind of an Apollo mission

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.240 
really having kind of an Apollo mission
and<00:02:40.519> regard<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:41.470> significant<00:02:42.470> increases<00:02:42.890> of

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
and regard to significant increases of

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.910 
and regard to significant increases of
renewable<00:02:43.670> energy
