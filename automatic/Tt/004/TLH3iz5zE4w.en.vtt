all<00:00:01.170> right<00:00:01.709> it<00:00:02.370> just<00:00:02.610> started<00:00:03.030> up<00:00:03.149> for<00:00:03.389> me<00:00:04.339> not

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
all right it just started up for me not

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.030 
all right it just started up for me not
everything<00:00:05.790> plugged<00:00:06.089> in<00:00:06.620> I'm<00:00:07.620> still<00:00:07.859> using

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
everything plugged in I'm still using

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.570 
everything plugged in I'm still using
the<00:00:08.250> same<00:00:08.280> rich<00:00:08.639> Porter<00:00:09.320> avi<00:00:10.320> spark<00:00:11.030> and<00:00:13.580> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
the same rich Porter avi spark and it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.060 
the same rich Porter avi spark and it
started<00:00:15.360> up<00:00:15.480> for<00:00:15.750> some<00:00:16.049> reason<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> code

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
started up for some reason and the code

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.400 
started up for some reason and the code
16<00:00:17.460> went<00:00:17.850> off<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.449> then<00:00:18.630> when<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> shut<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.230> off

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
16 went off but then when I shut it off

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.120 
16 went off but then when I shut it off
it<00:00:20.300> came<00:00:21.300> back<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.930> code<00:00:22.109> 16<00:00:22.470> even<00:00:22.890> after<00:00:23.100> I

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
it came back on the code 16 even after I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
it came back on the code 16 even after I
cleared<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.570> only<00:00:24.720> thing<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.199> did

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
cleared it the only thing I really did

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.359 
cleared it the only thing I really did
was<00:00:25.859> wiggle<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.880> there's<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> ground<00:00:28.140> wire<00:00:28.439> on

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
was wiggle the there's a ground wire on

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.910 
was wiggle the there's a ground wire on
the<00:00:29.640> underneath<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.269> booster<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.679> brake

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the underneath the booster the brake

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.790 
the underneath the booster the brake
booster<00:00:32.300> that<00:00:33.300> runs<00:00:33.570> from<00:00:33.750> there<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> back

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
booster that runs from there to the back

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.520 
booster that runs from there to the back
of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> engine<00:00:35.250> over<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.850> underneath<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
of the engine over here underneath I

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.740 
of the engine over here underneath I
wiggled<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.149> for<00:00:39.149> some<00:00:39.270> reason<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
wiggled that and for some reason it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
wiggled that and for some reason it
started<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.200> don't<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.620> was

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
started I don't know if that was

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.660 
started I don't know if that was
coincidence<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:42.260> I<00:00:43.260> guess<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.250> got<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> check

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
coincidence or not I guess I got a check

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.959 
coincidence or not I guess I got a check

computer<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.600> don't<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.320> try<00:00:49.590> starting<00:00:49.829> it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
computer I don't know try starting it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.290 
computer I don't know try starting it
one<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.280> time<00:00:52.340> I'm<00:00:53.340> gonna<00:00:53.760> give<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.059> shot

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
one more time I'm gonna give it a shot

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.740 
one more time I'm gonna give it a shot

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
okay now it's not starting figures

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:32.220 
okay now it's not starting figures
started<00:01:14.110> right<00:01:14.290> up<00:01:14.320> before

antifreeze in the water pump on so I

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.399 
antifreeze in the water pump on so I
can't<00:01:48.350> let<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.590> run<00:01:48.710> too<00:01:48.920> long

everything's great with it I don't
understand<00:01:59.460> let's<00:02:00.460> say<00:02:00.670> now<00:02:01.030> if<00:02:01.299> I<00:02:01.420> go<00:02:01.630> back

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.410 

now<00:02:05.140> I'm<00:02:05.259> gonna<00:02:05.380> try<00:02:05.649> out<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:06.009> scanner<00:02:06.420> you

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
now I'm gonna try out the scanner you

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:23.809 
now I'm gonna try out the scanner you
forward

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.410 

let's<00:02:24.750> see<00:02:25.019> it's<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.439> race<00:02:25.620> coverage

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.610 

yes

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.250 

all<00:02:37.099> right<00:02:37.430> see<00:02:38.000> racing

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.820 

read<00:02:43.860> codes

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.650 

and<00:02:47.310> I'm<00:02:47.460> still<00:02:47.730> getting<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.270> low

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
and I'm still getting that low

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.500 
and I'm still getting that low
resolution<00:02:49.410> problem<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.180> service

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
engine soon lights on again I don't know

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.580 
engine soon lights on again I don't know
I'll<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.160> damned

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
I'll be damned

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.010 
I'll be damned
so<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.970> have<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.090> keep<00:03:00.240> trying<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.690> out<00:03:00.780> maybe

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
so I have to keep trying it out maybe

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.870 
so I have to keep trying it out maybe
work<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> grounds<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.160> car<00:03:02.370> maybe

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880

the<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.860> computer<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.850> don't<00:03:06.810> know<00:03:06.960> any<00:03:07.440> ideas

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.770 

okay<00:03:13.690> one<00:03:13.870> other<00:03:14.020> thing<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.320> noticed

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
okay one other thing I noticed

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.290 
okay one other thing I noticed
fuel<00:03:16.440> pressure<00:03:16.709> gauge<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.760> jury-rigged

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
fuel pressure gauge I just jury-rigged

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.600 
fuel pressure gauge I just jury-rigged
went<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.660> here<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.080> back<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.610> manifold

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
went on here to the back of the manifold

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.750 
went on here to the back of the manifold
hair<00:03:20.819> pill<00:03:21.270> rail<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:22.440> if<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.280> turn<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.610> key

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
hair pill rail and if I turn the key

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.449 
hair pill rail and if I turn the key
forward<00:03:24.209> I'm<00:03:24.569> it's<00:03:25.380> bleeding<00:03:25.800> off<00:03:25.980> really

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
forward I'm it's bleeding off really

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.530 
forward I'm it's bleeding off really
quick

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.729 

see<00:03:31.140> how<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.349> just<00:03:31.379> dropped

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
see how it just dropped
