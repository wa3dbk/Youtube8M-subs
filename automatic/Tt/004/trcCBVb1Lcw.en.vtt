 she everybody hope you go 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.490
 very very well today we get 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.269
 find for a very small 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.610
 pretty short video of it actually the blog of 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.030
 picnic that I did with some 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 among you some subscribers 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:22.260
 Sunday, July 26 I wanted you 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.750
 to actually make a tiny little point 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.090
 a little precision before simply 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.660
 to tell you that that day 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.980
 I have very little film and I think there is 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.110
 three or four minutes of video not 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 the more I have very little fine but simply 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 because I benefited a lot 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.899
 I did not want to take 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.890
 a lot of time you shoot a lot 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.020
 of you who could not be 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.570
 present asked me anyway to 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.860
 post this video for you can 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.469
 have a glimpse of the day 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.210
 so we went so that's it and I have 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.610
 absolutely not want to do editing 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.250
 for this video so the few plans 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.109
 that I filmed or tremors put at the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.500
 following this way throughout the video 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.210
 I hope it will give a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.159
 little idea of â€‹â€‹the great day we had 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.200
 past I thank again 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.610
 all those who came we were 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.020
 not enormously frankly I think 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.049
 we were a little under twenty 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.250
 but me personally it's all about 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.350
 did what I wished I could 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.090
