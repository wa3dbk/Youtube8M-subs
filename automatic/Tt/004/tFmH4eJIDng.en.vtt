the knob goes vertically the bat will

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.670 
the knob goes vertically the bat will
flip<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.639> he's<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.179> hitting<00:00:15.839> now<00:00:16.230> he's<00:00:16.470> going

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
flip so he's just hitting now he's going

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.439 
the target so that it can feel the drive
action<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.160> quick<00:00:29.460> reps<00:00:29.820> so

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
action and we do this with quick reps so

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.520 
action and we do this with quick reps so
we're<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:30.779> striding<00:00:31.700> pop<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.360> pop<00:00:33.840> target

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
a straight line when we get contact

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.040 
a straight line when we get contact
never<00:01:46.650> rotational<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:48.390> that's<00:01:49.390> why<00:01:49.630> we<00:01:49.660> have

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
never rotational and that's why we have

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.530 
never rotational and that's why we have
the<00:01:50.229> target<00:01:50.650> out<00:01:50.800> front<00:01:51.160> when<00:01:51.820> we<00:01:51.970> add<00:01:52.120> the<00:01:52.330> bad

closest<00:04:11.300> to<00:04:11.360> us<00:04:11.590> middle<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:12.830> middle<00:04:13.370> ball

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
closest to us middle is the middle ball

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.670 
closest to us middle is the middle ball
and<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.300> outside<00:04:14.810> pitch<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.440> right-hander
