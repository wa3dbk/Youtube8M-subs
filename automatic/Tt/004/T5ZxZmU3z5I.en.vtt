00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
of that becomes tantamount to what we

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.039 
of that becomes tantamount to what we
call<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.549> overall<00:01:41.970> quality<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.509> life<00:01:42.600> and

call just overall quality of life and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
call just overall quality of life and
then<00:01:43.470> almost<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.460> major<00:01:44.759> goals<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
then almost all of the major goals that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.389 
then almost all of the major goals that
we<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:46.049> want<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> wind<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.740> accomplishing
