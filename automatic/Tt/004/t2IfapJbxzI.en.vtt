00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.860
 rest assured you have not applied 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.330
 on the bad video it's the test 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.650
 the new a3 sportback 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.940
 so it's true that in terms of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.800
 style it's not really the break 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.480
 but yet she inaugurates a whole 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.860
 new platform and unlike 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.570
 his little sister the 3 doors she a 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.169
 longer wheelbase for better 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.000
 habitability 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.140
 but first we'll leave them on 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.140
 the roads of the col de vence 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.280
 it's a well-honed mechanics after 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.870
 have presented the 3 to 3 doors to say 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.420
 and takes center stage with the 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.440
 sportback version that sounds better 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.210
 that the 5 doors 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.190
 and yet that's good of what he 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.720
 is even if seven to three posters of 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.640
 counterfeiters at the point of 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.040
 look like the a4 before the length 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.300
 increased by 73 mm allows to preserve 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.820
 the balanced lines 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.860
 at the back the lights drawn abbÃ¨s 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.920
 visually the self but overall 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.910
 no surprise the new a3 sportback 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.770
 looks like two drops of water to 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.970
 the old a3 sportback in 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.920
 the layout at all is to dive 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.360
 in the audi universe first because we 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.770
 has an excellent driving position its 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.190
 thanks to multiple seat adjustments and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.630
 steering wheel 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.520
 and then mostly because the finish 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.020
 is remarkable all materials 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.729
 up to these little buttons and its 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.630
 details of dressing are the subject of a 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.979
 extreme care 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.320
 it's simple it's like 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.450
 car of the higher category thanks 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.039
 at the wheelbase plus 35 mm the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.259
 rear seats are more inviting 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.810
 than on the 3-door version on its side 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.030
 the chest displays 380 cubic decimetres 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.440
 a slightly larger volume than 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.539
 that of direct rivals 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.910
 in short the a3 sportback is serious 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:45.039
 serious side uk interior presentation 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.039
 but also side driving sensations 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.140
 the register of only toby three 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.310
 teams is 38 are not that much 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.619
 pure efficiency 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.030
 as much as saying that in the wet or on the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.340
 snow no problem to be done 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.049
 but fun level we can stay 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.069
 a little bit on his hunger it's not 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.929
 she is really clumsy 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.340
 but we would still like to have 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.329
 a rear train that winds up a little the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.329
 more and out of curve 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.099
 our test version have the engine 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.170
 to liters tfsi of 180 horses a block 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.360
 ultra modern equipped including a 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.950
 bi injection system operating at the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.209
 times in intake manifolds and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.010
 in the combustion chambers 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.870
 in short, this engine is loaded with 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.709
 technologies finally the use is lacking 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.599
 still a little something 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.950
 a small flame a sparkling side 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.879
 it's true that he does not like it too much 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.069
 go on a diet 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.629
 its sound is pretty brief 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.739
 as much as we wait impatiently 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.540
 the future is king in this version 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.319
 wolf sportback who has three winners 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.420
 versatile 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.829
 but despite all her technology she 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.079
 lack of sporting character 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.609
 hope the future and what 3 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.799
 will land next year with his 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.459
 300 horses will display a temperament 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.459
 more assertive
