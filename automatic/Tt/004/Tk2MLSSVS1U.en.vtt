decomposed decomposing stuff when I'm

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.030 
decomposed decomposing stuff when I'm
watering<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.170> also<00:02:30.170> try<00:02:30.530> not<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.860> water

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
watering I also try not to water

watering I also try not to water
directly<00:02:31.550> on<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.790> leaves<00:02:32.000> even<00:02:32.660> though<00:02:32.960> I<00:02:32.990> did

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
directly on the leaves even though I did

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.250 
directly on the leaves even though I did
here<00:02:33.590> because<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.670> was<00:02:34.820> showing<00:02:35.030> off<00:02:35.330> but<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
here because I was showing off but the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.810 
here because I was showing off but the
closer<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.710> get<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.040> base<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.580> plant

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
closer you get to the base of the plant

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.940 
closer you get to the base of the plant
the<00:02:37.970> better<00:02:38.210> what<00:02:38.750> happens<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.500> raindrops

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
the better what happens is the raindrops

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.940 
the better what happens is the raindrops
can<00:02:40.190> act<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.790> prism<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:41.450> attract<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.350> lot

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
can act like a prism and attract a lot

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.290 
can act like a prism and attract a lot
of<00:02:42.980> sunlight<00:02:43.550> especially<00:02:43.820> if<00:02:44.180> you're

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
of sunlight especially if you're

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.910 
of sunlight especially if you're
watering<00:02:44.630> at<00:02:44.870> noon<00:02:45.080> which<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.500> would<00:02:45.680> suggest

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
watering at noon which I would suggest

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.280 
watering at noon which I would suggest
on<00:02:46.310> avoiding<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.540> can<00:02:47.720> burn<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.050> leaves

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
on avoiding and it can burn the leaves

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.750 
on avoiding and it can burn the leaves
so<00:02:48.680> if<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.980> stick<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.670> bottoms<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
so if you stick to the bottoms the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.100 
so if you stick to the bottoms the
shaded<00:02:52.760> parts<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.210> your<00:02:53.330> plants<00:02:53.690> you'll<00:02:53.840> have

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
shaded parts of your plants you'll have

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.270 
shaded parts of your plants you'll have
much<00:02:54.410> more<00:02:54.440> success<00:02:54.950> with<00:02:55.460> your<00:02:55.580> watery<00:02:57.280> see

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
much more success with your watery see

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.730 
much more success with your watery see
