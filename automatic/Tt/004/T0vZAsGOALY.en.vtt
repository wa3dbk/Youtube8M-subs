00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
drivers when they are holding up two

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.410 
drivers when they are holding up two
converters<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.820> on<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.270> our

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
converters and on here we have our

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.319 
converters and on here we have our
diesel<00:01:54.659> exhaust<00:01:54.840> fluid<00:01:55.170> filler<00:01:55.890> cap<00:01:56.270> okay<00:01:57.270> so

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
diesel exhaust fluid filler cap okay so

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.510 
diesel exhaust fluid filler cap okay so
next<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.869> an<00:01:58.020> additional<00:01:58.380> plug<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:59.369> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
next we have an additional plug as you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.030 
next we have an additional plug as you
can<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> drivers<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.409> find

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
can see this is for the drivers to find

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.620 
can see this is for the drivers to find
an<00:02:02.159> electrical<00:02:02.579> supply<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.299> plug<00:02:03.509> in

an electrical supply they can plug in

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.420 
an electrical supply they can plug in
here<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.439> get<00:02:04.680> air<00:02:04.920> conditioning

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
here and they can get air conditioning

thing we see is our stereo this is

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.830 
thing we see is our stereo this is
Bluetooth<00:03:20.220> enabled<00:03:20.370> for<00:03:21.180> our<00:03:21.269> drivers<00:03:21.690> so

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
Bluetooth enabled for our drivers so

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.300 
Bluetooth enabled for our drivers so
they<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.080> drive<00:03:22.260> hands-free<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.099> a<00:03:23.129> lot

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
they can drive hands-free it is a lot
