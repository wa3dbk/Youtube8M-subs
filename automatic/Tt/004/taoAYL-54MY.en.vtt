bridges<00:00:09.269> we're<00:00:09.420> going<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.780> build<00:00:10.019> four<00:00:10.559> bridge

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
bridges we're going to build four bridge

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.459 
bridges we're going to build four bridge
structures<00:00:11.639> using<00:00:11.880> index<00:00:12.420> cards<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.929> we're

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
structures using index cards and we're

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.289 
structures using index cards and we're
going<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.620> change<00:00:13.980> some<00:00:14.130> design<00:00:14.700> element<00:00:15.179> in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
bridge to withstand a load let's just

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.330 
bridge to withstand a load let's just
take<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> quick<00:00:21.930> look<00:00:22.170> at<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> materials<00:00:23.010> and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
take a quick look at the materials and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.800 
take a quick look at the materials and
in<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> type<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> bridges<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.510> you're<00:00:24.600> going

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
in the type of bridges that you're going

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.050 
in the type of bridges that you're going
to<00:00:24.900> build<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.980> vil<00:00:26.189> video<00:00:26.460> clip<00:00:29.060> so

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
to build with this vil video clip so

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
to build with this vil video clip so
let's<00:00:30.090> take<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> look<00:00:30.840> at<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> materials<00:00:31.619> we'll

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
let's take a look at the materials we'll

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.170 
let's take a look at the materials we'll
be<00:00:31.769> using<00:00:31.830> we're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> use<00:00:32.460> pennies<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
be using we're going to use pennies as a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.510 
be using we're going to use pennies as a
load<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.750> each<00:00:34.020> penny<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.590> will<00:00:34.770> will<00:00:35.280> count

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
load and each penny then will will count

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.580 
load and each penny then will will count
to<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.480> many<00:00:36.630> pennies<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> bridge<00:00:37.380> can

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
to see how many pennies the bridge can

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.190 
to see how many pennies the bridge can
hold<00:00:37.850> markers<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:39.120> pencils<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.020> them

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
hold markers or pencils if you have them

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.510 
hold markers or pencils if you have them
are<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.770> bridge<00:00:40.950> supports<00:00:41.370> on

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
are going to be the bridge supports on

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.190 
are going to be the bridge supports on
either<00:00:41.640> end<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.420> need<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> ruler<00:00:42.960> some

second set up is at that index card cut

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
second set up is at that index card cut
in<00:00:57.840> three<00:00:58.050> pieces<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.680> then<00:00:59.280> suspended

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
in three pieces and then suspended

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.429 
in three pieces and then suspended
between<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:01.250> two<00:01:02.250> supports<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.420> third<00:01:03.719> set

up will be that same three pieces but

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.240 
up will be that same three pieces but
we'll<00:01:06.990> glue<00:01:07.200> them<00:01:07.350> together<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.799> laminate

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
we'll glue them together to laminate

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.429 
we'll glue them together to laminate
them<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> beam<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> that'll<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.110> put<00:01:10.320> in

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
them into a beam and that'll be put in
between<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> supports<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.939> finally

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
between the supports and then finally

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
between the supports and then finally
we'll<00:01:13.080> take<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.500> index<00:01:13.860> card<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.490> we'll<00:01:14.640> fold

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
we'll take one index card and we'll fold

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.870 
we'll take one index card and we'll fold
it<00:01:15.150> into<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.509> beam<00:01:15.780> shape<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.729> suspend<00:01:17.729> out

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880

one<00:01:40.770> another<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.509> those<00:01:42.990> three

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
one another you can have those three

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.410 
one another you can have those three
pieces<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:43.890> glued<00:01:44.220> together<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.880> laminate

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
pieces then glued together and laminate

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.960 
pieces then glued together and laminate
it<00:01:45.570> into<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> beam<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:47.100> final<00:01:47.460> choice<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it into a beam and the final choice is a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
it into a beam and the final choice is a
single<00:01:48.509> card<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.049> been<00:01:49.200> folded<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
single card but it's been folded into a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.520 
single card but it's been folded into a
channel<00:01:50.310> shape<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.540> take<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> moment<00:01:52.350> now

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
channel shape so just take a moment now

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.960 
channel shape so just take a moment now
with<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.310> group<00:01:53.610> members<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
with your with your group members and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.600 
with your with your group members and
decide<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.140> which<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.560> those<00:01:55.799> four<00:01:55.860> shapes

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
decide on which one of those four shapes

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.940 
decide on which one of those four shapes
of<00:01:56.880> bridges<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:57.990> will<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.259> best<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.770> at

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
of bridges you think will be best at at

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.340 
of bridges you think will be best at at
holding<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.880> load<00:02:00.090> or<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.719> case<00:02:00.899> hold<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
holding a load or in this case hold the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
holding a load or in this case hold the
most<00:02:01.530> pennies<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.759> make<00:02:03.000> your

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
most pennies and then make your

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.870 
most pennies and then make your
prediction<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.950> which<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.490> those<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
prediction on which one of those you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.059 
prediction on which one of those you
think<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.180> going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.600> best<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.110> once

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
think is going to be best and once

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
think is going to be best and once
you've<00:02:08.220> made<00:02:08.250> your<00:02:08.399> prediction<00:02:08.970> come<00:02:09.539> up<00:02:09.629> with

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you've made your prediction come up with

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.750 
you've made your prediction come up with
an<00:02:09.840> explanation<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:11.099> your<00:02:11.250> group<00:02:11.430> members

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
an explanation with your group members

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760 
an explanation with your group members
as<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.239> why<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.660> picked<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.349> particular

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
as to why you picked that particular

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.560 
as to why you picked that particular
the<00:02:13.860> bridge<00:02:14.100> when<00:02:14.850> you've<00:02:14.970> done<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.180> we'll

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
the bridge when you've done that we'll

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.300 
the bridge when you've done that we'll
we'll<00:02:15.930> start<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.260> video<00:02:16.350> again<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.130> can

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
we'll start the video again and you can

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.310 
we'll start the video again and you can
actually<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> look<00:02:18.150> at<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.480> testing<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
actually have a look at the testing and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.050 
actually have a look at the testing and
see<00:02:19.440> which<00:02:19.620> bridge<00:02:19.860> actually<00:02:20.340> does<00:02:20.520> hold<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
see which bridge actually does hold the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.100 
see which bridge actually does hold the
most<00:02:21.240> pennies<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.540> our<00:02:24.630> first<00:02:24.870> test

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
most pennies so this is our first test

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.890 
most pennies so this is our first test
then<00:02:25.470> back<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> single<00:02:26.790> index<00:02:27.330> cards<00:02:27.720> will

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
then back to a single index cards will

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900 
then back to a single index cards will
place<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.110> index<00:02:28.710> card<00:02:29.040> across<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.730> two

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
place one index card across the two

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.820 
place one index card across the two
markers<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.600> then<00:02:31.380> we're<00:02:31.530> going<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.710> use

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
markers and then we're going to use

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.860 
markers and then we're going to use
pennies<00:02:32.160> remember<00:02:32.820> as<00:02:32.940> our<00:02:33.120> counter<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.660> let's

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
pennies remember as our counter so let's

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.170 
pennies remember as our counter so let's
start<00:02:34.110> adding<00:02:34.290> those<00:02:34.620> pennies<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.310> we'll<00:02:36.060> add

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
start adding those pennies and we'll add

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.360 
start adding those pennies and we'll add
them<00:02:36.390> one<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.840> time<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.770> one<00:02:38.040> penny

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.980 

two<00:02:41.370> pennies<00:02:43.940> three<00:02:44.940> pennies<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.720> cards

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
two pennies three pennies and the cards

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.750 
two pennies three pennies and the cards
touch<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.500> table<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.040> we'll<00:02:47.310> say<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.520> this

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
touch the table so we'll say that this

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.500 
touch the table so we'll say that this
bridge<00:02:48.000> was<00:02:48.120> able<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.450> hold<00:02:48.630> three<00:02:49.080> pennies

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
bridge was able to hold three pennies

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.240 
bridge was able to hold three pennies
our<00:02:51.510> second<00:02:52.020> setup<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.410> took<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.740> card<00:02:53.010> and

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
our second setup we took the card and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.100 
our second setup we took the card and
cut<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.550> into<00:02:53.700> three<00:02:54.090> pieces<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.570> just<00:02:54.900> one

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
cut it into three pieces so just one

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.620 
cut it into three pieces so just one
card<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:55.560> cut<00:02:55.950> into<00:02:56.250> three<00:02:56.520> pieces<00:02:56.700> will

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
card but cut into three pieces will

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.570 
card but cut into three pieces will
place<00:02:57.840> those<00:02:58.020> across<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.410> markers<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.310> again

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
place those across the markers and again

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.970 
place those across the markers and again
we'll<00:02:59.760> add<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.060> pennies<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.260> top<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.860> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
we'll add the pennies to the top of the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.970 
we'll add the pennies to the top of the
bridge<00:03:02.190> one<00:03:02.790> at<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.060> time<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.660> here<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.590> one

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
bridge one at a time and here we go one

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.190 
bridge one at a time and here we go one
two<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:11.210> three<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:12.240> again<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.870> bridge<00:03:13.050> is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
two and three and again the bridge is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.900 
two and three and again the bridge is
touched<00:03:13.440> down<00:03:13.710> so<00:03:14.040> we're<00:03:14.220> going<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.370> say<00:03:14.520> only

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
touched down so we're going to say only

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.300 
touched down so we're going to say only
three<00:03:15.150> pennies<00:03:15.510> again<00:03:15.810> for<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.860> bridge<00:03:17.100> with

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
three pennies again for the bridge with

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.699 
three pennies again for the bridge with
three<00:03:17.520> pieces<00:03:18.050> third<00:03:19.050> bridge<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.470> three

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
three pieces third bridge is three

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.140 
three pieces third bridge is three
pieces<00:03:20.070> again<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.550> time<00:03:20.610> we've<00:03:20.880> glued

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
pieces again but this time we've glued

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.970 
pieces again but this time we've glued
them<00:03:21.390> or<00:03:21.540> laminated<00:03:22.110> them<00:03:22.320> together<00:03:22.560> and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
them or laminated them together and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.890 
them or laminated them together and
we'll<00:03:23.970> place<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.180> bridge<00:03:24.570> across<00:03:24.690> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
we'll place that bridge across the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.060 
we'll place that bridge across the
markers<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.680> add<00:03:25.890> pennies<00:03:26.220> again<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:27.950> two

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:50.000 

three<00:03:33.590> four<00:03:36.200> five<00:03:38.330> six<00:03:40.430> seven<00:03:42.890> eight<00:03:45.170> nine<00:03:49.010> ten

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
three four five six seven eight nine ten

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.670 
three four five six seven eight nine ten
and<00:03:50.340> we<00:03:50.760> get<00:03:50.910> ten<00:03:51.209> pennies<00:03:51.570> piled<00:03:52.020> across<00:03:52.440> on

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
and we get ten pennies piled across on

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.830 
and we get ten pennies piled across on
the<00:03:52.800> bridge<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.100> time<00:03:53.340> before<00:03:53.520> it<00:03:53.820> fails<00:03:54.060> the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
the bridge this time before it fails the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.449 
the bridge this time before it fails the
final<00:03:55.230> bridge<00:03:55.380> we<00:03:55.560> didn't<00:03:55.800> glue<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.220> time

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
final bridge we didn't glue it this time

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.220 
final bridge we didn't glue it this time
but<00:03:56.640> all<00:03:56.910> we<00:03:57.030> did<00:03:57.060> was<00:03:57.360> take<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.720> card<00:03:57.990> and

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
but all we did was take the card and

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.530 
but all we did was take the card and
fold<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.709> into<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.980> channel<00:03:59.400> so<00:04:00.030> fold<00:04:00.300> up<00:04:00.420> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
fold it into a channel so fold up the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.330 
fold it into a channel so fold up the
two<00:04:00.690> sides<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.320> we'll<00:04:01.440> place<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.680> across

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
two sides and we'll place that across

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.150 
two sides and we'll place that across
the<00:04:02.610> markers<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.380> then<00:04:04.380> we<00:04:04.590> will<00:04:04.770> load<00:04:05.010> the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
the markers and then we will load the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.920 
the markers and then we will load the
pennies<00:04:05.490> in<00:04:05.640> again<00:04:05.910> I'm<00:04:06.510> going<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.720> cheat<00:04:06.900> a

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
pennies in again I'm going to cheat a

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.510 
pennies in again I'm going to cheat a
little<00:04:07.050> bit<00:04:07.290> though<00:04:07.440> I'm<00:04:07.950> going<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.190> load<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
little bit though I'm going to load the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.360 
little bit though I'm going to load the
pennies<00:04:08.850> by<00:04:09.110> stacks<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.320> ten<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:10.800> that's<00:04:10.890> ten

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
pennies by stacks of ten so that's ten

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.300 
pennies by stacks of ten so that's ten
pennies<00:04:11.730> starting<00:04:12.360> on<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.570> bridge

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.629 

and<00:04:17.910> we'll<00:04:18.180> add<00:04:18.299> another<00:04:18.420> stack<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:19.079> ten

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
and we'll add another stack of ten

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:42.740 
and we'll add another stack of ten
that's<00:04:20.639> 20<00:04:27.320> 30<00:04:33.680> 40<00:04:39.560> 50<00:04:41.090> pennies<00:04:42.090> stacked<00:04:42.540> in

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
that's 20 30 40 50 pennies stacked in

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.700 
that's 20 30 40 50 pennies stacked in
the<00:04:42.840> middle<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.230> bridge<00:04:46.880> 60<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.710> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
the middle of the bridge 60 and the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.290 
the middle of the bridge 60 and the
bridge<00:04:49.890> is<00:04:50.040> still<00:04:50.250> holding<00:04:50.460> no<00:04:50.760> sign<00:04:51.060> of

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
bridge is still holding no sign of

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.170 
bridge is still holding no sign of
bending<00:04:51.720> or<00:04:51.960> changing<00:04:52.500> shape<00:04:52.940> let's<00:04:53.940> try<00:04:54.150> a

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
bending or changing shape let's try a

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.140 
bending or changing shape let's try a
little<00:04:54.480> bit<00:04:54.630> more<00:04:55.070> 70<00:04:56.070> pennies<00:04:56.460> on<00:04:56.669> top<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:57.060> the

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
little bit more 70 pennies on top of the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.409 
little bit more 70 pennies on top of the
bridge<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:58.220> it's<00:04:59.220> just<00:04:59.430> become<00:04:59.790> too<00:05:00.030> unstable

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
bridge and it's just become too unstable

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.450 
bridge and it's just become too unstable
to<00:05:00.720> be<00:05:00.930> able<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.080> stack<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.470> penny<00:05:01.680> so<00:05:01.950> we'll

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
to be able to stack the penny so we'll

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.510 
to be able to stack the penny so we'll
say<00:05:02.580> in<00:05:02.790> excess<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.330> 70<00:05:03.570> pennies<00:05:04.250> so<00:05:05.250> let's

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
say in excess of 70 pennies so let's

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.700 
say in excess of 70 pennies so let's
just<00:05:05.700> go<00:05:05.850> over<00:05:05.880> our<00:05:06.300> results<00:05:06.840> then<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.410> have<00:05:07.680> a

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
just go over our results then and have a

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.100 
just go over our results then and have a
look<00:05:08.310> at<00:05:08.430> what<00:05:08.580> we<00:05:08.669> just<00:05:08.700> found<00:05:09.030> out<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:09.900> with

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
look at what we just found out so with

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.659 
look at what we just found out so with
the<00:05:10.229> single<00:05:10.590> card<00:05:10.830> we<00:05:11.100> were<00:05:11.220> able<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.520> hold

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
the single card we were able to hold

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.600 
the single card we were able to hold
three<00:05:12.240> pennies<00:05:12.800> by<00:05:13.800> cutting<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.220> card<00:05:14.460> into

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
three pennies by cutting the card into

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.890 
three pennies by cutting the card into
three<00:05:14.850> pieces<00:05:15.060> but<00:05:15.389> then<00:05:15.540> not<00:05:15.690> gluing

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
three pieces but then not gluing

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.280 
three pieces but then not gluing
together<00:05:16.290> we<00:05:16.500> again<00:05:16.770> held<00:05:17.130> three<00:05:17.700> pennies

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
together we again held three pennies

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.810 
together we again held three pennies
three<00:05:19.290> pieces<00:05:19.500> but<00:05:19.830> laminating<00:05:20.550> them<00:05:20.669> so

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
three pieces but laminating them so

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.670 
three pieces but laminating them so
gluing<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.240> three<00:05:21.419> pieces<00:05:21.660> together<00:05:22.140> change

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
gluing the three pieces together change

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.920 
gluing the three pieces together change
the<00:05:23.010> load-bearing<00:05:23.510> ability<00:05:24.510> of<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.750> bridge

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
the load-bearing ability of the bridge

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.480 
the load-bearing ability of the bridge
and<00:05:25.140> we're<00:05:25.260> able<00:05:25.350> to<00:05:25.500> hold<00:05:25.590> up<00:05:25.680> to<00:05:25.830> ten<00:05:26.130> pennies

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
and we're able to hold up to ten pennies

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.210 
and we're able to hold up to ten pennies
and<00:05:26.820> then<00:05:27.510> finally<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.020> best<00:05:28.229> overall<00:05:28.710> was

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
and then finally the best overall was

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.219 
and then finally the best overall was
the<00:05:29.430> single<00:05:29.850> card<00:05:30.120> and<00:05:30.390> folded<00:05:30.900> into<00:05:31.080> a

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
the single card and folded into a

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.529 
the single card and folded into a
channel<00:05:31.590> shape<00:05:31.950> and<00:05:32.160> that<00:05:32.669> in<00:05:32.940> excess<00:05:33.300> before

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
channel shape and that in excess before

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.240 
channel shape and that in excess before
our<00:05:33.810> load<00:05:34.050> just<00:05:34.380> spilled<00:05:34.650> over<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:34.979> edges

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
our load just spilled over the edges

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.850 
our load just spilled over the edges
with<00:05:35.460> sixty<00:05:35.970> pennies<00:05:36.360> so<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.500> can<00:05:37.650> see<00:05:37.830> very

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
with sixty pennies so you can see very

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.100 
with sixty pennies so you can see very
clearly<00:05:38.310> that<00:05:38.580> changes<00:05:39.270> in<00:05:39.510> the<00:05:39.660> way<00:05:39.780> that<00:05:39.810> we

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
clearly that changes in the way that we

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.770 
clearly that changes in the way that we
arrange<00:05:40.470> those<00:05:40.680> materials<00:05:41.310> do<00:05:41.910> provide<00:05:42.419> a

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
arrange those materials do provide a

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.170 
arrange those materials do provide a
greater<00:05:43.260> ability<00:05:43.410> for<00:05:43.890> that<00:05:43.950> bridge<00:05:44.280> to<00:05:44.550> hold

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
greater ability for that bridge to hold

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.870 
greater ability for that bridge to hold
on<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.570> a<00:05:45.600> load
