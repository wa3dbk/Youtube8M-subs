this<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.550> our<00:00:08.700> final<00:00:08.940> setup<00:00:09.420> before<00:00:09.570> heading

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
this is our final setup before heading

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.919 
this is our final setup before heading
to<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> desert<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.580> get<00:00:11.670> a

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
to the desert this is going to get a

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.829 
to the desert this is going to get a
shield<00:00:12.929> over<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.380> but<00:00:14.240> basically<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.480> co2

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
shield over it but basically this co2

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.230 
shield over it but basically this co2
tank<00:00:17.630> set<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.810> give<00:00:18.990> low<00:00:19.560> pressure<00:00:19.970> to<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.000> top

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
tank set to give low pressure to the top

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.900 
tank set to give low pressure to the top
of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> valve<00:00:22.039> valve<00:00:23.039> turns<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.699> high

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
of the valve valve turns on high

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.210 
of the valve valve turns on high
pressure<00:00:24.210> from<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.410> main<00:00:25.619> dump<00:00:25.949> tank

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
pressure from the the main dump tank

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.120 
pressure from the the main dump tank
here<00:00:26.490> which<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.730> an<00:00:26.820> old<00:00:26.970> nitrogen<00:00:27.480> k<00:00:27.689> tank

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
here which is an old nitrogen k tank

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.150 
here which is an old nitrogen k tank
that<00:00:29.130> goes<00:00:29.609> down<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> line<00:00:30.650> it's<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> bottom

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
that goes down the line it's the bottom

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.080 
that goes down the line it's the bottom
of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.309> piston<00:00:32.960> systems<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.290> goes<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.219> above

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
of the piston systems this goes up above

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.920 
of the piston systems this goes up above
the<00:00:36.300> piston<00:00:36.920> right<00:00:37.920> now<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.309> water<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.090> will

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the piston right now is water and will

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
the piston right now is water and will
be<00:00:40.110> fuel<00:00:40.879> now<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> propane<00:00:43.489> igniter<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
be fuel now we have a propane igniter it

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.360 
be fuel now we have a propane igniter it
goes<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> top<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> halo<00:00:47.070> system

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.580 

of<00:00:51.370> copper<00:00:52.030> up<00:00:52.960> in<00:00:53.110> there<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:53.380> that's<00:00:53.500> a

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
of copper up in there and that's a

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.890 
of copper up in there and that's a
windshield<00:00:53.890> around<00:00:54.430> that<00:00:54.640> we<00:00:55.360> now<00:00:55.510> have<00:00:55.720> real

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
windshield around that we now have real

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.440 
windshield around that we now have real
nozzles<00:00:56.380> for<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.620> first<00:00:56.800> time<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.460> old

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
nozzles for the first time and that old

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.320 
nozzles for the first time and that old
salad<00:00:58.989> bowl<00:00:59.250> there<00:01:00.250> is<00:01:00.520> going<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.730> be<00:01:00.879> a<00:01:00.910> shield

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
salad bowl there is going to be a shield

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.439 
salad bowl there is going to be a shield
to<00:01:01.660> bring<00:01:01.930> any<00:01:02.430> flaming<00:01:03.430> fuel<00:01:03.700> down<00:01:04.030> away<00:01:04.420> from

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
to bring any flaming fuel down away from

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:13.639 
to bring any flaming fuel down away from
the<00:01:05.460> insides<00:01:06.460> of<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.700> nozzles<00:01:08.729> basically

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.630 

that<00:01:14.649> is<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.399> whole<00:01:15.659> setup<00:01:17.369> we're<00:01:18.369> about<00:01:18.490> to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
that is the whole setup we're about to

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.510 
that is the whole setup we're about to
test<00:01:18.850> with<00:01:19.030> water<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.479> get<00:01:19.570> some<00:01:20.369> nozzle<00:01:21.369> and

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
test with water and get some nozzle and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:02:09.230 
test with water and get some nozzle and
pressure<00:01:21.729> tests

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.330
