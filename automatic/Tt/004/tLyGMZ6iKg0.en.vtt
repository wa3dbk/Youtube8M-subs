00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.370
Hey everybody, I'm Lindsay Adler and

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.810
I'm a Portrait and Fashion Photographer based in New York City.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.770
As a fashion photographer, I'm always on the go.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.040
I'm shooting in the studio, I'm

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.590
shooting on location, I'm shooting

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.120
a runway show, and one

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.610
of the things that's very important to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.670
me are really portable, really

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.130
easy to set up, and inexpensive

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.770
modifiers, and that's what we are going to talk about right now.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.720
I'm going to show you how to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.160
create a really beautiful, glowing, and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.890
a ethereal beauty look without

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.210
having to use three, or four,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.930
or five different studio strobes,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.260
but instead, a single speedlight and a little bit of creativity.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.540
I have my subjects standing in

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.920
front of a window, now what

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.750
I want you to do is I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.010
want you to look at her jaw and the side of her face.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.990
Can you see that light wrapping around?

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.050
That is going to help give me the ethereal look.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.620
The modifier that I'm going

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.870
to use is going to

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.660
be my FlashBender 2 XL Pro,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.350
and that larger FlashBender is

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.250
now going to be like a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340
big, white, reflective panel.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.010
If you shoot a speedlight

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.040
as a bare bulb, that speed

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.100
light, it's going to be very, very

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.070
harsh, and it's going to be very, very small.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.560
So what you do in

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.690
this instance, is when you bounce

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.890
the light into it, it makes

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.810
it a much larger light source,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.600
and so now it's going to

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.930
be much softer, and a much

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.390
better modifier for this ethereal look.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.510
So I've raised the light

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.640
up a little bit, so it's a more

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.310
flattering angle for her face.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.530
So really it's just about getting

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.390
that right mix of light between

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.010
the background, the light on her face, and the speedlight.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.670
So I'm really close that a

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.560
ethereal look I was going

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.940
for, I have the soft light

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.920
on her face, I have that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.580
glowing light from behind, but there's a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.770
little bit of shadow underneath

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.140
her chin and her nose, and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.440
there's nothing wrong with shadow, but

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.900
if I'm going for something really

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.130
glowing, maybe I want

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.190
that shadow to be a little

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.920
bit softer, not quite as dark.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.750
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to have my model hold a reflector.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.370
Considering that we're trying to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.450
go for soft and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.300
ethereal, you might want to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.750
add a diffusion panel, so

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.690
what that's going to do is, it's going

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.470
to soften down that light

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.150
a little bit more.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.640
So, if you want a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.160
one light setup for a really beautiful,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.960
ethereal look, all

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.040
you need is a speedlight with the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.590
FlashBender 2 XL

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.970
Pro, you can add

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.840
a diffuser if you want

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.300
it a little bit softer, put your subject

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.800
in front of the window, and add a reflector.
