00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
while then survival mode you basically

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.950 
while then survival mode you basically
yeah<00:00:26.039> just<00:00:26.310> keep<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.699> until<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.150> die<00:00:27.630> so

you<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.380> see<00:00:28.529> how<00:00:28.740> long<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.220> go

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you just you see how long you can go

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.310 
you just you see how long you can go
sort<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.730> time<00:00:29.970> challenge<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.050> let's<00:00:31.199> take<00:00:31.289> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
sort of a time challenge so let's take a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
sort of a time challenge so let's take a
look<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> story<00:00:32.130> mode<00:00:32.399> give<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
look here at the story mode give the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.590 
look here at the story mode give the
idea<00:00:33.030> how<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.210> works

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
idea how this works

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990 
idea how this works
I<00:00:33.690> got<00:00:33.840> most<00:00:34.170> way<00:00:34.469> through<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.280> first

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
I got most way through the first first

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.090 
I got most way through the first first
chapter<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> guess<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> first<00:00:37.020> 25<00:00:37.620> I'm<00:00:37.860> stuck

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
chapter I guess the first 25 I'm stuck

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500 
chapter I guess the first 25 I'm stuck
on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> last<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.090> still<00:00:39.329> working

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
on the last one there but still working

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.630 
on the last one there but still working
at<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.780> lets<00:00:40.469> us<00:00:40.649> start<00:00:40.980> down<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.399> little

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
at it lets us start down here a little

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.490 
at it lets us start down here a little
bit<00:00:41.730> lower<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.050> show<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.260> how<00:00:43.379> this

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
bit lower I just I can show you how this

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
bit lower I just I can show you how this
works<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.000> little<00:00:45.270> turtle<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
works so you are this little turtle and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
works so you are this little turtle and
basically<00:00:46.110> jump<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> air<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
basically jump in the air and then you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.510 
basically jump in the air and then you
tilt<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.090> tilt<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.960> device<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.680> make<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.370> go

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
tilt the tilt a device to make it go

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.830 
tilt the tilt a device to make it go
wherever<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.910> want<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> go<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> basically

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
wherever you want to go so you basically

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.619 
wherever you want to go so you basically
get<00:00:52.140> jumped<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.710> air<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.180> then<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
get jumped up in the air and then and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.090 
get jumped up in the air and then and
then<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> move<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> around<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.949> on

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
then you move it around like this now on

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.130 
then you move it around like this now on
the<00:00:56.190> back<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> turtle<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.239> I'm<00:00:57.660> controlling

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the back of a turtle and I'm controlling

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.229 
the back of a turtle and I'm controlling
the<00:00:58.230> turtle<00:00:58.530> by<00:00:58.739> tilting<00:00:59.280> device<00:00:59.520> nice<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the turtle by tilting device nice you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
the turtle by tilting device nice you
can<00:01:00.359> see<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.719> pretty<00:01:00.960> simple<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.620> not

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
can see it's not pretty simple to do not

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.799 
can see it's not pretty simple to do not
a<00:01:02.250> very<00:01:02.430> complicated<00:01:02.730> game<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.660> know<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
a very complicated game but you know the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.240 
a very complicated game but you know the
graphics<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.559> cool<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.040> see

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
graphics are really cool as you can see

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.460 
graphics are really cool as you can see
