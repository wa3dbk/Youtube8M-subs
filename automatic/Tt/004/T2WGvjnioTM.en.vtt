00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.019
 hello everyone hello today i am 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.220
 I'm cooking 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:22.590
 wonderful china dish hi my recipe 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:25.230
 familiar Georgian Jumabek a real 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.960
 china hi made from lamb 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.720
 but you can use beef but 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.559
 inexpressible taste attached to lamb and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.239
 eggplant and that's the necessary set of all 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.370
 products ingredients for shuttles 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:51.559
 luggage onion avocado 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.559
 but here I am replacing the adjika river 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.739
 tomato paste 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.870
 bundle beans 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.500
 garlic and unchanged hop-suneli 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:11.580
 as well as all Georgians' favorites 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:14.180
 Tomatoes, first of all, separate the flesh 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.180
 from the bones 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:25.400
 thank you cut off mars and so the bones 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.400
 we lay down to boil the broth 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.600
 no 1 hour to find there is no lamb 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.890
 ribs 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 and we therefore chopped the ribs so we 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.850
 remove the foam 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.390
 So we add on the broth 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.470
 put here bay leaf for aroma 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:02.160
 and now we fry the meat for this we 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:07.410
 heat the pan for five minutes before 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:13.640
 ruddy crust first we cut 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.640
 eggplant with the same slices as meat 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.230
 cut eggplant into pieces 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.370
 need to fill with water and then through 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.960
 some time when it remains drained 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.640
 water would remove bitterness 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:42.360
 all other onion tomato products and 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:47.420
 turnip we grind as well as 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.890
 Eggplants Must Clean Potatoes 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.880
 one of the most essential ingredients 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.880
 china hi 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.570
 we clean the last potato 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.820
 so you see all the ingredients are ready 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:08.910
 and at this time our meat is already roasted 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.690
 the last portion of meat is all roasted 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.350

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.010
