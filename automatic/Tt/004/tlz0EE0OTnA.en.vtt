hi youtubers welcome back to Donny boys

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.440 
hi youtubers welcome back to Donny boys
sent<00:00:08.189> me<00:00:08.250> through<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.490> small<00:00:08.820> engine<00:00:09.090> dr.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
sent me through the small engine dr.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.240 
sent me through the small engine dr.
today<00:00:09.840> I'm<00:00:10.019> going<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.230> show<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.800> throttle

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
today I'm going to show you the throttle

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.280 
today I'm going to show you the throttle
linkage<00:00:11.670> configuration<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:12.690> your<00:00:12.900> older

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
linkage configuration on your older

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.390 
linkage configuration on your older
Honda<00:00:13.830> eg<00:00:14.700> 3000<00:00:15.480> generator<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.859> again<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.250> is

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
Honda eg 3000 generator so again this is

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.189 
Honda eg 3000 generator so again this is
the<00:00:17.550> same<00:00:17.760> generator<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.420> saw<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> few<00:00:18.869> videos

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the same generator you saw a few videos

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.710 
the same generator you saw a few videos
previously<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.609> question<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.029> often<00:00:21.210> get<00:00:21.480> is

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
previously and a question I often get is

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.090 
previously and a question I often get is
what<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> throttle<00:00:22.590> linkage

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
what is the throttle linkage

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340 
what is the throttle linkage
configuration<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.390> generator<00:00:24.840> while

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
configuration on this generator while

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.200 
configuration on this generator while
first<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.070> carburetors<00:00:26.609> over<00:00:26.910> here

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
first of all the carburetors over here

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.450 
first of all the carburetors over here
there's<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> throttle<00:00:28.410> shaft<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:29.039> linkage

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
there's the throttle shaft or linkage

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.580 
there's the throttle shaft or linkage
over<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.179> connected<00:00:30.660> right<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.349> there

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
over here it's connected right in there

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.850 
over here it's connected right in there
there's<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.309> close<00:00:32.579> view<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.800> now<00:00:34.800> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
there's a close view of that now you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.680 
there's a close view of that now you
follow<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.430> linkage<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> way<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
follow that linkage all the way to the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.209 
follow that linkage all the way to the
left<00:00:36.809> over<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.070> be

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
left over here and it's going to be

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.119 
left over here and it's going to be
hooked<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.910> governor<00:00:39.329> arm<00:00:39.920> which<00:00:40.920> in

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
hooked up to the governor arm which in

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
hooked up to the governor arm which in
turn<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.760> governor<00:00:42.180> arm<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.930> tough<00:00:43.170> down

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
turn that governor arm is so tough down

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.170 
turn that governor arm is so tough down
here<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> shock<00:00:44.340> coming<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> motor

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
here to a shock coming out of the motor

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.069 
here to a shock coming out of the motor
and<00:00:45.570> here's<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> better<00:00:46.590> view<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.870> shot

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and here's a better view and the shot

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.569 
and here's a better view and the shot
that<00:00:49.289> comes<00:00:49.500> down<00:00:49.710> from<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> governor<00:00:50.340> arm

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
that comes down from the governor arm

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.760 
that comes down from the governor arm
goes<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.270> little<00:00:51.629> pump<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.320> whatever

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
goes to this little pump or whatever

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.520 
goes to this little pump or whatever
vacuum<00:00:53.280> thing<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.809> this<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> auto

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
vacuum thing and this is for the auto

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.380 
vacuum thing and this is for the auto
idle<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.460> when<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> put<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> load<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
idle so when you put a load on the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
idle so when you put a load on the
engine<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.109> throttle<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.710> its

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
engine it's going to throttle up on its

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.590 
engine it's going to throttle up on its
own<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.309> there's<00:00:59.460> no<00:00:59.640> load<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
own when there's no load it's going to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.830 
own when there's no load it's going to
idle<00:01:00.899> down<00:01:01.109> that's<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.969> now

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
idle down that's what this is for now

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
idle down that's what this is for now
attached<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> governor<00:01:04.920> arm<00:01:05.129> down<00:01:05.369> here

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
attached to the governor arm down here

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
attached to the governor arm down here
is<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> spring<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> may<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.780> hard<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.229> but

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
is a spring it may be hard to see but

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
is a spring it may be hard to see but
I'll<00:01:07.680> show<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.890> from<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> other<00:01:08.430> side<00:01:08.659> and

wire here that goes to this little

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.410 
wire here that goes to this little
vacuum<00:01:31.590> thing<00:01:32.040> over<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.210> for

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
vacuum thing over here and this is for

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.999 
vacuum thing over here and this is for
the<00:01:33.509> auto<00:01:33.689> idle<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> mentioned<00:01:34.890> previously

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the auto idle as I mentioned previously

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.280 
the auto idle as I mentioned previously
and<00:01:35.579> that's<00:01:36.240> how<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> saw<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.810> down<00:01:37.049> there

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and that's how it saw that down there

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.380 
and that's how it saw that down there
now<00:01:38.189> when<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.460> look<00:01:38.579> at<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> governor<00:01:39.180> arm

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
now when you look at the governor arm

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.179 
now when you look at the governor arm
you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> spring<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.650> attached<00:01:40.979> to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you can see that a spring is attached to

you can see that a spring is attached to
it<00:01:41.369> right<00:01:41.610> where<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:41.970> finger<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.780> continues

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320

it right where my finger is it continues
right<00:01:43.799> past<00:01:44.070> behind<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.759> muffler<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.390> then

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
right past behind the muffler and then

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080 
right past behind the muffler and then
comes<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.619> rear<00:01:46.799> back<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.850> see

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it right there

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.740 
it right there
then<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.290> hooks<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.649> into<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.390> it's<00:01:51.390> actually

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
then it hooks up into here it's actually

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
then it hooks up into here it's actually
a<00:01:51.780> pretty<00:01:51.960> simple<00:01:52.159> configuration<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
a pretty simple configuration but if you

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
a pretty simple configuration but if you
come<00:01:53.759> across<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.090> used<00:01:54.450> engine<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.079> they're

come across a used engine and they're
missing<00:01:55.649> sometimes<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.759> hard<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> make

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
missing sometimes it can be hard to make

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:09.029 
missing sometimes it can be hard to make
sure<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:58.290> they're<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.530> properly<00:01:59.159> again
