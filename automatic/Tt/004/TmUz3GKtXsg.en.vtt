00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.049
 farmer and hello friends hello 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.130
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.480
 cocotte tv today I present to you 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.350
 a mouse a mouse that comes from 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.910
 from logitech 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.349
 so unfortunately we did not 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.210
 not had by traditional means 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.009
 since we solicit very 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.109
 regularly logitech we get some 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.430
 answers but we do not get the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.230
 products that is to say that we have an agreement 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.000
 as far as I have never seen yet 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.130
 to arrive a product by the ways 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.350
 traditional so for the average cost 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.029
 diverted and do not sulk our pleasure 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.269
 today we put our hands on 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.910
 one of the new logitech mice the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.200
 g500 2 proteus body so at the level of 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.050
 packaging I will pass very quickly 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.300
 a blue little box presentation of the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 mouse distributed technical data and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.660
 flap boxes that will allow you 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.160
 present the mouse under a shell 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.270
 transparent but it's not the most 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.920
 interesting so what else do you say 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.480
 that at the bundle level we have 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 quite sober thing since we have basically 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.550
 two pamphlets guarantee clauses 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.530
 and a very quick starter guide that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.850
 basically basically explains to you how 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.620
 open the hatch underneath which 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.790
 will host the peas presented so 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.930
 in this hexagonal box with 5 weights 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.750
 of 3.6 g in the shape of a chevron 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.360
 will therefore integrate the mouse if the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.790
 need to be weighed down for the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.580
 very honestly I try 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.869
 had stayed at the g9 so today we 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.270
 has a mouse so have a lot a lot 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.430
 more worked rather pleasant even 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.860
 really nice in terms of materials 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.530
 we find the soft aspect of plastic 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.320
 shiny metal rubber 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.079
 in short a mouse rather or even very 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.810
 very well finished and that it was a small 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.240
 default here is nothing to say it's rather 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.210
 well finished and it clearly breathes the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.090
 solidity so the back shell is 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.970
 separated by a small strip of plastic 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.979
 lacquered appearance a rubber part a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.600
 soft touch part 1g translucent 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.460
 have illuminated the sleeve and so 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.860
 you can see the backlight 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.049
 it's sober unfair little I have a 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.210
 part again plastic aspect 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.250
 lacquered which separates so the two clicks to 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.840
 its ends we will find on an insert 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.020
 central one button then the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.440
 scroll wheel that allows 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.950
 password 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.810
 it's free or in notched mode 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.150
 then on the right side 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.220
 we are going to have a rubber pad 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.360
 with little chevrons a little bit 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.650
 everywhere ditto on the left side who 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.270
 therefore hosts a platform with a 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.850
 blue border on which the thumb can 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.130
 come back to rest lies forward a 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.540
 button type skype hours so for 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.480
 slow down the resolution as long as it is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.800
 held two side buttons an inset 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.630
 which hosts troyes small border 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.060
 translucent that will give you number 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.990
 indications on the rise or 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.850
 down the level of the countries located in 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.270
 before two new buttons along the 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.070
 click 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.360
 so that gives a sufficient number of 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.460
 buttons to predict just about all 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.910
 situations I was saying so a 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.640
 metal wheel logitech movies 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.290
 in perfect nothing to say i'm always 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.730
 seduced by the logitech wheels in 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.560
 anyway the wheels of the gaming mice 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.080
 there is really nothing to say he masters 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.480
 the subject at this level there below us 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.620
 have the skates the famous hatch of which 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.890
 I spoke to you just now 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.150
 loving system and that had me stood 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.310
 very very well besides enough 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.900
 difficult to open but it's a good 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.980
 point for the solidity the locations 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.450
 rafters to come put the weights 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.560
 regards the sensor in the middle so the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.450
 sensor we have no indication 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.560
 regarding his provenance I could not 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.850
 tell you what is it about sure 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.630
 it's a laser that cash 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.750
 40g that offers no less than 200 dpi and 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.459
 up to a crazy thing 12000 countries I 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.810
 the tests and 2000 dpi to see well 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.820
 it's simple I'm not fast enough 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.890
 far too old it's going way too much 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.320
 quickly for me it's almost unique it is 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.280
 unusable in my 2000 are enough for me 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.459
 widely 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.230
 she embeds a memory chip as well 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.010
 than a 32-bit processor to handle everything 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.489
 that she offers five profiles that you 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.190
 to say other 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.230
 I take a look very quickly in 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.620
 five levels of forgiveness dpi and these three 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.930
 profiles 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.300
 excuse me so a mouse to take 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.680
 in hand rather consensual really that 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.930
 accepts all the grips 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.550
 that it be closed finger you not that 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.600
 you many others that it slips very 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.880
 very well that it works very well 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.560
 anyway it's a product rather 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.910
 completed cell logitech so in general 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.830
 there will still be no need to be 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.539
 honest with a sav who is downright 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.100
 well the road it remains a product all to 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.110
 recommendable 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.660
 the only flaw to be teasing a little 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.860
 little 79 euros is a bit expensive one in 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.990
 the other is not necessarily more expensive 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.610
 than average so nothing to say so much 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.530
 that it is very quickly and very 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.720
 easily promoted so a 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.400
 excellent mouse just whose 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.450
 the test will follow very soon 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.980
 on cowcotland 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.790
 I invite you to come and read it 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.930
 by the way and then I'm going to 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.070
 just want a good 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.070
 day i will tell you goodbye
