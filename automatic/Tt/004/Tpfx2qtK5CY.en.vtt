00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
anything like that you see what it does

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.640 
anything like that you see what it does
is<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:27.180> get<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> water<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.930> pop<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.500> up

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
is to get the water you pop this up

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.859 
is to get the water you pop this up
simply<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.359> while<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
simply and it's a while it's like a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.220 
simply and it's a while it's like a
straw<00:00:31.109> basically<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.989> think<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> cool

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
straw basically and I think the cool

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.049 
straw basically and I think the cool
parts<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.130> there's<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.880> little

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
parts of this are there's like a little

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.569 
parts of this are there's like a little
latch<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.190> hook<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
latch right here so you can hook it to

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.970 
latch right here so you can hook it to
like<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.120> belt<00:00:39.989> loop<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.379> whatever<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.950> know
