there<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:42.149> quite<00:00:43.020> simple

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
there we have that so quite simple

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.760 
there we have that so quite simple
design<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> let's<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.350> flick

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
design and let's go a you just flick

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.220 
design and let's go a you just flick
that<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> USB<00:00:48.059> port<00:00:48.360> pops<00:00:49.020> out

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that up and then the USB port pops out

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.840 
that up and then the USB port pops out
and<00:00:50.539> it's<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.840> button<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.140> backup<00:00:52.850> it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and it's got one button for backup it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.639 
and it's got one button for backup it
didn't<00:00:54.149> come<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.300> any<00:00:54.629> instructions<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
didn't come with any instructions in the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.700 
didn't come with any instructions in the
packet<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.960> don't<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.559> how

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
packet so I don't know really know how

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.500 
packet so I don't know really know how
to<00:00:58.739> use<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.489> I'll<00:00:59.730> have<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.210> guess<00:01:00.359> I'm

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
to use them so I'll have I guess I'm

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.620 
to use them so I'll have I guess I'm
just<00:01:00.629> gotta<00:01:00.840> put<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.289> into<00:01:01.500> my<00:01:01.770> USB<00:01:02.370> Drive
