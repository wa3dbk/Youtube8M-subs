00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
dying fire weep and up and you saw this

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.889

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
building and this building is the prison

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.620 
building and this building is the prison
and<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.860> majority<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.250> season<00:01:44.640> 3<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
and the majority of season 3 is going to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
and the majority of season 3 is going to
take<00:01:45.810> place<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.439> prison<00:01:46.799> actually<00:01:47.070> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
take place in this prison actually I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.030 
take place in this prison actually I
think<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.460> season<00:01:47.610> 3<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> um<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.040> then

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
think all of season 3 is and um and then

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.100 
think all of season 3 is and um and then
that<00:01:50.220> stories<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.790> also<00:01:50.909> continue<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.659> book<00:01:51.869> 1

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that stories can also continue in book 1

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.649 
that stories can also continue in book 1
now<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> reason<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.100> these<00:01:53.390> better<00:01:54.390> than

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
now the reason I like these better than

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
now the reason I like these better than
the<00:01:54.750> trade<00:01:54.930> paperbacks<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.860> they're<00:01:56.310> much

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the trade paperbacks is a they're much
