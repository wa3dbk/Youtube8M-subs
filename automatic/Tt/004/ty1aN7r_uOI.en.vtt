of our brushes here I'm going to start
out<00:01:46.780> with<00:01:47.780> yellow<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:50.469> this<00:01:51.469> may<00:01:51.679> not<00:01:51.859> look

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
out with yellow and this may not look

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.779

like<00:01:52.399> very<00:01:52.609> much<00:01:52.880> at<00:01:53.119> first<00:01:53.389> but<00:01:54.579> they<00:01:55.579> look

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
like very much at first but they look

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.760 
like very much at first but they look
pretty<00:01:55.999> sweet<00:01:56.420> when<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.659> get<00:01:56.869> done<00:01:57.079> with<00:01:57.289> them

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
yellow don't have to be perfect because

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.300 
yellow don't have to be perfect because
they're<00:02:05.420> flames<00:02:05.749> they're<00:02:06.380> not<00:02:06.590> all<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.280> same

they're flames they're not all the same

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.699 
they're flames they're not all the same
size<00:02:07.759> makes<00:02:08.240> them<00:02:08.360> bigger<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.899> some<00:02:09.289> smaller

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
size makes them bigger and some smaller

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.570
