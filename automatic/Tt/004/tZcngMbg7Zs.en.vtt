00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:36.589 
probably wondering why we're in the

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:38.530 
probably wondering why we're in the
front<00:00:36.830> of<00:00:36.920> this<00:00:37.040> video<00:00:37.430> like<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.330> boss

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
front of this video like this the boss

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.020 
front of this video like this the boss
thought<00:00:38.989> that<00:00:39.710> would<00:00:39.830> be<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:39.979> good<00:00:40.280> idea<00:00:40.430> to

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
thought that would be a good idea to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.350 
thought that would be a good idea to
introduce<00:00:41.239> ourselves<00:00:41.809> people<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:43.360> the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
introduce ourselves people and the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.990 
introduce ourselves people and the
reason<00:00:44.540> that<00:00:44.989> pops<00:00:45.350> is<00:00:45.680> doing<00:00:46.070> it<00:00:46.250> is<00:00:46.519> so<00:00:46.850> that

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
reason that pops is doing it is so that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.160 
reason that pops is doing it is so that
he<00:00:47.150> gets<00:00:47.390> out<00:00:47.750> of<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.989> chair<00:00:48.260> yeah<00:00:50.170> being

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
he gets out of a chair yeah being

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.090
