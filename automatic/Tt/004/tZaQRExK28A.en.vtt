than hard line on and try this out you
can<00:00:42.360> probably<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.840> more<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.440> let<00:00:43.559> me<00:00:43.710> in

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
can probably get more to just let me in

people all of them they was born back in
the<00:00:59.070> same<00:00:59.280> spoon<00:00:59.520> point<00:00:59.820> as<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.120> start<00:01:00.539> so

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the same spoon point as they start so

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
the same spoon point as they start so
Harry<00:01:01.350> had<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> same<00:01:01.920> spot<00:01:02.309> where<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.520> start

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
chocolate already now to respond shot

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.670 
chocolate already now to respond shot
them<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.810> they've<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:12.869> no<00:01:13.140> chance<00:01:13.439> did

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
them and they've got no chance did

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.830 
them and they've got no chance did
probably<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.100> team<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.549> people<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.119> played<00:01:15.720> by

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
probably a team of people that played by

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.719 
probably a team of people that played by
objectives<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.619> domination<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.280> kept<00:01:17.549> your

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
objectives and domination you kept your

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.039 
objectives and domination you kept your
flags<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.860> are<00:01:20.250> gonna<00:01:20.460> make<00:01:20.549> their

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
flags and I are gonna make their

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.230 
flags and I are gonna make their
straight<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> spawn<00:01:24.060> rate

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
straight and now to the spawn rate

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.320 
straight and now to the spawn rate
member<00:01:24.570> guess<00:01:24.890> also<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.729> no<00:01:26.880> chance<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
member guess also they have no chance to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.580 
member guess also they have no chance to
shoot<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.659> chopper<00:01:27.869> dark<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.530> can

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
shoot a chopper dark because as you can

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.780 
shoot a chopper dark because as you can
see

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
see

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.520 
see
now<00:01:31.220> somewhat<00:01:32.220> short<00:01:32.580> done<00:01:33.320> but<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.410> keep

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
now somewhat short done but to keep

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.220 
now somewhat short done but to keep
trying<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.830> get<00:01:34.950> clear<00:01:35.220> view<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> think<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:36.230> don't

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
trying to get clear view I think I don't

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.660 
trying to get clear view I think I don't
know<00:01:37.290> Bob<00:01:37.740> I'm<00:01:37.920> playing<00:01:38.190> against<00:01:38.370> bunch<00:01:38.550> of
