00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.540
 Hello, it's Simon 's new muscle 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.280
 maker in this video is about if its 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.230
 a mac os the short form of it 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.880
 the video title is guaranteed 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.529
 one or the other already read 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.390
 heard or maybe even yourself 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.580
 is nourished ever after this motto 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.500
 14 max means proverbial or 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.090
 literally translates as much as if it were 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.220
 fits the macro nutrients 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.470
 or to your micronutrient 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 distribution and exactly the distribution of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.000
 micronutrients of the proteins of the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.190
 Carbohydrates and the fat are involved 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 of these nutritional strategies 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.129
 or that is almost like that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 become a question of faith with this 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.879
 effect going on many say that is 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.379
 actually everything you have to pay attention to 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.239
 some say that he can his 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.160
 pieces still quite different things behind it 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.350
 in this video it is now time 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.760
 to get rid of this effect mac is there 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.120
 already a big part of the wisdom 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.890
 in it 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.390
 I also tell you as much as there is 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.949
 Many points of criticism I believe there can 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.030
 I also have a great video yet to do 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.890
 and twice as a little bit 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.410
 compare because if you just look at 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.719
 efficiency then no matter how come 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.549
 we later to what now means exactly 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.619
 this nutrient distribution of the macro 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.140
 nutrients we once have the proteins 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.610
 the carbohydrates and fat, the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.409
 if you divide up you give yourself up 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.600
 so to speak the defense says to 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.520
 for example, two grams of proteins per 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.770
 kilogram body weight then you say 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.340
 itself okay I'm going to 50 on the day 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.229
 grams of fat 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.299
 the rest for you with the carbohydrates 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.430
 on total, you may come up 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.869
 three and a half 1000 kilocalories is 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.189
 Of course, a very important value 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.229
 that you reckon that you say 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.939
 okay i have approximate consumption now 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.560
 from three and a half 1000 kilocalories 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.960
 they are made up of proteins 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.240
 carbohydrates fatty acids and exactly 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.530
 I have to come back every day 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.270
 Of course that is already relative 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.500
 Simple when you buy groceries 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 Collection for you not really 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.040
 deal with the raw materials 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.020
 does not have to think about it now 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.189
 here sugar of the included so that it 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.630
 Here it is a bad thing for me 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.180
 somehow clogging the arteries 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.250
 but you just look fat and 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.020
 fat eats you look at carbohydrates and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.759
 Carbohydrates are carbohydrates and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.350
 just like the egg white let me guess 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.149
 Of course these are the white ones 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.979
 White are all you have with you 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.899
 need to know basically that enough 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.700
 completely out of total you are looking 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.990
 just that you have a meal together 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.550
 build for you the defaults 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.170
 not you can now for example 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.610
 McDonald's go and can you do one 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.380
 cheeseburger with a portion 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.970
 fries and if that of the caloric 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.550
 Margin and the distribution of the macro 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.760
 Nutrients of egg whites of carbohydrates 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.620
 and the fat is similar 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.600
 For example, salmon with brown rice and 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.740
 butter vegetables then this will be 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.060
 meals taken in the basics 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.590
 considered equivalent 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.930
 important as I said the distribution 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.970
 The micronutrients resulting from it 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.030
 then, of course, the entire number 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.950
 the calories prescribed on the day and after 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.510
 you can go and I believe there can 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.060
 you hardly say anything about it 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.830
 edition mac os say that very many 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.690
 people are very successful on the way 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.340
 many athletes are also from 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.930
 nutrition does not have that much idea 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.030
 if you like this basic principle 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.950
 already really big sales 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.810
 jumps make the success can their 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.160
 getting food under control and also 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.180
 someone who is really having nutrition 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.920
 not so profound yet 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.300
 has dealt it can 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.040
 Already very well oriented 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.740
 Nevertheless, I have already hinted 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.570
 let go ff14 mac is not that now 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.980
 what makes the whole diet 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.720
 in my opinion there is more 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.070
 Things that play in there with the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.010
 maybe a criticism of 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.650
 apple mac pros are or the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.000
 outfits merkurs reveals her limitations 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.980
 as I said I already have it 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.930
 it's not all there is to it 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.760
 is a lot, but it does not work 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.080
 Everything from if you are interested then 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.640
 Write me the comments then do it 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.170
 I have some videos where I am 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.910
 maybe this wild pc mac os again 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.440
 with a clean diet always like that 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.910
 a little bit compare respectively 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.830
 there just a little battle in the 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.300
 worst of the battle organizer writes 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.190
 me the comments if you have more 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.890
 otherwise, first wanted to know this 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.960
 video super basics for efficiency 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.060
 nutritional motto we'll see you in 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.060
 next video many greetings your simon
