lot of good things I thought we spend a
lot<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.600> time<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:25.019> Iran<00:00:25.550> you<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.789> could

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
lot of time in Iran you know we could

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.490 
lot of time in Iran you know we could
spend<00:00:27.150> most<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> night<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.990> thought<00:00:28.199> most

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
spend most of the night I thought most

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.710 
spend most of the night I thought most
of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.769> night<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> puck<00:00:29.539> but<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
of the night with the puck but at the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.479 
of the night with the puck but at the
end<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> night<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.710> know<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:32.160> didn't<00:00:32.369> they

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
end of the night you know we didn't they

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.310 
end of the night you know we didn't they
didn't<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> results<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.110> that's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
didn't get the results so that's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.569 
didn't get the results so that's
probably<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.739> thing<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.980> sticks<00:00:35.370> out<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
probably the thing that sticks out the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.520 
probably the thing that sticks out the
most<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> doesn't<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.410> some

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
most and the doesn't have to make some

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770 
most and the doesn't have to make some
adjustments<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.250> understand<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> if

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
adjustments and understand that the if

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.209 
adjustments and understand that the if
we're<00:00:39.930> gonna<00:00:40.050> score<00:00:40.260> goals<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.649> had<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> be

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
we're gonna score goals we had to be

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.650 
we're gonna score goals we had to be
paid<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> price<00:00:41.760> little<00:00:42.030> bit<00:00:42.120> better<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
paid a price little bit better on the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.770 
paid a price little bit better on the
net<00:00:43.700> one<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> players<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.539> had<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
net one of the players that you had that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020 
net one of the players that you had that
pays<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.320> price<00:00:46.469> very<00:00:47.219> strongly<00:00:47.550> over<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
pays the price very strongly over the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.369 
pays the price very strongly over the
past<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> Neal<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.719> new<00:00:48.899> church<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.350> you

past is Neal a new church can you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.160 
past is Neal a new church can you

evaluate his performance in Game one
well<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.629> although

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
well I think we all know that although

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420 
well I think we all know that although
we<00:00:54.809> play<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> decent<00:00:55.649> game<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.129> all<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
we play the decent game we can all be a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.290 
we play the decent game we can all be a
little<00:00:56.699> better<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.180> think<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> team<00:00:59.059> we<00:01:00.059> feel

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
little better I think as a team we feel

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.610 
little better I think as a team we feel
that<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.199> better<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
that we can be a little better and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.219 
that we can be a little better and
that's<00:01:02.609> basically<00:01:03.000> hit<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> man

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that's basically hit and that's to a man

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.070 
that's basically hit and that's to a man
and<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:05.220> necessarily<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.450> putting<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
and not necessarily just putting all the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
and not necessarily just putting all the
emphasis<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.070> guy<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.729> no<00:01:09.360> doubt

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
emphasis on one guy but the no doubt

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.210 
emphasis on one guy but the no doubt
this<00:01:09.750> guy<00:01:09.930> has<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> big<00:01:10.320> impact<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.890> our<00:01:11.040> hockey

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
this guy has a big impact on our hockey

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.219 
this guy has a big impact on our hockey
club<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.820> certainly<00:01:12.630> need<00:01:12.840> him<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> the

others best flown you spoke last night

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.260 
others best flown you spoke last night
to<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.560> fact<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.890> Carey<00:01:17.580> Price<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:18.060> seeing

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
to the fact that Carey Price was seeing

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.050 
to the fact that Carey Price was seeing
too<00:01:18.420> many<00:01:18.540> pucks<00:01:19.130> practice<00:01:20.130> today<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.790> in

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
too many pucks practice today is that in

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.210 
too many pucks practice today is that in
large<00:01:21.720> part<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> build<00:01:22.439> some<00:01:22.619> net<00:01:22.799> presence

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
large part to build some net presence

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.060 
large part to build some net presence
well<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.619> we<00:01:25.619> went<00:01:25.799> through<00:01:25.920> some

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
well I think we we went through some

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.380 
well I think we we went through some
drills<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:26.400> those<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:26.820> year<00:01:27.060> long<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
drills me those are all year long and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.429 
drills me those are all year long and
you<00:01:27.540> know<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.750> got<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> little<00:01:28.290> better

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
you know we got to be a little better

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.649 
you know we got to be a little better
down<00:01:29.040> low<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.310> stronger<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
down low and stronger on the and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.020 
down low and stronger on the and
those<00:01:31.619> kind<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.920> things<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.369> part<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.000> was

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
those kind of things and part of it was

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.810 
those kind of things and part of it was
that<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.570> also<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.280> be

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that but also we know that we have to be

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.640 
that but also we know that we have to be
a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.060> bit<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.360> involved<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.930> some<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
a little bit more involved and some of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.800 
a little bit more involved and some of
it<00:01:37.799> netfront<00:01:38.100> presence<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:38.970> necessarily

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
it netfront presence is not necessarily

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.390 
it netfront presence is not necessarily
something<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> practice<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:41.280> than

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
something you have to practice more than

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.120 
something you have to practice more than
it's<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.579> mindset<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.200> commit

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it's a mindset and if we commit

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.060 
it's a mindset and if we commit
ourselves<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.680> we'll<00:01:46.680> get<00:01:46.860> there

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
ourselves to go in there we'll get there

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.139 
ourselves to go in there we'll get there
and<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.310> sometimes<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.030> work

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
and we sometimes you have to work

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.850 
and we sometimes you have to work
through<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:48.659> they're<00:01:49.290> they're<00:01:49.649> doing

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
through it because they're they're doing

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.770 
through it because they're they're doing
a<00:01:49.890> pretty<00:01:50.040> good<00:01:50.130> job<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.460> boxing<00:01:50.729> us<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.149> is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
a pretty good job of boxing us out is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.999 
a pretty good job of boxing us out is
there<00:01:51.930> any<00:01:52.049> concern<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.619> time<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
there any concern at this time of the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.679 
there any concern at this time of the
year<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.610> are<00:01:53.790> really<00:01:54.060> cluttering

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
year that if you are really cluttering

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.749 
year that if you are really cluttering
up<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.110> blue<00:01:55.320> ice<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.740> very<00:01:55.920> close<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
up the blue ice or very close to it that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.850 
up the blue ice or very close to it that
the<00:01:57.090> officials<00:01:57.479> may<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> fairly<00:01:58.560> stern

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the officials may take a fairly stern

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.910 
the officials may take a fairly stern
view<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
view of that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.620 
view of that
you're<00:02:00.430> allowed<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.820> be<00:02:00.909> in<00:02:00.939> front<00:02:01.210> as<00:02:01.360> much<00:02:01.509> as

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
you're allowed to be in front as much as

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.880 
you're allowed to be in front as much as
you<00:02:01.720> want<00:02:01.930> as<00:02:02.170> long<00:02:02.290> as<00:02:02.439> you're<00:02:02.530> not<00:02:02.560> in<00:02:02.799> the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
you want as long as you're not in the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.999 
you want as long as you're not in the
crease<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.340> you're<00:02:04.180> not<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:05.009> interfering

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
crease and you're not the interfering

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.190 
crease and you're not the interfering
with<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.159> goaltender<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:06.820> that's<00:02:07.270> something

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
with the goaltender so that's something

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
with the goaltender so that's something
that<00:02:08.349> you<00:02:08.500> see<00:02:08.649> every<00:02:08.830> year<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.130> playoffs

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
that you see every year in the playoffs

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.370 
that you see every year in the playoffs
all<00:02:10.179> teams<00:02:10.420> do<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.869> don't<00:02:11.050> think<00:02:11.230> we're

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
all teams do that I don't think we're

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.510 
all teams do that I don't think we're
looking<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.650> do<00:02:11.770> anything<00:02:11.980> different<00:02:12.400> than

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
looking to do anything different than

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.100 
looking to do anything different than
any<00:02:13.060> other<00:02:13.120> team<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:13.569> we<00:02:13.660> need<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:13.989> it

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
any other team but we need to do it

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.610 
any other team but we need to do it
better<00:02:15.150> from<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.300> tactical<00:02:16.569> standpoint<00:02:17.050> how<00:02:17.560> do

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
better from a tactical standpoint how do

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.830 
better from a tactical standpoint how do
you<00:02:17.800> try<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.130> fight<00:02:18.430> off<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.730> turnover<00:02:21.840> well

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
you try to fight off the turnover well

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.160 
you try to fight off the turnover well
obviously<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.920> second<00:02:24.280> one<00:02:24.430> with<00:02:24.610> was<00:02:25.150> when<00:02:26.140> I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
obviously the second one with was when I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.780 
obviously the second one with was when I
really<00:02:26.500> hurt<00:02:26.680> us<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:26.920> lot<00:02:27.100> but<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.370> first<00:02:27.550> one

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
really hurt us a lot but the first one

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.970 
really hurt us a lot but the first one
is<00:02:27.819> well<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.239> was<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> bad<00:02:28.569> reverse<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.230> we

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
is well it was a bad reverse and we

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.170 
is well it was a bad reverse and we
didn't<00:02:30.130> get<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.489> as<00:02:30.610> well<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.030> you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
didn't get to it as well so you

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.250 
didn't get to it as well so you
certainly<00:02:31.420> have<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.780> cut<00:02:31.900> down<00:02:32.019> on<00:02:32.080> those

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
certainly have to cut down on those

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.380 
certainly have to cut down on those
mistakes<00:02:32.709> we<00:02:32.950> know<00:02:33.069> that<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:34.360> know

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
mistakes we know that but that you know

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.360 
mistakes we know that but that you know
I<00:02:34.510> think<00:02:34.870> they<00:02:35.080> made<00:02:35.260> some<00:02:35.500> some<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.950> those<00:02:36.040> and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
I think they made some some of those and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.860 
I think they made some some of those and
we<00:02:36.670> weren't<00:02:36.819> able<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.120> capitalize<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:37.569> them

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
we weren't able to capitalize on them

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.100 
we weren't able to capitalize on them
and<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.680> was<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.799> big<00:02:38.980> difference<00:02:40.110> what

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
and that that was a big difference what

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.059 
and that that was a big difference what
do<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.260> say<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.500> your<00:02:41.620> team<00:02:41.799> how<00:02:41.950> do<00:02:42.010> you

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
do you say to your team how do you

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.710 
do you say to your team how do you
practice<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.610> open<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.209> just<00:02:43.360> seems<00:02:43.480> like<00:02:43.569> me

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
practice that open it just seems like me

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.390 
practice that open it just seems like me
that's<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.019> bit<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.350> or<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.739> line<00:02:45.010> set<00:02:45.280> as

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
that's a bit of a or the line set as

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.640 
that's a bit of a or the line set as
well<00:02:45.580> no<00:02:45.819> I<00:02:45.850> think<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.450> normal<00:02:47.049> anuses

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
well no I think it's a normal anuses

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.380 
well no I think it's a normal anuses
isn't<00:02:48.220> don't<00:02:48.670> think<00:02:48.790> it's<00:02:48.910> as<00:02:49.000> much<00:02:49.150> to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
isn't don't think it's as much to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.520 
isn't don't think it's as much to
practice<00:02:49.810> more<00:02:49.959> than<00:02:50.110> we<00:02:50.170> have<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.380> be<00:02:50.500> a

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
practice more than we have to be a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.340 
practice more than we have to be a
little<00:02:51.100> sharper<00:02:51.430> with<00:02:51.519> our<00:02:51.640> decision<00:02:51.880> making

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
little sharper with our decision making

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.750 
little sharper with our decision making
well<00:02:53.350> we'll<00:02:53.590> talk<00:02:53.830> about<00:02:53.980> discipline<00:02:54.549> do<00:02:54.670> you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
well we'll talk about discipline do you

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.460 
well we'll talk about discipline do you
think<00:02:54.940> teams<00:02:55.480> tailed<00:02:55.840> back<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.080> little<00:02:56.350> bit

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
think teams tailed back a little bit

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.880 
think teams tailed back a little bit
last<00:02:56.620> night<00:02:57.180> well<00:02:58.180> i<00:02:58.209> think<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:59.140> know<00:02:59.170> we're

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
last night well i think you know we're

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.440 
last night well i think you know we're
talking<00:03:00.190> about<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.340> team<00:03:00.580> being<00:03:00.760> physical<00:03:01.330> i

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
talking about a team being physical i

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.330 
talking about a team being physical i
think<00:03:01.630> we<00:03:01.750> want<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.049> be<00:03:02.140> physical<00:03:02.650> but<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
think we want to be physical but you

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.000 
think we want to be physical but you
know<00:03:03.570> it's<00:03:04.570> also<00:03:04.810> can<00:03:05.170> be<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.320> challenge<00:03:05.799> when

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
know it's also can be a challenge when

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.520 
know it's also can be a challenge when
you<00:03:06.579> feel<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.820> you've<00:03:07.090> played<00:03:07.350> most<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
you feel that you've played most of the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.050 
you feel that you've played most of the
night<00:03:08.650> with<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.890> puppy<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.400> mean<00:03:09.730> we<00:03:09.850> had<00:03:09.970> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
night with the puppy I mean we had the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.599 
night with the puppy I mean we had the
puck<00:03:10.209> all<00:03:10.390> night<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:10.930> then<00:03:11.890> when<00:03:12.130> we<00:03:12.250> they

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
puck all night so then when we they

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.890 
puck all night so then when we they
didn't<00:03:12.820> spend<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.060> much<00:03:13.239> time<00:03:13.269> in<00:03:13.510> our<00:03:13.630> own<00:03:13.780> n

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
didn't spend that much time in our own n

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.210 
didn't spend that much time in our own n
so<00:03:14.049> are<00:03:14.140> these<00:03:14.320> couldn't<00:03:14.680> really<00:03:14.829> get<00:03:15.010> that

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
so are these couldn't really get that

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.699 
so are these couldn't really get that
involved<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.269> physically<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.260> when<00:03:17.470> we<00:03:17.590> had

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
involved that physically and when we had

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.770 
involved that physically and when we had
the<00:03:17.739> puck<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.459> every<00:03:18.640> one<00:03:18.790> end<00:03:18.970> you're<00:03:19.660> not

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
the puck in every one end you're not

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.970 
the puck in every one end you're not
hitting<00:03:19.959> on<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.230> when<00:03:20.500> you're<00:03:20.620> controlling

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
hitting on you when you're controlling

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.530 
hitting on you when you're controlling
it<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.579> think<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:22.000> was<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.239> bit<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.510> a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
it so I think that was a bit of a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.120 
it so I think that was a bit of a
challenge<00:03:22.750> we've<00:03:23.260> still<00:03:23.530> got<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:23.980> know<00:03:24.100> a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
challenge we've still got you know a

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.580 
challenge we've still got you know a
fair<00:03:24.340> number<00:03:24.489> of<00:03:24.670> hits<00:03:24.880> but<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.840> think<00:03:26.440> that

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
fair number of hits but the I think that

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.670 
fair number of hits but the I think that
kind<00:03:26.829> of<00:03:26.920> deflated<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.579> I<00:03:28.060> guess<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.019> the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
kind of deflated the I guess the the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.170 
kind of deflated the I guess the the
physical<00:03:30.070> aspect<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.640> our<00:03:30.790> game

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.140 

well<00:03:34.629> you<00:03:34.780> guys<00:03:35.340> started<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.489> one<00:03:36.879> in<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
well you guys started a one in the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.660 
well you guys started a one in the
playoffs<00:03:37.569> last<00:03:37.840> year<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:40.239> be<00:03:40.359> learning

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
playoffs last year to be learning

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.110 
playoffs last year to be learning
situation<00:03:42.670> like

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
situation like

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.500 
situation like
yeah<00:03:44.019> I<00:03:44.049> think<00:03:44.290> that's<00:03:45.099> why<00:03:45.250> they're<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.730> best

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
yeah I think that's why they're the best

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.839 
yeah I think that's why they're the best
out<00:03:46.659> of<00:03:46.690> seven<00:03:46.930> here<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.409> it's<00:03:47.620> 11<00:03:48.220> loss<00:03:48.459> here

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
out of seven here is it's 11 loss here

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.130 
out of seven here is it's 11 loss here
and<00:03:49.030> that's<00:03:49.180> not<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.360> end<00:03:49.629> of<00:03:49.659> the<00:03:49.720> world<00:03:49.930> but

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
and that's not the end of the world but

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.869 
and that's not the end of the world but
we<00:03:50.920> have<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.129> understand<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:51.640> we<00:03:51.730> gotta

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
we have to understand that we gotta

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.940 
we have to understand that we gotta
bounce<00:03:52.090> back<00:03:52.360> next<00:03:52.599> game<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.049> that's<00:03:53.769> as

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
bounce back next game and that's as

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.250 
bounce back next game and that's as
simple<00:03:54.129> as<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.659> playoffs

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
simple as that and in the playoffs

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.390 
simple as that and in the playoffs
sometimes<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.799> have<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.010> have<00:03:57.099> a<00:03:57.129> short

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
sometimes you have to have a short

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.000 
sometimes you have to have a short
memory<00:03:57.549> and<00:03:57.970> you've<00:03:58.659> got<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.840> be<00:03:58.959> able<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.829> turn

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
memory and you've got to be able to turn

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.430 
memory and you've got to be able to turn
the<00:04:00.129> page<00:04:00.310> quickly<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:01.030> then<00:04:01.140> bounce<00:04:02.140> back

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
the page quickly and then bounce back

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.319 
the page quickly and then bounce back
and<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:03.010> eridian<00:04:03.370> focus<00:04:03.730> for<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:03.970> next<00:04:04.000> game

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
and the eridian focus for the next game

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.500 
and the eridian focus for the next game
that's<00:04:04.599> what<00:04:04.750> we're<00:04:04.870> trying<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.110> do<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
that's what we're trying to do the

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.530 
that's what we're trying to do the
outside<00:04:07.840> well<00:04:08.409> you<00:04:08.560> mentioned<00:04:09.269> regarding<00:04:10.269> the

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
is due and but you know at the same time

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.439 
is due and but you know at the same time
you<00:04:39.010> got<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.220> look<00:04:39.280> at<00:04:39.430> your<00:04:39.610> team<00:04:39.820> and<00:04:40.000> and
