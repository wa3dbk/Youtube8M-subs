00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.610
 good morning a devolved kitchen goes today 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.790
 we will prepare a raw food recipe i 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.380
 fusilli with cauliflower and tomatoes for 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.330
 as for the equipment there 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.570
 you need a mixer a raw blender 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.400
 food a potato peeler and a utensil for 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.740
 spiral decoration 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.500
 there are two types as you see here 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.900
 in video the first one here is that 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.180
 that we will use with whom we create 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.520
 more than the actual fusilli of the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.470
 springs and the second with which one makes a 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.000
 pasta cut much more similar to 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.440
 fusilli with regard to 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.829
 ingredients for two portions there 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.480
 needed for the fusilli 2 celery rapa ce 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.399
 it takes two rather than one 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.190
 because the waste in this type of 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.329
 pasta cutting is quite conspicuous for 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:03.140
 the dressing 300 g of tomato sauce 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.840
 40 g of dried tomatoes 150 g of buds 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.609
 of cauliflower a spoon of cook a cd 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.950
 salted under apple vinegar not 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.289
 pasteurized a tablespoon of onions 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.329
 dried a few basil leaves 2 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.789
 spoons of chopped parsley a 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.289
 spoon of almond oil oil 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.299
 cold pressed extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.289
 just a pinch of chili pepper 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.539
 red dried powder optional 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.029
 as always whole or pink sea salt 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.170
 as far as the Himalayas are concerned, we move on 

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:32.299
 Preparation 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.420
 first thing after washing the 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.409
 so we send celery rapa Italian 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.189
 with a knife 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:44.060
 the roots and with the potato peeler the part 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.999
 external so we perfect the cleaning 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.009
 always using the knife then 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:51.709
 all residual parts of the part 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.039
 outside after cutting the parts 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:58.039
 terminals of celeriac we divide the 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.529
 disc in two parts 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.959
 every part should be spent at least 

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:05.540
 four centimeters to get i 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.000
 fusilli now we sink 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.640
 celery is the tip of this 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.370
 tool and we use it as if it were 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.740
 a corkscrew then we turn 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.080
 we prefer to do it this way but the 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.340
 the most appropriate technique would be that 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.410
 to screw the selected vegetable 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.780
 around this tool and not 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.150
 vice versa as we are doing 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.240
 once the awl is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.150
 completely sunk we remove the 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.850
 we handle it and then get it 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.940
 from the celery turn the pulp cut into 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.650
 fusillo we separate the fusilli a lot 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.770
 gently such that you don't 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.709
 break we suggest in any case of 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.380
 make this type of pasta on occasions 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.790
 details because it is not a 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.230
 dish suitable for everyday life because 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.100
 its quite takes time 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.520
 processing 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.560
 here's how you see the gap is pretty 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.870
 abundant obviously with this record 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.750
 pierced we can create others 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.700
 preparations of soups dedicate ourselves 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.400
 now nothing simpler to season 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.040
 in this case we must limit ourselves to 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.519
 blend all the ingredients together 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.410
 which we listed at the beginning 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.200
 then the fresh tomatoes tomatoes 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.930
 dried the cauliflower the onion 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.610
 dehydrated a pinch of chilli the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.730
 sales and put the two leaves of 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.010
 basil and finally the oil as required 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.100
 that we put together as and when 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.810
 frulliamo we have to keep a sauce 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.810
 quite chopped up 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.010
 here is this is the dressing sauce 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.360
 we got 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.340
 mix the fusilli and the sauce well 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.540
 we are ready for the presentation 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.740
 let's cut some coupon washer that 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.870
 we are not very fast on 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.520
 parsley well dried with half 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.650
 moon and we do it to fall to rain 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.800
 on fusilli then we end with one 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.890
 nice sprinkling of almond flour i 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.040
 fusilli with cauliflower and tomatoes are 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.420
 ready good devolving food to all e 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.420
