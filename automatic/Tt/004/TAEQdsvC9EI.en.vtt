because<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.530> list<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.719> really<00:01:18.719> nice

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
because the list of really nice

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.109 
because the list of really nice
materials<00:01:20.850> are<00:01:21.299> ridiculously<00:01:22.259> good<00:01:22.530> quality

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
materials are ridiculously good quality

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.560 
materials are ridiculously good quality
plenty<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> grip<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.630> stool<00:01:24.930> all<00:01:25.380> round

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
plenty of grip on the stool all round

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.399 
plenty of grip on the stool all round
well<00:01:27.570> bonded<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.679> rest<00:01:28.859> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> material

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
well bonded to the rest of the material

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.219 
well bonded to the rest of the material
everything<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.530> double<00:01:31.710> stitched<00:01:33.020> see<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
everything is double stitched see on the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.209 
everything is double stitched see on the
sides<00:01:34.469> they're<00:01:34.799> double<00:01:35.609> stitched<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:37.219> the

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
sides they're double stitched and the

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.520 
sides they're double stitched and the
idea<00:01:38.520> behind<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.969> is<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:40.380> you're

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
idea behind this is that when you're

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
idea behind this is that when you're
walking<00:01:40.649> through<00:01:40.859> Heather<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:42.020> brambles

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
walking through Heather and brambles

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.429 
walking through Heather and brambles
which<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.649> both<00:01:43.890> extremely<00:01:44.340> abrasive<00:01:45.439> this

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
which are both extremely abrasive this

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.270 
which are both extremely abrasive this
stuff<00:01:46.740> should<00:01:47.340> prevent<00:01:48.049> too<00:01:49.049> much<00:01:49.259> wear<00:01:49.590> on

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
stuff should prevent too much wear on

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.429 
stuff should prevent too much wear on
your<00:01:50.579> boots

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
your boots

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.770

them all beaten up but I think that'll

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.900 
them all beaten up but I think that'll
be<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.770> while<00:04:24.979> before<00:04:25.160> they<00:04:25.400> get<00:04:25.490> beaten<00:04:25.790> up

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
be a while before they get beaten up

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.510 
be a while before they get beaten up
