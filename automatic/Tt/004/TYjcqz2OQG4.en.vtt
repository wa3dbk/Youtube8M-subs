00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
this right now my brothers like causing

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.920 
this right now my brothers like causing
you<00:02:35.710> I<00:02:36.040> seriously<00:02:36.970> think<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> beds<00:02:37.690> gonna

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
you I seriously think the beds gonna

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.980 
you I seriously think the beds gonna
break<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:39.120> because<00:02:40.120> he<00:02:40.240> keeps<00:02:40.390> like<00:02:40.630> moving

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
break is it because he keeps like moving

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.290 
break is it because he keeps like moving
the<00:02:41.140> little<00:02:41.260> bed<00:02:41.590> house<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.610> could<00:02:42.820> hear<00:02:43.150> it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
the little bed house and I could hear it

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.010 
the little bed house and I could hear it
cracking<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:45.130> yeah<00:02:45.310> hopefully<00:02:46.090> doesn't<00:02:46.720> make

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
cracking so yeah hopefully doesn't make

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.780 
cracking so yeah hopefully doesn't make
it<00:02:47.170> does<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.830> make<00:02:47.860> videos<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.580> stuff

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790

start with a Charmander Magikarp and I
see<00:03:22.900> something<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.500> back<00:03:24.510> simple<00:03:27.120> Krogan

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
see something in the back simple Krogan

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.000 
see something in the back simple Krogan
our<00:03:30.010> reverse<00:03:30.610> is<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.030> Torchic<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:32.050> guess<00:03:32.470> this
