so using your plastic knife you can just

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.010 
so using your plastic knife you can just
pop<00:02:29.820> these<00:02:30.000> up<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.280> one<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.540> pop<00:02:33.900> it

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
pop these up and this one so just pop it

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.710 
pop these up and this one so just pop it
out

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.250 

there<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.410> go<00:02:42.830> CAS<00:02:43.830> your<00:02:43.890> screen<00:02:44.640> assembly

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
there you go CAS your screen assembly

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.800 
there you go CAS your screen assembly
now<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.380> can't<00:02:46.620> change<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.310> LCD<00:02:48.030> or<00:02:48.270> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
now you can't change the LCD or the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.770 
now you can't change the LCD or the
digitizer<00:02:49.260> separately<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.100> comes<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.580> a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
digitizer separately it comes as a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.850 
digitizer separately it comes as a
bonded<00:02:51.780> pair<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.380> have<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.560> replace<00:02:52.800> it

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
bonded pair so you have to replace it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.330 
bonded pair so you have to replace it
that's<00:02:53.580> one<00:02:53.760> part<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.560> bit<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.770> iPhone<00:02:56.070> 4

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
that's one part a bit like the iPhone 4

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.590 
that's one part a bit like the iPhone 4
and<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.580> 4s<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.470> reassembly<00:02:59.220> watch<00:03:00.120> out<00:03:00.420> for

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
and the 4s so reassembly watch out for

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.050 
and the 4s so reassembly watch out for
these<00:03:00.750> small<00:03:01.080> screw<00:03:01.410> that's<00:03:01.880> wouldn't<00:03:02.880> come

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
these small screw that's wouldn't come

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.640 
these small screw that's wouldn't come
out<00:03:03.240> because<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.540> does<00:03:03.930> come<00:03:04.170> out<00:03:04.200> from<00:03:04.530> this

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
out because it does come out from this

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.580 
out because it does come out from this
side<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.690> be<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> bit<00:03:06.990> fiddly

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
side it can be a bit fiddly

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.190 
side it can be a bit fiddly
there<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.430> go<00:03:08.580> se<00:03:08.820> comes<00:03:09.090> out<00:03:09.330> so<00:03:10.020> make<00:03:10.170> sure

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
there you go se comes out so make sure

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.480 
there you go se comes out so make sure
that<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.250> put<00:03:12.150> back<00:03:12.300> in<00:03:12.510> there<00:03:13.310> also<00:03:16.490> now

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
that that is put back in there also now

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.320 
that that is put back in there also now
offer<00:03:17.520> up<00:03:17.850> your<00:03:18.680> screen<00:03:19.680> assembly<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.520> put

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
little push you should feel it snap into

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.940 
little push you should feel it snap into
place<00:03:35.370> there<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:35.940> go<00:03:36.560> then<00:03:37.560> take<00:03:37.800> these

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
to do this screw back up the top here

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.470 
to do this screw back up the top here
then<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.200> can<00:04:43.410> be<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.620> bit<00:04:43.800> fiddly<00:04:44.210> but<00:04:45.210> if<00:04:45.360> you

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
then it can be a bit fiddly but if you

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.600 
then it can be a bit fiddly but if you
get<00:04:45.630> your<00:04:45.750> screwdriver<00:04:46.520> into<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.729> head

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.119 

you<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.330> do<00:04:51.449> that<00:04:51.569> up<00:04:51.889> sometimes<00:04:52.889> you<00:04:52.919> have<00:04:53.039> to

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
you can do that up sometimes you have to

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:54.649 
you can do that up sometimes you have to
keep<00:04:53.280> playing<00:04:53.490> with<00:04:53.699> it<00:04:53.819> until<00:04:53.939> it<00:04:54.240> lines<00:04:54.389> up

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
keep playing with it until it lines up

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:58.070 
keep playing with it until it lines up
but<00:04:54.840> that's<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.229> that's<00:04:56.159> pretty<00:04:56.340> homely<00:04:57.080> as

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
but that's this that's pretty homely as

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:06.559 
but that's this that's pretty homely as
you<00:04:58.229> can<00:04:58.379> see<00:04:59.900> then<00:05:00.900> take<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.289> last<00:05:02.009> group<00:05:05.569> and
