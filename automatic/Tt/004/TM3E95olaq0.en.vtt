00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
the future for progressive Aerodyne I

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.930 
the future for progressive Aerodyne I
think<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> future<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.100> very<00:03:05.130> good<00:03:05.640> very

you know Siri has a very unique position

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.890 
you know Siri has a very unique position
and<00:03:17.070> people<00:03:17.700> are<00:03:17.790> flying<00:03:18.030> for<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.360> always<00:03:18.600> say

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
and people are flying for I always say

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
for fun and there is a lot of fun in the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.240 
for fun and there is a lot of fun in the
Serie<00:03:21.420> because<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:22.080> run<00:03:22.560> on<00:03:22.710> water<00:03:22.740> and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
Serie because it can run on water and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.490 
Serie because it can run on water and
also<00:03:23.580> land<00:03:23.820> can<00:03:24.060> go<00:03:24.180> many<00:03:24.600> many<00:03:24.870> places<00:03:25.140> that

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
also land can go many many places that

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.990 
also land can go many many places that
with<00:03:26.040> other<00:03:26.220> transportation<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.970> can

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
with other transportation you can

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.910 
with other transportation you can
outreach<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.990> I<00:03:28.020> think<00:03:28.170> it's<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.500> futures

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
outreach so I think it's the futures

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.800 
outreach so I think it's the futures
