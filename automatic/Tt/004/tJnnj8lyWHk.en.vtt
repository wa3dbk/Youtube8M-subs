00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.030 
you can get past the very slow start and
the<00:01:53.700> grinding<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.450> new<00:01:54.990> beginning<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> very

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the grinding a new beginning is a very

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.679 
the grinding a new beginning is a very
good<00:01:56.369> addition<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.000> Harvest<00:01:57.299> Moon<00:01:57.329> series

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
good addition to the Harvest Moon series

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.319 
good addition to the Harvest Moon series
and<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.740> why<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.040> makes<00:01:59.369> my<00:01:59.549> number<00:01:59.880> 5<00:02:00.180> slot

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
number four number four - maybe a bit of

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.220 
number four number four - maybe a bit of
a<00:02:09.190> surprise<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.819> some<00:02:09.970> people<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:11.050> it's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
a surprise to some people but it's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.770 
a surprise to some people but it's
Harvest<00:02:11.530> Moon<00:02:11.560> magical<00:02:12.160> melody<00:02:12.550> on<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.090> purely

Harvest Moon magical melody on a purely

Harvest Moon magical melody on a purely
technical<00:02:14.140> level<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.489> is<00:02:15.760> probably<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.360> of

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
technical level this is probably one of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.870 
technical level this is probably one of
the<00:02:16.480> best<00:02:16.690> Harvest<00:02:17.110> Moon<00:02:17.140> games<00:02:17.500> out<00:02:17.800> there<00:02:17.880> it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
the best Harvest Moon games out there it

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.400 
the best Harvest Moon games out there it
uses<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.330> lot<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.750> mechanics<00:02:20.319> from

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
uses a lot of the mechanics from

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.009 
uses a lot of the mechanics from
previous<00:02:20.860> games<00:02:21.099> but<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:21.940> polishes<00:02:22.690> them<00:02:22.840> and

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
previous games but it polishes them and

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.740 
previous games but it polishes them and
doesn't<00:02:23.500> very<00:02:23.769> well<00:02:24.160> it's<00:02:25.120> also<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.510> first

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
doesn't very well it's also the first

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.240 
doesn't very well it's also the first
one<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.080> really<00:02:26.470> lets<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.739> customize<00:02:26.950> your

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
one that really lets you customize your

you<00:02:29.620> want<00:02:29.860> refined<00:02:30.250> land<00:02:30.550> but<00:02:31.420> personally<00:02:32.019> I

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
you want refined land but personally I

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.630 
you want refined land but personally I
didn't<00:02:32.560> like<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.800> as<00:02:32.890> much<00:02:33.040> as<00:02:33.160> others<00:02:33.430> in<00:02:33.550> the

problem<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.819> have<00:02:49.000> with<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.239> game<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.750> it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
problem I have with this game is that it

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.479 
problem I have with this game is that it
always<00:02:50.110> felt<00:02:50.560> kind<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.830> clunky<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.370> me

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
always felt kind of clunky to me

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.089 
always felt kind of clunky to me
movement<00:02:52.390> itself<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.900> pretty<00:02:53.140> sluggish<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.950> I

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
movement itself is pretty sluggish and I

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.100 
movement itself is pretty sluggish and I
kind<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.819> wish<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.120> animations<00:02:55.630> didn't<00:02:55.900> take

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
kind of wish the animations didn't take

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.160 
kind of wish the animations didn't take
so<00:02:56.349> long<00:02:56.790> also<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.660> characters<00:02:59.019> were

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
so long also the characters were

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.839 
so long also the characters were
somewhat<00:02:59.560> forgettable<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.250> mostly<00:03:00.730> that's

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
somewhat forgettable but mostly that's

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.030 
somewhat forgettable but mostly that's
because<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.599> lot<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.440> them<00:03:02.560> were<00:03:02.650> from<00:03:02.860> other

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
because a lot of them were from other

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.449 
because a lot of them were from other
Harvest<00:03:03.489> Moon<00:03:03.519> games<00:03:04.530> also<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:06.040> bunch<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
Harvest Moon games also a bunch of the

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.520 
Harvest Moon games also a bunch of the
notes<00:03:06.640> were<00:03:06.790> pretty<00:03:07.150> grinding<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:08.260> overall

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
notes were pretty grinding but overall

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.500 
notes were pretty grinding but overall
metro<00:03:09.010> Modi<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.430> still<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.760> song<00:03:10.030> Harvest<00:03:10.450> Moon

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
Moon a wonderful life for the game - not

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.650 
Moon a wonderful life for the game - not
the<00:03:23.380> ps2<00:03:23.769> version<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:24.400> one<00:03:24.579> sucks<00:03:24.880> but

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
the ps2 version that one sucks but

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.270 
the ps2 version that one sucks but
honestly<00:03:26.019> what<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.350> like<00:03:26.560> about<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.859> wonderful

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
honestly what I like about a wonderful

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.759 
honestly what I like about a wonderful
life<00:03:27.489> comes<00:03:28.269> from<00:03:28.390> how<00:03:28.690> different<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.590> is

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
life comes from how different it is

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.530 
life comes from how different it is
while<00:03:30.130> still<00:03:30.519> maintaining<00:03:30.700> love<00:03:31.299> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
while still maintaining love the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.740 
while still maintaining love the
familiar<00:03:32.470> stuff<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:33.579> core<00:03:33.790> form<00:03:34.090> itself<00:03:34.480> is

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
familiar stuff the core form itself is

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.750 
familiar stuff the core form itself is
pretty<00:03:35.170> solid<00:03:35.410> with<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.829> livestock<00:03:36.340> system

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
pretty solid with a livestock system

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.849 
pretty solid with a livestock system
that<00:03:36.940> makes<00:03:37.480> breeding<00:03:37.989> pretty<00:03:38.230> important<00:03:38.739> and

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
that makes breeding pretty important and

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.460 
that makes breeding pretty important and
the<00:03:39.850> inclusion<00:03:40.269> of<00:03:40.299> hybrid<00:03:40.750> crops<00:03:40.959> makes

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
the inclusion of hybrid crops makes

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.190 
the inclusion of hybrid crops makes
things<00:03:41.799> pretty<00:03:42.280> interesting<00:03:42.850> if<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.959> does

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
things pretty interesting if it does

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.320 
things pretty interesting if it does
take<00:03:44.470> forever<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.889> water<00:03:45.130> everything

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.840 

yeah<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:50.500> unlike<00:03:50.800> other<00:03:50.980> Harvest<00:03:51.460> Moon<00:03:51.490> games

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850
