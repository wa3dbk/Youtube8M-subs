like<00:00:31.289> history's<00:00:32.040> repeating<00:00:32.160> itself<00:00:32.550> going

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
like history's repeating itself going

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
like history's repeating itself going
from<00:00:33.630> 2013<00:00:34.350> into<00:00:34.620> 2014<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.399> were<00:00:35.550> looking<00:00:35.850> at

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
from 2013 into 2014 we were looking at

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
from 2013 into 2014 we were looking at
this<00:00:36.120> same<00:00:36.390> exact<00:00:36.750> convention<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.860> didn't

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
this same exact convention but we didn't

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.160 
this same exact convention but we didn't
have<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.460> anything<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.329> off<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> we

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
have really anything to go off of we

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.139 
have really anything to go off of we
were<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.440> kind<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.680> assuming<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.579> Patsy's

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
were just kind of assuming that Patsy's

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.360 
were just kind of assuming that Patsy's
that's<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.899> I'm<00:00:42.989> saying<00:00:43.230> again<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> good

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that's what I'm saying again was a good

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.819 
that's what I'm saying again was a good
place<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:44.850> last<00:00:45.300> year<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.780> set<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.410> Boston

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
place because last year if set in Boston

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.709 
place because last year if set in Boston
and<00:00:46.980> Boston<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.030> fallout<00:00:48.329> 4

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and Boston is going to be fallout 4

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.180 
and Boston is going to be fallout 4
location<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
location so there we go that's the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.470 
location so there we go that's the
reason<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.489> does<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> announce<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
reason that does is going to announce it
and<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.110> sounds<00:00:52.379> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> silly<00:00:52.770> in

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and see it sounds kind of silly in

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
and see it sounds kind of silly in
retrospect<00:00:53.489> even<00:00:53.730> though<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> time<00:00:54.449> we

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
