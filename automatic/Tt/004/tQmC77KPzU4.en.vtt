we can see the new growth appearing so
here<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.060> penstemon<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.130> if<00:01:16.130> we<00:01:16.280> take<00:01:16.490> a

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
here is the penstemon and if we take a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.870 
here is the penstemon and if we take a
good<00:01:16.970> branch<00:01:17.300> like<00:01:17.660> this<00:01:17.900> one<00:01:18.140> here<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.680> you

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
good branch like this one here and you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.370 
good branch like this one here and you
can<00:01:19.880> see<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:20.270> there's<00:01:20.450> all<00:01:20.600> this<00:01:20.780> new<00:01:20.840> growth

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
can see that there's all this new growth

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.960 
can see that there's all this new growth
all<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.040> way<00:01:22.130> off<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.490> stem

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
all the way off the stem

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.030 
all the way off the stem
and<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.210> stem<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.479> quite<00:01:23.840> woody<00:01:24.140> but<00:01:24.800> I'm

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
and the stem is quite woody but I'm

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.660 
and the stem is quite woody but I'm
going<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.430> go<00:01:25.520> down<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.180> lowest<00:01:27.040> then<00:01:28.040> the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
going to go down to the lowest then the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.760 
going to go down to the lowest then the
lowest<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:31.390> strong<00:01:32.390> board<00:01:32.690> that<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.050> can<00:01:33.260> that

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
lowest and strong board that I can that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.620 
lowest and strong board that I can that
I<00:01:33.920> can<00:01:34.100> easily<00:01:34.220> see<00:01:34.759> which<00:01:34.970> looks<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.450> be<00:01:35.540> about

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
I can easily see which looks to be about

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.560 
I can easily see which looks to be about
that<00:01:35.960> one<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.410> snip<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.460> off<00:01:38.229> oops

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
that one and snip it off oops

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.560 
that one and snip it off oops
right<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.900> again<00:01:42.340> this<00:01:43.340> one<00:01:43.610> here<00:01:43.940> this<00:01:44.210> stem

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
right and again this one here this stem

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.830 
right and again this one here this stem
here<00:01:45.009> down<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:48.490> down<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.520> strong<00:01:50.150> buds<00:01:50.479> and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
here down to down to strong buds and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.960 
here down to down to strong buds and
snip<00:01:51.170> off<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.770> lowest<00:01:51.979> strong<00:01:52.520> buds<00:01:52.820> that

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
snip off so the lowest strong buds that

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.260 
snip off so the lowest strong buds that
you<00:01:53.210> can<00:01:53.390> see

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.660 

and<00:02:00.490> let's<00:02:01.490> see<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:03.290> here<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:03.950> new<00:02:04.220> growth

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
and let's see this here is a new growth

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.399 
and let's see this here is a new growth
that<00:02:04.909> has<00:02:05.030> just<00:02:05.270> come<00:02:05.509> directly<00:02:05.930> up<00:02:06.110> from<00:02:06.320> the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
that has just come directly up from the

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.859 
that has just come directly up from the
base<00:02:06.619> it's<00:02:07.340> soft<00:02:07.729> I'm<00:02:08.119> just<00:02:08.330> going<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.690> leave

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
base it's soft I'm just going to leave

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.680 
base it's soft I'm just going to leave
this<00:02:09.140> but<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.830> last<00:02:10.069> year's<00:02:10.480> this<00:02:11.480> one
