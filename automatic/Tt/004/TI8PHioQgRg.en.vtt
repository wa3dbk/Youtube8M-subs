them<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.409> those<00:01:44.040> snipers<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.610> you've

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
them will have those snipers that you've

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.370 
them will have those snipers that you've
left<00:01:45.060> unlocked<00:01:45.360> i<00:01:45.540> think<00:01:45.780> sometimes<00:01:46.020> they

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
left unlocked i think sometimes they

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
left unlocked i think sometimes they
have<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.619> SMGs<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.250> stuff<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.490> really

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
have like SMGs and stuff it's really

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.910 
have like SMGs and stuff it's really
weird<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.149> they<00:01:48.780> usually<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.290> only<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
weird but they usually just only have a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.950 
weird but they usually just only have a
knife<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.000> easier<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> train<00:01:51.720> on

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
knife for you so it's easier to train on

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.200 
knife for you so it's easier to train on
and<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.130> classes<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.820> want<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> do

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and for the classes what you want to do

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
and for the classes what you want to do
is<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.689> use<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.380> sniper<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.829> your

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is you want to use the sniper of your

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.120

the to combat axes because that's your

only really lethal and then for
tacticals<00:02:35.700> i<00:02:35.880> recommend<00:02:36.300> using<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.690> TAC

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
tacticals i recommend using the TAC

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.870 
tacticals i recommend using the TAC
insertion<00:02:37.530> which<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.040> put<00:02:38.220> anything<00:02:38.460> but

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
insertion which you can put anything but

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.970 
insertion which you can put anything but
usually<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.560> good<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.770> have<00:02:40.950> a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
usually it's just good to have a

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.890 
usually it's just good to have a
tactical<00:02:41.250> insertion<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.880> there<00:02:42.090> then<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.780> can

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
tactical insertion on there then you can

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.930 
tactical insertion on there then you can
go<00:02:42.990> ahead<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.230> start<00:02:43.380> your<00:02:43.680> game<00:02:43.890> now<00:02:44.160> the

whole point of this training exercise is
to<00:02:54.300> get<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.720> guys<00:02:54.900> used<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.410> aiming<00:02:55.830> directly

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
to get you guys used to aiming directly

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.070 
to get you guys used to aiming directly
on<00:02:56.520> your<00:02:56.640> enemy<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> first<00:02:57.420> time<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.780> scope

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
on your enemy the first time you scope

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.890 
on your enemy the first time you scope
in<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.590> when<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.610> quick<00:02:59.820> scope<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.300> basically

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
in so when you quick scope in basically

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.940 
in so when you quick scope in basically
you're<00:03:01.050> scoping<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.590> right<00:03:01.770> away<00:03:01.860> and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950

you more use to aiming directly on your
enemy<00:03:13.470> as<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.890> scope<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.460> now<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.270> will<00:03:15.480> help

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
enemy as you scope in now this will help

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.590 
enemy as you scope in now this will help
you<00:03:15.810> improve<00:03:16.310> with<00:03:17.310> any<00:03:17.580> weapon<00:03:17.940> basically

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
you improve with any weapon basically

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
you improve with any weapon basically
because<00:03:18.810> if<00:03:18.930> you're<00:03:19.050> using<00:03:19.170> air<00:03:19.350> assault

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
because if you're using air assault

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.710 
because if you're using air assault
rifle<00:03:19.920> online<00:03:20.250> then<00:03:20.580> every<00:03:21.240> time<00:03:21.270> you<00:03:21.570> go<00:03:21.660> to

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
rifle online then every time you go to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.210 
rifle online then every time you go to
scope<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.110> on<00:03:22.230> tell<00:03:22.380> me<00:03:22.470> you'll<00:03:22.709> scope<00:03:22.920> right

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
scope in on tell me you'll scope right

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.770 
scope in on tell me you'll scope right
in<00:03:23.370> on<00:03:23.520> them<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.820> then<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.120> won't<00:03:24.360> need<00:03:24.510> to

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
in on them and then you won't need to

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.380 
in on them and then you won't need to
search<00:03:25.410> around<00:03:25.590> with<00:03:25.890> your<00:03:26.010> sights<00:03:26.390> after

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
search around with your sights after

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.540 
search around with your sights after
you've<00:03:27.720> scoped<00:03:28.140> in<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.680> find<00:03:28.980> them<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.280> then

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
you've scoped in to find them and then

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.070 
you've scoped in to find them and then
you'll<00:03:29.880> delay<00:03:30.240> time<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.750> they'll<00:03:30.870> probably

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
you'll delay time and they'll probably

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.250 
you'll delay time and they'll probably
kill<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.530> before<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:32.100> get<00:03:32.310> them<00:03:32.550> so<00:03:32.910> just

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
kill you before you get them so just

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.750 
kill you before you get them so just
taking<00:03:34.260> out<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.410> couple<00:03:34.950> milliseconds<00:03:35.280> of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
taking out that couple milliseconds of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.310 
taking out that couple milliseconds of
you<00:03:36.120> trying<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.450> find<00:03:36.690> them<00:03:36.900> after<00:03:37.050> you've

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
you trying to find them after you've

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.010 
you trying to find them after you've
scoped<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.830> that'll<00:03:38.550> save<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.940> time<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.420> also

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
scoped in that'll save you time and also

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.070 
scoped in that'll save you time and also
when<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.650> gunfight<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.570> you<00:03:42.570> do<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.900> can<00:03:43.020> do

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
when you gunfight so you do you can do

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.660 
when you gunfight so you do you can do
the<00:03:43.200> same<00:03:43.410> thing<00:03:43.680> with<00:03:43.860> your<00:03:44.010> ballistic<00:03:44.280> napes

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670

me switch between all of them and I'm
just<00:03:55.290> throwing<00:03:55.500> them<00:03:55.709> everywhere<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.280> just

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
just throwing them everywhere and just

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.730 
just throwing them everywhere and just
just<00:03:56.880> Chuck<00:03:57.150> God<00:03:57.420> try<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.720> get<00:03:58.230> people<00:03:58.380> real

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.140 
just Chuck God try to get people real
quickly<00:03:59.040> with<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.370> combat<00:03:59.760> axe<00:03:59.910> and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
quickly with the combat axe and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.460 
quickly with the combat axe and
ballistic<00:04:00.450> knives<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:00.810> not<00:04:00.930> like<00:04:01.080> hold<00:04:01.320> it

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
ballistic knives and not like hold it

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.290 
ballistic knives and not like hold it
for<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.709> really<00:04:02.040> long<00:04:02.130> time<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.520> aim<00:04:02.850> because

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
for a really long time and aim because

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.840 
for a really long time and aim because
that<00:04:03.510> defeats<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.840> purpose<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:05.160> basically

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
that defeats the purpose so basically

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.280 
that defeats the purpose so basically
that<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.630> whole<00:04:06.780> point<00:04:06.990> of<00:04:07.080> this<00:04:07.170> exercise

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
that is the whole point of this exercise

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.650 
that is the whole point of this exercise
i<00:04:07.620> find<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.220> good<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.550> do<00:04:08.700> before<00:04:09.300> you<00:04:09.330> do<00:04:09.480> big

different facing bots but it is kind of

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.730 
different facing bots but it is kind of
the<00:04:38.250> feeling<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.210> will<00:04:39.509> have<00:04:39.719> another<00:04:40.319> one
