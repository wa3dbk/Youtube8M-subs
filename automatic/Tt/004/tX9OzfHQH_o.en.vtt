00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that great and you can tell that it just

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
that great and you can tell that it just
covered<00:00:37.559> my<00:00:37.590> hands<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.370> actually<00:00:38.700> died

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
covered my hands that have actually died

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.209 
covered my hands that have actually died
in<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.540> yeah<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.770> time<00:00:40.980> I'm<00:00:41.100> actually

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
in it so yeah this time I'm actually

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.569 
in it so yeah this time I'm actually
using<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.670> real<00:00:41.820> dye<00:00:42.059> which<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:42.960> apple<00:00:43.469> green<00:00:43.579> by

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
using a real dye which is apple green by

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.110 
using a real dye which is apple green by
directions<00:00:45.410> I've<00:00:46.610> never<00:00:47.610> used<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.969> die

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
directions I've never used this die

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.690 
directions I've never used this die
before<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.510> don't<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.899> good<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.890> think

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
before I don't if it's good but I think

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.600 
before I don't if it's good but I think
it's<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.210> nice<00:00:51.360> color<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.610> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it's a really nice color it's like and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.689 
it's a really nice color it's like and
it's<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.590> dark<00:00:55.590> green<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.280> can't

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it's just like a dark green I can't

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.959 
it's just like a dark green I can't
really<00:00:56.910> explain<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.870> any<00:00:58.140> other<00:00:58.320> way

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
really explain it in any other way

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.400 
really explain it in any other way
doesn't<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.510> any<00:01:00.690> other<00:01:00.899> tones<00:01:01.230> in

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
doesn't really have any other tones in

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.729 
doesn't really have any other tones in
it<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.800> green<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.390> mean<00:01:03.989> it'll

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it it's just green so I mean it'll

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.670 
it it's just green so I mean it'll
probably<00:01:05.010> look<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.869> bit<00:01:06.990> bluer<00:01:07.229> because

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
probably look a little bit bluer because

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.270 
probably look a little bit bluer because
I'm<00:01:07.740> dying<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.100> over<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.799> yeah<00:01:10.799> like

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
I'm dying it over this but yeah like

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.270 
I'm dying it over this but yeah like
I've<00:01:11.460> not<00:01:11.850> dyed<00:01:12.210> my<00:01:12.360> her<00:01:12.510> since<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.100> last

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I've not dyed my her since the last

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.390 
I've not dyed my her since the last
video<00:01:14.549> which<00:01:14.729> was<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.060> two<00:01:15.270> weeks<00:01:15.479> ago<00:01:15.750> so

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
video which was like two weeks ago so

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
video which was like two weeks ago so
you<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.909> quite<00:01:18.180> fitted<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.810> actually

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
you know it's quite fitted I actually

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.210 
you know it's quite fitted I actually
kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> color<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
kind of really like the color but and

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.740 
kind of really like the color but and
I'm<00:01:23.220> thinking<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.820> changing<00:01:23.850> my<00:01:24.180> her<00:01:24.390> soon

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
I'm thinking of changing my her soon

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.340 
I'm thinking of changing my her soon
anyway<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.710> thought<00:01:25.920> I'd<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:26.520> green

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
anyway so I thought I'd just go green

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
anyway so I thought I'd just go green
then<00:01:28.350> let<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.590> fit<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:29.400> change<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
then let that fit and then change to the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.800 
then let that fit and then change to the
new<00:01:30.299> color<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.619> yeah<00:01:31.829> apple<00:01:32.430> green<00:01:32.810> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
new color so so yeah apple green this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
new color so so yeah apple green this
should<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.200> interesting<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.159> white<00:01:35.310> balance

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
should be interesting the white balance

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.660 
should be interesting the white balance
is<00:01:35.970> apparently<00:01:36.829> 100%<00:01:37.829> correct<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.460> video

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
is apparently 100% correct in this video

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.130 
is apparently 100% correct in this video
I've<00:01:38.790> used<00:01:39.030> custom<00:01:39.420> white<00:01:39.540> balance<00:01:39.570> where<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
I've used custom white balance where you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.950 
I've used custom white balance where you
take<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> picture<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.009> white<00:01:41.509> background<00:01:42.509> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
take a picture of a white background and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
take a picture of a white background and
then<00:01:43.079> set<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.829> as<00:01:43.950> your<00:01:43.979> white<00:01:44.310> balance<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
then set it as your white balance and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.109 
then set it as your white balance and
all<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.979> yeah<00:01:46.979> partly<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.700> perfect

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
all that and yeah partly this is perfect

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.819 
all that and yeah partly this is perfect
this<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> actual<00:01:49.200> color<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.649> her

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
this is like the actual color of a her

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.789 
this is like the actual color of a her
and<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.960> only<00:01:52.079> thing<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:52.530> doing<00:01:52.710> is

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
and the only thing that it's doing is

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.960 
and the only thing that it's doing is
making<00:01:53.100> things<00:01:53.189> look<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.520> little<00:01:53.549> bit<00:01:53.820> more

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
making things look a little bit more

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.280 
making things look a little bit more
vibrant<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.659> don't<00:01:54.840> mind

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
vibrant which I don't mind

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.090 
vibrant which I don't mind

bit strange because the Sun set in and
it's<00:05:27.820> creating<00:05:28.300> this<00:05:28.389> weird<00:05:28.750> orange<00:05:29.020> glow<00:05:29.350> all

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
but it's not really depicting the true

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.700 
but it's not really depicting the true
colors<00:05:35.530> of<00:05:35.910> my<00:05:36.910> human<00:05:37.270> self<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.440> colors

colors of my human self and the colors

colors of my human self and the colors
are<00:05:38.889> neon<00:05:39.550> of<00:05:39.669> accurate<00:05:40.150> my<00:05:40.570> lipsticks<00:05:40.960> purple

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
are neon of accurate my lipsticks purple
