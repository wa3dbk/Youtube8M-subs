00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.330
 and 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.230
 one 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.090
 in order to start using 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.480
 effects created by our hands in 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.080
 play time it is important for us to learn three simple 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.260
 rules and first we'll learn exactly 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:45.680
 wah-wah effect 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:47.570
 why so called judge for yourself and for 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.610
 to learn how to use the effect 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.280
 Wow Wow 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.250
 so rule 3 the first rule you know 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.850
 this creation is as tight as possible 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.200
 cameras ie cameras created by the palms 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.300
 your in which there will be a minimum of slots 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.830
 the second rule is that we 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:14.000
 must first fill the camera with sound and 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:22.580
 only then open it first sound in 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.619
 camera and only then open if it 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.470
 do both that is sound and 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.959
 opening the camera the camera does not have time 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.360
 be filled with sound and the effect will be 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.360
 Judge for yourself 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.479
 almost no effect, that is, first we 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.729
 tilt the camera sound then release 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.250
 release gin and this rule is 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.950
 sound directivity is very important 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.170
 direct the sound that we release from 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.000
 cameras exactly towards the listener for 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.250
 so that the effect is really 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.679
 very tangible and so beautiful only in 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.649
 in the other direction do not open your hand to 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.190
 the sound was scattered in all directions then 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.520
 really 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.800
 dissipates and it is minimal this 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.800
 effect see the difference 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.160
 and so the three simple rules are hermetic 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.930
 the camera first fills the cameras with sound 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.360
 then let out the sound and these rules 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.790
 direction to where the country 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.760
 in which we release the sound she is 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.430
 must be one way and sometimes even 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.440
 so when some learn 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.170
 train wow-wow effect 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.700
 use and said no not hear 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.040
 what do they get? Does it seem like not 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.560
 it turns out they and all because they are on 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.360
 in fact often do it right them 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.770
 sound is released to the opposite of you 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.930
 side and don't hear it 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.380
 therefore it is recommended to train often 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.260
 this wah-wow effect near the wall either in 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.300
 the corner when the sound from the walls will be reflected 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.650
 you will clearly hear well that you have 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.650
 everything is great 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.000
 one
