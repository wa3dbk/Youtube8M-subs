all<00:00:47.269> right<00:00:47.390> once<00:00:47.570> again<00:00:47.660> testing<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.289> Gemini

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
all right once again testing the Gemini

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.560 
all right once again testing the Gemini
PT<00:00:49.269> 2002's

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
PT 2002's

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.340 
PT 2002's
old-school<00:00:51.320> turntables<00:00:52.010> from<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:53.660> 90s<00:00:53.989> I'm

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
old-school turntables from the 90s I'm

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.450 
old-school turntables from the 90s I'm
just<00:00:54.530> gonna<00:00:54.620> see<00:00:54.800> if<00:00:54.829> they<00:00:54.949> can<00:00:55.100> keep<00:00:55.219> up<00:00:55.399> with

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
just gonna see if they can keep up with

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:36.840 
just gonna see if they can keep up with
a<00:00:55.609> simple<00:00:55.969> juggle

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.240 

wasn't<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.910> best<00:01:38.179> example<00:01:38.770> but<00:01:39.770> yeah<00:01:39.979> they

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
wasn't the best example but yeah they

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.820 
wasn't the best example but yeah they
kept<00:01:40.520> up<00:01:40.700> I<00:01:40.850> mean<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.929> torque<00:01:42.590> on<00:01:42.740> the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
kept up I mean that the torque on the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.850 
kept up I mean that the torque on the
motor<00:01:42.860> is<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:44.110> think<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.350> torque<00:01:45.590> on<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.830> motor

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
motor is I think the torque on the motor

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.060 
motor is I think the torque on the motor
ISM<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:47.090> pretty<00:01:47.600> close<00:01:47.929> to<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:48.200> technique<00:01:48.710> 12

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
ISM is pretty close to a technique 12

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.450 
ISM is pretty close to a technique 12
but<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.800> think<00:01:51.800> there's<00:01:52.009> a<00:01:52.360> millisecond<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.539> lag

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
but I think there's a millisecond of lag

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.270 
but I think there's a millisecond of lag
when<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:56.649> mean<00:01:57.649> you're<00:01:57.740> actually<00:01:58.009> cueing

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
when you I mean you're actually cueing

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.149 
when you I mean you're actually cueing
the<00:01:58.340> record<00:01:58.640> back<00:01:58.990> there's<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.070> millisecond<00:02:01.070> of

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
the record back there's a millisecond of

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.120 
the record back there's a millisecond of
lag<00:02:01.340> but<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.970> think<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:02.450> make<00:02:02.690> up<00:02:02.869> for<00:02:02.899> that

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
lag but I think you make up for that

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.100 
lag but I think you make up for that
just<00:02:04.130> pulling<00:02:04.909> pulling<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.600> record<00:02:05.929> back

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
just pulling pulling the record back

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.949 
just pulling pulling the record back
maybe<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.970> quarter<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.209> quarter<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.780> an<00:02:08.869> inch

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
maybe a quarter a quarter of an inch

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.810 
maybe a quarter a quarter of an inch
farther<00:02:09.290> you<00:02:09.619> would<00:02:09.829> on<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> regular<00:02:10.369> technic

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
farther you would on a regular technic

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.370 
farther you would on a regular technic
1200<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:12.459> you'd<00:02:13.459> be<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.670> mean<00:02:13.880> it'll<00:02:14.380> it'll

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
1200 and you'd be I mean it'll it'll

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.770 
1200 and you'd be I mean it'll it'll
catch<00:02:15.620> right<00:02:15.829> out<00:02:15.950> beat<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:17.060> think<00:02:17.450> that's<00:02:17.630> just

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
catch right out beat I think that's just

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.850 
catch right out beat I think that's just
that's<00:02:18.110> just<00:02:18.200> going<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.470> take<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> little

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
that's just going to take a little

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.550 
that's just going to take a little
retraining<00:02:19.370> for<00:02:19.400> somebody<00:02:19.760> who's<00:02:19.910> used<00:02:20.120> to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
retraining for somebody who's used to

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.690 
retraining for somebody who's used to
like<00:02:21.560> new<00:02:21.739> more<00:02:21.950> TTS<00:02:22.430> or<00:02:22.760> or

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
like new more TTS or or

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.870 
like new more TTS or or
the<00:02:24.000> actual<00:02:24.630> protecting<00:02:25.530> 1200<00:02:26.100> or<00:02:26.280> 12<00:02:26.520> tenths

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the actual protecting 1200 or 12 tenths

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.110 
the actual protecting 1200 or 12 tenths
but<00:02:27.230> overall<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.410> mean<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.920> got<00:02:29.490> these<00:02:29.610> at<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.819> deal

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
but overall I mean I got these at a deal

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.840 
but overall I mean I got these at a deal
and<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.590> bought<00:02:32.130> them<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.430> knock<00:02:32.640> around

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and and I bought them to knock around

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.840 
and and I bought them to knock around
and<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:34.080> they're<00:02:34.470> fun<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.890> got<00:02:35.459> some<00:02:35.640> cool

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
and I like they're fun I got some cool

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.110 
and I like they're fun I got some cool

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
kind of nice to have one back I like to

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.540 
kind of nice to have one back I like to
mess<00:02:44.760> around<00:02:44.880> with<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:46.620> got<00:02:47.459> this

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
mess around with it I got this

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.540 
mess around with it I got this
old-school<00:02:47.970> Odyssey<00:02:48.780> coffin<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.950> hey<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.310> mean

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
old-school Odyssey coffin so hey I mean

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.930 
old-school Odyssey coffin so hey I mean
I<00:02:50.790> got<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> good<00:02:51.209> deal<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:52.380> got<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> good

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
I got a good deal and I got a good

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.150 
I got a good deal and I got a good
decent<00:02:53.940> set<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.560> Gemini's<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> mess

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
decent set of Gemini's just to mess

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.350 
decent set of Gemini's just to mess
around<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.610> studio<00:02:56.910> mind<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.270> I'll

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
around with the studio mind you I'll

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.640 
around with the studio mind you I'll
never<00:02:57.570> take<00:02:57.780> them<00:02:57.900> out<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> gig<00:02:58.500> or

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
never take them out to do a gig or

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.180 
never take them out to do a gig or
anything<00:02:58.860> but<00:02:59.390> hey<00:03:00.390> I'm<00:03:00.630> happy
