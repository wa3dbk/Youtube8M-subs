futile<00:03:10.920> radio<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.480> radio<00:03:12.989> was<00:03:13.200> extremely

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
futile radio now the radio was extremely

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.750 
futile radio now the radio was extremely
itchy<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.420> not<00:03:16.200> smooth<00:03:16.890> when<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.400> pulled<00:03:17.640> on

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
itchy and not smooth when you pulled on

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.310 
itchy and not smooth when you pulled on
the<00:03:17.880> trigger<00:03:18.150> was<00:03:18.360> just<00:03:18.540> basically<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:19.140> piece

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the trigger was just basically a piece

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.539 
the trigger was just basically a piece
of<00:03:19.350> junk<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:21.260> evil<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.530> would<00:03:23.040> still<00:03:23.340> work

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
of junk and evil that would still work

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.780 
of junk and evil that would still work
but<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.090> real<00:03:24.269> problem<00:03:24.780> was<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.790> speed

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
but the real problem was this speed

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.530 
but the real problem was this speed
controller<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.870> came<00:03:28.170> with<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:30.390> was<00:03:30.510> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
controller that came with it it was a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.130 
controller that came with it it was a
bdc<00:03:31.230> speed<00:03:31.590> control<00:03:32.070> afford<00:03:32.549> reverse<00:03:33.140> but

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
bdc speed control afford reverse but

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.599 
bdc speed control afford reverse but
there's<00:03:34.440> no<00:03:34.590> adjustment<00:03:35.130> on<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.489> was

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
there's no adjustment on it it was

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.150 
there's no adjustment on it it was
potted<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.329> epoxy<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.260> there's<00:03:37.950> no

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
potted in epoxy and there's no

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.949 
potted in epoxy and there's no
adjustment<00:03:38.790> for<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:38.970> center<00:03:39.390> point<00:03:39.600> on<00:03:39.840> it

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
adjustment for the center point on it

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.940 
adjustment for the center point on it
and<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.680> probably<00:03:41.040> ran<00:03:41.280> into<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.120> if<00:03:42.420> you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
and the probably ran into is if you

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.789 
and the probably ran into is if you
adjusted<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.390> term<00:03:45.390> on<00:03:45.630> your<00:03:45.780> radio<00:03:46.109> you

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
adjusted the term on your radio you

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.470 
adjusted the term on your radio you
could<00:03:46.980> adjust<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.579> so<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.090> forward

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
could adjust it so that the forward

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.120 
could adjust it so that the forward
would<00:03:48.630> work<00:03:48.840> fine<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.380> when<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.620> let<00:03:49.799> off<00:03:49.950> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
would work fine and when you let off the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.599 
would work fine and when you let off the
stick<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.640> stick<00:03:50.880> went<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.209> neutral<00:03:51.660> the

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
stick of the stick went to neutral the

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.130 
stick of the stick went to neutral the
boat<00:03:53.609> would<00:03:53.760> come<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> complete<00:03:54.420> stop<00:03:54.540> and

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
boat would come to a complete stop and

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.170 
boat would come to a complete stop and
and<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.829> servos<00:03:56.220> wouldn't<00:03:56.519> buzz<00:03:56.640> or<00:03:56.820> anything

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and the servos wouldn't buzz or anything

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.970 
and the servos wouldn't buzz or anything
but<00:03:57.450> when<00:03:58.109> you<00:03:58.260> want<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.530> put<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.829> in<00:03:58.859> reverse

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
but when you want to put it in reverse

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.390 
but when you want to put it in reverse
you<00:03:59.609> had<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:01.530> little<00:04:01.560> bit<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.100> heat

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
you had just a little bit of heat

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.520 
you had just a little bit of heat
he<00:04:02.489> reverse<00:04:02.879> you<00:04:03.569> didn't<00:04:03.780> have<00:04:03.900> enough<00:04:03.989> travel

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
he reverse you didn't have enough travel

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.350 
he reverse you didn't have enough travel
to<00:04:04.620> get<00:04:04.709> reversed<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.370> trim<00:04:06.120> pot

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
to get reversed and the trim pot

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.360 
to get reversed and the trim pot
wouldn't<00:04:06.840> let<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.230> get<00:04:07.439> into<00:04:07.709> reverse<00:04:08.129> so

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
wouldn't let you get into reverse so

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.240 
wouldn't let you get into reverse so
there<00:04:08.519> was<00:04:08.640> really<00:04:08.670> no<00:04:09.060> way<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:10.010> give<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.129> to

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
there was really no way to give it to

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.839 
there was really no way to give it to
reverse<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:12.510> hope<00:04:13.409> took<00:04:13.890> all<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.280> radio<00:04:14.610> gear

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
reverse I hope took all the radio gear

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.240 
reverse I hope took all the radio gear
out<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.269> hooked<00:04:15.510> up<00:04:15.599> another<00:04:15.900> radio<00:04:16.289> that

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
out of it hooked up another radio that

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.069 
out of it hooked up another radio that
had<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.459> regular<00:04:18.000> stick<00:04:18.299> on<00:04:18.509> it<00:04:18.539> sort<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
had a regular stick on it sort of a

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.840 
had a regular stick on it sort of a
steering<00:04:19.440> wheel<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.799> trigger<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.340> by

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
steering wheel and trigger and by

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.850 
steering wheel and trigger and by
holding<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.329> stick<00:04:21.570> back<00:04:21.810> off<00:04:22.199> center<00:04:22.830> i

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
holding the stick back off center i

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.420 
holding the stick back off center i
could<00:04:23.190> get<00:04:23.340> reverse<00:04:24.680> pretty<00:04:25.680> good<00:04:25.889> and

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
could get reverse pretty good and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.909 
could get reverse pretty good and
forward<00:04:26.940> real<00:04:27.210> well<00:04:27.479> but<00:04:27.720> when<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.500> stick<00:04:28.770> was

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
forward real well but when the stick was

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.480 
forward real well but when the stick was
in<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.220> neutral<00:04:29.430> position<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:31.490> propellers

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
in the neutral position the propellers

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.580 
in the neutral position the propellers
fun<00:04:32.759> from<00:04:33.210> for<00:04:33.539> forward<00:04:33.930> speed<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.410> there<00:04:34.500> was

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
fun from for forward speed and there was

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.560 
fun from for forward speed and there was
there<00:04:34.800> was<00:04:34.889> enough<00:04:35.250> trim<00:04:35.490> on<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.729> radio<00:04:36.000> to

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
there was enough trim on the radio to

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.900 
there was enough trim on the radio to
cur<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.900> out<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.199> a<00:04:37.229> neutral<00:04:37.650> point<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:38.220> no<00:04:38.669> Tim

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
cur it out to a neutral point and no Tim

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.420 
cur it out to a neutral point and no Tim
on<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.090> speed<00:04:39.389> controller<00:04:39.810> so<00:04:40.220> basically<00:04:41.220> the

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
on the speed controller so basically the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.420 
on the speed controller so basically the
speed<00:04:41.669> controller<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.360> piece<00:04:42.570> of<00:04:42.600> trash<00:04:43.020> I

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
speed controller is a piece of trash I

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.370 
speed controller is a piece of trash I
took<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.490> all<00:04:44.729> all<00:04:45.270> covering<00:04:45.810> off<00:04:45.960> if<00:04:46.169> there's

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
took it all all covering off if there's

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.290 
took it all all covering off if there's
no<00:04:46.560> adjustments<00:04:47.280> on<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.520> whatsoever<00:04:47.820> it's<00:04:48.180> a

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
no adjustments on it whatsoever it's a

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.810 
no adjustments on it whatsoever it's a
preset<00:04:48.720> piece<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.169> trash<00:04:49.440> looks<00:04:50.310> like<00:04:50.490> about<00:04:50.639> a

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
preset piece of trash looks like about a

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.360 
preset piece of trash looks like about a
three<00:04:51.389> dollar<00:04:51.600> speed<00:04:52.050> controller<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.800> that's

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
three dollar speed controller and that's

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.120 
three dollar speed controller and that's
the<00:04:53.610> real<00:04:53.820> downfall<00:04:54.510> of<00:04:54.840> this<00:04:55.349> model<00:04:55.680> if<00:04:55.949> it

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
the real downfall of this model if it

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.339 
the real downfall of this model if it
wasn't<00:04:56.490> for<00:04:56.699> the<00:04:56.760> speed<00:04:57.030> controller<00:04:57.510> the

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
wasn't for the speed controller the

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.010 
wasn't for the speed controller the
radio<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:59.099> usable<00:04:59.940> what<00:05:00.330> I'm<00:05:00.449> going<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.660> do<00:05:00.840> is

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
radio is usable what I'm going to do is

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.490 
radio is usable what I'm going to do is
