 now that it came from the wind or Milan 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.400

 poor airways technical skills 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.130
 that make you smile with your beak preserve this and that which passes the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.920
 Convent this what you become

 captain at least aids as high as possible that have been used 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.859
 perhaps 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.390
 a week after the promotion that's enough 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.859
 so the tuning is what I rather than go crazy and 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.899
 lowered the second letter of what we talk about understanding who they are 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:35.129
 and yes even if this guitar as like agreements with samsung Americans if 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.159
 same good this too is if 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.989
 played tense like 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.310
 she is the physical aspect of the guitar story that judgment is 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.829
 Equally important 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:46.859

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.810
 a guitar that 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.640
 eh already already guess what will be the subsequent changes that will change 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.030

 barrels that already opened 3 domains 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.699
 and therefore similar to that which we will get used to seeing on the fingers of 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.959
 subsequent years even if the handle is still a carrier 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.309
 unlike the handles of previous years series 56 hey 57 is a handle 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:30.639
 absolutely delicious was the delicious one that so many people like 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.179
 I repeat no one knows why 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.520

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.050

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.170
 stratocaster 54 55 bad enough flat and even with this heat in 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.060

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.140
 careful to the profile of the maniacs of the few immediately 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.699
