so<00:00:24.960> by<00:00:25.230> far<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.740> most<00:00:25.859> common<00:00:26.430> way<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.609> roll<00:00:26.880> up

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

so by far the most common way to roll up
your<00:00:27.000> sleeves<00:00:27.590> is<00:00:28.590> let's<00:00:29.220> call<00:00:29.399> it<00:00:29.550> which<00:00:30.300> we

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
your sleeves is let's call it which we

your sleeves is let's call it which we
call<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> let's<00:00:31.529> call<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> cuff<00:00:32.220> roll<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.610> don't

call it let's call the cuff roll I don't

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.060 
call it let's call the cuff roll I don't
know<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.470> definitely<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.829> think<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
know so this is definitely I think a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
know so this is definitely I think a
most<00:00:35.250> common<00:00:35.550> way<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> do<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.970> I've<00:00:36.059> seen

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
most common way to do it I've seen

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.340 
most common way to do it I've seen
plenty<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.629> guys<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.170> way<00:00:37.290> you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
plenty of guys do it this way you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.720 
plenty of guys do it this way you
basically<00:00:37.680> start<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.220> cuff<00:00:38.400> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
basically start at the cuff and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.189 
basically start at the cuff and
obviously<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.420> buttons<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.839> already

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
obviously your buttons are already

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.170 
obviously your buttons are already
undone<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:41.220> start<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.519> the<00:00:41.579> cuff<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.059> you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
undone you start at the cuff and you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.220 
undone you start at the cuff and you
fold<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.680> like<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.659> from<00:00:45.839> there<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
fold up like so and then from there you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.880 
fold up like so and then from there you
just<00:00:46.440> continue<00:00:47.040> rolling<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.890> essentially

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
just continue rolling up so essentially

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.450 
just continue rolling up so essentially
this<00:00:53.040> works

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
this works

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.719 
this works
um<00:00:53.659> and<00:00:54.659> the<00:00:55.409> degree<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.369> which<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.580> works

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
um and the degree of to which it works

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.759 
um and the degree of to which it works
will<00:00:57.000> depend<00:00:57.420> mostly<00:00:57.689> on<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.229> wide<00:00:58.530> your

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
will depend mostly on how wide your

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.399 
will depend mostly on how wide your
sleeve<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.159> a<00:00:59.400> lot<00:01:00.360> of<00:01:00.479> times<00:01:00.659> in<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:00.960> past<00:01:01.170> I

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
sleeve is a lot of times in the past I

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.410 
sleeve is a lot of times in the past I
found<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.640> tends<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.150> come

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
found that this just tends to come

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
found that this just tends to come
undone<00:01:03.720> like<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.229> I'm<00:01:04.619> moving<00:01:04.769> around

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
undone like as I'm moving around

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.980 
undone like as I'm moving around
throughout<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> day<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.820> sort<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.119> unravels

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
throughout the day just sort of unravels

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.380 
throughout the day just sort of unravels
and<00:01:07.259> that<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.369> gets<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:08.670> nerves<00:01:08.850> if

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and that kind of gets on my nerves if

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.640 
and that kind of gets on my nerves if
this<00:01:09.540> works<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.140> hey<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.470> is

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
end of the cuff kind of touches to the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.820 
end of the cuff kind of touches to the
end<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.310> my<00:01:38.400> arm<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.909> my<00:01:38.970> elbows<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.409> can

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
know all straight and then from there

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.570 
know all straight and then from there
take<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> bottom<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.830> sleeve<00:01:47.220> which<00:01:47.550> is

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
take the bottom of the sleeve which is

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.789 
take the bottom of the sleeve which is
now<00:01:47.820> obviously<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.750> mid<00:01:48.990> sleeve<00:01:49.350> right<00:01:49.500> but

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
now obviously like mid sleeve right but

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
now obviously like mid sleeve right but
since<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.159> folded<00:01:50.430> over<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:51.210> take<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
since it's folded over you take that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.810 
since it's folded over you take that
just<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.320> right<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:53.640> roll

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
just right right here and then you roll

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300 
just right right here and then you roll
it<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.030> again<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.920> might<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it up again so like that it might be a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
it up again so like that it might be a
little<00:01:56.549> tough<00:01:56.700> depending<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.150> how<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:58.140> know

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
little tough depending on how you know

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.320 
little tough depending on how you know
snug<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:58.860> sleeves<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.370> and<00:02:00.000> hopefully<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
snug your sleeves are and hopefully you

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.760 
snug your sleeves are and hopefully you
have<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> really<00:02:00.659> something<00:02:00.990> sleeve<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
have it really something sleeve so you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.469 
have it really something sleeve so you
don't<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.040> all<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.159> accessibility<00:02:02.880> fabric

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
don't have all that accessibility fabric

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.350 
don't have all that accessibility fabric
but<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:05.190> honestly<00:02:05.580> is<00:02:05.670> my<00:02:05.940> preferred<00:02:06.330> method

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
but this honestly is my preferred method

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.990 
but this honestly is my preferred method
because<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.470> found<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.759> just

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
because what I found was that this just

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
because what I found was that this just
never<00:02:09.209> really<00:02:09.479> comes<00:02:09.690> undone<00:02:09.989> like<00:02:10.500> I'm

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
never really comes undone like I'm

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.800 
never really comes undone like I'm
running<00:02:11.310> errands<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.629> it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
running errands with this and it just it

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.140 
running errands with this and it just it
just<00:02:12.870> doesn't<00:02:13.230> ever<00:02:13.799> come<00:02:14.310> unrolled

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
just doesn't ever come unrolled

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.699 
just doesn't ever come unrolled
and<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:15.659> know<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.930> personal<00:02:16.080> preference<00:02:16.409> of

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
and you know it's personal preference of

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.990 
and you know it's personal preference of
course<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.189> doesn't<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.700> be<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.909> way

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
course this doesn't have to be the way

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.309 
course this doesn't have to be the way
you<00:02:18.060> do<00:02:18.299> it<00:02:18.420> I'm<00:02:18.750> just<00:02:18.959> showing<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.170> what

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
what's best so this is going to be the

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.970 
what's best so this is going to be the
double<00:02:23.909> fold<00:02:24.390> over

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
double fold over
