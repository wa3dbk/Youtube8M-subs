00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.980
 the chicken lee is one of the dishes of 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.140
 the easiest ceremonies to prepare 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.790
 I must say that we can garnish the chicken 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.360
 montpellier with all kinds of 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.360
 candied vegetables ie sweet or 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.130
 just tart we will prepare 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.290
 today the grilled chicken at the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.210
 candied pumpkin to gram of grass 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.809
 as we call it then we are going to have 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.570
 need 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.280
 of course chicken and composition 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.540
 tracks for you please go 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.480
 see it's very simple it's not 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.790
 complicated there me I normally take it 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.010
 can put an entire chicken or a shot 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.480
 cut them in four I like them 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.280
 chicken legs take that the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.250
 chicken legs that gives me a side 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.960
 gelatin sauce is well that's me 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.780
 gives a smooth sauce and then 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.400
 I also prefer chicken legs 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.320
 because it supports cooking better 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.030
 it's not like the white on white is 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.070
 are drying up very quickly so we but good 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.299
 as I said I put the thighs 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.110
 of chicken you can very well put 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.049
 a whole chicken 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.979
 so I take the chicken legs I 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:22.610
 will scent them and spices and with 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:25.149
 spice pump it is and I add a 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.149
 little bit of water 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.560
 I can let them marinate like that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.450
 in this preparation for half a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.070
 time but if we do not have the time to 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.720
 to marinate one can very well 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.240
 leathers right after putting them directly 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.800
 in the stewpot and cook them with the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.990
 spices I will first put oil 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.590
 the equivalent of 4 spoonfuls to him 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.590
 a minced onion 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.299
 a very small rust has pressed 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.530
 2 the tracks to fill another one 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.530
 little bit with onions 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.470
 once the marinated chicken legs 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.849
 for about 15 minutes to 30 minutes 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.209
 depending on the time you have is the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:54.140
 recovers with their marinade and we 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.140
 place with onion 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.040
 the marinade I want to add a little 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.940
 bunch of herbs 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.769
 here I put some coriander I 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.390
 am going to withdraw just now I'm going 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.760
 put salt like that we go to the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.780
 second step which is the preparation of 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.680
 pumpkin 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:24.690
 we're going to go very little because the thing 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.030
 will be very short and we will go to the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.480
 second step to prepare the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.120
 pumpkin 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.810
 we will obviously see 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.829
 pumpkin is the peel seed and 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.569
 detail in pieces 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.569
 we will steam it 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.750
 to help him get out of bed I'm going to 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.459
 sprinkle with a little salt 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.510
 important of rooms and jams of 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:02.099
 vegetables because the door knows when 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.099
 even a taste balance 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.940
 and I'm running away 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.520
 about 25 to 30 minutes the time that the 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.769
 the pumpkin are well cooked and well 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.200
 melting 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:25.470
 once cooked I get the 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.070
 pumpkin and I pour it into a 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.930
 stove 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.930
 I will add oil 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.169
 all this must be crushed or have 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:48.219
 a nice pumpkin jam 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.219
 then for sugar 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.110
 I sprinkle with semolina sugar 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.970
 see that she will still bleed 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:09.120
 so the idea is trust on 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.120
 soft fire or foehn cinnamon 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:26.540
 orange blossom water and putty 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:38.220
 and we will continue cooking while stirring 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.710
 quietly and you will see the 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.620
 texture in a little moment of the 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.730
 pumpkin jam that we're going 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.130
 see after half an hour the cook 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.530
 you can look at the texture of the 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.400
 jam it is beautiful and there a 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.920
 straight color 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.780
 we let confire between half 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.030
 hour at three quarters of an hour on a low heat 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.770
 as I explained now for the 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.770
 sauce and fried chicken 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:12.600
 here is the result of the pole mta ni it's 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.670
 a very reduced sauce really very 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.580
 short and for decoration 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.040
 I'll take I took rather 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.390
 months that I spent in the oven and then I 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.720
 get rid of their little 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.220
 very thin film we will have the 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.990
 chicken legs and then we see the 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.990
 garnish with pumpkin jam 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.920
 2 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.550
 I presented you one of the versions 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:54.919
 chicken garnier garnier with a 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.150
 sweet topping that was the 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:58.520
 candied pumpkin 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.550
 you can see your version of the pool 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.470
 and tart, that is to say win with 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.509
 candied lemon and red olives 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.509
 always on TV shueisha good appetite 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.530
 and
