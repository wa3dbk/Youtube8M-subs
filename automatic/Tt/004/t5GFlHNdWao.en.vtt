squeaks<00:01:43.630> are<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:44.020> guys<00:01:44.579> once<00:01:45.579> you've<00:01:45.700> gotten

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
squeaks are you guys once you've gotten

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.609 
squeaks are you guys once you've gotten
to<00:01:46.030> fold<00:01:46.299> in<00:01:46.420> half<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.720> second<00:01:47.049> time<00:01:47.200> leave<00:01:47.439> it

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
to fold in half the second time leave it

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.350 
to fold in half the second time leave it
folded<00:01:48.040> in<00:01:48.219> half<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.729> then<00:01:48.790> with<00:01:48.969> the<00:01:49.090> flaps

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
folded in half and then with the flaps

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.899 
folded in half and then with the flaps
that<00:01:49.600> are<00:01:49.719> open<00:01:49.869> facing<00:01:50.680> towards<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.219> you

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
that are open facing towards you you

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.940 
that are open facing towards you you
want<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.180> then<00:01:52.329> fold<00:01:52.990> each<00:01:53.350> of<00:01:53.560> these<00:01:53.680> sides

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
want to then fold each of these sides

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.550 
want to then fold each of these sides
over<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.640> create<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.360> third<00:01:55.869> of<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.110> fold<00:01:56.380> each

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
over to create a third of a fold each

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.440 
over to create a third of a fold each
way<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.490> easiest<00:01:57.520> way<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.939> do<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.119> is<00:01:58.299> to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
way and the easiest way to do that is to

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.050 
way and the easiest way to do that is to
just<00:01:58.719> start<00:01:59.140> up<00:01:59.320> here<00:01:59.350> right<00:01:59.680> where<00:01:59.860> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
just start up here right where that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.090 
just start up here right where that
creases<00:02:01.060> get<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.539> beginnings<00:02:02.110> where<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.799> tip

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
creases get the beginnings where the tip

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.950 
creases get the beginnings where the tip
of<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.399> hat<00:02:03.430> are<00:02:03.700> going<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.909> be<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.299> then<00:02:04.869> you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
of the hat are going to be and then you

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.719 
of the hat are going to be and then you
can<00:02:05.079> go<00:02:05.110> this<00:02:05.380> way<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:06.130> kind<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.369> get<00:02:06.520> that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
can go this way to and kind of get that

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.450 
can go this way to and kind of get that
going<00:02:06.969> and<00:02:07.240> then<00:02:07.810> as<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.289> pull<00:02:08.590> each<00:02:09.070> of<00:02:09.340> these

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
going and then as you pull each of these

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.430 
going and then as you pull each of these
over<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.090> could<00:02:10.210> try<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.390> find<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:11.110> part

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
over you could try to find the part

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.510 
over you could try to find the part
where<00:02:12.190> where<00:02:12.970> they<00:02:13.180> cross<00:02:13.570> here<00:02:14.380> matches<00:02:15.070> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
where where they cross here matches the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.350 
where where they cross here matches the
center<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.060> kind<00:02:16.270> of<00:02:16.300> gives<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.510> an<00:02:16.630> idea

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
center that kind of gives you an idea

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.080 
center that kind of gives you an idea
at<00:02:17.570> least<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:19.250> give<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.520> little<00:02:19.760> tricky

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
at least and it give you a little tricky

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.790 
at least and it give you a little tricky
you<00:02:20.300> want<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.600> try<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.870> couple<00:02:20.900> times<00:02:21.170> but

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
you want to try it a couple times but

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.080 
you want to try it a couple times but
and<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.130> doesn't<00:02:22.400> have<00:02:22.460> to<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.640> perfect

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
and it doesn't have to be perfect

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.690 
and it doesn't have to be perfect
perfect<00:02:23.450> but<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.870> want<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.110> try<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.380> get

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
perfect but you do want to try to get

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.000 
perfect but you do want to try to get
everything<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:26.000> kind<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.210> pull<00:02:26.480> over<00:02:27.010> until

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
everything to kind of pull over until

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.640 
everything to kind of pull over until
you<00:02:28.130> can<00:02:28.250> get<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.580> good<00:02:28.730> spot<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.650> once

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
you can get to a good spot and once

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.780 
you can get to a good spot and once
you've<00:02:30.770> kind<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.010> got<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.190> good<00:02:31.400> spot<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.760> can

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
you've kind of got a good spot you can

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.520 
you've kind of got a good spot you can
then<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.270> open<00:02:32.480> things<00:02:32.840> up<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.200> fold<00:02:33.380> it

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
then just open things up and fold it

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.350 
then just open things up and fold it
down<00:02:33.710> or<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.160> could<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.340> smush<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.790> down<00:02:35.090> to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
down or you could just smush it down to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.600 
down or you could just smush it down to
either<00:02:35.660> way<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.050> works<00:02:36.200> fine<00:02:36.470> but<00:02:36.740> we<00:02:37.370> want<00:02:37.550> to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
either way it works fine but we want to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.270 
either way it works fine but we want to
try<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:37.850> get<00:02:38.120> as<00:02:38.390> close<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.990> third<00:02:39.470> fold<00:02:40.010> as

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
try to get as close to a third fold as

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.330 
try to get as close to a third fold as
we<00:02:40.460> can<00:02:40.670> there<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:42.710> that's<00:02:42.830> something<00:02:43.100> like

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
we can there so that's something like

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.880 
we can there so that's something like
this<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.870> I'm<00:02:44.990> just<00:02:45.140> going<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.320> take<00:02:45.530> the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
this and I'm just going to take the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.130 
this and I'm just going to take the
first<00:02:46.730> layer<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.420> little<00:02:47.630> pointed<00:02:47.930> end

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
first layer of that little pointed end

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.960 
first layer of that little pointed end
down<00:02:48.380> there<00:02:48.590> pull<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.459> up<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.610> we're<00:02:49.820> going<00:02:49.940> to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
down there pull it up and we're going to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.550 
down there pull it up and we're going to
create<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.360> crease<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.720> goes<00:02:51.110> right<00:02:51.380> straight

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
create a crease that goes right straight

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.680 
create a crease that goes right straight
across<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.190> middle<00:02:52.430> here<00:02:52.670> by<00:02:52.880> pulling<00:02:53.570> this

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
across the middle here by pulling this

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.750 
across the middle here by pulling this
up<00:02:53.750> as<00:02:54.020> far<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:54.320> it'll<00:02:54.470> go<00:02:54.530> now<00:02:55.280> there's<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.550> few

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
up as far as it'll go now there's a few

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.220 
up as far as it'll go now there's a few
layers<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.209> paper<00:02:56.420> there<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:56.989> want<00:02:57.140> to

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
layers of paper there so you want to

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.620 
layers of paper there so you want to
kind<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.440> work<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:58.220> slowly<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.420> you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
kind of work with it slowly so that you

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.930 
kind of work with it slowly so that you
can<00:02:59.840> get<00:03:00.020> it<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.290> come<00:03:00.470> up<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.040> want<00:03:01.880> to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
can get it to come up and you want to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.360 
can get it to come up and you want to
try<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.209> kind<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.600> keep<00:03:03.230> things<00:03:03.620> as<00:03:03.830> centered

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
try to kind of keep things as centered

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.510 
try to kind of keep things as centered
as<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.760> can<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:06.530> which<00:03:06.739> try<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.040> pull<00:03:07.340> this

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
as you can to so which try to pull this

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.550 
as you can to so which try to pull this
up<00:03:07.989> as<00:03:08.989> far<00:03:09.290> as<00:03:09.470> it'll<00:03:09.709> go<00:03:11.080> get<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> good<00:03:12.290> crease

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
up as far as it'll go get a good crease

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.550 
up as far as it'll go get a good crease
going<00:03:12.830> down<00:03:12.950> here<00:03:13.130> at<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.280> bottom<00:03:14.560> flip

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
going down here at the bottom flip

going down here at the bottom flip
everything<00:03:15.860> over<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.489> fold<00:03:16.760> this<00:03:16.940> part<00:03:17.209> up<00:03:17.420> to

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
everything over and fold this part up to

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.240
