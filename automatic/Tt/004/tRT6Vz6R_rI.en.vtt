00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello everyone, so I waited for me 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.230
 leaks 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.800
 no se que money for a battle today for you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.679
 show you how to set up a forest to be a rider 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.760
 In principle, we have trolls 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.760
 not very good for us to wait for spawn 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.510
 us go 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:34.160
 Well, in principle, and the graph is also possible 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:38.420
 hurt in principle completely and from here 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.280
 already starting to beat them the second set we 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.280
 almost kill the trolls 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:58.080
 In principle, this is easy, well, just not very 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.559
 annoying or something like that 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.320
 sit and kill the clips here are not 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.490
 appeared we appeared trolls not very 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.470
 we are lucky okay for now you can 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.650
 say batrider struck at all 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.360
 batrider buys as if sleeping on 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.080
 goes blink dagger to jump and 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.930
 started pulling out 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.050
 of course became not delay maxim somewhere 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:33.289
 we buy more ships after four 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:38.490
 the joint here it serves to 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:42.990
 push closer to rivals then who 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.830
 we want in general for now 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.830
 next video 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.970
 need to put a little troll now 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:13.980
 and happy over the course and now we can walk 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:16.340
 to go well, I am a little blunted so 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.340
 let's say 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.840
 We also take Volt wolves under oil in 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.069
 Generally nothing easy now to us when 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.069
 our battle will come running 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.379
 Well, nothing heavy, that is, I apparently 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.379
 said still easy okay not the point 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.970
 the main thing is that we usually battle 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.450
 there is still a little bit to die too 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.340
 a lot of great and it would be nice 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.730
 sorry for saying so badly 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.730
 schoolboy after all 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:50.430
 here we are slightly 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:53.690
 so let's say stuffed and wait for spawn if 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.010
 still you do not want to wait for spawn 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.390
 you can probably try them like this 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:08.040
 here is the principle of killing and just like this 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:09.830
 we stand in the pits that time trying somehow 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.830
 control courier 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:18.380
 Well, in general, I apologize what is so bad 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:21.590
 I drive a mouse after all 7 recently bought a 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.720
 I have not had time to try 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.690
 in general, I think you learned how 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.130
 farm from the rider in the woods on the main 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.950
 remember better boots of speed 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.430
 blink dagger just fu on already on 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:45.360
 situations can be put together like kb shiva 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:47.340
 all breezes tornado tornado hears in 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.920
 overall he needs mobility 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.920
 maximum mobility 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.780
 do, that is, we take a lindover jump 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.540
 here 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:03.510
 a8 is just a flagship court foundation 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:06.660
 Naturally try to stand in the lobby and I 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.900
 I am sure that you will succeed 1 cow 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.900
 good luck
