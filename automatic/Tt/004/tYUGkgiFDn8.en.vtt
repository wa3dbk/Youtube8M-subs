know<00:01:01.949> outside<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> Japan<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.809> figured<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
know outside of Japan so I figured I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.870 
know outside of Japan so I figured I
would<00:01:04.439> try<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.680> track<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.040> game<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
would try and track this game down and I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.010 
would try and track this game down and I
ventured<00:01:06.240> out<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> game<00:01:06.720> stops

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
joystick to actually move the light it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.930 
joystick to actually move the light it
looks<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:17.769> kind<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.160> like<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.340> flashlight<00:03:18.670> on

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
looks like kind of like a flashlight on

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.550 
looks like kind of like a flashlight on
the<00:03:19.150> screen<00:03:19.359> you<00:03:19.480> have<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.750> move<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.019> in<00:03:20.440> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
the screen you have to move that in the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.960 
the screen you have to move that in the
direction<00:03:20.829> that<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.190> squiggly<00:03:21.640> line<00:03:21.820> is

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
direction that the squiggly line is

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.930 
direction that the squiggly line is
going<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:23.040> instead<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:24.220> mash<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.640> buttons

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
going so instead just mash the buttons

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.250 
going so instead just mash the buttons
in<00:03:25.060> time<00:03:25.269> for<00:03:25.540> aligning<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.959> up<00:03:26.049> with<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
in time for aligning it up with the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.500 
in time for aligning it up with the
circles<00:03:26.620> you're<00:03:26.890> at<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.250> same<00:03:27.430> time<00:03:27.670> pointing

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
circles you're at the same time pointing

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.000 
circles you're at the same time pointing
in<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.690> direction<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.380> line<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.739> going

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
in the direction that the line is going

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.190 
in the direction that the line is going
so<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.790> gets<00:03:30.910> pretty<00:03:31.150> challenging<00:03:31.720> at<00:03:31.810> times<00:03:31.840> I

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
so it gets pretty challenging at times I

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.569 
so it gets pretty challenging at times I
mean<00:03:32.350> when<00:03:32.470> that's<00:03:32.620> when<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.040> starts<00:03:33.310> speeding

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
mean when that's when it starts speeding

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.280 
mean when that's when it starts speeding
up<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.329> you<00:03:34.420> know<00:03:34.569> constantly

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
up and you have to you know constantly

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.479 
up and you have to you know constantly
change<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.709> direction<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.160> press<00:03:36.370> the

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
change the direction and press the

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.979 
change the direction and press the
buttons<00:03:36.790> they<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.000> get<00:03:37.180> really<00:03:37.390> challenging

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
buttons they can get really challenging

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.780 
buttons they can get really challenging
and<00:03:38.140> then<00:03:38.650> when<00:03:38.769> they<00:03:38.859> start<00:03:39.100> mixing<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.579> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
and then when they start mixing in the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.280 
and then when they start mixing in the
mode<00:03:39.970> where<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.209> have<00:03:40.359> to<00:03:40.480> defend<00:03:40.780> which<00:03:41.109> is

mode where you have to defend which is
when<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.650> four<00:03:41.920> face<00:03:42.160> buttons<00:03:42.190> will<00:03:43.180> come

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
when the four face buttons will come

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.610 
when the four face buttons will come
forward<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.870> center<00:03:44.109> of<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.290> screen<00:03:44.500> and

forward to the center of the screen and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.259 
forward to the center of the screen and
marrying<00:03:45.160> speeds<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:45.730> have<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:45.940> press<00:03:46.060> them

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
marrying speeds you have to press them

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.509 
marrying speeds you have to press them
at<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.420> same<00:03:46.569> time<00:03:46.780> now<00:03:47.680> how<00:03:47.889> this<00:03:48.100> ties<00:03:48.280> into

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
at the same time now how this ties into

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.280 
at the same time now how this ties into
the<00:03:48.639> life<00:03:48.880> bars<00:03:49.180> at<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.389> top<00:03:49.480> basically<00:03:49.840> every

the life bars at the top basically every

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.750 
the life bars at the top basically every
level<00:03:50.590> is<00:03:50.680> sort<00:03:50.889> of<00:03:50.950> like<00:03:51.069> a<00:03:51.130> battle<00:03:51.519> so

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
level is sort of like a battle so

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.430 
level is sort of like a battle so
usually<00:03:52.660> at<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.810> beginning<00:03:53.109> of<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:53.290> level

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.420 
you get a chance to do damage them
depending<00:04:06.410> upon<00:04:06.500> how<00:04:06.800> well<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:07.130> do<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.340> your

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.470 
combos and then the enemy has turned to
attack<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.550> what<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:10.760> have<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:10.970> defend<00:04:11.240> and

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
attack and what you have to defend and

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.330 
attack and what you have to defend and
that's<00:04:11.720> when<00:04:11.990> the<00:04:12.020> face<00:04:12.350> button<00:04:12.740> combinations

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
that's when the face button combinations

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.470 
that's when the face button combinations
come<00:04:13.550> in<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:13.820> that's<00:04:13.940> when<00:04:14.090> you're<00:04:14.180> defending

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
come in and that's when you're defending

so in essence you can actually just

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.550 
so in essence you can actually just
totally<00:04:17.330> ignore<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.720> light<00:04:17.870> bars<00:04:18.140> or<00:04:18.410> just

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
totally ignore the light bars or just

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.440 
totally ignore the light bars or just
try<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:18.769> do<00:04:18.950> your<00:04:19.070> combos<00:04:19.459> but<00:04:19.730> it<00:04:20.269> kind<00:04:20.420> of

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
try and do your combos but it kind of

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.880 
try and do your combos but it kind of
adds<00:04:20.600> this<00:04:20.840> little<00:04:21.110> battle<00:04:21.260> element<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.799> the
