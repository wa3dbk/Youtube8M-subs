in<00:00:23.400> fact<00:00:23.670> there's<00:00:23.820> pretty<00:00:24.000> much<00:00:24.060> only<00:00:24.270> been

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
in fact there's pretty much only been

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.550 
in fact there's pretty much only been
one<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.400> bmw<00:00:26.970> x3<00:00:27.470> it's<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
one and it's this the bmw x3 it's a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.230 
one and it's this the bmw x3 it's a
reasonable<00:00:29.010> car<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.400> drives<00:00:29.730> pretty<00:00:29.970> well

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
reasonable car it drives pretty well

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.359 
reasonable car it drives pretty well
it's<00:00:30.420> sort<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.930> a<00:00:31.199> condensed<00:00:31.859> version<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
it's sort of like a condensed version of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.420 
it's sort of like a condensed version of
the<00:00:32.460> x5<00:00:32.699> exactly<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> same<00:00:33.720> principle<00:00:34.430> decent

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the x5 exactly the same principle decent

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.040 
the x5 exactly the same principle decent
engine<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.879> four-cylinder<00:00:36.540> diesel<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
engine little four-cylinder diesel and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.200 
engine little four-cylinder diesel and
this<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.380> doesn't<00:00:38.100> sound<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.489> much<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:38.969> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
this one doesn't sound like much but it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.910 
this one doesn't sound like much but it
does<00:00:39.329> actually<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.320> crucially

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
does actually go all right and crucially

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.549 
does actually go all right and crucially
doesn't<00:00:41.730> use<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:42.120> fuel<00:00:42.450> less<00:00:43.079> than<00:00:43.350> most

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
doesn't use much fuel less than most

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.220 
doesn't use much fuel less than most
small<00:00:43.950> cars<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:45.390> course<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.899> smaller

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
small cars and of course it's smaller

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.920 
small cars and of course it's smaller
much<00:00:46.770> easier<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> handle<00:00:47.340> around<00:00:47.760> town<00:00:48.000> so

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
much easier to handle around town so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.090 
much easier to handle around town so
you'd<00:00:49.079> think<00:00:49.260> others<00:00:49.649> would<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.890> caught

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
you'd think others would have caught

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.910 
you'd think others would have caught
naan<00:00:50.370> by<00:00:50.550> now<00:00:50.760> well<00:00:51.719> actually<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:52.649> head<00:00:54.920> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
naan by now well actually my head and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.650 
naan by now well actually my head and
someone<00:00:56.309> cut<00:00:56.579> from<00:00:56.760> brands<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.329> might<00:00:57.510> not

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
someone cut from brands you might not

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.389 
someone cut from brands you might not
expect

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.979

archrival somewhere in the mix and this

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.929 
archrival somewhere in the mix and this
time<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.170> comes<00:01:35.439> from<00:01:35.590> Audi<00:01:35.860> in<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.399> form<00:01:36.670> of

time it comes from Audi in the form of

time it comes from Audi in the form of
the<00:01:37.240> new<00:01:37.420> q5

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.180 

the<00:01:49.480> Freelander<00:01:49.870> maybe<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.230> similar<00:01:50.680> price<00:01:50.950> but

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
the Freelander maybe a similar price but

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.010 
the Freelander maybe a similar price but
it's<00:01:51.310> playing<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.910> slightly<00:01:52.480> different<00:01:52.810> game

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
it's playing a slightly different game

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.870 
it's playing a slightly different game
mainly<00:01:53.800> because<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.190> focuses<00:01:54.700> more<00:01:54.730> on

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
mainly because it focuses more on

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.510 
mainly because it focuses more on
offroad<00:01:55.570> rather<00:01:56.020> than<00:01:56.260> on<00:01:56.380> road<00:01:56.620> so<00:01:56.920> it's<00:01:57.400> not

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
offroad rather than on road so it's not

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.980 
offroad rather than on road so it's not
quite<00:01:57.850> as<00:01:57.970> sharp<00:01:58.150> as<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.390> others<00:01:58.690> through<00:01:58.840> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
quite as sharp as the others through the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.870 
quite as sharp as the others through the
corners<00:01:59.350> but<00:01:59.740> makes<00:02:00.040> up<00:02:00.220> for<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.460> with<00:02:00.640> things

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
corners but makes up for it with things

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.480 
corners but makes up for it with things
like<00:02:01.000> comfort<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.260> engine<00:02:02.590> again<00:02:03.130> goes

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
like comfort the engine again goes

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.130 
like comfort the engine again goes
alright<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:04.000> can<00:02:04.150> hear<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.480> it's<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.720> diesel

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
alright you can hear that it's a diesel

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.690 
alright you can hear that it's a diesel
but<00:02:05.410> that's<00:02:05.590> fine<00:02:05.860> because<00:02:06.100> it's<00:02:06.340> not<00:02:06.490> too

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
but that's fine because it's not too

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.389 
but that's fine because it's not too
obtrusive<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:08.229> there's<00:02:08.470> some<00:02:08.649> really<00:02:08.920> clever

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
obtrusive but there's some really clever

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.040 
obtrusive but there's some really clever
things<00:02:09.729> in<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.000> Freelander<00:02:10.420> things<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.960> I

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
things in the Freelander things that I

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.660 
things in the Freelander things that I
love<00:02:11.350> make<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.740> a<00:02:11.800> lot<00:02:12.040> easier<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.460> live<00:02:12.640> with

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
love make it a lot easier to live with
