00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.440
 now I'm going to make a brief 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.880
 demonstration of how the game works 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.280
 of stone paper or scissors that I've 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.559
 developed to illustrate the use of 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.099
 robotic platforms as a laboratory 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.679
 experimental for this occasion 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.990
 have made some models of 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:23.849
 prediction based on the theory of 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.849
 games let's see how it works 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.860
 we launch the application 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.930
 here you can see a logo of the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.520
 drivers that are loading and the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.350
 necessary configuration so that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.750
 application work 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.720
 and we access the web interface 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.940
 where you can administer the application 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.760
 users can consult the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.260
 results of the games and also 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.130
 can extract all the data that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.699
 pick up that picks up the robot about its 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.950
 predictions and the behavior of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.230
 subjects in study 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.590
 let's start up and let's 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.590
 start to play 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.880
 if we are going to play 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.260
 the treatment as a player 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.260
 do not 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.530
 and as a player 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.009
 do not 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.620
 for hair that you are 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.620
 2. 3 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.490
 23 stone paper or ideas 1 2 and 3 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.580
 who are going to be able to touch them 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.800
 drag it alone and wait for not having 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.360
 trained ceiling 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.960
 U.S 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.960
 do not 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.220
 delighted to have played with you until 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.220
 the next
