00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 here or occasionally for donors 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.060
 mic berton 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.370
 forgive me the thing forgive me the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.840
 brightness but I have just left the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.370
 work and what I had done 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.570
 this morning he was among relatives of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.940
 probably also a nice video a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.650
 certain point boom also grew it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.420
 smartphone I don't know why 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.550
 so let's start again 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.320
 then what was missing the other day 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.060
 is missing on the other video on the other 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.769
 video was simply missing the part 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.519
 phone numbers just to make you understand 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.269
 then usually speech without pedal on 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.180
 brake 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.649
 let's turn on the usual boot up of 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.290
 qatar systems 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.620
 here it is very very sporty one 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.989
 cool that the system is turning on 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 the usual directions the usual ones 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.070
 indications remember that the system 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 the system you connect what is there 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.239
 others have another 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.949
 particularity that maybe maybe a 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.410
 someone has escaped maybe she was raised 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.239
 just to me anyway I tell you if you 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.500
 take and keep the system pushed 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.979
 remember that even the park assistant 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 new friend and in the sense it works but not 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.170
 hear the audio because it left us 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.780
 the audio attached to the infotainment 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.780
 then audio and zero out or zero audio 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.420
 or infor tainment off 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.630
 you automatically see the indication 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 bright but you see virtually no 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.520
 part inherent in the big beat that makes when 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.619
 do in the motorhome archa then 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.450
 attention that maybe you don't like me 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.700
 the other day I was backing up 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.670
 I watched I only heard the audio I have 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.020
 found practically with the bottom almost 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.060
 attached a car to almost not 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.220
 go on and later I realized that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.479
 I missed that I missed the sound of the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.560
 the bb of the park assistant then 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.189
 phone then what happens to 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.360
 phone 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.579
 let's go and see while we go to 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.829
 see where we are on the radio level as well 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.200
 my name is in another position 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.969
 perfect we are in a radio then 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.799
 this and for paolo is that he complained 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.869
 of help speech help but what do I have to 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.399
 do what i have to crush command 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.560
 vocal then we have the controls 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.110
 vowels no eye here what I do now 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.110
 paolo io as voice command from this 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.930
 call mom and make a call prema 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:25.540
 the call button wants me to press the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:28.240
 phone button in its place let's say 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.000
 dial followed by phone number or 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.640
 say call followed by the full name 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.890
 of the contact and the type of phone that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:43.720
 want to call canceled ok then the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.610
 question this we always arrive 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.040
 however, it is through a green button 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.860
 telephone voice command both via 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.410
 also the command of the little man who speaks 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.850
 directly on the phone, remember it 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.970
 there is no problem getting there 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.890
 after which it is very reactive in the sense it is 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.880
 very nice both in regards to 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.730
 the messages he obviously reads and to which 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.260
 you can only reply via a list 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.930
 pre made 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.520
 it is not that we can put ourselves up to 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.010
 messaging with our messages 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.180
 with with our text and there are gods 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.250
 in short, pre-written messages 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.350
 enough and therefore it can be done 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.850
 directly the message that attention 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.310
 now let's do the actual test 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:34.870
 phone so I always go as at 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:35.950
 usually you can see the phone 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.690
 the list of what can be done 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.690
 now I make it go wrong 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:56.470
 please try again, mom call me 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.200
 calling mom cell to finish 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.200
 the call presses the end call key
