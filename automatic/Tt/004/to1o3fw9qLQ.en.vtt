that was presumably after the user hit
cancel<00:03:53.200> that's<00:03:54.200> just<00:03:54.470> about<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.710> for<00:03:54.890> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
cancel that's just about it for the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.190 
cancel that's just about it for the
event<00:03:55.430> clearly<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.240> lumiose<00:03:56.570> catcher<00:03:56.930> was

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
event clearly the lumiose catcher was

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.200 
event clearly the lumiose catcher was
obvious<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.890> anyone<00:03:58.340> who<00:03:58.490> predicted<00:03:59.000> a

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
obvious and anyone who predicted a

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.590 
obvious and anyone who predicted a
connection<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.200> lumiose<00:04:00.500> was<00:04:00.890> correct<00:04:01.600> and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
connection to lumiose was correct and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.800 
connection to lumiose was correct and
obviously<00:04:02.990> it<00:04:03.530> relates<00:04:03.800> to<00:04:03.890> mountains<00:04:04.310> and

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
obviously it relates to mountains and

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.380 
obviously it relates to mountains and
volcanoes<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:06.560> its<00:04:06.890> name<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.430> pokedex<00:04:08.030> entry

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
volcanoes is its name and pokedex entry

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.930 
volcanoes is its name and pokedex entry
apply<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.980> obviously<00:04:10.250> we<00:04:10.340> don't<00:04:10.430> have<00:04:10.640> all<00:04:10.820> the

apply so obviously we don't have all the

apply so obviously we don't have all the
details<00:04:10.970> yet<00:04:11.420> but<00:04:11.840> as<00:04:12.530> we<00:04:12.770> get<00:04:12.890> more<00:04:12.920> details

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
details yet but as we get more details

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.130

I'm<00:04:13.760> sure<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.240> information<00:04:14.360> will<00:04:14.810> be<00:04:14.840> out<00:04:14.959> the

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
I'm sure the information will be out the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.560 
I'm sure the information will be out the
internet<00:04:15.470> maybe<00:04:15.680> I'll<00:04:15.950> report<00:04:16.280> more<00:04:16.549> I<00:04:16.820> don't
