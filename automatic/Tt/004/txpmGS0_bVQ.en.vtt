a<00:00:12.690> few<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.019> components<00:00:13.559> just<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.860> see<00:00:14.009> how

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
a few of the components just to see how

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.369 
a few of the components just to see how
it<00:00:14.340> would<00:00:14.549> all<00:00:14.580> look<00:00:14.849> what<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> like<00:00:15.990> about<00:00:16.109> it

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
it would all look what I like about it

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.380 
it would all look what I like about it
immediately<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.160> how<00:00:17.550> well<00:00:17.820> everything<00:00:18.210> does

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
immediately is how well everything does

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.480 
immediately is how well everything does
seem<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.810> fit<00:00:18.960> together<00:00:19.279> everything<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.369> nice

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
seem to fit together everything in nice

main spire where you'd expect to see
them<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.690> manual<00:01:51.899> actually<00:01:52.259> says<00:01:52.470> CG<00:01:52.830> is

them but the manual actually says CG is

the wingspan is shorter it has a

the wingspan is shorter it has a

slightly deeper wing cord that's all for

slightly deeper wing cord that's all for
now<00:02:48.780> once<00:02:49.380> i've<00:02:49.560> put<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.190> together<00:02:50.340> for<00:02:50.880> some

now once i've put it together for some
line-of-sight<00:02:51.480> flight<00:02:51.780> testing<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.410> might<00:02:52.799> put

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
line-of-sight flight testing I might put

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.350 
line-of-sight flight testing I might put
together<00:02:53.130> another<00:02:53.549> video<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.880> show<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.150> how

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
together another video to show you how

together another video to show you how
I've<00:02:54.540> gone<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.019> highlight<00:02:55.650> any<00:02:55.799> issues<00:02:56.340> that

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
I've gone and highlight any issues that

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.590 
I've gone and highlight any issues that
I<00:02:56.519> had<00:02:56.840> choosen<00:02:57.840> thanks<00:02:58.200> for<00:02:58.320> watching
