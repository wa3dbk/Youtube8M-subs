00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.769
 then today begins a series of things that I repeat but I never have 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:08.069
 had the opportunity 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.709
 the testimonials 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.990
 query on the occasion of the arrival of the new computer components 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.609
 i just won the war 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.400
 recorder 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.310
 not even the motherboard 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.560
 I will try to perform my binary functions see flip flops 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.769
 so I will try to explain inapa very plainly 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.789
 how to assemble your own computer is the person who how to create your own 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:34.700
 wife 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.850
 own work machine by michele - 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.820
 a computer suitable even in situations of more than you, assuming they are not 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.880
 absolutely a computer technician did I did no 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.670
 cost 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.300
 of no kind if I learned to do these things by mounting see mounting 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.830
 things is certainly more than anything for passion but also for an attempt to 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.200
 protect yourself for, many things you can manage to be a shame, surely you are 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.780
 safeguarded from the rip-offs now by getting the benevolence of saw 7 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.000
 obviously he looked at us 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.270
 art. up to its power is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.050
 at least for me. list the list of ingredients for today 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.750
 elements and components are personal computers 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.090
 that in my case sandri specific products are among things 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.810
 that always have repercussions 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.150
 let's look at some parameters of some components as they work certain 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.180
 things what to choose 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.950
 and then in real time 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.140
 and see 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 literally how to weld the pieces is like 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.369
 create your own coupons 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.420
 before this I wanted to spend two 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.430
 words on two things right 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.210
 first of all why a person should never choose city 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.030
 to buy the individual components rather than select an assembly 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.039
 then when any freak who gets rid of their respective 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.499
 if you go to one of the shopping centers 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:08.329
 29name mediaworld cornate give you a pc hardware section as it's called 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.489
 for all this list dd assembled comes the sixth grade urticaria precisely 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.269
 with reversible parents because 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.379
 casper better than the mind with these assembled with stratospheric cpus 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.699
 and maybe 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:28.040
 a video card 1503 leave by shared copper 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.219
 not integrated 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:33.819
 and then it puts the card of gym of peace very low a power supply above 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:34.949
 patatona 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.419
 a chinoisate 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.769
 absolutely of very low quality 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.929
 and above all from Rome these things make them overpay 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:48.959
 now I'm from the billiard room, you say, tell me this or this computer 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:49.860
 assembled 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.350
 antida is sellers on ebay I didn't tell you look 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.479
 pisa - prota 200 euros more 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.430
 and it didn't take me atelier to check it no ken we have the means 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.509
 no simple finder prices go to see the individual components how much 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:11.059
 it costs you to see that their summation bank to be always smaller than the 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.679
 sympathy of Constantine 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.519
 at night in these cases, boys 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.429
 bhaskar had to be avoided 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:20.959
 the rope 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.049
 certainly 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.139
 yes when websites with put baby sites selling 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.770
 of damaged hardware products online 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.129
 I sell works with assembly service and texts that 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.109
 are 30 and up to the mac 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.050
 but why love a person should choose 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.190
 heirs assemble in the private room rather than take advantage of this 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.139
 service 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.879
 well meanwhile the past. I have a bad experience with these parts assembly 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.369
 of companies and companies 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:55.460
 I got a computer with an assembled one giving it scabrous 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.950
 and with hands in wiring another video of wires that you couldn't understand how 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.559
 could have passed in the middle row 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:03.860
 but be careful 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.989
 cheee I follow selected pc + box and where was a rope processor 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.999
 integrated spoltor there is the applied happy3 pasta that sucks but I don't have it 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:19.829
 if a person with whom you bill extra poor not distorted and do not attempt a 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.099
 cart also 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:27.289
 umbria m a thermoconductive paste the spamina that 30 cents to put it e 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.419
 not even four 4 cents for a band to give people 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.960
 and therefore at least on that occasion 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.260
 airport literally risked d computer ports 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.460
 another question too. d series final 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.940
 hotel knows very well that computers with anything electronic scazzy 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.000
 easily so for any problem does not turn on 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.440
 blue-yellow-green black screen 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.750
 eh pleasant 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.180
 succeeded avatars learned how to scare 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.540
 and the exit of silvi la 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.469
 quote 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:06.159
 because as I did in the past unfortunately there is something wrong then I was looking for 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.500
 some support site for some stores 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.449
 he was 35 euros and called 70 euros per hour 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.070
 lg the turn of no 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.230
 and in Czech art books, travel books that I put 2 now that sky 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.129
 staccato 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.990
 that song girls like 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.319
 is a financial operator who speculates on the cost of money 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.110
 in the bank and it is known that the bank is generally recognized with another 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.779
 part and you are doing these operations hey hey we do not trim 2500 gross of 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:36.919
 interest then 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.380
 then of the bacterium 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.940
 if nothing else they have class skills but in these things we can 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.120
 having the capacity at least we care and we were watching from the capture 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.550
 another thing about the warranty of course if 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.280
 if you have any assembly you have the guarantee on the semblate there is a seal 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.990
 asked some problem you have to vote for the seller 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.100
 n while s buy the individual components 8 obviously had you have 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.699
 freedom 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.030
 freedom of management if there is any problem individual problem 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.169
 sent to that components as a gift from Verona via authorized Neptune 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.340
 I had the warranty replaced 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.550
 which is something that looks like a 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.880
 the stuff recently but at least you have the freedom to change the components of the 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.460
 computer as you wish
