can you I'm sorry I'm not sure how
pronounce<00:00:18.119> your<00:00:18.240> last<00:00:18.270> name<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.800> do

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
pronounce your last name and I do

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.560 
pronounce your last name and I do
apologize<00:00:20.310> if<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.789> butchered<00:00:21.090> your<00:00:21.330> last

pronouncing<00:00:22.109> your<00:00:22.170> last<00:00:22.380> name<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:23.340> I'm

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
pronouncing your last name but I'm

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.970 
pronouncing your last name but I'm
guessing<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.000> Anthony<00:00:24.449> busca<00:00:24.630> no<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
guessing it's Anthony busca no but I

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.630 
guessing it's Anthony busca no but I
could<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.310> wrong

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
could be wrong

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
could be wrong
so<00:00:26.820> hopefully<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.930> right<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
so hopefully I was right in one of the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.740 
so hopefully I was right in one of the
three<00:00:29.039> other<00:00:29.310> pronunciations<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.420> tried

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
three other pronunciations that I tried

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.770 
three other pronunciations that I tried

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
so anyway this is a pretty pretty fairly
