00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
is one thing to remember though and

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.990 
is one thing to remember though and
something<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.650> i<00:04:14.769> have<00:04:15.160> found<00:04:15.340> is<00:04:15.639> that<00:04:15.670> in

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
something that i have found is that in

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.319 
something that i have found is that in
my<00:04:16.479> particular<00:04:16.810> area<00:04:17.410> i<00:04:17.650> can<00:04:17.979> get<00:04:18.280> more<00:04:18.760> easily

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
my particular area i can get more easily

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.599 
my particular area i can get more easily
the<00:04:19.720> minus<00:04:20.200> media<00:04:20.530> than<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.039> plus<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.549> i

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
the minus media than the plus and i

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.580 
the minus media than the plus and i
found<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.210> minus<00:04:22.630> media<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.110> little

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
found that the minus media is a little

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.490 
found that the minus media is a little
bit<00:04:23.740> cheaper<00:04:24.430> than<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:24.970> plus<00:04:25.510> however<00:04:25.780> that

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
bit cheaper than the plus however that

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500 
bit cheaper than the plus however that
will<00:04:26.650> change<00:04:26.889> over<00:04:27.070> time<00:04:27.430> because<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:28.210> course

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
will change over time because of course

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.870 
will change over time because of course
this<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:29.139> a<00:04:29.289> new<00:04:29.590> technology<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.610> tends

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
this is a new technology and that tends

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.640 
this is a new technology and that tends
to<00:04:31.030> be<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.180> little<00:04:31.389> bit<00:04:31.539> more<00:04:31.900> expensive<00:04:32.229> at<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
to be a little bit more expensive at the
