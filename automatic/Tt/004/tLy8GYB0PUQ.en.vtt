00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
built for speed and let me tell you when

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.190 
built for speed and let me tell you when
you<00:00:29.400> put<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.789> skate<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.030> it<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.450> time<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.900> drop

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
you put this skate on it is time to drop

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.940 
you put this skate on it is time to drop
the<00:00:31.260> hammer

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
the hammer

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.160 
the hammer
it<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.910> completely<00:00:33.300> built<00:00:33.539> for<00:00:33.749> speed<00:00:33.839> so

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
it is completely built for speed so

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.989 
it is completely built for speed so
let's<00:00:34.379> take<00:00:34.589> a<00:00:34.620> look<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:35.519> the<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:35.850> El

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:35.999 
let's take a look at what the right El

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.630 
let's take a look at what the right El
hammer<00:00:36.239> has<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.659> offer<00:00:36.980> when<00:00:37.980> talking<00:00:38.460> about

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
hammer has to offer when talking about

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.380 
hammer has to offer when talking about
sizing<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.870> boot<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:41.010> quite<00:00:41.999> a<00:00:42.030> bit<00:00:42.210> more

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
sizing this boot is all quite a bit more

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
sizing this boot is all quite a bit more
narrow<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> toes<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.649> opposed<00:00:44.039> to<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
narrow in the toes as opposed to the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.279 
narrow in the toes as opposed to the
heel<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.819> boot<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.839> is<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.109> to<00:00:46.170> be

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
heel of the boot so this is going to be

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.680 
heel of the boot so this is going to be
a<00:00:46.319> great<00:00:46.559> skate<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:47.069> you<00:00:47.699> have<00:00:47.999> if<00:00:48.329> your<00:00:48.449> toes

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
a great skate if you have if your toes

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.049 
a great skate if you have if your toes
and<00:00:48.929> naturally<00:00:49.379> come<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.769> a<00:00:49.800> point<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.879> your

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and naturally come to a point if your

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
and naturally come to a point if your
toes<00:00:51.300> sit<00:00:51.659> a<00:00:51.929> little<00:00:52.319> bit<00:00:52.409> more<00:00:52.559> flat<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:52.949> are

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
toes sit a little bit more flat and are

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.879 
toes sit a little bit more flat and are
rounded<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.870> want<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> compensate<00:00:55.530> by

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:55.889 
rounded then you want to compensate by

00:00:55.889 --> 00:01:00.079 
rounded then you want to compensate by
ordering<00:00:56.960> and/or<00:00:57.960> trying<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.679> a<00:00:58.949> size<00:00:59.699> that's

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
ordering and/or trying on a size that's

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.989 
ordering and/or trying on a size that's
about<00:01:00.359> half<00:01:00.629> size<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.139> maybe<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.379> size<00:01:01.649> larger<00:01:02.249> I

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
about half size to maybe a size larger I

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.660 
about half size to maybe a size larger I
typically<00:01:03.870> wear<00:01:04.170> seven<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.100> most<00:01:05.339> Rydell

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
typically wear seven in most Rydell

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.490 
typically wear seven in most Rydell
models<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.300> one<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> seven<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
models this one I like a seven and a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.400 
models this one I like a seven and a
half<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:08.270> but<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.450> you're<00:01:09.660> like<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.080> said<00:01:10.290> if

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
half in but if you're like I said if

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.440 
half in but if you're like I said if
your<00:01:10.560> toes<00:01:10.800> naturally<00:01:11.730> come<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> point

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
your toes naturally come to a point

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
your toes naturally come to a point

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you're probably going to be right on in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.080 
you're probably going to be right on in
the<00:01:14.880> size<00:01:15.120> you<00:01:15.270> normally<00:01:15.600> wear<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.870> Rydell's

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
the size you normally wear in Rydell's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.310 
the size you normally wear in Rydell's
like<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.210> said<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.510> a<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.780> bit<00:01:18.900> wider<00:01:19.080> in

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
like I said it's a little bit wider in

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
like I said it's a little bit wider in
the<00:01:19.350> heel<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.980> you've<00:01:20.490> got<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.730> great<00:01:21.000> speed

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the heel but you've got this great speed

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.150 
the heel but you've got this great speed
strap<00:01:21.660> which<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.870> gonna<00:01:22.140> lock<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.560> heel<00:01:22.830> in

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.160 
really well and it's an all leather boot
so<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.210> hold<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.660> really<00:01:27.870> really

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
so it's going to hold up really really

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.800 
so it's going to hold up really really
well<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:29.160> got<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.490> chambray<00:01:29.940> lining<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
dry since it is built for speed when we

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.280 
dry since it is built for speed when we
move<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.640> down<00:01:38.910> it's<00:01:39.150> got<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.630> powerdyne
