how<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.110> draw<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> car<00:00:02.419> this<00:00:03.419> one<00:00:03.659> this<00:00:04.410> method

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
how to draw a car this one this method

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.089 
how to draw a car this one this method
of<00:00:04.799> drawing<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.100> car<00:00:05.339> uses<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:06.000> grid<00:00:07.099> really

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
of drawing a car uses a grid really

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.100 
of drawing a car uses a grid really
agrees<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:09.030> grid<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.389> use<00:00:09.540> here<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.900> two

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
agrees the grid that we use here is two

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.039 
agrees the grid that we use here is two
Squires<00:00:11.389> side-by-side<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.690> form<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.400> rectangle

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
Squires side-by-side to form a rectangle

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.980 
Squires side-by-side to form a rectangle
which<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.230> actually<00:00:17.750> effectively<00:00:18.750> two

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
which is actually effectively two

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.689 
which is actually effectively two
squares<00:00:19.380> long<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.890> compete<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.189> roof<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
squares long and compete on roof and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.390 
squares long and compete on roof and
roof<00:00:21.150> free<00:00:21.750> hand<00:00:22.039> as<00:00:23.039> im<00:00:23.250> doing<00:00:23.490> here<00:00:23.990> I<00:00:25.400> think

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
roof free hand as im doing here I think

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.990 
roof free hand as im doing here I think
this<00:00:26.550> works<00:00:26.760> out<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.730> square<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this works out so that the square is a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.530 
this works out so that the square is a
slightly<00:00:30.720> taller<00:00:31.109> actually<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.650> more

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
slightly taller actually the more

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.240 
slightly taller actually the more
rectangular<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.230> straight<00:00:34.829> away<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.040> knew

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
rectangular so straight away I knew

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
rectangular so straight away I knew
about<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> car<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> draw<00:00:36.360> will<00:00:37.230> be

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
about the car I'm going to draw will be

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.240 
about the car I'm going to draw will be
a<00:00:37.739> short<00:00:37.860> stubby<00:00:38.640> car<00:00:39.410> obviously<00:00:40.410> if<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> want

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
a short stubby car obviously if you want

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790 
a short stubby car obviously if you want
to<00:00:41.309> make<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.610> sports<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.180> even<00:00:42.390> make<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.840> grid

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
to make a sports can even make the grid

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
to make a sports can even make the grid
a<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:44.100> bit<00:00:44.219> narrower<00:00:44.579> from<00:00:45.149> top<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.390> bottom

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
a little bit narrower from top to bottom

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.700 
a little bit narrower from top to bottom
but<00:00:46.430> some<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.120> how<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.740 

start<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.859> the<00:00:55.949> center<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:56.969> bottom<00:00:57.390> half

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
start on the center at the bottom half

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.900 
start on the center at the bottom half
here<00:00:58.170> draw<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> large<00:00:58.710> circle<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.760> touches

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
here draw a large circle so it touches

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.180 
here draw a large circle so it touches
the<00:01:00.120> halfway<00:01:00.420> line<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:02.690> half<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.110> rear<00:01:04.830> box

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
the halfway line and half the rear box

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.609 
the halfway line and half the rear box
like<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.330> rear<00:01:06.509> square<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> draw

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
like this the rear square and draw

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.460 
like this the rear square and draw
another<00:01:08.220> nike<00:01:09.119> lips<00:01:11.390> okay<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.810> we're<00:01:13.350> going

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
another nike lips okay now we're going

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.580 
another nike lips okay now we're going
to<00:01:13.560> put<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> kind<00:01:14.009> of<00:01:14.070> body<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:16.470> need

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
to put the kind of body in here we need

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.230 
to put the kind of body in here we need
to<00:01:16.680> cut<00:01:16.860> across<00:01:17.190> that<00:01:17.490> circle<00:01:17.970> as<00:01:18.060> I've

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
to cut across that circle as I've

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.620 
to cut across that circle as I've
started<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:20.399> just<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.390> about<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
started up and just think about the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.279 
started up and just think about the
front<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.080> I'm<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.549> to<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> roof<00:01:23.820> line

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
front here I'm go to the roof line

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.990 
front here I'm go to the roof line
approximately<00:01:25.289> I'm<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.399> drop<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.580> short

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
approximately I'm going to drop it short

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.059 
approximately I'm going to drop it short
of<00:01:27.179> the<00:01:27.300> top<00:01:27.539> so<00:01:29.240> windscreens<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:31.069> the

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
of the top so windscreens going in the

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.749 
of the top so windscreens going in the
waist<00:01:32.399> line<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:33.950> which<00:01:34.950> put<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.190> real<00:01:35.429> thing

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
waist line here which put the real thing

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.359 
waist line here which put the real thing
I<00:01:36.000> could<00:01:36.569> drop<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.929> down<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.380> wanted<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> make

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
I could drop this down if wanted to make

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.210 
I could drop this down if wanted to make
it<00:01:38.490> taller<00:01:38.810> just<00:01:39.810> right<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.039> back

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
it taller just right in at the back

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.559 
it taller just right in at the back
tighten<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> back<00:01:44.360> put<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> wheel

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
tighten in the back put the wheel

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.570 
tighten in the back put the wheel
thickness<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.229> tire<00:01:46.830> thickness<00:01:47.310> rather

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
thickness in the tire thickness rather

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.399 
thickness in the tire thickness rather
that<00:01:47.850> always<00:01:48.119> seems<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.539> make<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.020> drawing<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that always seems to make the drawing a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.660 
that always seems to make the drawing a
little<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.770> better<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.159> I'll<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.280> shared

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
little bit better so I'll just shared

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.969 
little bit better so I'll just shared
this<00:01:50.819> in<00:01:51.030> blunt<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.509> we'll<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.899> Lee<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.860> at

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
this in blunt and we'll put Lee what at

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.389 
this in blunt and we'll put Lee what at
the<00:01:53.069> front<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.459> you<00:01:53.549> can't<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:55.399> arch

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the front that you can't see the arch

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.149 
the front that you can't see the arch
like<00:01:56.789> this<00:01:56.970> little<00:01:57.149> filling<00:01:57.600> arch<00:01:59.630> OC<00:02:00.630> poor

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
like this little filling arch OC poor

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.780 
bring it down a bit it's looking like a
car<00:02:20.700> ship<00:02:21.060> now<00:02:21.799> that's<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:23.010> car<00:02:23.220> body<00:02:23.489> coming

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
car ship now that's the car body coming

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.020 
car ship now that's the car body coming
around<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.209> wheel<00:02:24.450> put<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.320> bit<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> grilling

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
around the wheel put a bit of a grilling

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.970 
around the wheel put a bit of a grilling
yeah<00:02:27.030> kind<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:27.989> consider<00:02:28.380> perhaps<00:02:28.500> looking<00:02:28.769> at

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
yeah kind of consider perhaps looking at

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.170 
yeah kind of consider perhaps looking at
the<00:02:29.070> wheel<00:02:29.280> details<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.750> sec<00:02:31.049> yeah<00:02:31.079> we<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.709> so

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
the wheel details in a sec yeah we go so

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.180 
the wheel details in a sec yeah we go so
it<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.329> put<00:02:33.450> some<00:02:33.570> little<00:02:33.720> black<00:02:34.350> circles<00:02:34.980> in

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
it just put some little black circles in

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.870 
it just put some little black circles in
make<00:02:36.150> these<00:02:36.420> look<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:37.310> holes<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.549> an<00:02:38.670> alloy

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
make these look like holes in an alloy

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.330 
make these look like holes in an alloy
wheel<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:42.030> here<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.540> go<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.590> wheels<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.950> bit<00:02:44.100> big

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
wheel so here we go the wheels a bit big

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.300 
wheel so here we go the wheels a bit big
but<00:02:45.049> you<00:02:46.049> can<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.680> mess<00:02:46.829> about<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:47.130> a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
but you can you can mess about with a

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.220 
but you can you can mess about with a
grid<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:47.609> little<00:02:47.880> bit<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.150> get<00:02:48.269> make<00:02:48.510> more<00:02:48.780> in

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
grid a little bit to get make more in

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.360 
grid a little bit to get make more in
proportion<00:02:51.200> yeah<00:02:52.200> okay<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.920> looks<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
proportion yeah okay it looks like the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.309 
proportion yeah okay it looks like the
wheel<00:02:53.519> is<00:02:53.940> turning<00:02:54.720> into<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.200> corner<00:02:57.079> put<00:02:58.079> some

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
wheel is turning into a corner put some

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.130 
wheel is turning into a corner put some
reflection<00:02:58.950> reflection<00:02:59.850> thin<00:03:00.390> lines<00:03:00.630> on<00:03:00.900> here

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
reflection reflection thin lines on here

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.379 
reflection reflection thin lines on here
like<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.709> indicate<00:03:02.130> it's<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.970> shiny<00:03:03.209> metal

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
like this to indicate it's a shiny metal

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.599 
like this to indicate it's a shiny metal
surface<00:03:03.900> them<00:03:04.139> at<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.350> back<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.859> some<00:03:05.430> more

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
surface them at the back so some more

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:06.890 
surface them at the back so some more
holes

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
holes

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:17.470 
holes
and<00:03:08.150> just<00:03:09.150> work<00:03:09.689> on<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.079> little<00:03:10.200> bit

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.510 

yeah<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.290> put<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.590> more<00:03:19.710> waste<00:03:20.010> d<00:03:20.460> to

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
yeah and I just put it more waste d to

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.620 
yeah and I just put it more waste d to
waste<00:03:20.910> line<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.660> consider<00:03:22.620> possibly

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
waste line on the consider possibly

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.970 
waste line on the consider possibly
where<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.690> window<00:03:24.990> is<00:03:25.020> going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.410> finish<00:03:25.770> just

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
where the window is going to finish just

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.530 
where the window is going to finish just
get<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> rough<00:03:26.610> idea<00:03:26.760> fill<00:03:27.300> that<00:03:27.480> in<00:03:29.270> got<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.360> B

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
get a rough idea fill that in got the B

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.300 
get a rough idea fill that in got the B
column<00:03:30.840> drawn<00:03:31.350> in<00:03:31.560> roughly<00:03:31.860> there<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:32.250> i

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
column drawn in roughly there but i

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.970 
column drawn in roughly there but i
think<00:03:32.490> i'm<00:03:32.550> going<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.730> go<00:03:32.880> over<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.480> beak<00:03:33.690> on

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
think i'm going to go over the beak on

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.470 
think i'm going to go over the beak on
lots<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.130> cars<00:03:35.400> now<00:03:35.700> have<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:36.060> B<00:03:36.210> column

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
lots of cars now have that B column

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.880 
lots of cars now have that B column
black<00:03:36.870> teen<00:03:37.170> yeah<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.280> let's<00:03:38.460> go<00:03:38.610> over<00:03:38.640> that

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
black teen yeah so let's go over that

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.710 
black teen yeah so let's go over that
yeah<00:03:40.890> okay<00:03:41.250> it's<00:03:41.700> not<00:03:41.820> far<00:03:42.090> off<00:03:42.150> that's<00:03:42.450> about

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
yeah okay it's not far off that's about

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.190 
yeah okay it's not far off that's about
it<00:03:42.750> really<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.270> spend<00:03:45.510> more<00:03:45.570> time<00:03:45.960> on<00:03:46.020> it

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
it really you can spend more time on it

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.340 
it really you can spend more time on it
if<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:46.650> coloring<00:03:47.580> your<00:03:47.700> team<00:03:48.140> which<00:03:49.140> I'm

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
if you like coloring your team which I'm

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.980 
if you like coloring your team which I'm
fat<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.590> think<00:03:49.860> we'll<00:03:49.980> do<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.550> minute<00:03:50.990> it's

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
fat I think we'll do it in a minute it's

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.990 
fat I think we'll do it in a minute it's
always<00:03:52.200> important<00:03:53.160> as<00:03:53.250> well<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.610> make<00:03:53.760> sure

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
always important as well to make sure

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.570 
always important as well to make sure
you<00:03:54.090> draw<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.360> car<00:03:54.630> low<00:03:54.990> enough<00:03:55.490> lots<00:03:56.490> of

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
you draw the car low enough lots of

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.510 
you draw the car low enough lots of
people<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.420> bottom<00:03:58.020> of<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.230> car<00:03:58.520> almost

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
people have the bottom of the car almost

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.150 
people have the bottom of the car almost
on<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.240> center<00:04:01.080> line<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.440> wheels<00:04:01.709> well<00:04:02.040> if

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
on the center line of the wheels well if

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.790 
on the center line of the wheels well if
you<00:04:02.220> look<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.459> cars<00:04:03.080> you<00:04:04.080> know<00:04:04.170> you're<00:04:04.680> very

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
you look at cars you know you're very

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.699 
you look at cars you know you're very
very<00:04:05.700> rarely<00:04:05.940> see<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.180> high<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.720> car<00:04:07.410> which<00:04:07.590> is

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
very rarely see a high a car which is

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.810 
very rarely see a high a car which is
high<00:04:07.890> off<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.130> ground<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.490> I'll<00:04:08.640> draw<00:04:08.790> it

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
high off the ground so I'll draw it

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.720 
high off the ground so I'll draw it
quite<00:04:09.120> low<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.600> ground<00:04:10.190> yeah<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.550> looks

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
quite low to the ground yeah that looks

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.080 
quite low to the ground yeah that looks
ok<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.660> think<00:04:13.130> that's<00:04:14.130> about<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.490> so<00:04:14.910> let's

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
ok so I think that's about it so let's

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.740 
ok so I think that's about it so let's
just<00:04:15.300> go<00:04:15.390> put<00:04:15.570> some<00:04:15.720> color<00:04:15.900> on<00:04:17.570> alright<00:04:18.570> so

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
just go put some color on alright so

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.900 
just go put some color on alright so
here's<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.109> car<00:04:19.320> just<00:04:19.620> brought<00:04:19.829> it<00:04:20.040> inside<00:04:20.609> so

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
here's the car just brought it inside so

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.900 
here's the car just brought it inside so
just<00:04:21.450> put<00:04:21.959> some<00:04:22.080> color<00:04:22.230> on<00:04:22.640> and<00:04:23.640> just<00:04:23.760> get

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910
