 war of the industrial age were of course 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.540
 wars and before that but the importance of technology 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:37.050
 technology and mass production back in 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.329
 previous wars not manifested as 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.920

 Germany Austria-Hungary France and Russia 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.199
 grew an average of 80 percent 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.660
 German military defense 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.539
 industry has been involved 115 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.870
 thousand people achievement of science and technology 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.339
 put into service the coming war in 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.900
 Received the first 40 Maxim machine guns

 invented produced in us through 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.619
 three years and began to produce in Tula 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.720
 weapons factory shooting of them can 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.520
 It was to lead until they ran out 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.710
 ammunition during the first world war 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.900
 machine gun reliability has become a legend and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.930
 Germans eagerly used trophy 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.189
 samples fall off were military machine gun 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.320
 experts say more war not 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.150
 maybe but muscle want machine was 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.790
 invented in 905 , the Russian army was already 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.470
 automatic here is not very much persecuted Fedorov 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.850
 and good 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.619
 special then mind to the fourteenth 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.930
 year Germany brought the number of its 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.670
 land army up to more than 800 thousand 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.409
 man in response to the government of france 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.329
 which was difficult to compete with 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.640
 the Germans in the army increased 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.500
 service life from 2 to 3 years and lowered 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.540
 draft age up to 20 years 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.530
 the French army immediately increased by 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.970
 50 percent 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.820
 English fleet to the beginning of the war 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.110
 numbered 11 cruising squadrons and 8 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.540
 battleships squadron 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.280
 but the Germans are swiftly drug 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.320
 had their naval forces on 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.660
 construction of new battleships and submarines 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.330
 boats the germans spent sim and a half 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.510
 billion marks first submarine 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.640
 Germany appeared in 1906 later than 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.640
 even in turkey and portugal and to top 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.460
 wars in possession of the 2nd Reich there were only 39 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.560
 submarine vs 98 for the British but in the fall 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.350
 14 years from the German stocks the first came 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.680
 submarine you 35 she set 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.710
 sad record sank during the war 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.690
 236 ships in the fourteenth year for 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.150
 full deft main problem is that 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.790
 questions alone do not drown without 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.290
 impact of the enemy and such cases 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.440
 quite a lot of things we just 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.910
 technical excellence well here it is 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.420
 cascade of forces of the fleet is also in the seventeenth 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.780
 year Germany who lost faith 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.950
 the ability of their armies to solve the problem 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.530
 land theaters she made the main 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.420
 submarine war 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.340
 prompted the development of new 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.260
 types of weapons in the arena of combat 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.970
 action aircraft that are now out 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.250
 began to apply not only for intelligence 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.750
 but also for the first bombardment 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.000
 tanks that only their appearance 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.010
 terrified the enemy but the main thing 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.530
 began to use weapons of mass 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.940
 defeat the first to use gas began 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.380
 the French but tear grenades 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.720
 gas they quickly ended April 22 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.230
 1915 about the river ept the German army 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.940
 sprayed 168 tons of chlorine hit 15 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.980
 thousand french soldiers of whom 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.959
 a third died immediately afterwards 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.360
 replaced by more toxic phosgene a 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.239
 later and moreover this war was for the first time 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.239
 the war of anonymous murders here for example on 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.380
 12 years to bardin the Russian hussars with 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.680
 french chopped 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.940
 they say who will kill someone's eyes or 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.530
 any Crimean war in which 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.310
 the lion is fat at the hour where you lost 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.170
 but bravely fought bayonet yes 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.850
 now sit for a few meters each 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.130
 friend and shoot but nobody sees anyone 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.010
 this is the epoch of mass anonymous murder 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.660
 steve warring countries produced 28 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.989
 million rifles one million 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.450
 machine guns of 150,000 cannons and over 9 thousand 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.200
 tanks total costs entente and

 triple 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.670

 8 million us after the war 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.569
 process started in most countries 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.100
 demilitarization that is gradual 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.200
 transition to a peaceful economy 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.970
 most state committees 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.829
 created to control industrial

 Versailles Peace Treaty German 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.889
 the army was becoming symbolic 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.960
 the navy took the winners 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.760
 she numbered the German army
