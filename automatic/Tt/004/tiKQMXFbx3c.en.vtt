00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
we wrote a response to the paper I'm

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.580 
we wrote a response to the paper I'm
from<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> Islamic<00:00:21.180> education<00:00:21.300> at<00:00:21.869> Academy

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
from the Islamic education at Academy

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.500 
from the Islamic education at Academy
and<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.820> may<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.029> been<00:00:24.300> responsible

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
and I think we may have been responsible

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.439 
and I think we may have been responsible
for<00:00:25.310> basically<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> big<00:00:26.670> action<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.269> I

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
for basically the big action and that I

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.910 
for basically the big action and that I
got<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:27.779> these<00:00:27.900> Muslims<00:00:28.320> together<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
got all these Muslims together and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.820 
got all these Muslims together and
non-muslims<00:00:29.519> TVC<00:00:29.880> complain<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:31.140> about<00:00:31.410> that

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
non-muslims TVC complain not about that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
issue which he refused and this is

four<00:01:51.180> were<00:01:51.450> wrong<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.220> not<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.430> topic

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
four were wrong to have not the topic

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.539 
four were wrong to have not the topic
but<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> way<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:55.200> express<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.920> program<00:01:56.340> was

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
but the way they express the program was

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.179 
but the way they express the program was
what<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.630> skewed<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.469> reason<00:01:58.799> being<00:01:58.950> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
what was skewed the reason being is

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.010 
what was skewed the reason being is
because<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.759> anyone<00:02:00.149> does<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> limited<00:02:00.780> study

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
because if anyone does a limited study

there<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.640> wider<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.750> scope<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.350> actually<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
there is wider in scope and actually the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.010 
there is wider in scope and actually the
traditional<00:02:08.640> Islamic<00:02:09.000> discourse<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> far

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
traditional Islamic discourse is a far

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.770 
traditional Islamic discourse is a far
more<00:02:10.430> academic<00:02:11.430> robust<00:02:11.819> discourse<00:02:12.450> which

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
more academic robust discourse which

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.640 
more academic robust discourse which
wasn't<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
wasn't a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.589 
wasn't a
valid<00:02:14.040> point<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.760> example<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.239> had<00:02:15.360> for

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
valid point so example you had for

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.410 
valid point so example you had for

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
Tricia Cohen who is a well-known d

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.300 
Tricia Cohen who is a well-known d
mythologized<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.409> you<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.829> and<00:02:20.129> she

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
mythologized that you like and she

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.220 
mythologized that you like and she
basically<00:02:20.489> was<00:02:20.970> saying<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:22.049> the

overall intellectual tradition in the
Islamic<00:02:24.599> matters<00:02:25.140> people<00:02:26.010> remember<00:02:26.159> what

Islamic matters people remember what

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.160 
Islamic matters people remember what
they<00:02:26.760> want<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.120> remember<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.870> really

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
they want to remember but it really

Western<00:02:39.299> so<00:02:39.510> example<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:39.989> have<00:02:40.019> professor

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
Western so example you have professor

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.009 
Western so example you have professor
Keith<00:02:40.859> let<00:02:41.519> her<00:02:41.700> who<00:02:41.909> talks<00:02:42.180> about<00:02:42.299> authentic

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
Keith let her who talks about authentic

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.470 
Keith let her who talks about authentic
testimony<00:02:43.709> as<00:02:43.950> such<00:02:44.489> as<00:02:44.609> actually<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.329> is

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
testimony as such as actually of that is

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.750 
testimony as such as actually of that is
social<00:02:45.900> mother<00:02:46.109> thing<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.739> if<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.159> even<00:02:47.639> if

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
social mother thing is so if you even if

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.099 
social mother thing is so if you even if
you<00:02:47.879> have<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> hang<00:02:48.209> on<00:02:48.389> even<00:02:48.659> if<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.840> didn't

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
you have to hang on even if you didn't

you have to hang on even if you didn't
like<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.440> program<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.700> got<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.389> right

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
like this program you have got the right

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.180 
like this program you have got the right
to<00:02:51.840> maybe<00:02:51.989> go<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> channel<00:02:52.590> 4<00:02:52.859> or<00:02:53.010> another

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
to maybe go to channel 4 or another

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.740 
to maybe go to channel 4 or another
broadcast<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.879> say<00:02:54.030> we'd<00:02:54.209> like<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.540> make<00:02:54.720> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
broadcast I say we'd like to make a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.539 
broadcast I say we'd like to make a
program<00:02:55.019> slightly<00:02:55.950> different<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.459> this

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
program slightly different to this

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.679 
program slightly different to this
everybody<00:02:56.970> has<00:02:57.209> an<00:02:57.750> interpretation<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:59.099> what

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689

history<00:03:00.689> is<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:01.340> agree<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.579> agree<00:03:02.639> but<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.870> think

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
history is I agree I agree but I think

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.050 
history is I agree I agree but I think
it's<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.650> responsibility<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.459> any<00:03:05.700> media

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060
