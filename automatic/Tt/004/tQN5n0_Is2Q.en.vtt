below<00:01:09.580> so<00:01:10.580> let's<00:01:11.000> get<00:01:11.149> right<00:01:11.360> into<00:01:11.420> thread

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
below so let's get right into thread

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.560 
below so let's get right into thread
Center<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.159> you<00:01:13.550> will<00:01:13.700> first<00:01:13.970> need<00:01:14.119> a

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
Center so you will first need a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.219 
Center so you will first need a
scoreboard<00:01:15.020> objective<00:01:15.530> of<00:01:16.490> stat<00:01:17.119> walk<00:01:17.899> one

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
scoreboard objective of stat walk one

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.370 
scoreboard objective of stat walk one
centimeter<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.270> then<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.690> will<00:01:20.840> create<00:01:21.110> this

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
centimeter and then you will create this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.219 
centimeter and then you will create this
really<00:01:21.740> quick<00:01:21.979> redstone<00:01:22.550> clock<00:01:22.929> which<00:01:23.929> goes

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
really quick redstone clock which goes

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.810 
really quick redstone clock which goes
into<00:01:24.619> these<00:01:24.860> two<00:01:25.009> command<00:01:25.340> blocks

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
into these two command blocks

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.820 
into these two command blocks
this<00:01:26.210> one<00:01:26.479> has<00:01:26.660> a<00:01:26.960> 1/2<00:01:27.289> delay<00:01:27.590> with<00:01:27.800> the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
this one has a 1/2 delay with the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.639 
this one has a 1/2 delay with the
repeater<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:28.460> one<00:01:28.580> has<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.729> 2<00:01:28.940> typically

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
repeater and this one has a 2 typically

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.350 
repeater and this one has a 2 typically
this<00:01:30.649> will<00:01:30.890> then<00:01:31.280> set<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.729> score<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.149> any

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
this will then set the score of any

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.810 
this will then set the score of any
player<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.810> has<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.440> walk<00:01:33.770> minimum<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.399> 1<00:01:34.610> so

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
player that has a walk minimum of 1 so

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.430 
player that has a walk minimum of 1 so
if<00:01:34.940> they've<00:01:35.119> walked<00:01:35.360> 1<00:01:35.600> centimeter<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:36.289> will

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
if they've walked 1 centimeter it will

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.730 
if they've walked 1 centimeter it will
replace<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:37.039> back<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.520> 0<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.530> same<00:01:39.530> with<00:01:39.649> the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
replace it back to 0 and same with the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.260 
replace it back to 0 and same with the
other<00:01:39.770> one

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
other one

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.550 
other one
next<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.509> have<00:01:41.539> this<00:01:41.960> one<00:01:42.200> command<00:01:42.500> block

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
next you have this one command block

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.760 
next you have this one command block
over<00:01:42.979> here<00:01:43.149> which<00:01:44.149> executes<00:01:44.810> ad<00:01:44.960> player<00:01:45.350> that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
over here which executes ad player that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.090 
over here which executes ad player that
has<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.310> score<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:47.030> walk<00:01:47.300> minimum<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:48.140> 26<00:01:48.890> and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
has the score of walk minimum of 26 and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.380 
has the score of walk minimum of 26 and
meters<00:01:49.429> and<00:01:49.670> then<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:51.020> will<00:01:51.380> test<00:01:51.770> for<00:01:51.890> a<00:01:51.950> block

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
meters and then it will test for a block

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.990 
meters and then it will test for a block
negative<00:01:53.390> 1<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:53.990> why<00:01:54.579> negative<00:01:55.579> 1<00:01:55.729> which<00:01:55.909> will

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
negative 1 so why negative 1 which will

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.539 
negative 1 so why negative 1 which will
be<00:01:56.060> underneath<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.689> for<00:01:57.350> Planck's<00:01:57.799> one<00:01:58.070> which

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
be underneath you for Planck's one which

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.020 
be underneath you for Planck's one which
is<00:01:58.790> Bruce<00:01:59.689> blanks<00:02:00.079> if<00:02:00.829> that<00:02:01.070> test<00:02:01.280> for<00:02:01.369> true<00:02:01.759> it

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
is Bruce blanks if that test for true it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.030 
is Bruce blanks if that test for true it
will<00:02:02.659> then<00:02:02.840> play<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.229> sound<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.799> random

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
will then play the sound of a random

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.270 
will then play the sound of a random
chess<00:02:04.250> opening<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.020> then<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.259> will<00:02:06.469> also<00:02:06.740> go

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
chess opening and then it will also go

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.580 
chess opening and then it will also go
ahead<00:02:07.579> and<00:02:07.909> give<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.660> particle<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.290> smoke

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
ahead and give you the particle of smoke

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.380 
ahead and give you the particle of smoke
you<00:02:10.369> don't<00:02:10.549> just<00:02:10.670> need<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.180> plates

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
you don't just need to have the plates

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.640 
you don't just need to have the plates
on<00:02:11.540> though<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.870> could<00:02:12.019> also<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.410> some

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
on though you could also have some

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.699 
on though you could also have some
command<00:02:12.980> block<00:02:13.220> set<00:02:13.519> up<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:14.390> will<00:02:14.870> make<00:02:15.350> some

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
command block set up that will make some

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.410 
command block set up that will make some
funk<00:02:15.950> sand<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.549> needs<00:02:16.730> come<00:02:16.910> down<00:02:17.120> when

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
funk sand and it needs come down when

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.789 
funk sand and it needs come down when
you<00:02:17.510> run<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.780> on<00:02:17.840> top<00:02:18.049> of<00:02:18.230> them<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.650> looks

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
you run it on top of them so it looks

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.590 
you run it on top of them so it looks
like<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.370> broke<00:02:19.670> off<00:02:19.910> or<00:02:20.209> something<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:20.510> that

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
like it broke off or something like that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.960 
like it broke off or something like that
so<00:02:21.500> there<00:02:21.769> are<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> lot<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.160> other<00:02:22.430> ideas<00:02:22.640> that

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
so there are a lot of other ideas that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.930 
so there are a lot of other ideas that
could<00:02:23.299> put<00:02:23.540> on<00:02:23.630> top<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.260> one<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:25.640> is

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
could put on top of this one that is

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.000 
could put on top of this one that is
pretty<00:02:26.269> much<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.049> if<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.230> guys<00:02:27.380> enjoyed

that I have done I've been trying to
condense<00:02:34.190> them<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> little<00:02:34.609> bit<00:02:34.700> more<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.060> make
