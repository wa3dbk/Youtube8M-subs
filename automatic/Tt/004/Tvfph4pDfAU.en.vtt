00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
melee spin which is kind of like a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830

whirlwind but it's a not as strong

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.370 
whirlwind but it's a not as strong
because<00:01:10.470> he's<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> Scout<00:01:11.130> obviously<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
because he's the Scout obviously so you

can use that close range and it does

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.820 
can use that close range and it does
deal<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:15.509> good<00:01:15.900> amount<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.200> damage<00:01:16.350> better

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
deal with good amount of damage better

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.359 
deal with good amount of damage better
if<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> hit<00:01:17.189> him<00:01:17.280> from<00:01:17.369> behind<00:01:19.040> he<00:01:20.040> has

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
if you hit him from behind he has

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.490 
if you hit him from behind he has
different<00:01:21.210> abilities<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.080> use<00:01:22.229> for

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
different abilities that you can use for

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.140 
different abilities that you can use for
a<00:01:22.560> secondary<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.430> using<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> dash<00:01:23.970> in

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
a secondary one I'm using the dash in

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
a secondary one I'm using the dash in
this<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.540> that's<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.750> basically<00:01:25.400> makes

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
this one and that's just basically makes

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.510 
this one and that's just basically makes
you<00:01:26.520> zoom<00:01:27.000> forward<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.220> marked

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you zoom forward and then a marked

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.640 
you zoom forward and then a marked
target<00:01:29.700> which<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.439> if

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
target which I actually really like if

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.550 
target which I actually really like if
you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.950> mark<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.759> enemy<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.350> everybody<00:01:34.350> can

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
you can mark the enemy out everybody can

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.880 
you can mark the enemy out everybody can
see<00:01:34.829> where<00:01:35.820> they<00:01:35.970> are<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:37.020> weakens<00:01:37.200> their

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
see where they are and it weakens their

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.740 
see where they are and it weakens their
armor<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.119> there's<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> orbital

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
armor and then there's the orbital

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.609 
armor and then there's the orbital
beacon<00:01:40.049> which<00:01:40.670> shows<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.909> location<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.619> enemy

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
beacon which shows the location of enemy

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.859 
beacon which shows the location of enemy
on<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> battlefield<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.790> don't<00:01:45.630> really

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
on the battlefield I don't really

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.030 
on the battlefield I don't really
recommend<00:01:46.049> using<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.740> too<00:01:46.890> much

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
recommend using that one too much

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.859 
recommend using that one too much
because<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> three<00:01:48.390> kill<00:01:48.600> streak

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
because if you go on a three kill streak

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
because if you go on a three kill streak
you're<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.220> anyways<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you're going to have that anyways and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.179 
you're going to have that anyways and
your<00:01:51.450> other<00:01:51.600> teammates<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.500> access<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
your other teammates have access to it

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.649 
your other teammates have access to it
with<00:01:53.340> retail<00:01:53.790> streets<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.180> well<00:01:55.790> for<00:01:56.790> his

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
with retail streets as well for his
