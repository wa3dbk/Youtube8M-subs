that so Simon the SUV segment is growing
but<00:00:38.219> much<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.730> place<00:00:39.000> has<00:00:39.270> been<00:00:39.420> lived<00:00:39.660> by

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
but much of that place has been lived by

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.959 
but much of that place has been lived by
Auto<00:00:40.079> Diesel's<00:00:40.680> near<00:00:40.860> Heather's<00:00:41.250> abdicating

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
Auto Diesel's near Heather's abdicating

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.600 
Auto Diesel's near Heather's abdicating
to<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> CVT<00:00:42.510> petrol<00:00:43.050> make<00:00:43.230> seems<00:00:43.530> yeah<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> mean

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
to a CVT petrol make seems yeah I mean

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.569 
to a CVT petrol make seems yeah I mean
obviously<00:00:44.730> Richard<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.989> case<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.579> 4008

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
obviously Richard in this case with 4008

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.130 
obviously Richard in this case with 4008
we<00:00:47.760> didn't<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> option<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
we didn't actually have the option of a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.740 
we didn't actually have the option of a
diesel<00:00:49.649> auto<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.850> did<00:00:51.000> consider<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.449> diesel

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
diesel auto and we did consider a diesel

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
diesel auto and we did consider a diesel
manual<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> think<00:00:52.980> largely<00:00:53.370> when<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.820> car

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
manual but I think largely when this car

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.639 
manual but I think largely when this car
is<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.570> used<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> metro<00:00:55.260> markets

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
is going to be used in the metro markets

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.500 
is going to be used in the metro markets
it's<00:00:55.800> probably<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> work<00:00:56.430> beast<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it's probably going to work beast in a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.349 
it's probably going to work beast in a
petrol<00:00:57.840> format<00:00:58.340> obviously<00:00:59.340> compact<00:00:59.699> SUV<00:01:00.180> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
petrol format obviously compact SUV is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.319 
petrol format obviously compact SUV is
the<00:01:00.539> largest<00:01:00.809> cygwin<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> marketplace

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's the color in size that everyone is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's the color in size that everyone is
trending<00:01:05.670> towards<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.780> had<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.080> in

to go out of production towards in this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
to go out of production towards in this
calendar<00:01:42.420> year<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.250> solve<00:01:44.490> what

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
calendar year and I think we solve what

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.020 
calendar year and I think we solve what
about<00:01:44.850> 87<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> first<00:01:45.780> year<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.439> 2010<00:01:47.340> 70

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
about 87 in the first year and 2010 70

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330 
about 87 in the first year and 2010 70
following<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.140> things<00:01:50.009> been<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> little

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
following that and things been a little

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.740 
following that and things been a little
bit<00:01:50.490> tough<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.880> year's<00:01:51.119> we're<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.630> but

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
bit tough this year's we're going on but

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.700 
bit tough this year's we're going on but
obviously<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> car<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> be

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
obviously the car is going to be

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.740 
obviously the car is going to be
replaced<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> run-out<00:01:53.729> face<00:01:54.060> so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
replaced and it's in a run-out face so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.999 
replaced and it's in a run-out face so
we're<00:01:54.899> looking<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.140> realigning<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> pricing

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
we're looking at realigning the pricing

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.090 
we're looking at realigning the pricing
as<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.790> speak<00:01:57.000> well<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.290> what<00:01:58.680> does<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.890> mean

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
as we speak well so what does that mean

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.709 
as we speak well so what does that mean
does<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.340> mean<00:01:59.640> as<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.969> significant<00:02:00.509> price

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
does that mean as a significant price

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.830 
does that mean as a significant price
change<00:02:01.670> 55,000<00:02:02.670> oh<00:02:02.729> yeah<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.390> think<00:02:03.509> at<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
change 55,000 oh yeah I think at this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.149 
change 55,000 oh yeah I think at this
point<00:02:03.930> we're<00:02:04.200> looking<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> realign<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.950> price

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
point we're looking to realign the price

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.590 
point we're looking to realign the price
point<00:02:05.399> by<00:02:05.490> about<00:02:05.670> five<00:02:05.880> thousand<00:02:06.240> dollars<00:02:06.479> on

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
point by about five thousand dollars on

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.389 
point by about five thousand dollars on
and<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.409> car<00:02:07.619> will<00:02:07.740> eventually<00:02:08.099> going<00:02:08.250> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and that car will eventually going to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.800 
and that car will eventually going to
run<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.119> interesting<00:02:09.450> thing<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.780> that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
run out the interesting thing is that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.930 
run out the interesting thing is that
obviously<00:02:10.200> 4008<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.039> seen<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> logical

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
obviously 4008 is seen as a logical

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.280 
obviously 4008 is seen as a logical
replacement<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.569> four<00:02:12.690> thousand<00:02:12.989> seven

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
replacement for four thousand seven

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.709 
replacement for four thousand seven
we're<00:02:13.709> an<00:02:13.799> actual<00:02:14.010> fact<00:02:14.219> it<00:02:14.340> isn't<00:02:14.489> okay<00:02:15.360> it's

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
we're an actual fact it isn't okay it's

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:16.819 
we're an actual fact it isn't okay it's
a<00:02:15.780> different<00:02:16.049> car<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.439> different<00:02:16.709> market

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
a different car to a different market

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.490 
a different car to a different market
place<00:02:17.129> so<00:02:17.370> um<00:02:17.670> okay<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.049> imagine<00:02:19.140> then

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
place so um okay do you imagine then

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.110 
place so um okay do you imagine then
that<00:02:19.530> many<00:02:19.859> for<00:02:20.099> thousands<00:02:20.579> having<00:02:20.790> customers

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that many for thousands having customers

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.209 
that many for thousands having customers
will<00:02:21.390> switch<00:02:21.599> across<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.260> car<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.799> look

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
will switch across to this car I look

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.800 
will switch across to this car I look
I'm<00:02:23.340> sure<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.549> number<00:02:23.909> of<00:02:23.969> them<00:02:24.060> are<00:02:24.269> already

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
I'm sure a number of them are already

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.809 
I'm sure a number of them are already
considering<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.680> given<00:02:26.310> those<00:02:26.400> numbers<00:02:26.730> I

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
considering it given those numbers I

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.949 
considering it given those numbers I
talked<00:02:27.000> about<00:02:27.150> before<00:02:27.299> with<00:02:27.599> who's<00:02:27.750> actually

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
talked about before with who's actually

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.080 
talked about before with who's actually
got<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> four<00:02:28.769> thousand<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.189> seven<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:29.609> we

got a four thousand and seven but we

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.550 
got a four thousand and seven but we
actually<00:02:30.180> see<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.569> larger<00:02:30.989> number<00:02:31.109> of<00:02:31.260> people

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
actually see a larger number of people

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
success story for us so we think we

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.720 
success story for us so we think we
should<00:02:51.750> sell<00:02:51.900> around<00:02:52.280> about<00:02:53.280> three<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.639> four

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
should sell around about three to four

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.210 
should sell around about three to four
hundred<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:54.090> year<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:55.109> we're<00:02:55.769> looking<00:02:55.950> forward

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
hundred a year so we're looking forward

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.500 
hundred a year so we're looking forward
to<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.579> big<00:02:56.700> count<00:02:56.970> there's<00:02:57.389> a<00:02:57.480> lot

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
to the big count there's a lot

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.420 
to the big count there's a lot
percentage<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:58.200> your<00:02:58.349> total<00:02:58.439> volume<00:02:59.010> as<00:02:59.129> Italy

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
percentage of your total volume as Italy

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.550 
percentage of your total volume as Italy
probably<00:03:00.269> about<00:03:00.510> thirty<00:03:00.900> thirty<00:03:01.470> five

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
probably about thirty thirty five

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.649 
probably about thirty thirty five
percent<00:03:01.739> at<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.609> moment<00:03:02.909> so<00:03:03.060> obviously<00:03:03.480> when

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
percent at the moment so obviously when

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:04.729 
percent at the moment so obviously when
launching<00:03:03.989> towards<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.409> middle<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.650> this

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
launching towards the middle of this

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.990 
launching towards the middle of this
year<00:03:04.919> we<00:03:05.069> wanted<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.340> get<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.579> count<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:05.849> soon

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
year we wanted to get this count as soon

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.640 
year we wanted to get this count as soon
as<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.180> could<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.569> we<00:03:06.629> are<00:03:07.169> one<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.409> the<00:03:07.470> first

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
as we could and we are one of the first
