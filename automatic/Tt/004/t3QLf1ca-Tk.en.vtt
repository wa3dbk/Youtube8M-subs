00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.660

 the career of le mans or I would love 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.459
 to be able to see all those incredible fireballs 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.959
 on the track it would be sensational brains but 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.780
 only five students will be the 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.830
 fortunate that they will be able to go everything will be 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.600
 delivered to luck 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.459

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.010

 put each name on a piece of paper 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.210
 The first 5 drawn will be the
