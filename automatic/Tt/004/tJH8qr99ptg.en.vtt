00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
speed helmet next to see to beat which

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.760 
speed helmet next to see to beat which
stands<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> two<00:00:29.910> bars<00:00:30.289> right<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:33.770> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
stands for the two bars right here that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.940 
stands for the two bars right here that
we<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.910> D<00:00:36.660> stands<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.350> double<00:00:37.620> which

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
we have the D stands for a double which

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.850 
we have the D stands for a double which
is<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> double<00:00:39.149> bars<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.960> top<00:00:40.230> which<00:00:40.590> most

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
is the double bars on the top which most

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.440 
is the double bars on the top which most
of<00:00:40.980> them<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.219> now<00:00:42.020> then<00:00:43.020> C<00:00:43.829> or<00:00:44.730> closed<00:00:45.180> eye

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
of them have now then C or closed eye

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.670 
of them have now then C or closed eye
which<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.200> pretty<00:00:46.440> narrow

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
which is because it's pretty narrow

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.430 
which is because it's pretty narrow
right<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.420> same<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.539> something<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
right here same as something like that a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.100 
right here same as something like that a
closed<00:00:49.710> eye<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.879> more<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> linebacker

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
closed eye so it's more of a linebacker

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
closed eye so it's more of a linebacker
a<00:00:52.800> fullback<00:00:53.460> lime<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.879> kind<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> face<00:00:54.270> mask

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
a fullback lime and kind of face mask

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.260 
a fullback lime and kind of face mask
and<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.980> TX<00:00:56.340> which<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> code

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and then we have TX which is the code

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
and then we have TX which is the code
for<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.899> brand<00:00:58.170> new<00:00:58.260> face<00:00:58.469> mask<00:00:58.739> my<00:00:59.309> big

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
for this brand new face mask my big

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.959 
for this brand new face mask my big
grill<00:00:59.760> had<00:00:59.969> HT<00:01:00.539> instead<00:01:01.129> this<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.550> here

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
grill had HT instead this one right here

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.320 
grill had HT instead this one right here
is<00:01:03.920> eg<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.489> I'm<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.820> quite<00:01:05.970> sure<00:01:06.060> what<00:01:06.270> all

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is eg so I'm not quite sure what all

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.630 
is eg so I'm not quite sure what all
those<00:01:06.450> stand<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
those stand for but that's just the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
those stand for but that's just the
covert<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.150> lastest<00:01:09.659> LW<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.350> stands<00:01:10.590> for

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
covert and lastest LW that stands for

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
covert and lastest LW that stands for
light<00:01:10.979> weight<00:01:11.189> reason<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.479> light

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
light weight reason this is a light

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.300 
light weight reason this is a light
weight<00:01:12.720> face<00:01:13.049> mask<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.619> because<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
weight face mask is because with the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.130 
weight face mask is because with the
amount<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.580> butters<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.869> cannot

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
amount of butters on this you cannot

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.830 
amount of butters on this you cannot
have<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.740> full<00:01:17.060> steel<00:01:18.060> face<00:01:18.270> mask<00:01:18.570> gross

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
have it be a full steel face mask gross

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.600 
have it be a full steel face mask gross
and<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.290> too<00:01:19.439> heavy<00:01:19.619> since<00:01:20.040> my<00:01:20.220> big<00:01:20.400> girl

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
and just be too heavy since my big girl

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.570 
and just be too heavy since my big girl
so<00:01:21.140> they<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.470> Hall<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.770> Steel<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.340> does

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
so they it is Hall of Steel which does

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.730 
so they it is Hall of Steel which does
make<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> little<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.090> dangerous<00:01:24.290> but<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> do

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
make a little more dangerous but I do

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.380 
make a little more dangerous but I do
have<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.070> video<00:01:26.430> coming<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> couple<00:01:27.030> weeks

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390

on that one after this one about the
pros<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.340> cons<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> light<00:01:30.150> weight<00:01:30.360> versus<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
pros and cons of a light weight versus a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.660 
pros and cons of a light weight versus a
solid<00:01:31.829> steel<00:01:31.950> face<00:01:32.189> mask

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670

her evil eye brows us whatever they're
called<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.899> specifically

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
called that go here that is specifically

called that go here that is specifically
on<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> light<00:01:52.829> weight<00:01:53.040> face<00:01:53.280> mask<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.390> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
on the light weight face mask it's this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.060 
on the light weight face mask it's this
one<00:01:54.689> which<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.960> salt<00:01:55.140> steel<00:01:55.409> does<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.890> have

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
one which is salt steel does not have

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
one which is salt steel does not have
the<00:01:56.250> equalized<00:01:57.229> just<00:01:59.299> next<00:02:00.299> way<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> really

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the equalized just next way I really

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.620 
the equalized just next way I really
like<00:02:00.990> about<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.380> face<00:02:01.560> mask<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
like about this face mask is it's like a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.149 
like about this face mask is it's like a
big<00:02:03.930> girl<00:02:04.110> although<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.649> not<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:04.950> heavy

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
big girl although it's not as heavy

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.109 
big girl although it's not as heavy
which<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.829> positive<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:08.910> heavy

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
which is a positive so it's not as heavy

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.859 
which is a positive so it's not as heavy
as<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> big<00:02:09.539> girl

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
as the big girl

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.660 
as the big girl
yeah<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.289> still<00:02:10.440> has<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> cool<00:02:10.950> badass<00:02:11.160> design

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
yeah it still has the cool badass design

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.930 
yeah it still has the cool badass design
like

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
like

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.700 
like
to<00:02:12.000> diagnose<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.870> horizontal<00:02:13.470> all<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
to diagnose the horizontal all the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.590 
to diagnose the horizontal all the
different<00:02:14.010> different<00:02:14.520> ways<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.420> still

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
different different ways and it still

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.960 
different different ways and it still
does<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.930> six<00:02:16.710> diagonal<00:02:17.190> bars<00:02:17.430> as<00:02:17.700> opposed

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
does have six diagonal bars as opposed

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.810 
does have six diagonal bars as opposed
to<00:02:18.240> six<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.900> six<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.350> other<00:02:19.560> way<00:02:19.820> okay

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
to six and six on the other way okay

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.540 
to six and six on the other way okay
next<00:02:21.810> one<00:02:22.410> thing<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.590> really<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.220> some

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
next one thing I really like is some

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.160 
next one thing I really like is some
people<00:02:23.790> think<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.270> really<00:02:24.630> easily<00:02:24.810> grab

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
people think you can really easily grab

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.630 
people think you can really easily grab
this<00:02:25.320> because<00:02:25.530> there's<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.830> as<00:02:25.890> many<00:02:26.010> bars<00:02:26.310> as

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
this because there's not as many bars as

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.430 
this because there's not as many bars as
the<00:02:26.910> big<00:02:27.060> grill<00:02:27.240> however<00:02:27.960> when<00:02:28.350> you're

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the big grill however when you're

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.410 
the big grill however when you're
looking<00:02:28.620> here<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.160> still<00:02:29.550> can't<00:02:29.820> get<00:02:30.030> my<00:02:30.210> hands

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
looking here I still can't get my hands

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.360 
looking here I still can't get my hands
through<00:02:30.600> anywhere<00:02:31.040> except<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.190> at<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
through anywhere except for at the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.310 
through anywhere except for at the
bottom<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.090> try<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.870> grab<00:02:34.050> here

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
bottom here you can try and grab here

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.800 
bottom here you can try and grab here
but<00:02:34.890> cuz<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.220> way<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.550> diagonals<00:02:36.150> are<00:02:36.360> it's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
but cuz the way the diagonals are it's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.210 
but cuz the way the diagonals are it's
super<00:02:37.260> awkward<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.650> try<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:37.950> put<00:02:38.100> your

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
super awkward to try and put your

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.370 
super awkward to try and put your
fingers<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.700> here<00:02:38.910> which<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.690> really<00:02:39.930> like<00:02:40.110> as

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
fingers in here which I really like as

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.310 
fingers in here which I really like as
opposed<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.830> sitting<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.550> face<00:02:41.730> mask

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
opposed to sitting on this face mask

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.480 
opposed to sitting on this face mask
grab<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.440> right<00:02:43.620> there<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.250> grab<00:02:44.430> it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
grab it right there you can grab it

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.150 
grab it right there you can grab it
right<00:02:44.550> there<00:02:45.000> grab<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.840> that's<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.950> top

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
right there grab it that's on the top

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.800 
right there grab it that's on the top
but<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.610> diag<00:02:47.850> up<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.180> should<00:02:48.390> make<00:02:48.690> it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
but just the diag up I should make it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.040 
but just the diag up I should make it
really<00:02:49.080> awkward<00:02:49.230> for<00:02:49.470> your<00:02:49.680> fingers<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:51.050> couple

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
really awkward for your fingers a couple

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.830 
really awkward for your fingers a couple
the<00:02:52.140> last<00:02:52.170> things<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.560> really<00:02:52.770> like<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.840> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
the last things I really like is the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.690 
the last things I really like is the
vertical<00:02:55.230> bars<00:02:55.410> here<00:02:55.890> which<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.370> doesn't

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
vertical bars here which this doesn't

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.390 
vertical bars here which this doesn't
smell<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:58.140> mean<00:02:58.320> face<00:02:58.470> mask<00:02:58.740> because<00:02:59.070> this<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
smell I mean face mask because this is a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.190 
smell I mean face mask because this is a
kind<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.820> an<00:02:59.940> all<00:03:00.090> position<00:03:00.480> face<00:03:00.660> mask<00:03:00.900> which

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
kind of an all position face mask which

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.590 
kind of an all position face mask which
you<00:03:01.290> can<00:03:01.470> wear<00:03:01.650> at<00:03:02.310> linebacker<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:03.300> know<00:03:03.390> go

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
you can wear at linebacker you know go

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.790 
you can wear at linebacker you know go
back<00:03:03.830> kind<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:06.230> brick<00:03:07.230> over<00:03:07.470> here

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
back kind of like the brick over here

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.800 
back kind of like the brick over here
which<00:03:08.430> kind<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.730> signifies<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.210> this<00:03:09.570> for

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
which kind of signifies that this for

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.330 
which kind of signifies that this for
more<00:03:09.960> of<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.110> skill<00:03:10.350> position<00:03:10.770> as<00:03:10.920> well<00:03:11.130> as<00:03:11.220> it

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
more of a skill position as well as it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.920 
more of a skill position as well as it
can<00:03:11.490> be<00:03:11.640> for<00:03:11.670> alignment<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.450> was<00:03:12.600> designed

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
can be for alignment and it was designed

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.780 
can be for alignment and it was designed
for<00:03:13.110> alignment<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:14.360> then<00:03:15.360> also<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.790> light

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
for alignment and then also the light

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.850 
for alignment and then also the light
weight<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.330> being<00:03:18.810> light<00:03:18.989> weight<00:03:19.200> cuz<00:03:19.470> isn't

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
weight so being light weight cuz isn't

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.640 
weight so being light weight cuz isn't
so<00:03:19.950> heavy<00:03:20.300> always<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.330> plus<00:03:21.570> I'm<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> last

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
so heavy always a plus I'm the last

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.810 
so heavy always a plus I'm the last
thing<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:22.890> really<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.370> about<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.640> one

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
thing I really like about this one

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.910 
thing I really like about this one
opposed<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.390> some<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.690> other<00:03:24.810> ones<00:03:25.050> even

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
opposed to some of the other ones even

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.770 
opposed to some of the other ones even
though<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.100> same<00:03:26.280> kind<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.600> Green

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
though the same kind is the Green

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.390 
though the same kind is the Green
gridiron<00:03:28.200> finish<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:28.980> as<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.250> can

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
gridiron finish on this so as you can

getting some of the negatives of it I

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.440 
getting some of the negatives of it I
don't<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:10.100> this<00:04:11.100> here<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:12.830> this<00:04:13.830> one<00:04:13.980> has

their tags date of V and that be stood
for<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.310> B<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.820> would<00:04:20.940> be<00:04:21.060> created<00:04:21.479> right

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
for the B that would be created right

here

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
here

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.600 
here
on<00:04:24.729> like<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.449> soak<00:04:25.750> reset<00:04:26.169> be<00:04:26.319> there<00:04:26.610> along

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
on like that soak reset be there along

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.029 
on like that soak reset be there along
with<00:04:27.639> that<00:04:27.910> video<00:04:28.360> which<00:04:28.599> is<00:04:28.720> now<00:04:28.870> gone<00:04:29.050> you

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
with that video which is now gone you

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.890 
with that video which is now gone you
lose<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.460> aggressiveness<00:04:31.060> as<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.509> bottom<00:04:31.780> so

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
lose the aggressiveness as the bottom so

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.020 
lose the aggressiveness as the bottom so
as<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.110> can<00:04:32.229> see<00:04:32.289> on<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:32.590> one<00:04:32.729> she<00:04:33.729> goes<00:04:33.849> all

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
as you can see on this one she goes all

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.369 
as you can see on this one she goes all
the<00:04:34.060> way<00:04:34.120> around<00:04:34.300> like<00:04:34.479> that<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.900> suppose<00:04:35.020> to

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 
the way around like that I suppose to

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.730 
the way around like that I suppose to
this<00:04:35.530> where<00:04:35.949> it<00:04:36.009> kind<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.930> bends<00:04:37.930> in<00:04:38.409> a<00:04:38.560> bit

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
this where it kind of bends in a bit

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.439 
this where it kind of bends in a bit
which<00:04:38.949> all<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.520> their<00:04:39.639> face<00:04:39.789> masks<00:04:40.090> used<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.300> do

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
which all of their face masks used to do

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.510 
which all of their face masks used to do
so<00:04:41.259> it's<00:04:41.710> kind<00:04:41.889> of<00:04:41.949> a<00:04:42.039> little<00:04:42.159> less<00:04:42.370> aggressive

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
so it's kind of a little less aggressive

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.879 
so it's kind of a little less aggressive
which<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.599> don't<00:04:44.050> really<00:04:44.199> like<00:04:44.349> as<00:04:44.470> much<00:04:44.650> kind

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
which I don't really like as much kind

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.890 
which I don't really like as much kind
of<00:04:44.979> maybe<00:04:45.250> wish<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.580> tapered<00:04:45.879> in<00:04:46.030> whoever<00:04:46.750> that

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
of maybe wish it tapered in whoever that

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.659 
of maybe wish it tapered in whoever that
would<00:04:47.080> be<00:04:47.199> pretty<00:04:47.409> difficult<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:48.009> do<00:04:48.129> with

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
would be pretty difficult to do with

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.820 
would be pretty difficult to do with
this<00:04:48.849> type<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.120> butter<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:49.690> maybe<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:50.289> was<00:04:50.379> one

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
this type of butter so maybe it was one

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.320 
this type of butter so maybe it was one
thing<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.129> do<00:04:51.280> for<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.490> manufacturing<00:04:52.090> process

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
thing to do for a manufacturing process

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.760 
thing to do for a manufacturing process
and<00:04:54.479> I<00:04:55.479> also<00:04:55.690> wish<00:04:55.990> those<00:04:56.169> for<00:04:56.409> maybe<00:04:56.560> some

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
and I also wish those for maybe some

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.350 
and I also wish those for maybe some
more<00:04:56.889> bars<00:04:57.130> at<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.310> bottom<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.880> always<00:04:58.120> wish

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
more bars at the bottom I always wish
