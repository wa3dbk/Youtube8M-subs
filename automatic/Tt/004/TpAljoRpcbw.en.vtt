lunar<00:02:06.390> eclipse<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.960> June<00:02:07.200> 4th<00:02:07.530> reverses<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
lunar eclipse of June 4th reverses the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.669 
lunar eclipse of June 4th reverses the
order<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> Earth<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.569> Moon<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
order of the Earth and Moon so that the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.420 
order of the Earth and Moon so that the
moon<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.039> eclipsed<00:02:11.099> instead<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.330> Sun

finally<00:02:14.269> we<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.689> the<00:02:14.719> transit<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.379> Venus<00:02:15.739> on

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
finally we have the transit of Venus on

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.309 
finally we have the transit of Venus on
june<00:02:16.340> fifth<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.879> sixth<00:02:17.299> when<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.959> second
