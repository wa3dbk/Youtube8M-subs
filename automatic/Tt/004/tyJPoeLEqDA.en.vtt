which is a real 180 X which is going
around<00:00:37.920> buzz<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.690> go<00:00:39.839> and<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.050> so

chain<00:00:44.699> is<00:00:45.179> from<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> guitar<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.859> dunlop

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
chain is from the guitar into a dunlop

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.599 
chain is from the guitar into a dunlop
crybaby<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.909> walk<00:00:48.089> into<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.749> line<00:00:49.019> 6<00:00:49.350> pod<00:00:49.609> hd500

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
crybaby we walk into a line 6 pod hd500

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.209 
crybaby we walk into a line 6 pod hd500
and<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.600> goes<00:00:51.749> to<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> end<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.159> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and that goes to the end then for the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.000 
and that goes to the end then for the
effects<00:00:53.519> loop<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.999> got<00:00:54.409> just<00:00:55.409> a<00:00:55.440> blind<00:00:55.620> pedal

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
effects loop we got just a blind pedal

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.819 
effects loop we got just a blind pedal
and<00:00:56.159> a<00:00:56.339> delay<00:00:56.579> pedal<00:00:56.960> pretty<00:00:57.960> simple<00:00:58.319> not<00:00:58.649> much

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and a delay pedal pretty simple not much

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.950 
and a delay pedal pretty simple not much
to<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.149> anyways<00:01:00.679> this<00:01:01.679> has<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.069> lot<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> features

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
to it anyways this has a lot of features

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.300 
to it anyways this has a lot of features
it's<00:01:03.960> got<00:01:04.309> an<00:01:05.309> effects<00:01:05.670> loop<00:01:07.040> 2<00:01:08.040> foot

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it's got an effects loop 2 foot

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.139 
it's got an effects loop 2 foot
switchable<00:01:08.640> jacks

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
switchable jacks

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.530 
switchable jacks
so<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.719> choose<00:01:11.000> between<00:01:12.000> clean<00:01:12.509> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so you can choose between clean and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.480 
so you can choose between clean and
dirty<00:01:12.750> or<00:01:13.259> we<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.829> even<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> boost<00:01:14.310> for

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
dirty or we can even do a boost for

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.030 
dirty or we can even do a boost for
clean<00:01:14.759> stuff<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.770> turn

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
clean stuff this also got we can turn

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
clean stuff this also got we can turn
the<00:01:17.100> reverb<00:01:17.250> running<00:01:17.579> off<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.790> turn<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the reverb running off and turn the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.630 
the reverb running off and turn the
effects<00:01:18.270> loop<00:01:18.390> on/off<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:19.740> got<00:01:20.250> two<00:01:20.399> points

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
effects loop on/off I got two points

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.639 
effects loop on/off I got two points
both<00:01:20.850> example<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.289> gonna<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.530> that

beware all sound of this room the other
thing<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.579> don't<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> want<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> use

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
thing I don't like is if you want to use

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
thing I don't like is if you want to use
an<00:01:36.689> effects<00:01:36.930> loop<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> turn

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
an effects loop you got to have a turn

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.649 
an effects loop you got to have a turn
on<00:01:38.310> all<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.520> time<00:01:38.789> what's<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.270> foot<00:01:39.479> switch

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
on all the time what's the foot switch

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
on all the time what's the foot switch
so<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> actually<00:01:40.829> put<00:01:41.219> switch<00:01:41.430> in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so what I do is actually put switch in

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.249 
so what I do is actually put switch in
the<00:01:41.609> back<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.939> amp<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.960> turn<00:01:43.109> it<00:01:43.170> off

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the back of the amp and just turn it off

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.679 
the back of the amp and just turn it off
no<00:01:43.590> big<00:01:43.740> deal<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.390> way<00:01:45.479> just

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
no big deal I can get in the way just

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.370 
no big deal I can get in the way just
stay<00:01:45.990> there

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.770 

all<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.490> start<00:01:50.759> off<00:01:50.939> we're<00:01:51.450> gonna<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
all right start off we're gonna do the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.219 
all right start off we're gonna do the
clean<00:01:51.990> channel<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.310> my<00:01:53.340> EQ<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.930> seven

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
clean channel and on my EQ is that seven

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.260 
clean channel and on my EQ is that seven
a<00:01:55.259> half<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:56.009> bass<00:01:56.189> two<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> half<00:01:57.180> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a half for the bass two and a half of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.210 
a half for the bass two and a half of
the<00:01:57.329> minute<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.780> six<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> treble<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
the minute and six for the treble and

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.760 
the minute and six for the treble and
you<00:01:59.939> got<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.390> thing<00:02:00.840> called<00:02:01.320> bright<00:02:01.560> switch

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you got this thing called bright switch

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.679 
you got this thing called bright switch
so<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.070> make<00:02:02.220> bright<00:02:03.179> if<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.420> want<00:02:03.570> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
so you can make bright if you want to

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.999 
so you can make bright if you want to
you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.929> in<00:02:04.020> case<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.649> pickups

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
you know in case you think your pickups

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.710 
you know in case you think your pickups
to<00:02:05.189> honking<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.729> think<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.329> are<00:02:06.420> but

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
to honking I think they are but

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.570 
to honking I think they are but
especially<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:07.950> was<00:02:07.979> real<00:02:08.190> quick<00:02:08.340> anyway

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
especially there was real quick anyway
