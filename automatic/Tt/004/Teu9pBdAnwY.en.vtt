hair yesterday like as a finisher and I

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.790

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.450 
that a lot of the products I had been
using<00:02:01.570> earlier<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.380> week<00:02:02.590> I'm<00:02:02.920> had<00:02:03.189> a<00:02:03.219> lot

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
using earlier in the week I'm had a lot

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.330 
using earlier in the week I'm had a lot
of<00:02:03.490> protein<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.509> then<00:02:05.289> so<00:02:05.799> then<00:02:05.979> my<00:02:06.130> hair

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
of protein and then so then my hair

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.279 
of protein and then so then my hair
kinda<00:02:06.670> started<00:02:06.969> acting<00:02:07.270> funky<00:02:07.509> like<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.229> know

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
kinda started acting funky like I know

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.210 
kinda started acting funky like I know
I'm<00:02:08.560> using<00:02:08.800> too<00:02:09.070> much<00:02:09.190> protein<00:02:09.490> when

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
I'm using too much protein when

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.509 
I'm using too much protein when
basically<00:02:12.220> no<00:02:13.180> products<00:02:14.080> affects<00:02:15.010> my<00:02:15.250> hair

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
basically no products affects my hair

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.270 
basically no products affects my hair
it's<00:02:15.849> like

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
it's like

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.030 
it's like
hered<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.150> like<00:02:17.360> yeah<00:02:17.720> nope<00:02:18.200> sorry<00:02:18.620> I'll

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
hered is just like yeah nope sorry I'll

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.040 
hered is just like yeah nope sorry I'll
like<00:02:19.490> eating<00:02:19.850> conditioners<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:20.660> regular

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
like eating conditioners like regular

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.110 
like eating conditioners like regular
conditioners<00:02:21.620> won't<00:02:22.250> have<00:02:22.400> any<00:02:22.580> slip<00:02:22.850> on<00:02:23.000> my

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
conditioners won't have any slip on my

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.380 
conditioners won't have any slip on my
hair<00:02:23.420> they<00:02:23.720> won't<00:02:24.020> um<00:02:24.610> yeah<00:02:25.610> they're<00:02:26.150> just

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
hair they won't um yeah they're just

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.150 
hair they won't um yeah they're just
pointless<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:27.080> nothing<00:02:27.440> works<00:02:27.650> on<00:02:27.860> my<00:02:27.950> hair

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
pointless like nothing works on my hair

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.640 
pointless like nothing works on my hair
so<00:02:28.550> that's<00:02:29.330> when<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.660> know<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.930> have<00:02:30.200> like<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> bit

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
so that's when I know I have like a bit

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.199 
so that's when I know I have like a bit
of<00:02:30.800> protein<00:02:31.010> overload<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:31.910> need<00:02:32.090> to

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
of protein overload I need to

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.050 
of protein overload I need to
concentrate<00:02:32.390> more<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:33.370> moisture<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.640> this

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
concentrate more on moisture and this

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.729 
concentrate more on moisture and this
does<00:02:35.330> have<00:02:35.569> protein<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.260> towards<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
does have protein it's towards the

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.180 
does have protein it's towards the
bottom<00:02:37.600> but<00:02:38.600> it's<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.840> sub<00:02:39.050> hydrolyzed<00:02:39.620> keratin

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
bottom but it's a sub hydrolyzed keratin

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.920 
bottom but it's a sub hydrolyzed keratin
and<00:02:41.500> anymore<00:02:42.500> oh<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.120> has<00:02:44.150> silk<00:02:44.569> amino

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
and anymore oh and it has silk amino

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.690 
and anymore oh and it has silk amino
acids<00:02:45.380> both<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:46.010> them<00:02:46.069> are<00:02:46.190> towards<00:02:46.459> bottom

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
acids both of them are towards bottom

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.600 
acids both of them are towards bottom
but<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.920> know<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.340> a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
but just it just you know it just a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.300 
but just it just you know it just a
protein<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.269> protein<00:02:50.420> product<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.800> if<00:02:52.190> your

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
protein is a protein product so if your

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.160 
protein is a protein product so if your
protein<00:02:52.730> sensitive<00:02:53.209> like<00:02:53.420> me<00:02:53.450> some<00:02:53.930> people

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
protein sensitive like me some people

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.810 
protein sensitive like me some people
are<00:02:54.230> more<00:02:54.410> protein<00:02:54.830> sensitive<00:02:55.340> than<00:02:55.459> me<00:02:55.550> some

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
are more protein sensitive than me some

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.540 
are more protein sensitive than me some
people<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.630> know<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:57.290> deal<00:02:57.560> with<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:58.100> bit<00:02:58.400> more

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
people you know can deal with a bit more

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.170 
people you know can deal with a bit more
protein<00:02:59.060> um<00:02:59.360> but<00:02:59.989> just<00:03:00.200> be<00:03:00.320> aware<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.760> that

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
protein um but just be aware that that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.400 
protein um but just be aware that that
is<00:03:02.450> in<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.959> product<00:03:04.450> but<00:03:05.450> yeah<00:03:05.630> besides<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.230> I

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
is in a product but yeah besides that I

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.680 
is in a product but yeah besides that I
can<00:03:06.950> definitely<00:03:07.100> use<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.640> our<00:03:08.150> dew<00:03:08.360> points

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
can definitely use this our dew points

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.660 
can definitely use this our dew points
are<00:03:08.750> getting<00:03:08.989> pretty<00:03:09.200> optimal<00:03:09.800> for<00:03:10.430> using

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
are getting pretty optimal for using

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.750 
are getting pretty optimal for using
glycerine<00:03:11.120> glycerine<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.720> fourth<00:03:11.959> ingredient

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
glycerine glycerine to fourth ingredient

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.930 
glycerine glycerine to fourth ingredient
so<00:03:13.760> i'll<00:03:14.890> definitely<00:03:15.890> be<00:03:15.920> using<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.670> in

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
so i'll definitely be using this in

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.900 
so i'll definitely be using this in
spring<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.360> summer<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:18.019> was<00:03:18.680> going<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:21.400> buy<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
spring and summer I was going to buy the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.539 
spring and summer I was going to buy the
mousse<00:03:23.720> gel<00:03:23.750> because<00:03:24.530> that's<00:03:25.040> supposed<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.489> be

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
mousse gel because that's supposed to be

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.880 
mousse gel because that's supposed to be
a<00:03:25.610> hold<00:03:25.850> of<00:03:25.910> for<00:03:26.239> this<00:03:26.750> was<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.320> old<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:27.620> five

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
a hold of for this was the old of five

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.310 
a hold of for this was the old of five
so<00:03:28.549> I<00:03:28.579> was<00:03:28.790> like<00:03:28.910> okay<00:03:29.060> it's<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.690> little<00:03:29.720> softer

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
so I was like okay it's a little softer

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.380 
so I was like okay it's a little softer
so<00:03:30.920> what's<00:03:31.280> going<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.610> end<00:03:31.670> whose<00:03:31.940> shelf<00:03:32.209> I

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
so what's going to end whose shelf I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.300 
so what's going to end whose shelf I
could<00:03:32.570> get<00:03:32.750> more<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.900> recoil<00:03:36.350> but<00:03:37.040> I

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
could get more of the the recoil but I

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.880 
could get more of the the recoil but I
already<00:03:37.459> have<00:03:37.579> I<00:03:38.090> have<00:03:38.299> like<00:03:38.510> at<00:03:38.780> least<00:03:38.890> half

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
already have I have like at least half

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.729 
already have I have like at least half
of<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.310> bottle<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.329> 12<00:03:41.630> ounce<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.110> coil<00:03:42.410> and

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
of a bottle of a 12 ounce of a coil and

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.009 
of a bottle of a 12 ounce of a coil and
I<00:03:43.160> have<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> 6-ounce<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:44.329> was<00:03:44.720> like<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.989> don't

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
I have a 6-ounce I was like I don't

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.080 
I have a 6-ounce I was like I don't
really<00:03:45.260> need<00:03:45.530> any<00:03:45.769> more<00:03:45.920> recoil<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.700> then<00:03:46.880> the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
really need any more recoil and then the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.940 
really need any more recoil and then the
other<00:03:47.120> day<00:03:47.450> i<00:03:47.480> also<00:03:47.720> bought<00:03:48.049> like<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.440> mason

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
other day i also bought like a mason

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.130 
other day i also bought like a mason
pearson<00:03:49.280> brussels<00:03:50.120> like<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.540> need<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.870> sit<00:03:51.079> down

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
pearson brussels like I need to sit down

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.560 
pearson brussels like I need to sit down
and<00:03:51.350> put<00:03:51.680> myself<00:03:51.859> on<00:03:52.160> another<00:03:52.489> note<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.880> because

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
and put myself on another note I because

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.720 
and put myself on another note I because
sometimes<00:03:54.109> I<00:03:54.410> just<00:03:54.470> get<00:03:54.709> very<00:03:54.980> flighty<00:03:55.400> with

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
sometimes I just get very flighty with

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.520 
sometimes I just get very flighty with
my<00:03:55.880> purchases<00:03:56.540> I'm<00:03:56.780> just<00:03:56.959> like<00:03:57.049> I'll<00:03:57.170> try<00:03:57.410> that

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
my purchases I'm just like I'll try that
