I've actually been a little lazy I
haven't<00:00:38.610> used<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.000> I'm<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.300> start

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
haven't used it so I'm going to start

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.270 
haven't used it so I'm going to start
using<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.719> again<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.710> older<00:00:40.980> our

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
using it again as we can older our

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.090 
using it again as we can older our
collagen<00:00:41.850> stops<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.390> producing<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.100> we'll

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
collagen stops your producing and we'll

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.709 
collagen stops your producing and we'll
get<00:00:44.370> wrinkles<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.969> start<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> scar<00:00:45.539> more

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
get wrinkles we start to scar more

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.690 
get wrinkles we start to scar more
easily<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.070> lose<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
easily and we just lose a lot of the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.819 
easily and we just lose a lot of the
elasticity<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.510> our<00:00:48.660> face<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.140> things<00:00:49.710> like

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
elasticity in our face so things like

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.260 
elasticity in our face so things like
the<00:00:49.950> derma<00:00:50.219> roller<00:00:50.399> are<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:50.969> great<00:00:51.149> for

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the derma roller are really great for

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.670 
the derma roller are really great for
helping<00:00:51.570> us<00:00:51.719> kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> restore<00:00:52.440> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
helping us kind of restore that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.590 
helping us kind of restore that
elasticity<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.550> restore<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> reproduction

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
elasticity and restore the reproduction

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150 
elasticity and restore the reproduction
of<00:00:54.719> collagen<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.680> wanted<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.470 
of collagen and I wanted to do a
tutorial<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.699> how<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> use<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.360> because

tutorial on how to use it because

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.029 
tutorial on how to use it because

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
there's been a lot of confusion as to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.310 
there's been a lot of confusion as to
the<00:00:59.670> best<00:01:00.000> technique<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.629> using<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.079> thing

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the best technique in using this thing

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.630 
the best technique in using this thing
because<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> funny<00:01:02.460> it's

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

just like a little rollerball and has
and<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> guys<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.309> see<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.880> has

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
and if you guys can see this but has

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.050 
and if you guys can see this but has
like<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.689> needles<00:01:07.549> sticking<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
like little needles sticking out of it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.240 
like little needles sticking out of it
and<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.570> looks<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.080> very<00:01:10.320> painful<00:01:10.530> but

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and it looks like it's very painful but

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
and it looks like it's very painful but
it's<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.420> too<00:01:12.570> bad<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.439> little

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it's not too bad it's it's a little

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
it's not too bad it's it's a little
annoying<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.520> bad<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.210> so

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
annoying but it's not bad and so

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
better now so it goes a little drug but

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.250 
better now so it goes a little drug but
I<00:02:59.980> want<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.280> go<00:03:00.370> ahead<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.940> start<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.480> use<00:03:01.510> the

to do is my derma roller is clean and

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.980 
to do is my derma roller is clean and
now<00:03:06.880> what<00:03:07.060> I'm<00:03:07.150> going<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.300> do<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.690> I'm<00:03:07.959> just

now what I'm going to do is I'm just

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.760 
now what I'm going to do is I'm just
going<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.350> go<00:03:08.530> kind<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:08.950> up<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.610> down<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.770> I'm

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
going to go kind of up and down and I'm

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.470 
going to go kind of up and down and I'm
pressing<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.459> little<00:03:12.610> bit<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:12.940> not<00:03:13.030> too<00:03:13.090> hard

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
pressing a little bit but not too hard

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.420 
pressing a little bit but not too hard
and<00:03:13.810> what<00:03:14.290> I'm<00:03:14.380> basically<00:03:14.739> doing<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.280> I'm

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
and what I'm basically doing is I'm

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.870 
and what I'm basically doing is I'm
going<00:03:15.459> up<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.239> down<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:17.340> I'm<00:03:18.340> giving<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.790> a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
going up and down and I'm giving it a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.550 
going up and down and I'm giving it a
little<00:03:19.030> bit<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.300> pressure<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.900> don't<00:03:20.350> want<00:03:20.500> to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
little bit of pressure I don't want to

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.560 
little bit of pressure I don't want to
bleed<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.160> don't<00:03:21.220> want<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.519> be<00:03:21.610> in<00:03:21.700> pain<00:03:21.940> but

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
bleed and I don't want to be in pain but

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.479 
bleed and I don't want to be in pain but
I<00:03:22.600> do<00:03:22.690> want<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.019> feel<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.650> notice<00:03:24.100> your

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
I do want to feel it and you notice your

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.040 
I do want to feel it and you notice your
skin<00:03:24.730> will<00:03:25.000> actually<00:03:25.269> start<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.600> get<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> little

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
skin will actually start to get a little

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.380 
skin will actually start to get a little
red<00:03:26.200> that's<00:03:26.769> okay

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
red that's okay

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.060 
red that's okay
basically<00:03:28.390> there's<00:03:28.570> two<00:03:28.870> different<00:03:29.290> ways<00:03:29.530> to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
basically there's two different ways to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.890 
basically there's two different ways to
using<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.430> derma<00:03:30.610> roller<00:03:30.820> one<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.750> can

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
using the derma roller one is you can

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.020 
using the derma roller one is you can
use<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.110> with<00:03:32.830> quite<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.190> bit<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.459> pressure<00:03:33.640> and

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
use it with quite a bit of pressure and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.060 
use it with quite a bit of pressure and
use<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.420> like<00:03:34.570> every<00:03:34.959> once<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.739> week<00:03:35.890> or<00:03:36.040> every

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
use it like every once a week or every

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.670 
use it like every once a week or every
five<00:03:36.310> days<00:03:36.519> or<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:36.850> or<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.390> can<00:03:37.810> put<00:03:38.140> use<00:03:38.530> it

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
five days or so or you can put use it

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.310 
five days or so or you can put use it
with<00:03:38.769> less<00:03:39.010> pressure<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.670> use<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.120> more<00:03:40.450> often

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
with less pressure and use it more often

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.720 
with less pressure and use it more often
like<00:03:41.470> maybe<00:03:41.709> like<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.100> know<00:03:42.160> four<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.580> five

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
like maybe like you know four to five

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.780 
like maybe like you know four to five
times<00:03:43.000> per<00:03:43.239> week<00:03:43.320> I<00:03:44.320> do<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:45.160> with<00:03:45.370> maybe<00:03:45.550> like<00:03:45.640> a

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
times per week I do it with maybe like a

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.390 
times per week I do it with maybe like a
little<00:03:46.090> bit<00:03:46.209> more<00:03:46.330> pressure<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:47.160> once<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.250> week

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
little bit more pressure and once a week

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.979 
little bit more pressure and once a week
but<00:03:48.610> it's<00:03:48.790> really<00:03:49.060> depends<00:03:49.600> it<00:03:49.750> really

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
but it's really depends it really

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.070 
but it's really depends it really
depends<00:03:50.320> on<00:03:50.470> your<00:03:50.590> skin<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.190> also<00:03:52.060> how<00:03:52.870> much

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
depends on your skin and also how much

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.430 
depends on your skin and also how much
you<00:03:53.290> can<00:03:53.500> take<00:03:53.650> pain<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:54.130> am<00:03:54.959> apparently<00:03:55.959> not

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
you can take pain I am apparently not

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.120 
you can take pain I am apparently not
too<00:03:56.590> bad<00:03:56.739> with<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.070> hold<00:03:57.250> withstanding<00:03:57.790> pain

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
too bad with we hold withstanding pain

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.830 
too bad with we hold withstanding pain
so<00:04:00.130> I'm<00:04:00.220> going<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.459> go<00:04:00.610> up<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.000> down<00:04:01.150> on<00:04:01.540> my

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
so I'm going to go up and down on my

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.080 
so I'm going to go up and down on my
chin<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:03.010> starts<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.489> hurt<00:04:03.519> less<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:03.970> less

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
chin and it starts to hurt less and less

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.390 
chin and it starts to hurt less and less
as<00:04:04.390> you<00:04:05.160> go<00:04:06.160> over<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:08.100> then<00:04:09.100> what<00:04:09.340> I'm

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
as you go over it and then what I'm

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.160 
as you go over it and then what I'm
going<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.580> do<00:04:09.730> is<00:04:10.000> I'm<00:04:10.360> going<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.600> start<00:04:10.840> going

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
going to do is I'm going to start going

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.620 
going to do is I'm going to start going
in<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.590> crisscross<00:04:11.890> motion<00:04:12.580> like<00:04:13.299> I'm<00:04:13.420> drawing

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
in a crisscross motion like I'm drawing

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.140 
in a crisscross motion like I'm drawing
an<00:04:13.810> X

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.840 

and<00:04:17.380> kind<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.440> avoiding<00:04:18.950> this<00:04:19.160> eye<00:04:19.370> area<00:04:19.700> I'm

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
and kind of avoiding this eye area I'm

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.070 
and kind of avoiding this eye area I'm
going<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.270> little<00:04:20.360> bit<00:04:20.540> right<00:04:20.690> here<00:04:20.840> but<00:04:20.989> I'm

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
going a little bit right here but I'm

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.220 
going a little bit right here but I'm
avoiding<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.530> eye<00:04:21.560> area<00:04:21.650> right<00:04:22.040> here<00:04:23.230> just

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
avoiding the eye area right here just

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.630 
avoiding the eye area right here just
because<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.500> skin<00:04:24.770> there's<00:04:24.950> really<00:04:25.190> thin<00:04:25.460> and

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
because the skin there's really thin and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.000 
because the skin there's really thin and
I<00:04:25.700> need<00:04:25.850> to<00:04:26.000> be<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.420> little<00:04:27.200> more<00:04:27.350> gentle<00:04:27.650> if<00:04:27.890> I'm

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
I need to be a little more gentle if I'm

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.920 
I need to be a little more gentle if I'm
going<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.250> go<00:04:28.340> over<00:04:28.370> there<00:04:28.670> just<00:04:28.910> doing<00:04:29.720> Criss

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
going to go over there just doing Criss

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.180 
going to go over there just doing Criss
crosses

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.100 

and<00:04:36.430> then<00:04:37.180> I'm<00:04:37.270> going<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.450> do<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.750> opposite

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
and then I'm going to do it the opposite

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.450 
and then I'm going to do it the opposite
way<00:04:38.170> now

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.430 

now<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.120> reason<00:04:43.479> why<00:04:43.570> I'm<00:04:43.630> doing<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:44.320> many

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
now the reason why I'm doing in so many

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.280 
now the reason why I'm doing in so many
different<00:04:44.620> ways<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:45.370> because<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.690> want<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.139> make

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
different ways is because I want to make

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.920 
different ways is because I want to make
sure<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:48.060> hits<00:04:49.060> as<00:04:49.300> many<00:04:49.570> different

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
sure that it hits as many different

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.730 
sure that it hits as many different
parts<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.199> my<00:04:50.320> face<00:04:50.530> as<00:04:50.770> possible<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:53.350> when<00:04:53.710> I

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
parts of my face as possible so when I

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.920 
parts of my face as possible so when I
go<00:04:54.009> up<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.430> down<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:55.120> then<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.509> way<00:04:55.750> and

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
go up and down and then this way and

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.810 
go up and down and then this way and
then<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.050> way<00:04:56.199> I'm<00:04:56.620> basically<00:04:57.280> hitting<00:04:57.639> as

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
then that way I'm basically hitting as

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.310 
then that way I'm basically hitting as
many<00:04:58.120> angles<00:04:58.509> of<00:04:58.810> my<00:04:59.110> face<00:04:59.320> as<00:04:59.680> possible

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
many angles of my face as possible

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.749 
many angles of my face as possible
basically<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.740> way<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:03.009> derma<00:05:03.310> roller<00:05:03.520> works

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
basically the way the derma roller works

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.029 
basically the way the derma roller works
is<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.270> kind<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.080> causes<00:05:05.289> a<00:05:05.560> little<00:05:05.710> bit<00:05:05.860> of

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
is it kind of causes a little bit of

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.340 
is it kind of causes a little bit of
trauma<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.729> know<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.419> sounds<00:05:07.720> really<00:05:07.930> dramatic

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
trauma I know it sounds really dramatic

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.840 
trauma I know it sounds really dramatic
but<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:08.620> just<00:05:08.740> causes<00:05:09.130> just<00:05:09.370> a<00:05:09.460> little<00:05:09.699> bit<00:05:09.789> of

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
but it just causes just a little bit of

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.990 
but it just causes just a little bit of
trauma<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.180> where<00:05:10.539> it<00:05:10.870> will<00:05:11.289> kind<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:12.000> improve

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
trauma to where it will kind of improve

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.840 
trauma to where it will kind of improve
the<00:05:13.180> collagen<00:05:13.630> reproduction<00:05:14.139> of<00:05:14.259> our<00:05:14.380> face<00:05:14.850> so

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850
