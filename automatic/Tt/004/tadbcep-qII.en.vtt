00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hi youtube people my name is stars 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.440
 64 and today I will show how to unblock the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.110
 super smash bros characters for 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.450
 nintendo 64 is said that you can 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.759
 unlock four new characters a 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.800
 new scenario and a new menu but what 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.720
 from the menu I'm not too sure since I 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.330
 I still do not try the four characters 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.960
 that you can unblock are hill and bud 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.019
 captain falcon nes and luigi good 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.730
 let's start hill and bud you just have to 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.160
 Finish the game in any way 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 difficulty and with the lives you want 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.120
 it does not matter if you do what you continue 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.309
 matter is that you finish the game for 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.620
 final to be able to fight against hewitt in the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.629
 stadium of pikachu and beat him so that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 be a selectable character and if not 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.600
 you beat it will not unlock and you'll have 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.600
 to start over 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.699
 captain faltÃ³n you must finish the game in 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.129
 any difficulty with the lives that 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.230
 you want without doing continuous but this 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.300
 time in less than 20 minutes and at the end 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.670
 fight against falcon captain in the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.799
 samus stadium and beat him to make it 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.899
 a selectable character and if not what 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.890
 you can not unlock, so you'll have to 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.890
 do it all again 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.350
 you must finish the game in the time that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.929
 you want but in difficulty mode 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.090
 normal and with three lives and in the end 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.130
 fight against nes at kirby stadium 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.229
 and beat him so you can choose him in 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.240
 the selection menu and in case of no 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.250
 beat him also have to try 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.920
 again 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.840
 luigi you must finish with the eight 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.730
 initial characters the break mode of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.830
 targets so that the last 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.840
 characters in completing this mode I fought 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.450
 against luigi at mario's stadium and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.970
 beat him to be a character 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.430
 selectable 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.230
 so I recommend you choose a 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.360
 strong character to be the last 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.820
 in completing this mode and so you can 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.620
 beat Luigi with the strong character and 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.930
 If you do not win, you will have to 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.090
 end the break the targets mode alone 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.550
 with a character and the fight will appear 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.040
 with turn is 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.810
 to unlock the mutual scenario with 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.460
 kingdom you have to finish the game with 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.800
 all 8 initial characters 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.780
 and to unlock the new menu they say 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.060
 than playing in versus many mode 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.640
 times but as I told you I do not know 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.220
 a lot of this trick 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.880
 This was all comment and subscribe is 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.880
 well bye
