you including screen protector if you're
interested<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.290> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.500> silicon

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
interested in that this is a silicon

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.000 
interested in that this is a silicon
case<00:00:44.040> that's<00:00:44.910> coated<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:46.010> high-gloss

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
case that's coated in a high-gloss

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.910 
case that's coated in a high-gloss
polymer<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.620> it'll

polymer so what that will do is it'll

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
polymer so what that will do is it'll
give<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> very<00:00:50.579> smooth<00:00:51.210> back<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.809> can

give you a very smooth back as you can

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.250 
give you a very smooth back as you can
hear<00:00:53.390> it's<00:00:54.390> sort<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.899> matte<00:00:55.230> finish

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
hear it's sort of like a matte finish

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.529 
hear it's sort of like a matte finish
coating<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.730> great<00:00:57.000> super

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539

smooth very nice to hold on to its a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.490 
smooth very nice to hold on to its a
little<00:00:59.460> bit<00:00:59.670> grippy<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.329> it'll<00:01:01.079> add<00:01:01.199> some<00:01:01.379> nice

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
little bit grippy so it'll add some nice

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.959 
little bit grippy so it'll add some nice
grip<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:02.190> holding<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.789> your

hands<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.830> same<00:01:04.860> time<00:01:05.280> unlike<00:01:05.850> silicone

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
hands at the same time unlike silicone

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
hands at the same time unlike silicone
this<00:01:06.659> will<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.080> pick<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.350> any<00:01:07.470> fingerprints

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
this will not pick up any fingerprints

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.670 
this will not pick up any fingerprints
any<00:01:08.490> dust<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> lint<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.560> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
any dust and lint as you can see this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.710 
any dust and lint as you can see this
case<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.220> spotless<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.820> I've<00:01:12.119> been<00:01:12.240> using<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
case is spotless and I've been using it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.520 
case is spotless and I've been using it
for<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> past<00:01:13.080> four<00:01:13.439> days<00:01:15.110> I'd<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> think

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
for the past four days I'd like to think

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.590 
for the past four days I'd like to think
of<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.040> TPU<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.909> because<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> seems

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of it more as TPU just because it seems

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.359 
of it more as TPU just because it seems
to<00:01:18.720> share<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> properties<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> plastic<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to share the properties of plastic and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.740 
to share the properties of plastic and
silicon<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.420> flexible<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.049> silicone

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
silicon so it's flexible like silicone

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.940 
silicon so it's flexible like silicone
but<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> same<00:01:25.110> time<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
but at the same time because of that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
but at the same time because of that
cough<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.189> polymer<00:01:26.939> coating<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> back

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
cough that polymer coating on the back

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
cough that polymer coating on the back
it<00:01:28.020> slides<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.400> pocket<00:01:29.850> very

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it slides in and out of your pocket very

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.569 
it slides in and out of your pocket very
easily<00:01:30.299> does<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> pick<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.170> anything<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.340> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
easily does it pick up anything as you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.969 
easily does it pick up anything as you
can<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.909> super<00:01:33.270> clean<00:01:33.689> even<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.740> white

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
can see super clean even in this white

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.179 
can see super clean even in this white
model<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> we'll<00:01:37.350> pop<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> phone<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
model so we'll pop this on the phone and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.490 
model so we'll pop this on the phone and
we'll<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.460> how<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> fits<00:01:39.259> because<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
we'll see how it fits because it is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140 
we'll see how it fits because it is
silicone<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.400> obviously<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.939> very

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
silicone it's obviously going to be very

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.609 
silicone it's obviously going to be very
easy<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.630> put<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> phone<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.439> gotta

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
bit deep in there so this will protect

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.429

capsule as you can see right here is

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.150 
capsule as you can see right here is
that<00:02:21.300> little<00:02:21.360> slot<00:02:21.870> where<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.530> use<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.770> pry

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that little slot where you use to pry

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.309 
that little slot where you use to pry
off<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.400> back<00:02:23.700> cover<00:02:24.060> they've<00:02:24.630> made<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> great

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
off the back cover they've made a great

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.770 
off the back cover they've made a great
mold<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.010> whole<00:02:26.459> case<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.060> right<00:02:27.420> here<00:02:27.690> is

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
mold of the whole case and right here is

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.710 
mold of the whole case and right here is
what<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.110> can<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.650> one<00:02:29.580> cut<00:02:30.209> out<00:02:30.360> which

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
what you can see that one cut out which

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.070 
what you can see that one cut out which
separates<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> screen<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.640> back<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.959> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
separates the screen and the back so it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.930 
separates the screen and the back so it
seems<00:02:34.290> as<00:02:34.470> though<00:02:34.500> these<00:02:35.190> precise<00:02:35.640> cutouts

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
seems as though these precise cutouts

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.960 
seems as though these precise cutouts
are<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.630> direct<00:02:37.110> result<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:38.310> great<00:02:38.520> molding

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
that they've done that and finally at

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.180 
that they've done that and finally at
the<00:03:59.400> top<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.970> do<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:00.299> little<00:04:01.170> incisions<00:04:01.859> for

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
grill seems is all they do take a lot of

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.710 
grill seems is all they do take a lot of
attention<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.440> detail<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.609> I<00:04:09.150> do<00:04:09.209> like<00:04:09.540> that

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
attention to detail and I do like that

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.750 
attention to detail and I do like that
any<00:04:09.930> manufacturer<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.799> finally<00:04:11.549> they<00:04:11.700> do

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
any manufacturer and finally they do

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.640 
any manufacturer and finally they do
have<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.060> nice<00:04:12.299> little<00:04:12.510> rim<00:04:12.810> all<00:04:13.049> around<00:04:13.440> here

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
have a nice little rim all around here

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.520 
have a nice little rim all around here
so<00:04:13.889> this<00:04:14.040> will<00:04:14.280> lift<00:04:14.540> your<00:04:15.540> screen<00:04:16.049> off<00:04:16.320> the

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
so this will lift your screen off the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.140 
so this will lift your screen off the
table<00:04:16.889> or<00:04:16.979> whatever<00:04:17.220> surface<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.729> place<00:04:17.970> them

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
table or whatever surface you place them

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.750 
table or whatever surface you place them
on<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.840> that's<00:04:19.320> very<00:04:19.470> nice<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:20.039> see<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.430> do<00:04:20.549> have

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
on so that's very nice to see I do have

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.640 
on so that's very nice to see I do have
a<00:04:20.820> screen<00:04:21.060> protector<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:22.200> doesn't<00:04:22.500> bubble

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
a screen protector and it doesn't bubble

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.920 
a screen protector and it doesn't bubble
up<00:04:22.919> at<00:04:23.039> all<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.849> case<00:04:24.000> itself<00:04:24.360> features<00:04:24.630> a

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
up at all the case itself features a

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.960 
up at all the case itself features a
slim<00:04:25.229> form<00:04:25.530> factors<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.159> can<00:04:26.310> see<00:04:26.520> so<00:04:26.789> while

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
slim form factors you can see so while

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.710 
slim form factors you can see so while
it's<00:04:27.240> light

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
it's light

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.590 
it's light
and<00:04:28.050> doesn't<00:04:28.740> add<00:04:28.950> much<00:04:28.980> bulk<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:30.180> won't<00:04:30.510> add

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
and doesn't add much bulk it won't add

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.390 
and doesn't add much bulk it won't add
much<00:04:30.720> in<00:04:30.990> terms<00:04:31.140> of<00:04:31.320> protection<00:04:31.830> just<00:04:32.100> because

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
much in terms of protection just because

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.190 
much in terms of protection just because
the<00:04:32.700> material<00:04:33.360> itself<00:04:33.420> tends<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.050> be<00:04:34.170> pretty

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
the material itself tends to be pretty

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.400 
the material itself tends to be pretty
thin<00:04:34.730> so<00:04:35.730> for<00:04:35.970> an<00:04:36.030> overall<00:04:36.390> in<00:04:36.690> everyday<00:04:37.140> case

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
thin so for an overall in everyday case

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.590 
thin so for an overall in everyday case
it's<00:04:37.770> definitely<00:04:38.040> recommended<00:04:39.000> just<00:04:39.270> because

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
it's definitely recommended just because

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.880 
it's definitely recommended just because
I<00:04:39.630> know<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.050> people<00:04:40.260> like<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.620> have

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
I know that people like to have

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.890 
I know that people like to have
something<00:04:41.130> slim<00:04:41.550> but<00:04:42.210> at<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.360> same<00:04:42.540> time<00:04:42.720> it

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
something slim but at the same time it

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.120 
something slim but at the same time it
will<00:04:43.020> provide<00:04:43.290> very<00:04:43.560> good<00:04:43.800> scratch

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
will provide very good scratch

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.860 
will provide very good scratch
protection<00:04:44.520> because<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.240> covers<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.570> back

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
protection because it covers the back

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.200 
protection because it covers the back
and<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.140> size<00:04:46.410> of<00:04:46.560> your<00:04:46.620> device<00:04:46.980> but<00:04:47.940> it's<00:04:48.060> not

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
and the size of your device but it's not

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.390 
and the size of your device but it's not
very<00:04:48.360> good<00:04:48.480> at<00:04:48.690> drop<00:04:48.900> protection<00:04:49.310> even<00:04:50.310> though

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
very good at drop protection even though

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.100 
very good at drop protection even though
it<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.640> little<00:04:50.820> bit<00:04:50.970> better<00:04:51.210> than<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.720> naked

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
it is a little bit better than the naked

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.800 
it is a little bit better than the naked
phone<00:04:52.290> itself<00:04:52.650> so<00:04:53.100> overall<00:04:54.090> i'm<00:04:54.270> definitely

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
phone itself so overall i'm definitely

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.840 
phone itself so overall i'm definitely
pleased<00:04:55.110> with<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.380> case<00:04:55.560> itself<00:04:55.920> i<00:04:56.220> am<00:04:56.640> glad

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850

good<00:05:10.290> protection<00:05:10.820> for<00:05:11.820> overall<00:05:12.120> usage<00:05:12.450> but

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
good protection for overall usage but

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.540 
good protection for overall usage but
obviously<00:05:13.230> if<00:05:13.380> you're<00:05:13.470> going<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.620> drop<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:13.920> you

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
obviously if you're going to drop it you

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.820 
obviously if you're going to drop it you
might<00:05:14.700> have<00:05:14.760> some<00:05:15.300> concerns<00:05:15.720> over<00:05:16.080> that<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:16.590> I

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
might have some concerns over that so I

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.620
