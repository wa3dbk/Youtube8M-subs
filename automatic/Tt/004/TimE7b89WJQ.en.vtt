it a lot nicer to play games especially
racing<00:01:49.350> games<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
racing games because you have the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.639 
racing games because you have the
rounded<00:01:51.180> edges<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:51.930> feel<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.470> nice

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
rounded edges and they feel really nice

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.770 
rounded edges and they feel really nice
in<00:01:52.860> your<00:01:52.979> hand<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:54.000> can't<00:01:54.210> really<00:01:54.479> explain

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
in your hand I just can't really explain

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.380 
in your hand I just can't really explain
it<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.140> feels<00:01:55.649> great<00:01:55.979> turning<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.790> hits<00:01:57.180> your

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it it feels great turning it hits your

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.200 
it it feels great turning it hits your
fingers<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> right<00:01:58.380> spots<00:01:58.770> that's<00:01:59.520> kind

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
fingers and the right spots that's kind

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.929 
fingers and the right spots that's kind
of<00:02:00.329> dirty<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:01.110> sounded<00:02:01.530> bad<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.159> I'm<00:02:02.670> just

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
of dirty that sounded bad but I'm just

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.880 
of dirty that sounded bad but I'm just
saying<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.360> has<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> more<00:02:04.049> natural<00:02:04.469> feel<00:02:04.649> when

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
saying that has a more natural feel when

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.800 
saying that has a more natural feel when
you're<00:02:05.009> playing<00:02:05.250> racing<00:02:06.060> games<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.630> other

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.140 
used to it on my iphone 5 I loved it the
screen<00:03:11.709> does<00:03:11.950> not<00:03:12.130> really<00:03:12.400> need<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.790> be<00:03:12.910> wider

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
screen does not really need to be wider

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.910 
screen does not really need to be wider
I<00:03:13.300> don't<00:03:13.660> think<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.260> needs<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.590> be<00:03:14.709> wider

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
I don't think that it needs to be wider

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.759 
I don't think that it needs to be wider
in<00:03:15.250> any<00:03:15.670> sort<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.239> way<00:03:16.300> I<00:03:16.750> think<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.380> screen<00:03:17.560> is

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
in any sort of way I think the screen is

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.070 
in any sort of way I think the screen is
perfect<00:03:17.980> how<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.880> now<00:03:19.090> maybe<00:03:19.390> standards

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
perfect how it is now maybe standards

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.490 
perfect how it is now maybe standards
will<00:03:20.760> increase<00:03:21.760> later<00:03:21.970> on<00:03:22.420> in<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.780> years<00:03:23.110> as

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
will increase later on in the years as

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.949 
will increase later on in the years as
hands<00:03:24.010> get<00:03:24.190> bigger<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:25.269> kidding<00:03:25.630> as<00:03:25.780> we

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
hands get bigger just kidding as we

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.220 
hands get bigger just kidding as we
evolve<00:03:26.470> but<00:03:27.100> i'm<00:03:27.250> saying<00:03:27.580> when<00:03:28.420> people<00:03:28.930> start

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
evolve but i'm saying when people start

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.199 
evolve but i'm saying when people start
getting<00:03:29.350> used<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.769> larger<00:03:30.160> screens<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.820> even

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
getting used to larger screens and even

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.120 
getting used to larger screens and even
larger<00:03:31.780> screen<00:03:32.110> phones<00:03:32.440> come<00:03:32.739> out<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.010> the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
larger screen phones come out on the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.880 
larger screen phones come out on the
market<00:03:33.519> like<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.120> see<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.630> what<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.680> the

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
market like you see the what is it the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.820 
market like you see the what is it the
samsung<00:03:36.820> galaxy<00:03:36.850> note<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:38.350> kind<00:03:38.650> of<00:03:38.709> like

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
samsung galaxy note it's kind of like

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.470 
samsung galaxy note it's kind of like
that<00:03:39.100> people<00:03:39.459> are<00:03:39.550> getting<00:03:39.730> used<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.120> larger

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
that people are getting used to larger

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.090 
that people are getting used to larger
screens<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:40.989> we<00:03:41.110> don't<00:03:41.290> know<00:03:41.410> what<00:03:41.590> Apple<00:03:41.950> will

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
screens so we don't know what Apple will

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.890 
screens so we don't know what Apple will
come<00:03:42.310> out<00:03:42.459> with<00:03:42.670> later<00:03:42.970> in<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.299> future<00:03:43.660> maybe

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
come out with later in the future maybe

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.690 
come out with later in the future maybe
they'll<00:03:44.230> come<00:03:44.470> out<00:03:44.650> with<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.950> larger<00:03:45.489> screen

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
they'll come out with a larger screen

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.210 
they'll come out with a larger screen
just<00:03:46.060> like<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.420> Samsung<00:03:46.870> Galaxy<00:03:46.900> Note<00:03:47.560> but

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
just like the Samsung Galaxy Note but

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.490 
just like the Samsung Galaxy Note but
that's<00:03:48.670> probably<00:03:49.000> not<00:03:49.150> for<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.780> few<00:03:49.870> years<00:03:50.140> and

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
that's probably not for a few years and

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.640 
that's probably not for a few years and
probably<00:03:51.190> won't<00:03:51.790> happen<00:03:52.090> even<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:53.200> guys<00:03:53.380> that

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
probably won't happen even so guys that

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.560 
probably won't happen even so guys that
