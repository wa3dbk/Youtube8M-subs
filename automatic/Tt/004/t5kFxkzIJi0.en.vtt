00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
patients coming in and out of your work

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.529 
patients coming in and out of your work

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and then you also get to work in a team

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.390 
and then you also get to work in a team
environment<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.470> other<00:00:22.619> doctors<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400

nurses and other radiographers so I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.740 
nurses and other radiographers so I
think<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.730> team<00:00:26.939> environment<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.539> really

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
good mmm so a radiographer is someone

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.029 
good mmm so a radiographer is someone
who<00:00:46.969> takes<00:00:47.969> x-rays<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.289> thing<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:49.860> then

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
who takes x-rays is one thing but then

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
who takes x-rays is one thing but then
they<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.309> lots<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.910> other<00:00:51.000> things<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.449> well<00:00:51.480> so

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.110 
they do lots of other things as well so
you<00:00:52.920> might<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.309> involved<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.670> ultrasound

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you might be involved in ultrasound

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.799 
you might be involved in ultrasound
could<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> sonographer<00:00:55.430> or<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.699> could<00:00:57.000> do

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
could be a sonographer or you could do

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.619 
could be a sonographer or you could do
MRI<00:00:58.350> or<00:00:58.680> CT<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.730> example<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.270> they're<00:01:00.449> all

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
MRI or CT for example so they're all

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
MRI or CT for example so they're all
different<00:01:00.930> sorts<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.410> things<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.190> even<00:01:02.250> do

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
different sorts of things and we even do

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.270 
different sorts of things and we even do
some<00:01:02.699> procedures<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:04.439> doctors<00:01:04.890> taking

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
some procedures so with doctors taking

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.429 
some procedures so with doctors taking
x-rays<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.180> theatre<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.930> those<00:01:07.290> sorts

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
x-rays as we do theatre or those sorts

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.679 
x-rays as we do theatre or those sorts
of<00:01:07.619> things<00:01:07.680> yeah<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.090> radiographers

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
of things yeah so I radiographers

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.000 
of things yeah so I radiographers
they're<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> ones<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.320> are<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:10.890> with

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
they're the ones that are in there with

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.920 
they're the ones that are in there with
the<00:01:11.130> patient<00:01:11.549> they're<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> ones<00:01:12.780> they

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the patient they're the ones they

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
the patient they're the ones they
actually<00:01:13.260> take<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> x-rays<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> scans

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
actually take the x-rays or do the scans

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.910 
actually take the x-rays or do the scans
and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> radiologists<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> ones

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and then the radiologists are the ones

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160 
and then the radiologists are the ones
that<00:01:17.040> report<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> film's<00:01:18.030> afterwards<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.140> I

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that report the film's afterwards so I

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.510 
that report the film's afterwards so I
think<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> much<00:01:20.070> better<00:01:20.280> job

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
think we have the much better job

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
think we have the much better job
because<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> actually<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.140> there

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
because we get to actually be in there

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.490 
because we get to actually be in there
and<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.860> fun<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.280> scanning<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.409> know

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and have fun with scanning and you know

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.929 
and have fun with scanning and you know
get<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.770> hang<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.100> patients<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.729> sort

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
get to hang out with patients that sort

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.840 
get to hang out with patients that sort
of<00:01:27.000> thing<00:01:27.060> yeah<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.290> radiographer<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.340> like

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
of thing yeah so a radiographer is like

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.490 
of thing yeah so a radiographer is like
a<00:01:29.880> healthcare<00:01:30.390> professional<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> physio

or someone like that to three to four
year<00:01:33.600> degree<00:01:33.979> whereas<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.159> radiologist<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.390> do

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
year degree whereas a radiologist you do

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.870 
year degree whereas a radiologist you do
medicine<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> study<00:01:38.250> radiology

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
medicine and then you study radiology

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.469 
medicine and then you study radiology
afterwards<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.710> enjoy<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.430> variety<00:01:41.579> so

afterwards I really enjoy the variety so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.690 
not just doing x-rays all day doing lots
of<00:01:45.479> different<00:01:46.140> parts<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> radiography<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.579> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
of different parts of radiography as I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.440 
of different parts of radiography as I
said<00:01:48.000> before<00:01:48.439> and<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.640> really<00:01:50.970> enjoy<00:01:51.240> working

interesting<00:02:10.080> fun<00:02:10.500> sort<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.069> part<00:02:11.280> of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
interesting fun sort of part of

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.210 
interesting fun sort of part of
radiography<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.780> hospital

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
radiography is in a hospital

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.900 
radiography is in a hospital
yeah<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.360> come<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.260> in<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.440> morning<00:02:15.910> sometimes

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
yeah so come in in the morning sometimes

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.690 
yeah so come in in the morning sometimes
we<00:02:17.300> would<00:02:17.450> do<00:02:17.690> like<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> around<00:02:19.100> within<00:02:19.550> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
we would do like a around within the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.940 
we would do like a around within the
hospital<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.300> go<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.570> ICU<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.290> do<00:02:21.530> some<00:02:21.710> x-rays

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
hospital so go to ICU and do some x-rays

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.360 
hospital so go to ICU and do some x-rays
standard<00:02:22.580> x-rays<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.120> day<00:02:23.590> then<00:02:24.590> you'd<00:02:25.220> be

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
standard x-rays in the day then you'd be

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.640 
standard x-rays in the day then you'd be
rusted<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.940> an<00:02:26.030> area<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.870> say<00:02:27.050> I'd<00:02:27.200> be<00:02:27.320> rusted

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
rusted to an area to say I'd be rusted

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.700 
rusted to an area to say I'd be rusted
to<00:02:27.740> CT<00:02:28.130> for<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> day<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.510> that's<00:02:29.720> where<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.440> do

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
to CT for the day so that's where you do

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.540 
to CT for the day so that's where you do
it's<00:02:31.670> cool<00:02:31.880> it's<00:02:32.650> where<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.740> do<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.920> scan<00:02:34.310> of

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
it's cool it's where you do a scan of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.930 
it's cool it's where you do a scan of
the<00:02:35.390> body<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.200> region<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.580> patient

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
the body a region and you the patient

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.520 
the body a region and you the patient
goes<00:02:38.060> in<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.690> out<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.990> machine<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.350> you

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
goes in and out of the machine and you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.830 
goes in and out of the machine and you
end<00:02:39.680> up<00:02:39.770> with<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.950> 3d<00:02:40.490> picture<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.420> patient

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
end up with a 3d picture of the patient

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.650 
end up with a 3d picture of the patient
so<00:02:42.020> it's<00:02:42.200> pretty<00:02:42.470> cool<00:02:42.880> yeah<00:02:43.880> patients<00:02:44.420> can<00:02:44.510> be

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
so it's pretty cool yeah patients can be

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.150 
so it's pretty cool yeah patients can be
a<00:02:44.690> bit<00:02:44.840> sicker<00:02:45.170> because<00:02:45.410> they're<00:02:45.800> more

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
a bit sicker because they're more

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.360 
a bit sicker because they're more
high-end<00:02:46.430> scan<00:02:47.030> but<00:02:47.750> yeah<00:02:48.650> you're<00:02:48.860> able<00:02:49.190> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
high-end scan but yeah you're able to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.220 
high-end scan but yeah you're able to
you<00:02:49.730> know<00:02:49.850> they're<00:02:50.060> they're<00:02:50.660> still<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:50.930> right

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
you know they're they're still all right

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.960 
you know they're they're still all right
and<00:02:51.530> you're<00:02:51.620> able<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.890> yet<00:02:52.250> produce<00:02:52.550> some<00:02:52.730> good

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
and you're able to yet produce some good

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.970 
and you're able to yet produce some good
images<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.600> get<00:02:53.870> some<00:02:54.050> good<00:02:54.200> diagnostic

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
images and get some good diagnostic

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.310 
images and get some good diagnostic
outcomes<00:02:55.370> for<00:02:55.610> them<00:02:55.790> yeah<00:02:56.240> so<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.990> need<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.170> be

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
outcomes for them yeah so you need to be

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
outcomes for them yeah so you need to be
someone<00:02:57.709> who<00:02:57.890> enjoys<00:02:58.160> people<00:02:58.970> and<00:03:00.340> enjoy

someone who enjoys people and enjoy

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.880 
someone who enjoys people and enjoy
communicating<00:03:01.580> with<00:03:02.030> people<00:03:02.410> could<00:03:03.410> even

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
communicating with people could even

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.060 
communicating with people could even
though<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.700> know<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> science-based

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
though you know it is a science-based

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.920 
though you know it is a science-based
course<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.790> are<00:03:08.090> interacting<00:03:08.480> with<00:03:08.720> patients

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
course you are interacting with patients

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.840 
course you are interacting with patients
and<00:03:09.440> other<00:03:09.650> people<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.280> hospital<00:03:10.370> so

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
and other people in the hospital so

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.040 
and other people in the hospital so
that's<00:03:11.000> that's<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.360> really<00:03:11.570> important<00:03:11.900> thing

of being at school you need to keep up

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.390 
of being at school you need to keep up
with<00:03:19.880> your<00:03:19.970> maths<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:21.380> then<00:03:21.590> at<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.830> moment

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
with your maths and then at the moment

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.550 
with your maths and then at the moment
to<00:03:22.519> get<00:03:22.670> into<00:03:22.940> radiography<00:03:23.870> either<00:03:24.260> need<00:03:24.530> to

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
to get into radiography either need to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.910 
to get into radiography either need to
do<00:03:24.769> physics<00:03:25.220> or<00:03:25.430> biology<00:03:25.989> but<00:03:26.989> physics<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.680> is

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
do physics or biology but physics is is

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.890 
do physics or biology but physics is is
kind<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.430> main<00:03:28.610> one<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:28.940> because<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:29.840> know

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
kind of the main one that because I know

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.540 
kind of the main one that because I know
that<00:03:30.140> may<00:03:30.290> change<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:30.950> has<00:03:31.100> changed<00:03:31.459> in

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
that may change and it has changed in

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.340 
that may change and it has changed in
the<00:03:31.640> past<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.209> ya<00:03:32.480> doing<00:03:32.780> physics<00:03:33.140> is

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
the past so ya doing physics is

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.620 
the past so ya doing physics is
important<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.940> don't<00:03:35.090> have<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.239> be<00:03:35.330> great<00:03:35.510> at

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
important you don't have to be great at

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.440 
important you don't have to be great at
physics<00:03:36.100> but<00:03:37.100> having<00:03:37.700> having<00:03:38.239> that

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
physics but having having that

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.560 
physics but having having that
background<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:39.080> helpful<00:03:39.530> because<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:41.150> theory

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
background is helpful because the theory

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.720 
background is helpful because the theory
of<00:03:41.600> radiation<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.560> stuff<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:43.130> physics<00:03:43.549> pace

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
of radiation and stuff is physics pace

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.370 
of radiation and stuff is physics pace
so<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.510> need<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.750> learn<00:03:44.870> about<00:03:45.019> that<00:03:45.260> at

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
so you need to learn about that at

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.800 
so you need to learn about that at
school<00:03:45.650> well<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.400> love<00:03:46.790> x<00:03:47.030> rays<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.299> fine<00:03:47.690> I'm

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
school well I love x rays a fine I'm

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.180 
school well I love x rays a fine I'm
really<00:03:47.989> interesting<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:48.620> find<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.040> fascinating

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
really interesting I find it fascinating

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.970 
really interesting I find it fascinating
the<00:03:49.820> way<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.989> think<00:03:51.170> I'm<00:03:51.380> so<00:03:51.500> privileged

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the way that I think I'm so privileged

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.310 
the way that I think I'm so privileged
to<00:03:52.130> be<00:03:52.160> able<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:53.540> know<00:03:53.630> work<00:03:53.870> with<00:03:53.930> people

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
to be able to you know work with people

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.530 
to be able to you know work with people
and<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.860> in<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.519> job<00:03:55.760> where<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:55.940> get<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.180> see<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
and and in a job where I get to see the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.630 
and and in a job where I get to see the
x-rays<00:03:56.810> myself<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.530> always<00:03:58.010> find<00:03:58.549> that

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
x-rays myself and I always find that

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.190 
x-rays myself and I always find that
really<00:03:58.850> interesting<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.450> find<00:03:59.660> pathologies

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
really interesting and find pathologies

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.140 
really interesting and find pathologies
and<00:04:00.230> stuff<00:04:00.470> interesting<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.430> really<00:04:01.880> enjoy

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
and stuff interesting so I really enjoy

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.780 
and stuff interesting so I really enjoy
that<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:03.440> really<00:04:03.739> enjoy<00:04:04.070> being<00:04:04.310> able<00:04:04.580> to

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
that and I really enjoy being able to

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.940 
that and I really enjoy being able to
have<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:04.940> positive<00:04:05.180> influence<00:04:05.660> on<00:04:06.200> patients<00:04:06.709> so

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
have a positive influence on patients so

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.560 
have a positive influence on patients so
it<00:04:07.100> makes<00:04:07.280> me<00:04:07.459> feel<00:04:07.580> really<00:04:07.640> good<00:04:08.030> when<00:04:08.090> they

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
it makes me feel really good when they

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.570 
it makes me feel really good when they
can<00:04:08.810> say<00:04:09.230> thank<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.980> really<00:04:10.010> made<00:04:10.430> my

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
can say thank you that really made my

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.160 
can say thank you that really made my
day<00:04:10.640> or<00:04:10.970> made<00:04:11.299> this<00:04:11.420> thing<00:04:11.900> that<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.080> was

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
day or made this thing that I was

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.680 
day or made this thing that I was
worried<00:04:12.470> about<00:04:12.500> really<00:04:13.250> not<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:13.489> bad<00:04:13.690> think

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
worried about really not that bad think

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.719 
worried about really not that bad think
about<00:04:14.840> something<00:04:15.110> that<00:04:15.290> you<00:04:15.410> like<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:15.920> do<00:04:16.340> in

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
about something that you like to do in

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.580 
about something that you like to do in
terms<00:04:17.150> of<00:04:17.390> like<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.900> was<00:04:18.109> interested<00:04:18.470> in<00:04:18.530> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
terms of like I was interested in the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.740 
terms of like I was interested in the
health<00:04:18.799> science<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:19.669> then<00:04:20.090> give<00:04:20.330> something<00:04:20.570> a

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
health science and then give something a

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.920 
health science and then give something a
go<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.970> know<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.120> may<00:04:23.330> like<00:04:23.570> it<00:04:23.599> or<00:04:23.840> you

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
go and you know you may like it or you

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.570 
go and you know you may like it or you
may<00:04:24.080> not<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.500> it's<00:04:24.590> all<00:04:24.740> right<00:04:25.010> if<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.430> don't

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
may not and it's all right if you don't

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.220 
may not and it's all right if you don't
like<00:04:25.849> it

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
like it

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.290 
like it
but<00:04:27.100> you<00:04:27.430> know<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.580> may<00:04:27.820> find<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.150> you

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
but you know you may find that you

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.640 
but you know you may find that you
really<00:04:28.540> enjoy<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:28.990> but<00:04:29.110> if<00:04:29.230> it's<00:04:29.380> something

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
really enjoy it but if it's something

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.010 
really enjoy it but if it's something
that<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:30.220> think<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.820> could<00:04:31.180> enjoy<00:04:31.420> that<00:04:31.780> you

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
that you think I could enjoy that you

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.110 
that you think I could enjoy that you
know<00:04:32.140> I<00:04:32.170> knew<00:04:32.620> that<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.980> wanted<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:33.730> do<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.850> health

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
know I knew that I wanted to do a health

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.000 
know I knew that I wanted to do a health
science<00:04:34.570> but<00:04:34.720> i<00:04:34.750> had<00:04:34.900> no<00:04:34.930> idea<00:04:35.050> which<00:04:35.440> one<00:04:35.680> and

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
science but i had no idea which one and

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.520 
science but i had no idea which one and
I<00:04:36.790> just<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:37.210> chose<00:04:37.510> radiography<00:04:38.140> you<00:04:38.320> know<00:04:38.440> it

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
I just I chose radiography you know it

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.140 
I just I chose radiography you know it
was<00:04:38.680> kind<00:04:38.890> of<00:04:39.040> one<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.370> those<00:04:39.460> things<00:04:39.700> but<00:04:39.820> in

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
was kind of one of those things but in

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.310 
was kind of one of those things but in
actual<00:04:40.480> fact<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:40.780> think<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.020> would<00:04:41.110> have<00:04:41.170> been

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
actual fact I think I would have been

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.230 
actual fact I think I would have been
happy<00:04:41.590> if<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.770> chosen<00:04:42.010> any<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.430> them<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.790> don't

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
happy if I chosen any of them I don't

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.190 
happy if I chosen any of them I don't
think<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.450> really<00:04:43.480> would<00:04:43.810> have<00:04:43.840> mattered<00:04:44.050> for

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
think it really would have mattered for

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.950 
think it really would have mattered for
me<00:04:44.470> but<00:04:44.950> just<00:04:45.060> finding<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.240> area<00:04:46.570> that<00:04:46.900> I

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
me but just finding the area that I

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.410 
me but just finding the area that I
liked<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:47.500> then<00:04:47.680> investigating<00:04:48.400> that<00:04:48.520> yeah

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
liked and then investigating that yeah

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.180 
liked and then investigating that yeah
don't<00:04:49.750> don't<00:04:50.020> feel<00:04:50.260> like<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:50.620> don't<00:04:50.680> know<00:04:50.950> I'm

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
don't don't feel like I don't know I'm

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.710 
don't don't feel like I don't know I'm
not<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.400> hundred<00:04:51.610> percent<00:04:51.790> sure<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.630> that's

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
not a hundred percent sure that that's

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.930 
not a hundred percent sure that that's
what<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:52.960> want<00:04:53.170> to<00:04:53.230> do<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.590> so<00:04:54.160> then<00:04:54.460> you<00:04:54.700> step

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
what I want to do and so then you step

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.910 
what I want to do and so then you step
back<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.300> don't<00:04:55.420> do<00:04:55.540> it<00:04:55.660> at<00:04:55.750> all<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:56.170> give<00:04:56.830> it
