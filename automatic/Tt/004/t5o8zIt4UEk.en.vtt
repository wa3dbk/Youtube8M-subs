00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.129
 I have an aging and the program with a lot of money 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.129
 NestlÃ© card reader to USB 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.129
 Connection to connect the cameras and the iPad 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.669
 Hell use purpose the iPad SunEdison goes is can for his 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.800
 one or the other simple backups of special with map or should we then 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.900
 when it is on the road it is at 4 60 the work num just comes on 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.700
 other people 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.700
 who long journey will not comment on one or the other 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.570
 and the second field of application is of course simply at one time 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.980
 big screen to raise the pictures and look more optical 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.230
 offset whether for the exposure sitting whatever the picture 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.570
 to judge 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.040
 thanks to the two cameras you can now but that pictures something never 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.040
 450 every computer, he is a guest lecturer ever brought into the house 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.590
 and then I have one more the Greens 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.740
 in the 200er now no 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.460
 no sd-card has the I want to then just connect directly but I with 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.460
 the splendor then also made work without problems 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.730
 then i start to import images from the sd-map 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.650
 8 the attacks 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.530
 connect 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 and then it opens up in the run-up 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
 you can also see a few in front of television is also displayed 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.280
 if it's a rock festival backed rust and Trochowski way 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 Trainers and to see if the sausage too 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.299
 From marketers I can now have imported times 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.060
 you could also individually select you could prepare it 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.660
 the imported one comes a green tick 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.310
 the relatively fast that it is supposed to be around 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.440
 that's just fine 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.670
 and if the whole 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.770
 happened then you can see the pictures in hell or on the map on it 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.749
 that always likes me on the map 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.879
 the operating system is still set English so these are limits 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.979
 displayed in English in five companies 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.469
 Soloists always new ideas the Nikon here 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.279
 and and try to connect directly via the usb port 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.400
 but good as it is exactly the same window says something again 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.599
 happens when you select individual images 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.599
 then comes a blue one 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.309
 and then you can too 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.749
 Must-man you just do not have all the pictures impressions but you can certainly search 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.059
 wanted to sell 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.349
 licked in the Porzer so then selected Limburg hers 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.389
 not in traffic 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.499
 it works here too 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:06.399
 go relatively quickly 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:09.399
 although it's more like the first pictures 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.169
 only from 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.169
 and the last ones have fallen in pneumatic mail 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.489
 that with the out that I now, among other things, because he at one 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.209
 integrated Leica m9 for example there were the 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.849
 Hoff if not 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 then paid if I have no money so then 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.979
 in some cameras we are careful i do not know which yet 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.219
 It is always possible that with van the man to date photographs are always possible 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.899
 Watching big pictures is always stupid 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.999
 and then told me once 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.979
 2 Reimann one at the imported 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.099
 and the ones he last imported 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.609
 that was Nikon pictures 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.009
 that one has pretty nice that one 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.079
 The teachers like you're used to from the iPad big and small 10 so can 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.099
 you really can 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.889
 Nice to judge the pictures you made here for me a good one 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.889
 Thing 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.919
 and then we have those too 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:17.509
 then all imported a folder the fire is something I have out of hand 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.169
 and had voted for 51 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.509
 Woermann looks very nice that you are really looking for individual 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.210
 so I have now 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.219
 the iPad on 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.090
 m connected to 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.240
 Without seeing you here very nice that is the goal 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.870
 in today's pictures 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.229

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:52.800
 Union and liberal have and how it looks with their neurosis our grandma 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:56.749
 At the beginning of the new trading week, this is a recovery 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.830
 the manager 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.960
 On the way to the end, I'm not sure what else we are 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.909
 other problems 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.789
 in the Consumer area 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.789
 but we should also select those countries 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.999
 with all others 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:15.749
 the continent 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.749
 so you then put them on the calculator 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.680
 the food 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.830
 one percent foreign computer so he does not count on my everyday life &amp; Co 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.830
 On iTunes it says there is a life Berlin Calculator 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.509
 an important tip still the right way around 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.779
 it had it last year 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:38.639
 do not sync before taking the pictures off again just once 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.599
 Has 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.550
 Unless you want to have it on us this was from Val d'Isere 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.990
 Becker synchronized 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.539
 Eluana there new percent the percent of all electricity the pictures on the 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.539
 Haldenhof to better week 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.990
 now are with the friends from a video camera changed 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.279
 Bohmann 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.279
 Kuka was even if you can import videos 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.270
 with chambers TX single small digital camera 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.759
 Camcorders managed the videos I recorded earlier 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:19.610
 I'll take it 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.939
 the last 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.939
 with Keller's 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.569
 forget it's gone 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.240
 it took about a minute 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.319
 then let's have a look 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.419
 Filling 130 grams 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.800
 that would have thought about whether players as before not at all 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.869
 counting 

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:56.580
 this one should 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.610
 that's awesome if you have the right format and that's been in Orbe now 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.659
 if you only have one in the model Freecom or something then you can 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:06.710
 that too on yours on the grid is so nice
