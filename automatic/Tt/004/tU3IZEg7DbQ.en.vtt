00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.940
 design criteria 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.360
 hello today we will talk about the criteria of 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.810
 design for a storm drain or 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.270
 sanitary sewer we have to 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.380
 this is a well a record of 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.900
 sewerage 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.980
 The pipe 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.980
 and the other post 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.529
 this is the land then we have 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.070
 several parameters that are necessary 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.160
 consider when making a design 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.390
 or when calculating 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 one is the slope 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.380
 slope 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.140
 which is expressed as the bound 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.950
 here of the inverted tube minus the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.820
 level of the inverted here between the 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.970
 length we have 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.760
 delta h which is the difference in height 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.680
 between the length is the slope when 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.640
 in a sewer we have to treat 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.860
 that the slope of the conduit or 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 of a channel is selected so that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.660
 fit as far as possible to the slope 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.440
 natural terrain or terrain 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.440
 has a slope 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.570
 and we have to try that the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.760
 collector slope is adjusted as 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.580
 possible to the slope of the land and to 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.290
 the topography of it so that it 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.840
 guarantee the minimum speed and the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.630
 important effort because we have to 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.820
 try to make sure that the slope goes 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.240
 with the slope of the terrain good for 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.280
 minimize excavation costs 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.280
 that is one of the things to have in 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.970
 Clear account if the slope of the terrain 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.710
 is very little we can not not 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.729
 we can have a slope 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.610
 minimum that as we said to guarantee the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.390
 minimum speed 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.880
 to have in the pipeline and to guarantee the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.070
 good shear stress these are others 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.630
 two parameters that should be due 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.090
 meet when we design a 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.700
 sewer the determined collector 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.739
 pluvial or sanitary 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.239
 let's talk about it the speed 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.490
 minimum 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.030
 usually 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.110
 The minimum speed must be of 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.500
 0.6 meters per second that guarantees us 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.800
 that the two sands do not settle 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.110
 of nothing in the pipeline in some cases 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.770
 if it is impossible to obtain a speed 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.730
 so it gets to allow up to 0.3 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.730
 meters per second as long as it 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.910
 guarantee that the attractive force or 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.520
 effort with shear is greater than the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.520
 minimum value than for a sewer system 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.520
 is in the range between 1 and 2 pascal is 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.170
 well this is the other parameter 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.930
 the other parameter that we call the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.860
 shear stress or it is also called 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.390
 Attractive force or drag tension or 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.140
 tension another actress is called 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.420
 good 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.760
 this is called these four ways 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.650
 attention another actress important effort 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.650
 attractive tension or force 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.810
 This guarantees that any 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.150
 sediment that that's what any 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.390
 particle that is sedimented that 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.430
 comes from sand mud or this is 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.950
 dragged into the sewer and its 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.800
 value must be for a sewer system 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.690
 sanitary 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.110
 it must be between 1 and 2 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.540
 Newton over square meter for a 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.080
 storm sewer that has more 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.110
 sand and that must be greater than 2 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.180
 newtons on square meter or more 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.819
 at 2 pascal is 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.730
 a newton on square meter is the same 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.190
 to a pascal 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.069
 good in another in another video already 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.400
 we'll talk about how to calculate the effort 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.040
 constant this in the pipe how 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.220
 calculate the speed also in a 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.440
 pipe that we'll see in the new video 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.250
 so that you do not stop receiving 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.040
 subscribe to our various channel 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.740
 criteria we saw the slope that is what 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.680
 possible to minimize excavations 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.820
 follow as far as possible in the topography 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.820
 of the land or adjusting ensuring the 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.220
 minimum speed 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.070
 and the attractive force we saw these two 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.720
 criteria that the minimum speed should 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.180
 be greater as possible to 0.6 meters 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.600
 per second although in some cases 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.610
 can be in the range of between 0.3 and 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.639
 0.6 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.060
 we saw that attractive strength must 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.060
 be older 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:11.240
 to 12 pascal is possible now 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:15.370
 we will see the maximum speed 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.370
 because you must restrict the speed 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.660
 you must restrict the speed to 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.210
 avoid abrasion in the pipe 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.790
 then the maximum speed must be 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.790
 less than 5 meters per second 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.080
 if it happens that the speed is greater than 5 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.970
 meters per second you should try to 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.600
 decrease the slope to decrease 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.000
 water velocity in the pipe 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.360
 how can we achieve that suppose that 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.760
 we have a very steep terrain if 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.190
 we put a pipe with that slope 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.870
 here 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.290
 logical that we're going to get a 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.560
 very high speed greater than 5 meters 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:03.470
 per second how you should not do what 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.890
 we do then do we build a 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.720
 fall camera or we catch this is the 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.720
 terrain here 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.199
 we lower this well 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.970
 here we have the other well a record and 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.970
 as you see 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:37.170
 here we have the first fall camera 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.020
 here we have the second fall camera 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.310
 then the land can have a 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.830
 pending very 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.540
 very high but we the pipeline 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.850
 we give a lower slope to avoid 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.120
 that the speed does not exceed 5 meters 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.760
 per second that can generate with all 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.100
 the drag that a sewer brings 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.880
 A collector can generate abrasion in a 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.830
 your good baby those are in themselves the ones 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.750
 main criteria that we should have 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:08.110
 into account when a design was 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.100
 sewer I repeat it speed 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.600
 minimum 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:17.350
 greater than 0.6 meters per second 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:20.880
 maximum speed 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:23.360
 less than 5 meters per second 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:28.389
 attractive strength 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.389
 superior that exceeds the two most expensive 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.550
 these are the conditions or criteria of 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:38.040
 design when we are going to calculate a 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:41.450
 snapshot we will design a quantity 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.450
 thank you
