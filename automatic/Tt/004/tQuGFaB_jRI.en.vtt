00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 guests guests with you hope samilova and 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:18.420
 Today I will tell you how to make such 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:22.949
 Here is a beautiful contribution and today we are 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.439
 let's twist the hair on the pencil yes yes 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.920
 you really did not hear the pencil 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.539
 one of my friends did not use 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.140
 thermal protection before laying 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.280
 so I had to cut it 8 but 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.559
 you use heat protection though i 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.890
 made such a thermal protection on the hair 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.289
 after washed and dried hair dryer 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.680
 honestly honestly inflicted therefore never 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.559
 forget to apply heat protection to us 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:59.629
 the lanes are all gone. 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.629
 and so we share the hair we remove 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.910
 took a strand of hair 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.270
 jerry pencil ordinary pencil can 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.530
 Any absolutely take and so set 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.159
 pencil close to the roots and cheat 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.159
 bed 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:33.560
 there we take the iron and warm up the whole strand 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.729
 on a pencil and warm up 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.380
 touched everything to be warm again 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.009
 seconds ten support let 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:55.940
 cool to more resilient windows and 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:58.920
 let go as the cord from the phone 3 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.619
 next strand see here you can 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.170
 vary if you want bigger ones 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.470
 such curls can take a brush 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.920
 for example for make up the diameter itself is over 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.070
 thicker than a pencil 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.200
 if you want thin so many many 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.860
 many thin curls take thinner 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.800
 diameter 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.400
 if more curls take 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.900
 thicker you can also combine one 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.239
 pryadochka delirium thin other help 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.670
 will look natural and therefore 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.670
 let's try this 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.420
 see compared to previous 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.379
 it turns out a bigger wave 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.329
 so someone like the following 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.000
 I will take a rag again on a pencil that 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.739
 if they combine different diameters that 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.760
 there were different habits on so interesting 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:08.530
 more Soviet street strands will look 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.209
 better to take on a large diameter will 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.120
 more beautiful look especially the street 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.290
 always writes shorter strands later 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.239
 trimmed therefore street 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.239
 it is better to take a thicker diameter 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.439
 so go further 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.719
 all bottom strands would twist on a pencil 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.170
 that is, such a thin diameter and 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:47.389
 a bit thicker here is a tassel so that she 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.090
 was about the same and already 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:52.599
 street strands I will twist on such 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.599
 thick 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:33.449
 so one side is already screwed 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.659
 here we go for a couple and twist exactly 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.659
 everybody 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:05:01.820
 we all screwed all the hair 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:05.750
 kivot macaroni turned out we can 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.010
 leave basically and so they are under there 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.510
 after some time they grew a little 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.080
 fasting and will be very cool too 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.990
 to look 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.600
 that is, without touching it there sprinkle varnish and 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.090
 and still can not disassemble them 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.940
 add a little bit of volume i'm in this 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.090
 If you add a bit of volume, so varnish for 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.090
 hair 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.210
 business fear 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.509
 like about- and tilt your head down and 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:49.009
 shake hands fixed paw 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.250
 then they parted there for what 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.889
 you want which side is more simple 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.330
 by hands 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:01.940
 there let's say more on this side 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:07.990
 take so comb with large 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:12.480
 teeth and just pull up 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.480
 you can still comb your fingers like this 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.650
 we already know how to shoot down because 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.950
 my previous videos are therefore already 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:28.240
 we all really learned our contribution 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:30.760
 ready such now not even feminine 9 I 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.240
 I would say curls turned out very 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.560
 feminine and gentle and romantic 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.380
 romantic evening with such a hairstyle 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.180
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.800
 This is styling so put huskies write 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.680
