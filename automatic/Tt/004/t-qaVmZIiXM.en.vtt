no<00:03:57.980> tangling<00:03:59.570> very<00:04:00.570> light<00:04:00.870> shedding<00:04:01.470> shedding

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
no tangling very light shedding shedding

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.660 
no tangling very light shedding shedding
is<00:04:02.520> going<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.940> occur<00:04:03.300> whether<00:04:03.920> or<00:04:04.920> not<00:04:05.280> you

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
is going to occur whether or not you

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.590 
is going to occur whether or not you
still<00:04:05.970> webs

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
still webs

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.310 
still webs
so<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:08.040> feel<00:04:08.730> like<00:04:08.760> sealing<00:04:09.570> webs<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:09.990> just<00:04:10.230> a

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
so I feel like sealing webs is just a

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.120 
so I feel like sealing webs is just a
preventive<00:04:10.860> measure<00:04:11.300> it<00:04:12.300> can<00:04:12.570> help<00:04:12.750> reduce

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
preventive measure it can help reduce

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.860 
preventive measure it can help reduce
shedding<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.610> it's<00:04:14.760> not<00:04:15.060> gonna<00:04:15.330> stop

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870
