actually connect that just kind of like

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.179 
actually connect that just kind of like
rest<00:01:24.540> together<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.229> when<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.429 
to simulate the ripping off of the shirt
that<00:01:29.610> hogan<00:01:29.880> always<00:01:30.090> used<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that hogan always used to do and on the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
that hogan always used to do and on the
back<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> slits<00:01:32.939> across

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
back it has like the slits across

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.410 
back it has like the slits across
because<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:33.810> torn<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.950> um<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.400> kind<00:01:36.329> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
because it was torn but um I kind of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.660 
because it was torn but um I kind of
like<00:01:36.600> how<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.439> did<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.040> think<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> old

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
like how they did this I think the old

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
like how they did this I think the old
Jack's<00:01:38.970> version<00:01:39.360> did<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> Velcro

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
Jack's version did it with a Velcro

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.960 
Jack's version did it with a Velcro
strip<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> front<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.729> could<00:01:41.820> actually

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
strip in the front so it could actually

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.880 
strip in the front so it could actually
like<00:01:42.270> tear<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.110> stay<00:01:43.320> shut<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
like tear but it would stay shut it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.020 
like tear but it would stay shut it
would<00:01:43.979> stay<00:01:44.130> fastened<00:01:45.590> honestly<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.799> don't

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
would stay fastened honestly I don't

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.980 
would stay fastened honestly I don't
prefer<00:01:48.030> either<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.780> they're<00:01:48.899> both

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
prefer either one I think they're both

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.870 
prefer either one I think they're both
pretty<00:01:49.110> good<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.530> what<00:01:49.560> they<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.759> he<00:01:50.759> also

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
pretty good for what they are he also

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.389 
pretty good for what they are he also

it's on the figure so there you can see
what<00:02:06.990> i<00:02:07.020> mean<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:08.459> would<00:02:08.580> think

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
what i mean it's like you would think

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.460 
what i mean it's like you would think
that<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.030> would<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.599> front<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.349> it's

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
that this would be in the front but it's

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.570 
that this would be in the front but it's
off<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.770> side<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.340> knot<00:02:11.550> is

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
off to the side and then the knot is

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.990 
off to the side and then the knot is
over<00:02:11.879> here<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.959> actually<00:02:13.319> accurate

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
over here this is actually accurate

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.370 
over here this is actually accurate
the<00:02:15.000> representation<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.870> Hogan<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.230> we're

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
the representation of Hogan that we're

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.050 
the representation of Hogan that we're
getting<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.860> figure<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.819> doesn't

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
getting in this figure so it doesn't

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.090 
getting in this figure so it doesn't
bother<00:02:18.150> me<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.569> mean<00:02:18.920> aesthetically<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> would

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
bother me I mean aesthetically I would

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.170 
bother me I mean aesthetically I would
have<00:02:20.190> preferred<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> little<00:02:21.060> more

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
have preferred it to be a little more

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.309 
have preferred it to be a little more
centered<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:21.660> I'm<00:02:21.780> sure<00:02:21.930> we'll<00:02:21.959> get<00:02:22.200> plenty

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
centered but I'm sure we'll get plenty

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.840 
centered but I'm sure we'll get plenty
of<00:02:22.500> other<00:02:22.650> Hogan's<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.190> centered<00:02:23.459> bandana

you<00:03:38.880> take<00:03:38.910> out<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.299> bandana<00:03:39.690> there's<00:03:40.019> a

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
you take out the bandana there's a

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.199 
you take out the bandana there's a
little<00:03:40.200> space<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.860> between<00:03:41.010> his<00:03:41.310> hair<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.790> his

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.630 
little space in between his hair and his
like<00:03:42.870> actual<00:03:43.170> face<00:03:43.500> obviously<00:03:44.250> that's<00:03:44.549> what

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
like actual face obviously that's what

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.250 
like actual face obviously that's what
the<00:03:44.700> bandana<00:03:45.060> would<00:03:45.239> slide<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.140> would

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
the bandana would slide in so it would

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.110 
the bandana would slide in so it would
stay<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.829> place<00:03:47.400> once<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.640> got<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:47.970> there

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
stay in place once you got it in there

chest<00:04:18.989> which<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.769> think<00:04:19.799> pretty<00:04:20.310> accurate

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
chest which is I think pretty accurate

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.610 
chest which is I think pretty accurate
but<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.419> think<00:04:21.840> they<00:04:21.930> have<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.080> same<00:04:22.260> arms

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
but I think they have the same arms

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.110 
but I think they have the same arms
which<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.099> perfect<00:04:23.460> because<00:04:23.490> Hogan<00:04:23.940> was

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
which is perfect because Hogan was

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.150 
which is perfect because Hogan was
really<00:04:24.360> big<00:04:24.960> in<00:04:25.140> those<00:04:25.229> days<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:26.340> seeing

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
really big in those days so seeing

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.230 
really big in those days so seeing
they<00:04:27.340> had<00:04:27.460> those<00:04:27.640> kind<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:27.970> parts

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
they had those kind of parts

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.660 
they had those kind of parts
similarities<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.800> makes<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.100> lot<00:04:30.190> of<00:04:30.250> sense<00:04:30.340> and

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
similarities it makes a lot of sense and

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.790 
similarities it makes a lot of sense and
then<00:04:31.240> height-wise<00:04:31.600> Brock<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.170> Hogan's<00:04:32.500> stand

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
then height-wise Brock and Hogan's stand

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.860 
then height-wise Brock and Hogan's stand
well<00:04:33.490> Brock's<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.790> little<00:04:34.150> shorter<00:04:34.450> than<00:04:34.570> Hogan

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
well Brock's a little shorter than Hogan

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.750 
well Brock's a little shorter than Hogan
which<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.230> also<00:04:35.410> believe<00:04:35.800> is<00:04:35.890> accurate<00:04:36.310> yeah<00:04:36.700> I

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
which I also believe is accurate yeah I

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.860 
which I also believe is accurate yeah I
think<00:04:36.970> out<00:04:37.090> of<00:04:37.120> my<00:04:37.300> personal<00:04:37.540> collection

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
think out of my personal collection

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.540 
think out of my personal collection
Brock<00:04:38.230> Lesnar<00:04:38.560> might<00:04:38.710> be<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.920> guy<00:04:39.040> who<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.280> have

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
Brock Lesnar might be the guy who I have

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.700 
Brock Lesnar might be the guy who I have
that's<00:04:39.790> most<00:04:40.180> similarly<00:04:40.900> scaled<00:04:41.230> with<00:04:41.410> Hogan

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
that's most similarly scaled with Hogan

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.560 
that's most similarly scaled with Hogan
if<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.490> want<00:04:42.640> to<00:04:42.730> go<00:04:42.820> back<00:04:43.060> with<00:04:43.210> somebody

with<00:04:57.130> Hogan<00:04:57.430> great<00:04:57.610> my<00:04:57.880> opinion<00:04:58.270> about<00:04:59.110> the

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
with Hogan great my opinion about the

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.530 
with Hogan great my opinion about the
right<00:04:59.530> height<00:04:59.560> right<00:05:00.430> size<00:05:00.700> these<00:05:01.360> two<00:05:01.510> look

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
right height right size these two look

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.480 
right height right size these two look
really<00:05:01.720> good<00:05:01.990> together<00:05:02.190> lastly<00:05:03.190> here's<00:05:03.340> what

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
really good together lastly here's what

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.620 
really good together lastly here's what
it<00:05:03.580> looks<00:05:03.700> like<00:05:03.850> next<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.180> one<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.480> more

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
it looks like next to one of the more

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.840 
it looks like next to one of the more
smaller<00:05:05.020> /<00:05:05.470> average<00:05:05.950> sized<00:05:06.130> figures<00:05:06.550> we<00:05:06.700> got

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
smaller / average sized figures we got

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.370 
smaller / average sized figures we got
Shawn<00:05:07.060> Michaels<00:05:07.420> here<00:05:07.570> this<00:05:07.810> is<00:05:07.900> my<00:05:07.990> custom

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
Shawn Michaels here this is my custom

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.980 
Shawn Michaels here this is my custom
that<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.590> showed<00:05:08.830> in<00:05:09.070> this<00:05:09.280> video<00:05:09.930> you'll<00:05:10.930> see

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
that I showed in this video you'll see

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.480 
that I showed in this video you'll see
that<00:05:11.260> he's<00:05:11.380> smaller<00:05:11.650> than<00:05:11.710> Hogan<00:05:12.100> as<00:05:12.250> well<00:05:12.460> he

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
that he's smaller than Hogan as well he

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.340 
that he's smaller than Hogan as well he
should<00:05:12.610> be<00:05:12.820> thinner<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.630> little<00:05:13.690> leaner

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
should be thinner a little leaner

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.000 
should be thinner a little leaner
whereas<00:05:14.980> Hogan<00:05:15.280> is<00:05:15.370> bigger<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.180> bulkier<00:05:16.450> and

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
whereas Hogan is bigger and bulkier and

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.490 
whereas Hogan is bigger and bulkier and
I<00:05:18.060> think<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.150> works<00:05:19.300> you<00:05:19.750> know<00:05:19.870> Shawn<00:05:20.140> Michaels

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
I think it works you know Shawn Michaels

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.680 
I think it works you know Shawn Michaels
