00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.759
 I want to work in this video 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.299
 on statics module s 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.019
 110 Waltz 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.390
 Education agents 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.999
 pull it and shield it 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.199
 we are working here with a well-dimensioned and the first city council 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.519
 Mountain of steel 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.009
 since Tijuca was included 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.359
 in the following so the anchoring of the reasonable 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.359
 be detected on a wooden handle 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.200
 we will see 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.770
 in Loket new position 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.180
 the module production construction 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.460
 Euro and the guy 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460
 110 with 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.250
 because from 1 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 after position number and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 have been forgiven 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.090
 Information required as a guide in the chapter Material who fast 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.420
 There are also components here and Megan Build Series 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.860
 where always that in addition to the main place Heidrich connection module is connected 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.120
 the main component is 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.450
 a support made of softwood today 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.600
 Strength classes 10 24 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.520
 for the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.390
 Son while we go through 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.060
 the main orchestra is not taken into account and the wall intervals 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 Longitudinal direction of the Wartburg circle will not be decisive 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.510
 Eg be hailed equal 15 centimeters 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.080
 it is a 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.340
 Dahl plate that while in the 35 with the dimensions 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.579
 l equal to 16 centimeters b equal to one centimeter 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:01:59.320
 and 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 a equal to ten inches 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.320
 The entries continue with chapter Connection means 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.889
 as liaison man of today 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.479
 of the type 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.799
 it's fun 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.999
 0 May 80 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.420
 Picture we enter with two screws 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.279
 rla and one 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:23.969
 Screws vertical direction as well as the edge distances a1 equal to 80 millimeters 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.969
 and branch with 60 mm before 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.389

 hindering no effect Kuka St and Bucher b 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.729
 Chapter impact we put the 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.729
 on during the appropriate typing 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.399
 and Beck are entering the load 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.759
 he cuts sizes to us a three-part load way to input 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.719
 ready 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.249
 characteristic forces per action we get at position SWO 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.819
 in the chapter Results 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.329
 Poor, we can turn off the forces for easy and pull out 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.439
 take over and do not mix these by hand 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.649
 Scheer Forces Epics we take over the situation 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:29.649

 Mr. Reaction RTX occupied 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.409
 but in the chapter proves 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.569
 is it possible by 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.339
 casual excess small excess in the evidence too 

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:00.349
 tolerate 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.610
 this shows us the 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.080
 system 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.080
 Loads up to the evidence 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.449
 in the chapter of the measurement 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.189
 Load capacity 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.189
 because the carrying capacities are determined and documented 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.150
 the leadership team seven chapters 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
 IZA core state of carrying capacity

 Orban Sparks Agreement Holtmann 80 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.789
 Reutlingen load at 61 percent capacity 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.620
 Lohse to Action is thus proven
