times<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.520> included<00:01:48.060> more<00:01:48.270> rods<00:01:48.570> than

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
times we have included more rods than

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780 
times we have included more rods than
what<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.200> needed<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.799> basic<00:01:50.220> triangulation

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
what is needed for a basic triangulation

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.100 
what is needed for a basic triangulation
kit<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.299> sometimes<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.870> need<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
kit because sometimes you need the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
kit because sometimes you need the
longer<00:01:52.260> rods<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.799> need<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.010> shorter<00:01:53.280> rods<00:01:53.460> so

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
longer rods or need the shorter rods so

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.120 
longer rods or need the shorter rods so
we<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.210> included<00:01:54.600> them<00:01:54.690> in<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.870> price<00:01:55.130> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
we have included them in the price that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.350 
we have included them in the price that
way<00:01:56.250> everything<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.390> need<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.690> right<00:01:57.720> there

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
way everything you need is right there

getting<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.970> lot<00:02:06.150> more<00:02:06.420> than<00:02:06.570> than<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:07.170> you

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
getting a lot more than than what you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.859 
getting a lot more than than what you
would<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> imagine<00:02:08.519> so<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:09.509> take<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.750> in

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
would you imagine so just take that in

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
would you imagine so just take that in
mind<00:02:10.080> there's<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.159> great<00:02:11.340> view<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.610> suction

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
mind there's a great view of the suction

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.390 
mind there's a great view of the suction
cup<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.810> rod<00:02:12.989> attached<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:14.099> take

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
cup with the the rod attached just take

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.879 
cup with the the rod attached just take
off<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.670> Acorn<00:02:14.969> nut<00:02:15.120> put<00:02:16.019> on<00:02:16.139> the<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.709> grip

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:16.889 
off the Acorn nut put on the the grip

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:17.880 
off the Acorn nut put on the the grip
head<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.279> then

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
head and then

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.260 
head and then
screw<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> 1/4<00:02:18.460> nut<00:02:18.550> back<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:18.850> making<00:02:19.240> sure

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
screw the 1/4 nut back on making sure

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.750 
screw the 1/4 nut back on making sure
that<00:02:19.390> nothing<00:02:19.750> falls<00:02:19.930> off<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.440> future<00:02:20.760> and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
that nothing falls off in the future and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.070 
that nothing falls off in the future and
again<00:02:22.060> there's<00:02:22.240> two<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.660> those

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
again there's two of those

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.420 
again there's two of those
so<00:02:23.290> really<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.950> don't<00:02:24.069> have<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.250> worry<00:02:24.370> about

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
so really you don't have to worry about

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:34.199 
so really you don't have to worry about
anything<00:02:31.230> as<00:02:32.230> for<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> camera<00:02:33.580> mount<00:02:33.760> we

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
anything as for the camera mount we

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.910 
anything as for the camera mount we
found<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.570> if<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.690> secure<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.440> table

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
found that if you secure it to a table

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.370 
found that if you secure it to a table
of<00:02:36.070> some<00:02:36.220> sort<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.670> then<00:02:37.209> add<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.600> camera<00:02:37.870> to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
of some sort and then add the camera to

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.130 
of some sort and then add the camera to
the<00:02:38.410> mount<00:02:38.800> it's<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.610> lot<00:02:40.030> easier<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.720> if<00:02:40.930> you

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
the mount it's a lot easier that if you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.680 
the mount it's a lot easier that if you
get<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.380> lot<00:02:41.590> more<00:02:41.620> secure<00:02:42.070> fit<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.480> you're

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
get a lot more secure fit and you're

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:58.530 
get a lot more secure fit and you're
safer

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.910 

now<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.600> have<00:02:59.810> almost<00:03:00.050> like<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.290> tripod<00:03:00.740> you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
now you have almost like a tripod you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.350 
now you have almost like a tripod you
know<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.160> can<00:03:01.340> set<00:03:01.490> everything<00:03:01.580> out<00:03:01.820> on<00:03:01.970> top

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
know you can set everything out on top

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.180 
know you can set everything out on top
there's<00:03:02.660> your<00:03:02.840> shoe<00:03:03.020> mount<00:03:03.170> with<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.500> rod<00:03:03.680> it

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
there's your shoe mount with the rod it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.070 
there's your shoe mount with the rod it
comes<00:03:04.400> with<00:03:04.520> two<00:03:04.700> grip<00:03:05.240> heads<00:03:05.420> on<00:03:05.600> top<00:03:05.780> already

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
comes with two grip heads on top already

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.890 
comes with two grip heads on top already
that<00:03:06.680> way<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:06.800> did<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.220> slide<00:03:07.520> it<00:03:07.670> on<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.090> you're

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.750 
that way I did is slide it on and you're
ready<00:03:09.020> to<00:03:09.170> go<00:03:09.290> with<00:03:10.070> your<00:03:10.250> camera

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.100 

the<00:03:13.760> rods<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.180> teeny-weeny<00:03:14.570> grip<00:03:14.780> heads<00:03:14.990> are

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
the rods and teeny-weeny grip heads are

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.480 
the rods and teeny-weeny grip heads are
just<00:03:15.290> as<00:03:15.440> easy<00:03:15.590> as<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.860> larger<00:03:16.100> models<00:03:16.370> so

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
don't worry about that they operate just

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:34.330 
don't worry about that they operate just
the<00:03:19.820> same<00:03:32.620> secure<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.709> down<00:03:33.740> that<00:03:34.160> way<00:03:34.280> you

it's<00:04:37.610> gonna<00:04:37.700> be<00:04:37.790> a<00:04:37.820> big<00:04:38.000> pain<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.240> try<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:38.690> you

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
it's gonna be a big pain to try and you

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.590 
it's gonna be a big pain to try and you
know<00:04:39.740> focus<00:04:40.100> on<00:04:40.220> anything<00:04:40.370> else<00:04:40.550> also<00:04:41.180> if

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.960 
have to stay in the car for a while
because<00:04:44.930> once<00:04:45.440> you<00:04:45.560> triangulate<00:04:46.490> this<00:04:46.790> thing

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
because once you triangulate this thing

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.270 
because once you triangulate this thing
against<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.750> windshield<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:49.010> no<00:04:49.100> longer

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
against the the windshield you no longer

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.550 
against the the windshield you no longer
can<00:04:49.550> open<00:04:49.790> that<00:04:49.880> door<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.780> rods<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.320> know

can open that door the rods you know
they're<00:04:51.740> not<00:04:51.800> flexible<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:54.770> top<00:04:55.280> rod

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
they're not flexible so the top rod

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.240 
they're not flexible so the top rod
should<00:04:55.760> be<00:04:55.850> about<00:04:56.030> 45<00:04:56.540> degree<00:04:56.780> angle<00:04:57.160> you<00:04:58.160> know

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
should be about 45 degree angle you know

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.630 
should be about 45 degree angle you know
from<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.700> from<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.060> camera<00:04:59.330> itself<00:04:59.600> that<00:04:59.810> way

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
from moving around the entire idea of

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.779 
from moving around the entire idea of
the<00:05:06.620> triangulation<00:05:06.979> kit<00:05:07.250> is<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.520> keep<00:05:07.640> the

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
the triangulation kit is to keep the

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.390 
the triangulation kit is to keep the
vibrations<00:05:08.270> down<00:05:08.450> cars<00:05:09.440> like<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.800> move<00:05:09.919> a

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
vibrations down cars like to move a

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.280 
vibrations down cars like to move a
hit<00:05:10.520> bumps<00:05:10.699> and<00:05:11.000> stuff<00:05:11.060> this<00:05:11.600> is<00:05:11.780> an<00:05:11.900> easy<00:05:12.110> way

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
hit bumps and stuff this is an easy way

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.050 
hit bumps and stuff this is an easy way
of<00:05:12.470> kind<00:05:12.830> of<00:05:12.860> just<00:05:12.919> making<00:05:13.490> sure<00:05:13.580> everything's

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
of kind of just making sure everything's

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.170 
of kind of just making sure everything's
secure<00:05:14.919> again<00:05:15.919> just<00:05:16.250> push<00:05:16.430> down<00:05:16.460> firmly<00:05:17.030> on

secure again just push down firmly on
the<00:05:17.419> on<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.780> cup<00:05:17.990> itself<00:05:18.259> you<00:05:18.830> sometimes<00:05:19.190> have

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
the on the cup itself you sometimes have

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.879 
the on the cup itself you sometimes have
to<00:05:19.340> find<00:05:19.610> a<00:05:19.759> nice<00:05:20.660> fit<00:05:20.960> because<00:05:21.139> suction<00:05:21.680> cups

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
to find a nice fit because suction cups

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.010 
to find a nice fit because suction cups
require<00:05:22.430> you<00:05:22.759> know<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:23.120> entire<00:05:23.419> seal<00:05:23.750> so

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
require you know the entire seal so

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.550 
require you know the entire seal so
we've<00:05:24.259> got<00:05:24.350> a<00:05:24.380> curvaceous<00:05:25.009> car<00:05:25.250> like<00:05:25.460> this<00:05:26.210> one

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
we've got a curvaceous car like this one

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.480 
we've got a curvaceous car like this one
sometimes<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:27.650> takes<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:28.070> know<00:05:28.160> one<00:05:28.310> or<00:05:28.400> two

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
sometimes it takes you know one or two

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.710
