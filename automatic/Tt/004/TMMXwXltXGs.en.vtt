00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.519
 what 's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.889
 new video destiny today is friday 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.719
 So on seo tv on super and we go 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.400
 let's see what this I had with 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.250
 a chance spoiler accordingly 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
 already know what a Bavarian and 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.460
 Asleep asked you to let 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.490
 quite discreetly surprising from the storm 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 Here I can say yes 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.170
 would like to start something fine 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.029
 we see what are the small parts with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
 Here we look first here light 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.180
 Particle exchange two rare coins 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.399
 I get a light particle 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.050
 a little bit steep rarities sound granted 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.629
 telemetry hand wool on the telemetry 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.579
 and shotgun demetri can for one 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.290
 get five pieces and give the coin 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.059
 you lose on your leveling at the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.670
 Weapons should definitely live there 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.010
 but also at benji dunn here plasma 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.180
 then drive are vehicle upgrade 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.250
 out of the blue sparrows are you doing 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.539
 Legendary ones are fast and see if 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.610
 especially exceptions also a special one 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.930
 colored switzerland then her heavy 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 ammo should be synthesized meanwhile 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.680
 Everyone knows that here we have the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.960
 phones fourteen-saints end of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.640
 strongest helmets for the part of my 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.950
 according to internet of course 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.479
 increased melee attack tempo more 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.030
 super energy by not peter kilz and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.220
 Protection of dawn dazzles represented 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.520
 is therefore bound to the times Babbel 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.979
 maria fekter makes the opponents in pv 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.479
 as well as in the pvp blindly looks at you 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.759
 We have reviews for everyone 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.380
 my single review is done in 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.780
 The description should definitely times 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.140
 get a clear buy recommendation then 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.270
 here at the karas backbone discipline maximum 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.189
 140 is not bad light sensors 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.560
 hold grenades after placing 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.930
 longer and instead of 15 seconds almost 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.450
 30 seconds might therefore just for 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.189
 pvp on the map at some point are finally 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.229
 so mine could distribute and if you could 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.930
 everything right this is practically almost 2 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.060
 Light sensors at the same time have me 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.920
 strong and natural faster with 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.290
 special weapons to land and you have 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.210
 great energy through grenades children on 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.979
 no case underestimate here 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.200
 Simply look for the regulation 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.490
 proper skill jan before the ob 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.810
 I thought the things are not 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.190
 Absolutely the best but after that I was 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.200
 First of all, it would not have been that way now 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.929
 thought so maybe check it out 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.819
 Buy if she wants to live here 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.610
 split on intellect and strength came 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.800
 with the first dlc is also dlc 1 1 to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.989
 Increases the size of the grenade 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.910
 super energy as soon as no darkness 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.730
 turned off so cabal grows 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.530
 fallen star so not pvp opponents and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.330
 kills with nova trees reduce the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.060
 Cool down the next month bomb 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.400
 If you are on eg pva euro nova 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.930
 bomb on nine opponents then shoots 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.300
 the nova bomb immediately recharged 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.459
 the city are helmets in my opinion 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.650
 for the walk synonymous times in the review 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.220
 also the values ​​are absolute 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.560
 stable 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.050
 look there and then down here 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.970
 multi tool has the name of mine 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.209
 opinion deserves because we have 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.100
 here the radar is active and we have here 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.290
 this weapon offers a movement tempo 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.430
 thrust and fire at a very low deduction 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.840
 pressure so if you shoot and would have 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.970
 the carriers do not press down completely 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.829
 Unfortunately, the thing does not shoot 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.420
 fully automatic though the people times 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.850
 say it's good because it's a scout 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.400
 granted and no automatic win 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.390
 but everyone has to do it themselves 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.160
 I think you convinced that they 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.140
 really money will flash even the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.150
 hunters with the dancing machines and on 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.950
 agility is also the titans and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.530
 Blogs that are generally about agility 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.750
 not so good at it we are the hunters 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.600
 can get out there with a lot 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.470
 purely in the district for it and then here 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.180
 You should buy an exotic fragment 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.320
 if you finish here 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.880
 want to miss 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.860
 you'll see that down here in armor 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.280
 and weapons you need that and we have 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.989
 the exotic breast 1 gram for 23 light 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.760
 Particles get you that can the new 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.450
 dlc two breastplates for the block with 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.640
 be inside 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.890
 and he wants to have that 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.209
 superior diagrams yes so i can 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.410
 everything clearly clear here 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.790
 Buy recommendation give this 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.010
 adult there is no 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.260
 analysis because we already have everything 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.359
 reviewed accordingly, now waiting 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.799
 Do not be on an analysis all review 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.359
 in the description check the off if 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.370
 you are interested in that 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.320
 lippische there and in the sense people what 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.120
 you say to the inventory for me 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.320
 one of the best recent months on 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.150
 each case very very good because easy 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.680
 everything he agrees for the hunter is indeed 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.160
 not the best, but it still is 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.050
 so 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.540
