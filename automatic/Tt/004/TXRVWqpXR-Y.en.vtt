00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.440 
undulate it and use a little bit of you
glue<00:01:49.960> on<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.680> Eco<00:01:51.040> central<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.880> turns<00:01:52.180> into<00:01:52.360> a

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
glue on the Eco central it turns into a

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.570 
glue on the Eco central it turns into a
really<00:01:52.720> modern<00:01:53.290> contemporary<00:01:53.680> sort<00:01:54.220> of<00:01:54.340> look

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
really modern contemporary sort of look

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.920 
really modern contemporary sort of look
and<00:01:54.820> I've<00:01:54.909> added<00:01:55.090> some<00:01:55.330> of<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.540> other<00:01:55.690> types

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
and I've added some of the other types

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.200 
and I've added some of the other types
of<00:01:56.140> wire<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.680> design<00:01:57.340> as<00:01:57.549> well<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:58.000> just

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
of wire to the design as well that just

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.670 
of wire to the design as well that just
make<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.540> look<00:01:58.659> upscale<00:01:59.020> not<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.409> lot<00:01:59.650> of

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
make it look upscale not a lot of

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.860 
make it look upscale not a lot of
material<00:01:59.890> very<00:02:00.370> inexpensive<00:02:01.299> but<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.570> really

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
material very inexpensive but it really

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.870 
material very inexpensive but it really
looks<00:02:02.049> like<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:02.590> has<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.740> lot<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.070> visual<00:02:03.340> impact

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
looks like it has a lot of visual impact

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.330 
looks like it has a lot of visual impact
and<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.810> could<00:02:04.990> do<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.110> very<00:02:05.290> basic<00:02:05.590> sort<00:02:06.220> of

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
and you could do a very basic sort of

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.639 
and you could do a very basic sort of
design<00:02:06.760> as<00:02:06.970> well<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.540> just<00:02:07.930> lends<00:02:08.229> itself

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
design as well and it just lends itself

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.830 
design as well and it just lends itself
to<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.429> many<00:02:09.580> different<00:02:10.090> types<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.509> floral

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
to so many different types of floral

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.960 
to so many different types of floral
designing<00:02:11.410> look<00:02:11.860> for<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.280> Eco<00:02:12.580> central

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
designing look for the Eco central

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.430 
designing look for the Eco central
at<00:02:13.030> your<00:02:13.210> local<00:02:13.420> wholesaler<00:02:13.930> if<00:02:14.080> they<00:02:14.230> don't

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
at your local wholesaler if they don't

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440 
at your local wholesaler if they don't
have<00:02:14.620> them<00:02:14.770> available<00:02:14.980> ask<00:02:15.490> because<00:02:16.120> I'm<00:02:16.240> sure

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
have them available ask because I'm sure

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.000 
have them available ask because I'm sure
they<00:02:16.570> could<00:02:16.750> order<00:02:16.930> them<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.770> think

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
they could order them in and I think

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.830 
they could order them in and I think
you'll<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> lot<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.030> options<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.750> your

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
you'll have a lot of options in your

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.450 
you'll have a lot of options in your
floral<00:02:20.170> design

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.520
