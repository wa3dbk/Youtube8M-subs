00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.990
 very good one more day leaves them with 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.620
 telephony 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.360
 but I think it 's these books what is 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.440
 this 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.440
 what is this 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.789
 4 s 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.480
 the back part 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.880
 what will it be 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.770
 the children to say it somehow 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.150
 demanding 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.760
 is Maria 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.050
 yes i have an iphone 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 we have everything enough 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.200
 the price of 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.200
 yes 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.730
 as one and so on and I know that I have to contribute 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.730
 it has cost me a lot more 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.250
 and on top of that, well, I had to 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.250
 conform to say it somehow 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 to buy it from a guy Castle 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 close to me 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.789
 but how good now you will see that it is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.510
 so let's go 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.820
 here you have it on the front page or in 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.190
 white gsm model that if not what 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.760
 you know the differences between the models 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.100
 what is said 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.780
 in the cdm we can not extract the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.240
 simple micro in this case yes 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.479
 and we say for more inri we have this 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.479
 behind 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.220
 so I put it 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.630
 well here we have the typical chapita 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.899
 where we are 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.560
 manuel of user of stickers like 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.560
 women and the winning hand 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.980
 the headphones that take control 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.270
 this to be able to change music that catch 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.829
 the phone and hang up and the cable quoted 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.829
 of iphone sides 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.840
 the very simple box very very reduced 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.470
 make the most of the size the truth 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.470
 and good 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.580
 it's a bit too small because neither 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.070
 will bring many things as you can see is 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.010
 very good the phone what is a bit 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.040
 this is not scratched anything has something the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.989
 little bit but the logical 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.750
 and every time I see this I like it more 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.900
 every time I see this I do not know if you can 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.900
 watch 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.380
 as you can see here steve jobs 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:44.940
 1955-2011 iphone and here 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.940
 is the face of steve jobs here 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.260
 finally people already have a and mobile 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.739
 I'm going to lower some brightness in the background 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.739
 of screen 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.250
 in depth of the phone 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.810
 I finally have it and I still do not believe 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.819
 how can you know I have this still yet what 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.230
 I'm spending and I'm going to spend 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.470
 all the possible videos of the roms and 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.629
 upload them as soon as possible so 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.480
 finally take the issue of the 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.120
 ctt skate 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.660
 Andrey 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.860
 but possibly it is that yes 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.120
 once I've made the videos of everything 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.190
 what can be done 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.989
 let's say I'll get rid of him because a 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.069
 classmate needs a mobile and 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.720
 I told him that I'm selling it to him 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.520
 because as you can see 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.520
 it's a very big phone 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.260
 that works pretty well with drones 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.180
 custom 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.799
 and that I have it in the rough even though 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.980
 it seems that you 're not a little dirty 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.310
 now 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.260
 but I have it immaculate 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.540
 but good 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.959
 you have to live in the present and see that 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.280
 we have something new so nothing dale 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.290
 al aik if you liked this little one a 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.420
 boxing and presentation of the new of the 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.420
 family and until next time
