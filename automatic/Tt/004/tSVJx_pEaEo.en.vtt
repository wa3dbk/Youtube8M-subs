00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
just stopped exercising altogether they

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.020

spiral<00:04:05.570> back<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.989> eating<00:04:06.320> unhealthy<00:04:06.830> again

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
spiral back and eating unhealthy again

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.680

and<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.340> all<00:04:07.459> goes<00:04:07.610> downhill<00:04:07.880> from<00:04:08.090> there<00:04:08.450> so<00:04:08.660> I

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
and it all goes downhill from there so I

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.780 
and it all goes downhill from there so I
think<00:04:08.930> that's<00:04:09.080> a<00:04:09.230> good<00:04:09.980> point<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.489> have

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790
