I got an issue with the eyes and the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.660 
I got an issue with the eyes and the
rest<00:03:30.020> of<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.290> face<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.860> makes<00:03:31.040> her<00:03:31.220> look<00:03:31.430> like

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
rest of the face it makes her look like

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.210

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.690 
I think it's just that the circle lenses
like<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:38.930> can't<00:03:39.200> see<00:03:39.530> through<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.310> circle

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
like you can't see through the circle

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.060 
like you can't see through the circle
lenses<00:03:41.120> she<00:03:41.630> looks<00:03:41.959> like<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.230> doll<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.860> next

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070
