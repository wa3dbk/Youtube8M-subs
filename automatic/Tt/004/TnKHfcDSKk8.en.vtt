00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.620
Michael Riedel: Welcome to Name Check.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.620
I'm Michael

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.620
Riedel.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.360
My guest today is known for having a "goofy
charm and boundless energy," which you told

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.660
me before we started means it's a recipe for
getting lots of women.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.320
Is that correct?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.900
Jerry Trainor: That is incorrect.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.210
I don't do well with the ladies.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.300
I don't know where the boundless energy is
coming from.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.300
Michael: And the goofy charm?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.300
Does that deserve you, too?

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.079
Jerry: I don't have any charm and I'm very
tired all of the time.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.680
I'm like Ben Stein, apparently.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.970
Michael: Welcome, my sleepy friend Jerry Trainor
to "Name Check."

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.970
Jerry: Nice to see you.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.899
Michael: Jerry is the star and producer of
a show on Nickelodeon called "Wendell and

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:47.899
Vinnie."

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:48.899
You play Vinnie.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:49.899
Jerry: That's right.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.760
Michael: Give us a sense of what the show
is about and why is it so funny?

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.829
Is that not a softball question for you to
start?

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.320
Jerry: Why is it funny?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320
Whack!

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.949
The honest reason why it's funny is because
we have funny writers.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.030
The guy who created the show, Jay Kogen, his
resume is impressive to say the least.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.560
He wrote for "Frasier," the early days of
"The Simpsons," George Lopez, amongst many

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.140
other things and is a big ghostwriter for
movies.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.330
I got the script and at the time I was getting
ready to finish "iCarly."

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.690
I read the script and it was the funniest
thing I had read from any network.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.720
I was like, "This is the project.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.250
I don't care that I'm still with Nickelodeon.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.930
This is the project I want to do."

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.241
Nick has been great about it.

00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:42.770
It's super funny, geared more towards grown
ups.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.540
Michael: Is Nickelodeon trying to change and
become more of an adult network than the kids

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.330
network we see it as?

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Jerry: They are.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.660
They had "Nick at Nite," but now they just
want Nickelodeon to be a network that is family

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.660
friendly.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.070
It's not just kids, because their niche was
just kids.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.640
It's natural that kids grow up, they start
families of their own.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.290
You want to keep everybody in the family,
so that's their aim.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.140
Michael: We know that 30 year old adults are
totally immature, so they still look to "Nick

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.140
at Nite" for comfort food.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.140
Jerry: That's right.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.140
I'm basically playing myself.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.140
Michael: [laughs] Exactly.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.140
Right.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.180
When you're also the producer of a show like
"Wendell and Vinnie," how much power and influence,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.269
as the producer, do you have over the writers?

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.269
They send you jokes.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.900
Can you say, "No, not funny enough.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.900
Back to the typewriter"?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.790
Jerry: I'm not that mean about it.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.290
I'm not like, "Not funny.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.129
Back to the drawing board, writer monkey."

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.240
Michael: That's what Johnny Carson used to
be like.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.260
Jerry: I would never, no.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.280
I would never just because they are brilliant,
but...

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.850
Michael: How do you convey that you're just
not [a] happy face?

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.850
Jerry: You do that face.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.850
You don't even have to say it.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.850
You do the face you just made.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.450
You go like this, and they go, "OK, nevermind.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.450
What about this?

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.959
What about this?" and you go, "This is hilarious."

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.599
That's my favorite part of the show, because
we shoot in front of a live audience.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.909
My favorite part of doing live audience sitcom
is when we've done two takes.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:03.909
We've got it.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.659
We've got it how it's written, and then they
come up and they have pages of alts for like,

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:22.269
"What about instead of saying this, you say
this?"

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:34.760
Michael: Yes, you 
had some training in college as an actor,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.909
and if you're doing these in front of a live
audience, it's like doing a little play, isn't

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:38.909
it?

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.430
Jerry: It takes me right back.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.719
I've always wanted...

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.719
Here's the thing.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:43.719
Ever since I was a kid...

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:49.450
I grew up watching "Family Ties," "The Cosby
Show," and this show is very much a throwback

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.920
to that because nowadays we have comedy that's
so niche and personal.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.249
I like "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.819
I like "Big Bang Theory."

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.790
We don't have the same sense of humor, then,
so I know what type of person you are.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.659
Whereas when we were growing up, everybody
watched these shows and it wasn't a kids show.

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.060
Michael: I'm a little older than you are.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.840
The shows that I grew up on were "Mary Tyler
Moore" and the great "Bob Newhart" Show.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.919
Jerry: I loved, not the "Bob Newhart Show,"
but "Newhart" I loved.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.290
Michael: But again, those were shows that,
because there were only three or four networks,

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.360
everybody was watching.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.139
Now you can just keep slicing the audience
and say, "We're going to appeal to people

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.030
who are 18 to 25 and that's it."

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.040
Jerry: Why could those shows be brilliant
without being incredibly offensive and still

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.430
be fun for everybody?

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.430
Michael: I would argue, too.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.430
I was only a kid.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.290
I was, what, 10 or 11 when I was watching
"The Bob Newhart Show," which was not for

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.290
10 or 11 year olds.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.290
Jerry: Not at all.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.100
Michael: I would rather watch something as
good as that.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.320
Not necessarily get all the jokes, but see
really good writing as a young kid and absorb

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320
that.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320
Jerry: Yeah, you absorb it.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.320
Michael: Rather than being written down to.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.320
Jerry: Exactly.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.940
That's the thing.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:05.310
When people ask how I keep working with kids
and how did I fall into that and why am I

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.810
good at that?

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.229
It's for that reason, because I remember when
I was a kid.

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:16.030
I didn't need to get everything on every level,
but I understood what the grownups were saying

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.880
and I understood, instinctually, why something
was funny.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.550
Michael: And you also learn rhythm and timing,
which is the essence of comedy, too.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.159
You watch "Bob Newhart" at work on anything.

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.900
I don't care if you're 10 years old, you take
a pause like that and take a longer pause

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.120
and the laugh is going to be better.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.759
Jerry: And just the dry Ã‰ the look like he's
thinking.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:45.080
You can see where other comedic greats like
Will Ferrell get so much of that, "I'm bewildered

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.080
but..."

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.080
You know what I mean?

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.599
Michael: Carson's great strength always was
he said, "You know, my talent is I react well."

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.669
You have Don Rickles on the "Carson Show"
and let him fly.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.479
Then you just cut to Johnny and all Johnny
has to do is move the pencil or something

00:05:58.479 --> 00:05:59.730
like that and get a laugh.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.940
Rickles is working his tail off to try to
get the laugh.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.759
You said that Nickelodeon is growing up a
little.

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:11.139
Do you worry for your own career of getting
typecast in these family friendly things?

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.760
Is there a darker side to Jerry Trainor that
has to come out as an actor at some point?

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.139
Jerry: Yes, I have a script that I've written.

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:25.110
It's about a transsexual drug dealer on the
edge of humanity that I'm shopping right now

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.110
and nobody's buying...

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.110
Michael: It's based on your early years?

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.800
Jerry: Yeah, my early days.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.680
I don't...

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.470
Typecast, schmipecast.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.520
That's what I say.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.289
Do what you love and this is what I love to
do.

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.289
I saw a documentary.

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:43.069
This is a weird non sequitur but this Foo
Fighters documentary about Dave Grohl and

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.490
how he transitioned.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.720
He says this great thing that I'm going to
paraphrase.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.639
When he transitioned from Nirvana and he created
the Foo Fighters, he was like, "People really

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.659
resented me for doing a new rock band, but
what do you want me to make?

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:56.220
A jazz record?

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.220
This is what I do.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.259
I'm a rocker and this is what I want to do."

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.610
When I read the script it was what I wanted
to do.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.550
It was like, "Yes, that thought crosses my
mind.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.550
Oh, will people..."

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.170
Michael: You're always going to be entertainment
for kids.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.170
Jerry: Yes.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.340
"Will I only be this, or will I only be that?"

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.259
I'm like, "Well, if this is what I want to
do then I'm happy being this."

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.979
Michael: If things don't work out, I'm sure
you'll be available for birthday parties,

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.280
right, since kids love you.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280
Jerry: That's right.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280
Michael: Always remember...

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280
Jerry: That's right, Michael.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.280
Thank you.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.830
And I also don't want to force myself into
being like, "Well, I have to do this gritty

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.360
role just to prove that I can do it."

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.060
I'd rather it happen organically, when the
time is right.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.500
Michael: You'll become a transvestite naturally.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.500
Jerry: That's right.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.500
Michael: I understand.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.500
Jerry: I'm very method.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.500
I'll go through the operation.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.500
Michael: All right.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.970
Jerry Trainor, lovely chatting with you.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.159
The show is called "Wendell and Vinnie" on
Nickelodeon.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.159
Good luck with it.

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:46.159
Jerry: Thank you so much.

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:47.500
Michael: If you're back in town, swing by
and we'll have another chat.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.500
Jerry: Absolutely.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.500
Michael: I'm Michael Reidel and you've been
watching "Name Check."

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.500
Jerry: Bye.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.502
Michael: Bye.
