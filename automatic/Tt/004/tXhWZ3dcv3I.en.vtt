so<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.920> are<00:00:14.009> going<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.490> launch<00:00:14.670> an<00:00:14.880> application

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
so we are going to launch an application

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.700 
so we are going to launch an application
using<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.980> shortcut<00:00:17.400> or<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:19.080> can<00:00:19.320> also<00:00:21.500> we<00:00:22.500> can

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
using a shortcut or we can also we can

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:33.010 
using a shortcut or we can also we can
also<00:00:24.949> launch<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.220> from<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> stop<00:00:26.820> many

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.540 

we<00:00:33.680> can<00:00:34.059> we<00:00:35.059> see<00:00:35.360> here<00:00:36.140> are<00:00:36.649> few<00:00:36.980> options<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.480> we

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
we can we see here are few options so we

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.910 
we can we see here are few options so we
are<00:00:40.550> going<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.480> burn<00:00:42.610> in<00:00:43.610> this<00:00:43.879> case<00:00:44.120> burn<00:00:44.449> or

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
are going to burn in this case burn or

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.299 
are going to burn in this case burn or
music<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.699> we<00:00:46.850> select<00:00:47.269> it<00:00:47.480> simply<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:48.559> now<00:00:49.250> we

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
music so we select it simply and now we

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:57.069 
music so we select it simply and now we
see<00:00:51.190> that<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.250> can<00:00:52.640> make<00:00:52.879> an<00:00:53.260> audio<00:00:54.260> CD<00:00:54.860> or<00:00:56.079> this

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
see that we can make an audio CD or this

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.200 
see that we can make an audio CD or this
CD<00:00:57.530> is<00:00:57.710> going<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.309> use<00:00:58.519> on<00:00:58.850> regular<00:00:59.449> CD<00:01:00.229> player

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
CD is going to use on regular CD player

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.760 
CD is going to use on regular CD player
we<00:01:02.210> can<00:01:02.479> also<00:01:02.870> make<00:01:03.290> an<00:01:03.500> mp3<00:01:04.690> disc<00:01:05.690> which<00:01:06.530> will

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
we can also make an mp3 disc which will

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.290 
we can also make an mp3 disc which will
be<00:01:07.000> accessible<00:01:08.000> in<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.420> variety<00:01:10.030> mp3<00:01:11.030> players

and but in this case we are we are going

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.160 
and but in this case we are we are going
to<00:01:19.610> make<00:01:20.170> only<00:01:21.170> data<00:01:22.039> backup<00:01:22.580> of<00:01:22.820> mp3<00:01:23.539> files<00:01:23.869> so

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
to make only data backup of mp3 files so

to write here something else in this

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.770 
to write here something else in this
case<00:02:14.920> I'll<00:02:15.220> put<00:02:15.460> two<00:02:16.120> put<00:02:16.720> here<00:02:17.110> called<00:02:17.980> stream

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
case I'll put two put here called stream

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.420 
case I'll put two put here called stream
gods<00:02:19.780> pan<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:24.690> what<00:02:25.690> we<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.140> do<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.680> simply

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
gods pan and what we can do is simply

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.790 
gods pan and what we can do is simply
clicking<00:02:27.880> on<00:02:28.180> Add<00:02:28.390> button<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.900> add<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.440> files

or this or these selected ones in this

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.509 
or this or these selected ones in this
case<00:03:06.760> I'm<00:03:07.060> going<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.480> add<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.049> whole<00:03:08.079> folder<00:03:08.739> I

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.789 

can<00:03:13.739> just<00:03:14.739> add<00:03:14.950> one<00:03:15.340> or<00:03:16.209> two<00:03:16.239> folders<00:03:16.900> all<00:03:17.170> but

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
can just add one or two folders all but

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.000 
can just add one or two folders all but
in<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.159> case<00:03:18.430> I'm<00:03:18.700> going<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.200> add<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.980> whole

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
in this case I'm going to add the whole

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.610 
in this case I'm going to add the whole
ball<00:03:21.940> CD<00:03:22.359> so<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.290> will<00:03:23.680> list<00:03:23.859> it<00:03:24.069> once<00:03:24.280> more<00:03:24.579> I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
ball CD so I will list it once more I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.649 
ball CD so I will list it once more I
will<00:03:26.620> select<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:27.069> folder<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.760> consequently

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
will select this folder and consequently

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:39.990 
will select this folder and consequently
add<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.750> all<00:03:33.510> finish<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:35.760> here<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:39.250> the

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
add that is all finish and here is the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.319 
add that is all finish and here is the
indicator<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.720> capital<00:03:41.349> capacity<00:03:42.099> so<00:03:42.549> now

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
indicator of capital capacity so now

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.069 
indicator of capital capacity so now
this<00:03:43.659> means<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.590> debt<00:03:45.220> will<00:03:45.670> be<00:03:46.079> fitting

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
this means that the debt will be fitting

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.539 
this means that the debt will be fitting
on<00:03:47.769> a<00:03:47.799> CD<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:50.250> approximately<00:03:51.250> 1

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
on a CD and approximately 1

00:03:51.549 --> 00:04:00.780 
on a CD and approximately 1
approximately<00:03:53.879> 1<00:03:56.940> approximately<00:03:58.019> 1/3<00:03:59.790> is
