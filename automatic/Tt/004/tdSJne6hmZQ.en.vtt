the fire break base base you probably
can't<00:00:55.850> see<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.089> crate<00:00:56.390> there<00:00:56.570> but<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:57.019> base

can't see the crate there but the base

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.430 
can't see the crate there but the base
is<00:00:57.859> actually<00:00:58.100> all<00:00:58.460> swamped<00:00:59.059> and<00:00:59.300> that<00:01:00.170> makes

is actually all swamped and that makes

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.259 
is actually all swamped and that makes
sure<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:00.679> the<00:01:01.010> logs<00:01:01.460> when<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:01.819> put<00:01:01.999> them<00:01:02.149> in

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
sure that the logs when you put them in

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.939 
sure that the logs when you put them in
there<00:01:02.449> will<00:01:02.749> never<00:01:02.929> roll<00:01:03.230> forward<00:01:03.710> against

there will never roll forward against
the<00:01:04.100> glass<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:04.850> therefore<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.330> she's<00:01:05.540> always

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
the glass so therefore that she's always

the glass so therefore that she's always
full<00:01:06.140> protecting<00:01:06.740> your<00:01:06.860> glass<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:07.759> that<00:01:07.790> it

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
full protecting your glass so that it

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.280 
full protecting your glass so that it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
models in this range so we have FB one

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.600 
models in this range so we have FB one
here<00:01:48.730> which<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.660> six<00:01:49.870> cups<00:01:50.200> they<00:01:51.130> do<00:01:51.280> FB

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
here which is the six cups they do FB

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
now do the FB 3 which is an 18 volts

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.990 
now do the FB 3 which is an 18 volts
again<00:01:56.200> every<00:01:56.710> single<00:01:56.740> stove<00:01:57.160> available<00:01:57.850> in

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
the door but you still require at the

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.500 
the door but you still require at the
heat<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.500> still<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.100> room<00:03:03.280> then<00:03:04.269> that

heat to still in that room then that

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.539 
heat to still in that room then that
would<00:03:04.630> be<00:03:04.750> perfect<00:03:05.140> for<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:06.340> can

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
would be perfect for you you can

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.940 
would be perfect for you you can
obviously<00:03:06.700> have<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.360> door<00:03:07.870> on<00:03:08.110> both<00:03:08.350> sides<00:03:08.620> so

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950
