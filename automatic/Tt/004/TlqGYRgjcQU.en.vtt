pretty surreal I'm still you know
ultimately<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.899> incredible<00:00:36.899> feeling

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
ultimately it was a incredible feeling

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.160 
ultimately it was a incredible feeling
I'm<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.340> supporting<00:00:38.820> cast<00:00:39.079> for<00:00:40.079> my

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I'm just a supporting cast for my

I'm just a supporting cast for my
teammates<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> fans<00:00:41.100> my<00:00:41.399> parents<00:00:41.730> being

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
teammates to the fans my parents being

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.700 
teammates to the fans my parents being
down<00:00:42.090> there<00:00:42.270> inside<00:00:42.570> line<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> mean<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.620> was

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
down there inside line so I mean it was

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.900 
down there inside line so I mean it was
a<00:00:43.770> memorable<00:00:43.950> moment<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.640> something<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
a memorable moment and something that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.720 
a memorable moment and something that
always<00:00:45.450> being<00:00:45.840> my<00:00:45.930> memories<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
always being my memories and as the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.369 
always being my memories and as the
dual-threat<00:00:48.030> quarterback<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.020> around<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
dual-threat quarterback you around the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
dual-threat quarterback you around the
ball<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.770> much<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.219> pass<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.670> how<00:00:50.910> does<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
ball as much as you pass it how does it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.459 
ball as much as you pass it how does it
feel<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.750> do<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> spread

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
feel when you do that in a spread

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.100 
feel when you do that in a spread
offense<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:53.100> might<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.690> creates<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
offense I might think that it creates a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380 
offense I might think that it creates a
balance<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.649> think<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.340> keeps<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.730> defense<00:00:57.210> on

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
balance I think it keeps the defense on

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.420 
balance I think it keeps the defense on
edge<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> ultimately<00:00:58.530> gives<00:00:59.100> us<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
edge and ultimately gives us the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.040 
edge and ultimately gives us the
advantage<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.510> something<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.960> we

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
advantage so it's something that we

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.470 
advantage so it's something that we
implemented<00:01:01.500> when<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.680> got<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.480> its

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
implemented when we got here and its

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.670 
implemented when we got here and its
continued<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> work<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.320> progress<00:01:04.470> for

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
continued to be a work in progress for

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.000 
continued to be a work in progress for
us<00:01:05.510> you<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.630> Dad<00:01:06.840> both<00:01:06.869> Sweeney<00:01:07.350> had<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> salute

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.320 
us you and Dad both Sweeney had a salute
during<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.430> game<00:01:08.610> did<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.909> mean<00:01:09.119> anything

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
