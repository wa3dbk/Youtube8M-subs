00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.340
 I run for days like yesterday and when I say 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.289
 yesterday I mean a specific date to 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.420
 an intimate and mysterious time five 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.019
 thousand series a blessed competition 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.400
 by the stars with ideal happy ending 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.619
 implausible beyond their own 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.270
 limits to the session where the difficult is 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.789
 It makes it easy for you to achieve what 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.340
 customarily unattainable mind and you stay 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.219
 at peace with yourself only for that 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.780
 moment I'm hooked on the sport and 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.359
 when I speak in the first person I do not speak 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.069
 of me but half of him of anyone who 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.989
 with an invisible plan tattooed on their 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:42.429
 viscera starts running from all that 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.620
 that knows the satisfaction of duty 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.329
 compliment of the conquered brand that 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.280
 we only care about ourselves but 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.870
 that radiates so much light around 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.449
 our pronounced these words 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.039
 thinking of you in me in the sweat that 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.839
 crown the front of the factions 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.909
 smiling and sharp that sculpts 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.429
 let's put a freshly made far lick 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.079
 few seconds better than expected in 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.239
 tribute to that day of effort in 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.610
 fullness of intact forces who 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.500
 I knew why the average of 405 per 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.000
 km transforms one day in three minutes 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.040
 long 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.100
 that for the case does not matter because the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.320
 transit from 4 to 3 as from 5 to 4 is 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.330
 gigantic when done fluently and 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.610
 when the legs ask for it and the system 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.350
 Cardiovascular disease is granted when you 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.880
 body works like the body of a 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.180
 athlete of higher level than 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.979
 you really are not a mirage all 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.020
 the runners we have the certainty that 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.300
 the day h exists because we have lived it 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.790
 sometime in life and if not what 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.340
 we will live we know the existence of that 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.320
 trance even before you find it to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.270
 the evidence I refer to, we look for it in the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.369
 feelings of each morning between the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.740
 Thickness of overloads that receive us 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.119
 the rise of the bed and give as 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.610
 the tendons that repeat and the 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.440
 joints cross every dawn 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.080
 we hope that this 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.450
 just be the date to run as 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.490
 never and although it is not and even if you know 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.020
 that is not it explores your organism and they go 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.030
 passing the hours until the time of 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.009
 fit shoes instinctively 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.750
 you keep looking for signs of a 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.429
 magical confluence of motivation 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.129
 physiology and form 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.989
 then the normal thing is to become disabused in the 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.599
 heating and get the monkey slaughter 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.730
 I started joaquin that years go by until 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.739
 find the instant often 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.500
 while the crossing in the desert lasts 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.569
 the boredom spreads and we want the session 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.090
 finish as soon as possible due to fatigue 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.730
 Foster foster said to be athlete is to be 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.829
 all day tired well because the world 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.989
 real cancels the enjoyment and forces you to 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.730
 empar and give insipid sessions between the 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.060
 work schedule and obligations 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.769
 domestic and so the seasons and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.019
 we fulfill with iron will the 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.569
 plans conforming with small 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.659
 sensations canapÃ©s of the sublime moment 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.209
 of the banquet training for that 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.280
 because it 's weird because it's unique when 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.900
 comes the day of excellence you feel 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.790
 just like kissing the dance queen 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.950
 what by feeling the contact with 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.109
 clouds that crown the highest mountain in 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.599
 a hostile mountain range that's why we run 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.879
 300 days a year maybe more supporting 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.980
 the weather the stress you give up the 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.480
 disappointments for that every month of 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.000
 September at the beginning of the season 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.190
 we premiered a new broker diary 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.100
 looking for a single session 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.620
 of maximum performance with pleasure I've 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.690
 said deliberately pleasure because if 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.090
 there's something athletes know 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.870
 the slow athletes is that surrender to 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.670
 maximum 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.850
 give everything by building a project 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.370
 beautiful grants happiness and although 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.770
 that happiness is short as it will be 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.230
 intense as of deep and paradoxical the 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.480
 ability to feel of the human being that 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.630
 we suffer for years in search of 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.090
 few minutes of true happiness 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.280
 I say more the reason why you run and 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.580
 you live is to find the way 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.580
 have to overcome your best memory 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.120
 Y
