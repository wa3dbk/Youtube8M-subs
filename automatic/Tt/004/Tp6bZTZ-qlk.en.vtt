00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.699
 Hello everyone and welcome to the palace 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.080
 futuroscope congresses or comes 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.300
 to be launched right now just behind 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.289
 - the 14th edition of the gamers assembly 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.609
 then the players start to 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.900
 settle down we're going to have league of 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 legends of starcraft but what we 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.199
 interest today is call of duty 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.730
 4 modern warfare that will be played 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.289
 today it's still played a lot 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.550
 the series is very successful we are going 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.079
 have two hundred players today a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.819
 endowment of 14000 euros so it's not 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.179
 nothing is going to be the attention elsewhere of the 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:40.350
 show and it's gone from a little 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.909
 moment we are used to seeing 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.739
 call of duty competitions on 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.109
 most recent opuses such as warfare 3 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.999
 or again black ops May 2 at the gamers 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.370
 assembly we decided to do otherwise 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.260
 here only pc players and who plays 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.510
 on call of duty 4 modern warfare 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.619
 first name is not we who have 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.350
 chose call of duty 4 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:02.549
 it's call of duty 4 he chose it this 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.039
 who does not know what's going on all 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.990
 years for choosing communities we 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.850
 we have an event that can not 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.979
 accommodate more than 850 seats 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.049
 so the best solution today 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.640
 we found for to select 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.670
 Basque players to appeal to 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.229
 communities and it turns out that we have 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 had the choice between call of duty 4 that 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.530
 the goal blackhawks 2 we have everything 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.179
 simply asked on our page 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.280
 facebook to players to participate we have 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.109
 had several hundred responses from 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.530
 two sides and his passes of the ti cats which has 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:33.119
 had the community the most motivated ad 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 and the proof is that it's the most 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.950
 big work we get dressed with 40 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.229
 teams 200 players out of 850 and who 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.249
 are who are in the room 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.450
 forty teams that during the three 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.979
 days of competition were so 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.859
 confronted on an old version of 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.179
 call of and the fighting was tough at 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.069
 get out of the chicken phases we are 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.780
 are interested in the team evoked 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.210
 a team made up of old comers 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.409
 reconnect with code 4 to my team so we 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.600
 is 5/4 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.360
 so there are bombers andrÃ© 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.710
 a magulas jump Julian dreux 2 and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.450
 Sebastian their bac 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.880
 it's been a long time since we had 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.470
 saw and we came for fun of course 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.899
 we are always there for the competition 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.720
 because finally in the end it's for that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.640
 we are moving but there is really a 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.230
 bond of friendship that has been created and 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.489
 really came to meet for 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.590
 to laugh together even though the 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.880
 competition remains present 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.989
 after passing without problems 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.819
 group matches which allowed 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.380
 split the 40 teams the quarters of 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.880
 final are quietly our 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.580
 lawyers they will face the Cevennes 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.080
 a fairly young team and despite at 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.550
 contractions the evoked do 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.540
 proof during this game of a mastery 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.209
 total of the game 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.130
 these quarter-finals are played on a bo3 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.810
 included two winning maps the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.300
 search and destruction being the mode 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.680
 of play of all the competition and this 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.910
 first card sees an easy victory 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.910
 to talk about an opponent 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.910
 but little time to rest the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.120
 semi-final already point the end of his 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.920
 nose 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.840
 alas it is already the same song 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.190
 in front of them these are the team punchlines 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.900
 ultra favorite tournament 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.370
 and since it is useless to 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.120
 stress not do players decide to get 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.120
 play the color 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.590
 then begins a match where the lawyers 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.459
 they will try to save the honor without 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.970
 great success 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.970
 Sadly 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.680
 I go against those are hardly 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.090
 is different from the future 2 a defeat 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.300
 that does not prevent them from keeping a 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:52.050
 some good mood not disappointed because 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.310
 in the end I expected it and we knew 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.020
 already at the beginning we would lose in 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.209
 France she is hooked but it's not 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.980
 serious we just come for fun that's it 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.709
 a year we did not play 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.390
 well we still have old rest so we 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.250
 still hungry we do not know our first 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.590
 we have experience forever 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.690
 hung up but after what did the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.030
 difference the fact that guys guys 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.130
 opposite we play every night they have 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.540
 never stopped playing it prague 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.489
 a lot they have the team and they have 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.989
 since reading strata 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.099
 here we have been for a long time 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.289
 do not want to play we do not want to 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.710
 to take the lead to soak looking for the 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.259
 frag 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.819
 this is a game to have fun what but the 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.500
 punchline they did not come for 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:29.819
 have fun so we find them for the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.259
 finale on the central stage of the 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.360
 gamers assembly where they will confront 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.530
 the bikey these two teams that have 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.250
 encountered the day before in the final of 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.380
 winner bracket 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.789
 accordingly the punchline must 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.560
 win two cards to win the 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.960
 victory while the biking will have no 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.880
 only one and it is on strike that the 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.380
 final will be played with punchline 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:05:05.580
 that they defend very strong of the same 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:05:07.139
 digging away rabbit but like 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.699
 any final this one has reserved us 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.259
 some surprises and especially the 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:18.509
 standards come up debate that on their 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:20.659
 defense notice at 12 10 we play the ball of 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.659
 match 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:34.750
 and it's won that does not make sense 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:43.110
 opposite and victory and valerie dream son 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:43.110
 paul and paul klein so reversed 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.230
 well, it's a pleasure to win a final 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.370
 hardly face scene in a map 13 10 so 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.720
 we could not dream better for this 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.010
 final now so here's a 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.420
 beautiful nothing else to say 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.480
 we really do an attack but 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.550
 really mediocre 4.4 suite I believe 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.140
 that he sees is 4.8 and in defense 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.720
 we wake up because we know 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.950
 that we really made an attack 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.750
 ridiculous and we wake up and we arrive 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.740
 to make a comeback in game logs 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.960
 playing hyper safe 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.760
 as we say we treat you oms the treat 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.590
 it is therefore on this victory that 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.580
 finish the gamers assembly rendezvous 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.400
 next year for a new 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.910
 competition can be sure from 4 to 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.910
 esa purse
