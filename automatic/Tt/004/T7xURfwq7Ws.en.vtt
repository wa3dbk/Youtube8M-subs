00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.580
 and there dear veteran friends b coming 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.200
 in the area once again I'm bringing a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.809
 video here for people who are going to talk today 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.030
 about hands off media or hands off more 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.710
 It's the next folks there are some. 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.289
 criteria that are very important there 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.140
 with regard to the purchase and use of 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.240
 sick is the first thing you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.760
 will observe is that you should buy a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.920
 hands off limits with at least seven 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.240
 at most six good minutes and save it 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 This is the ideal time. 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.860
 if you want there is no law that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.110
 did not lenny is hurt sometimes 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.239
 you and takes as it is in play 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.790
 alone and a delay of seven, and this can be 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.010
 I can only buy with 89 news 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.110
 9 - I would consider the maximum time 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.899
 hire - did you know that this game is going to 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.460
 long you're angry and 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.809
 Carrick, you know you can do it. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 to cook a little bit in a bit 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.280
 and at the end of the game it will not 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.350
 to manage to do is to win the game 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.969
 Okay, come on then. 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.539
 the first thing cost mines how much is 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.970
 it costs 500 glove goals but 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.180
 1,550 of the reef is good for you to cover 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.490
 value of Sundays which is 2000 than 2050 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.010
 you'll have to use there at least 11 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.750
 times are right and the time it will take 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 for you to use these two times will give 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.509
 an average of 18 19 minutes is fine 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.369
 on average keep in mind that you will 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.770
 add more or less 18 minutes of time 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.150
 of use plus the six to eight minutes I go 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.890
 put 8 as an average 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.590
 for you to have done it or will be 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.420
 a total playing time of 26 minutes 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.450
 for you to have taken the value that you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.909
 spent in use of miles is fine then have 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.799
 Cement 26 minutes from the game the staff are 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.220
 public game usually from our band 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.170
 from mr there is an average of 30 more 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.450
 usually games that take 40 50 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.920
 minutes then means have plenty of space 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.409
 to be used 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.180
 here we go to the details now of how to use 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.270
 fine 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.530
 if you are playing with rivers that have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.719
 skills that do not depend on items 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.520
 example uses which does not depend on 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.430
 take damage is hard said he has a 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.740
 ticket takes damage in item 1 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.570
 is also going to have that same type of use 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.670
 that the poison that comes from the side of 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.110
 time is then this kind of item you 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.390
 will focus on what is going to focus bond 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.400
 experience is not fundamental what 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.720
 matter is gold, it's okay and I 'm not 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.180
 saying you should make videos 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.670
 I just need to give an example then 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.230
 you make use focused on gold that we want 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.910
 focus in force every time the name of the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.400
 get out of the way you're going to use it 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.590
 shouts and avoids the worst that they are 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.390
 The worst clips are written from west 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.420
 of laws that are the ones that attack from afar 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.830
 and it is the level and map clips that 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.290
 are those written smaller is okay 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.970
 so you see these two any other 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.739
 are acceptable but if you do not have 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.770
 The option you use at the same time, my 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.580
 focus is good goal if character focus 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.890
 xp 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.530
 you will always try to use us 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.300
 biggest clips of the janga option to those 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.880
 big centaur the red ounce a 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.920
 pass of the pink feathers the troll are you 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.450
 always use bigger ones if for some reason 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.640
 reason you will take a lot to 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.350
 reach the big field or your field was 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.120
 blocked there is no clip there you go in 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.430
 field in the field but you will 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.810
 look for the group c back in 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.680
 Brazil that gives more experience than 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.360
 brown group 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.400
 if it was a dog it was using alpha 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.930
 dog that bigger dog if it's the 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.760
 stone bugs use any of the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.230
 two cars are the same and on the sites 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.850
 neighbors you will use in the Azores that 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.430
 They're the biggest, it's already good, so 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.739
 always the biggest critics because 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.760
 example the large clips give 119 of 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.299
 experience 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.239
 119 foods're just multiply the cake 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.910
 broach two and half then it lay 119 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.560
 two months of almost 300 xp and this 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.980
 in the lower levels of the game by 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.810
 example and you 78 is very significant 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.190
 is this bunch of experiences and our 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.739
 much faster level 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.470
 so if your son photo afp uses us 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.299
 Larger crips there folks came though 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.299
 when you reach a certain level 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.540
 you will stop using media on the clips 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.880
 great guys what is level and takes 16 o 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.650
 most is light that is more you have 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.390
 reached the highest health potential 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.940
 usually you will not have more than one 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.829
 benefit the astronomical and within 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.840
 Experience is good 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.180
 or when you have to go the ones that form 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.100
 fast for example a vlog when already 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.230
 is wearing a lipstick fury with mexico - 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.370
 it kills very fast the clips in the bush 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.989
 it's okay the alchemist same thing 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.210
 jd to health when he was already swollen 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.760
 blade set when you already have an attack request 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.780
 Come on, he's killing everything fast there. 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.830
 I'll give you an example because I'm 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.750
 talking is good 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.669
 Goal of you most important experience 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.199
 in the front because that cake species that 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.240
 you earn almost insignificant to 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.220
 you at your level but the goal that you 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.870
 you will earn for each creep field 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.960
 for each time with your united 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.220
 is a good cost is a good benefit because 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.840
 sometimes you stop buying a book 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.090
 close an item because of 50 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.919
 sauce because of 100 of gold and this 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.690
 item is an item you place type of 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.610
 Hair you need bbb to do on 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.990
 combat is good then sometimes by 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.150
 cause of 100 goals you do not have an item 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.199
 so we have to maximize a goal 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.610
 that we are winning how it is that 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.800
 Are you going to do it like I said before? 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.180
 instead of killing large clips and 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.280
 killing the small children will give a 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.110
 example starting with the central campus 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.750
 the central campus has the field sitting with 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.520
 one has a big small clip is 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.190
 you do what you usually do is 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.590
 to use the big boy you will win 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.930
 190 Sunday goals are good 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.789
 24 more goals than massimo's goal 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.979
 of the little clip then you go 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.270
 to win a total of 214 goals and why 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.550
 because I tell you if he does not give you the 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.990
 gold clip you killed it turns 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.690
 that clip he will not have noticed 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.880
 Consolidation becomes 190 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.400
 If you do the opposite you use the 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.860
 corn in the small club that gives 24 of goal 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.990
 it will turn into 190 gold and 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.060
 if you kill the big clip in hand you 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.940
 will win 78 goals at most or 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.270
 you will see 214 win in total you 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.430
 will win 268 only in this example there you 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.650
 transformed you won more you win 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.510
 more goal is good for you then 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.449
 have an idea when you use corn 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.130
 out in six seconds each CODAU 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.940
 if you did while goals never 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.349
 as I said 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.389
 sometimes you stop closing the inter 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.889
 because of 57 goals, then the 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.990
 Think about it up front when you 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.270
 you no longer need xp you 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.669
 use coda in the best clips 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.960
 possible is the offer because to you 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.639
 maximize the amount of goals you 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.130
 will win so you get a clip that 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.720
 not fit in and use it and kills 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.380
 bigger in the hand than to gain the maximum 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.599
 goals 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.340
 so this is it I think it covers everything 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.720
 that we can talk about non-myths. 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.190
 I entered the heavy machine machine that I 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.080
 I do not think there's no need even is 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.729
 The more we put it lightly 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.099
 but that you have how to reach the 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.750
 midas potential okay if you like the 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:33.100
 Please video of jewelry and 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.140
 if you want to sign up to know when 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.970
 back new videos top corner 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.840
 right of the screen at the icon or at the end of the 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.940
 video of the name 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.590
 register that has a big one and one 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.690
 Big hug, I hope from the bottom of my heart. 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.090
 make the video useful to you and 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.090
 I see soon thanks guys and I went 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.680
 singing
