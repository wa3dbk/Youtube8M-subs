this<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.850> used<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.390> an<00:01:33.540> eight-ton<00:01:34.049> Jack<00:01:34.409> I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
this is used with an eight-ton Jack I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800 
this is used with an eight-ton Jack I
asked<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.670> would<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.850> possible<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.509> put<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
asked if it would be possible to put a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.530 
asked if it would be possible to put a
12-ton<00:01:37.409> jack<00:01:37.680> into<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
12-ton jack into this but it will not it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.899 
12-ton jack into this but it will not it
won't<00:01:39.750> fit<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.560> 12-ton<00:01:41.040> jack<00:01:41.369> gets<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.729> little

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
won't fit the 12-ton jack gets a little

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
won't fit the 12-ton jack gets a little
bit<00:01:42.150> larger<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.840> only<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.740> eight-ton<00:01:44.280> is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
bit larger so only the eight-ton is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.880 
bit larger so only the eight-ton is
going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.909> fit<00:01:45.119> into<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.380> jack<00:01:46.680> is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
going to fit into this now this jack is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.469 
going to fit into this now this jack is
just<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.399> came<00:01:47.610> from<00:01:47.820> Harbor<00:01:48.240> Freight

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
just one that came from Harbor Freight

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.920 
just one that came from Harbor Freight
very<00:01:48.930> inexpensive<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.610> price<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.659> press

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
very inexpensive the price of the press

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.999 
very inexpensive the price of the press
I<00:01:52.140> believe<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:53.119> 325<00:01:54.119> 350<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.799> lot

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
I believe is about 325 350 so it's a lot

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.609

cutting edge is centered over the RAM of
my<00:02:43.950> jack<00:02:44.340> as<00:02:44.580> well<00:02:45.360> as<00:02:45.630> within<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.740> upper

my jack as well as within the upper
platen<00:02:47.940> now<00:02:48.600> you'll<00:02:48.780> notice<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.110> this

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
platen now you'll notice that this

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.100 
platen now you'll notice that this
platen<00:02:49.920> also<00:02:50.430> does<00:02:50.610> not<00:02:50.760> come<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:51.930> that's

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
platen also does not come out so that's

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.780 
platen also does not come out so that's
one<00:02:52.440> less<00:02:52.710> piece<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.640> worry

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
one less piece that you have to worry

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.360 
one less piece that you have to worry
about<00:02:53.880> also<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.440> like<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.800> others<00:02:56.130> I'm

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
about also so just like the others I'm

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.610 
about also so just like the others I'm
going<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.150> make<00:02:57.360> certain<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.840> my<00:02:58.020> jack<00:02:58.380> is

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
going to make certain that my jack is

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.580 
going to make certain that my jack is
tight<00:02:58.920> very<00:02:59.250> tightly<00:02:59.760> closed<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:01.520> pump<00:03:02.520> it<00:03:02.670> up

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
tight very tightly closed and pump it up

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.750 
tight very tightly closed and pump it up
one<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.800> nice<00:03:04.950> things<00:03:04.980> about<00:03:05.460> that

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
one of the nice things about that

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.840 
one of the nice things about that
smaller<00:03:06.150> opening<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.470> a

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
smaller opening is that you have a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.690 
smaller opening is that you have a
little<00:03:08.850> shorter<00:03:09.180> distance<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.720> go<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.700> there

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
little shorter distance to go and there

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.570 
little shorter distance to go and there
we've<00:03:11.880> cut<00:03:12.090> through<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.570> metal<00:03:13.460> open<00:03:14.460> this

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
we've cut through that metal open this

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:22.610 
we've cut through that metal open this
up<00:03:19.100> release<00:03:20.100> our<00:03:20.310> piece<00:03:21.110> so<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.170> can<00:03:22.320> see<00:03:22.500> I've

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
up release our piece so you can see I've

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.920 
up release our piece so you can see I've
cut<00:03:22.860> through<00:03:23.040> my<00:03:23.190> metal<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.970> pop<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.420> out<00:03:24.630> I

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
cut through my metal to pop this out I

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.680 
cut through my metal to pop this out I
usually<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:25.770> take<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.010> hammer<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.690> lightly

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
usually just take a hammer and lightly

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.720 
usually just take a hammer and lightly
tap<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.590> my<00:03:32.520> piece<00:03:32.760> will<00:03:32.970> come<00:03:33.180> out<00:03:34.490> so<00:03:35.490> it's<00:03:35.640> a

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
tap and my piece will come out so it's a

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.760 
tap and my piece will come out so it's a
great<00:03:35.970> little<00:03:36.150> tool<00:03:36.540> if<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.140> think<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.590> you

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
great little tool if you think that you

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.160 
great little tool if you think that you
would<00:03:37.920> like<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.370> add<00:03:38.550> multiples<00:03:39.390> or<00:03:39.660> put<00:03:39.900> some

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
would like to add multiples or put some

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.250 
would like to add multiples or put some
kind<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.530> production<00:03:41.160> mode<00:03:41.820> into<00:03:42.420> your<00:03:42.660> pieces

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
kind of production mode into your pieces

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.740 
kind of production mode into your pieces
where<00:03:43.950> all<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.370> are<00:03:44.520> doing<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:45.030> punching<00:03:45.600> out

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
where all you are doing is punching out

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.260 
where all you are doing is punching out
the<00:03:45.780> shapes<00:03:46.230> it's<00:03:46.980> nice<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.610> versatile<00:03:48.060> it

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
the shapes it's nice and versatile it

weighs probably 10 pounds maybe 15 by
the<00:03:52.290> time<00:03:52.590> I've<00:03:52.770> got<00:03:52.800> a<00:03:52.980> jack<00:03:53.340> into<00:03:53.610> this<00:03:53.910> so

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
the time I've got a jack into this so

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.170 
the time I've got a jack into this so
it's<00:03:54.630> extremely<00:03:54.930> portable<00:03:55.650> takes<00:03:56.400> up<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.730> very

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
it's extremely portable takes up a very

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
very small footprint in the studio now

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.670 
very small footprint in the studio now
like<00:04:00.240> I<00:04:00.390> said<00:04:00.450> here<00:04:00.990> is<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.200> comparison

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
