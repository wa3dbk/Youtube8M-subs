 dominik small 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 cavani statement please good evening and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:06.729
 the coach alfred king for next 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.979
 Very well deserved two games were 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:14.440
 you better i can say so much 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:18.130
 actually no game was for us 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:22.119
 game where can you not say how 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.170
 level has come and has us 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.600
 hurt, of course 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.649
 Today, I still think that's us 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.880
 try to do something and not only 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:38.830
 fall down and accept that that 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.599
 We have a big defeat too 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.880
 home we tried to win 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:46.000
 with all the means we what we had 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 and of course I am satisfied 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.080
 We have had a difficult year 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.700
 I mean that was not optimal for us 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.679
 many injured with our squad 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.340
 players many diseases and so on 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.450
 wrestling 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.080
 That's why we play against keel 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.179
 already in a eighth-final 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.800
 Congratulations to the keel 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.560
 but I have to say that mine too 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.250
 team not only now a whole 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.550
 Season fought very hard so far 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.080
 so we can not be 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.140
 be proud out there to care but we 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.130
 can already 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:32.080
 my head up from the people 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:41.230
 go and a lot of success 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:43.970
 thank you mr good day mr families 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.180
 because you are too satisfied with the extreme 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.190
 hinspiel would have played outstanding 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.970
 and a bit harder 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.660
 You never know that by playing 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:01.910
 but can lose and then come to it 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:05.450
 the failures at facebook parties off and 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.760
 you do not have to concentrate like that 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.450
 really what would come in defense 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.140
 and offensive already included but 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.140
 but 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:26.269
 66 no matter but I think so 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.530
 despite the willingness to take risks we too 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.790
 Wanted to win the game 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.360
 have no matter what and give and gas 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.030
 also done 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.510
 the defense stood very neat 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.959
 first half was very good and only one 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.880
 which we certainly what you but 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.070
 can complain about is the opportunities arising from 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.510
 but claims alone 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.610
 different and that's why we do not have 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.420
 too high still clear but but 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.180
 we played well and deserved 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.350
 won and are very happy with it 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.320
 that we continue on facebook everything 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.760
 Good on everyone with good health board 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.940
 and wants to thank alfred in the league 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.760
 Helgert 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.440
 they said knockout matches against kiel 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.359
 that was a special situation, think 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.370
 I meet the thw so early as 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.000
 did you see it today yes absolutely 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.680
 view, we said 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.020
 We did not expect that we already 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.410
 should play here against keel after 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.510
 the final but as fourth behind group 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.670
 There were only sovereign opponents 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.130
 yes we fought that was natural 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.560
 one lies with this game in flensburg 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.170
 where we said the level never reached 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.990
 has been from our side but today 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.760
 we fought that was a great 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.650
 game that was much better ours 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.420
 page ago yes annoying but can was the 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.919
 better team that was and has 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:03.130
 thank you very much with lively tequila 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:07.960
 dominik 30 story how was it for you 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.150
 Today yes we overwhelming that such a 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.650
 spectator has behind him 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.650
 that just has that tingling again 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.990
 in addition to that led to that as well 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.410
 player remains focused one has on 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.720
 the way to the hall today before the game 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.919
 already mental problem because every 10,000 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.380
 come in and know that we are with 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.410
 But nine goals at half time lead then 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.880
 to warm up to come and this this 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.250
 to feel the atmosphere that has us 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.250
 helped players to be motivated and 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.300
 so thanks to the fans that are 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.350
 that's what we need 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.300
 of course in the return match in the quarterfinals 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:46.110

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.560

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.900
 get against facebook parties 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.400
