 fourth specialized instrumental unit 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 in endodontics the topic that I am going to read is 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.340
 the introduction in endodontics we use 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.680
 most of the instrumental 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.720
 used in the preparation of cavities 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.840
 and also some of the instruments of 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.450
 periodontics oral surgery prosthesis and

 unique designed materials and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.240
 exclusively for the preparation and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.310
 sealing the cavity thumb

 rational realization of the treatment of 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.479
 Root canal presupposes employment 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.970
 of the appropriate material in the

 dental instruments are preserved 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.200
 with advantage in sterile trays 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.460
 distinguishing between the instrumental 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 surgical and the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.979
 surgical the basic instruments not 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 surgical is made up of a part of the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.300
 necessary for the preparation of the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.369
 cavity and duct and other of the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.140
 endodontics must be organized in such 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.570
 so the instruments often 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.060
 employee is in the proximity 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.160
 immediate operator's instruments
