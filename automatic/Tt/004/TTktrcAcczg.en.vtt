 and on brembo I am really proud because 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.780
 so often I don't have to say anything 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.920
 I have trouble finding it difficult the problems with my concentration 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.240
 or for example 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.790

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.080
 graphic gold price 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.670
 I find it quite difficult to become 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.619
 with a relapse of days, busy and silent to find 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.260

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.740
 himself 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.740
 that of course also has to do with delay 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.229
 that they have difficulty osn the information we have had to note that they sometimes 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.510
 are full 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 that made me decide to have one 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.230

 bleiswijk nameplates hossend ratie 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.659
