00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.660 
like this firstly pattern like that and
then<00:04:02.150> we<00:04:02.330> trace<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.660> I<00:04:03.080> like<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.620> have<00:04:04.400> this

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
then we trace it I like to have this

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.840 
then we trace it I like to have this
thing<00:04:05.410> first<00:04:06.410> we<00:04:06.560> draw<00:04:06.800> it<00:04:06.860> we<00:04:07.310> saw<00:04:07.520> it<00:04:07.580> and

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
thing first we draw it we saw it and

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.740 
thing first we draw it we saw it and
then<00:04:08.180> we<00:04:08.810> smooth<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.670> in<00:04:10.670> this<00:04:10.940> segment<00:04:11.450> we're

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
then we smooth it in this segment we're

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.750 
then we smooth it in this segment we're
just<00:04:11.989> going<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.230> draw<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:13.900> but<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.230> then<00:04:15.760> we

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
just going to draw it but and then we

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.879 
just going to draw it but and then we
use<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.150> cutter<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.780> cut<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:19.100> shape<00:04:19.480> for<00:04:20.480> my

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
use the cutter and cut the shape for my

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.400 
use the cutter and cut the shape for my
to<00:04:21.889> go<00:04:22.070> next<00:04:22.340> thing<00:04:22.639> we<00:04:22.790> do<00:04:22.940> is<00:04:22.970> sawed<00:04:23.720> out<00:04:24.050> the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
to go next thing we do is sawed out the

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.340 
to go next thing we do is sawed out the
shape<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.010> handle<00:04:25.510> with<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:27.110> save
