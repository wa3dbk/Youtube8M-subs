00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
which I actually started burning last

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.879 
which I actually started burning last
night<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.180> isn't<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.600> this<00:04:22.200> is<00:04:22.320> innocent

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
night this isn't the this is innocent

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.850 
night this isn't the this is innocent
sundress<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:24.199> this<00:04:25.199> is<00:04:25.349> what<00:04:25.499> this<00:04:25.650> one<00:04:25.830> looks

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
sundress and this is what this one looks

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.290 
sundress and this is what this one looks
like<00:04:26.099> the<00:04:26.729> notes<00:04:26.999> on<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.479> one<00:04:27.749> are<00:04:29.300> it

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
like the notes on this one are it

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.629 
like the notes on this one are it
doesn't<00:04:30.629> say<00:04:30.840> but<00:04:31.080> I've<00:04:32.009> already<00:04:32.189> burned<00:04:32.520> this

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
doesn't say but I've already burned this

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.230 
doesn't say but I've already burned this
one<00:04:32.849> last<00:04:33.060> night<00:04:33.300> just<00:04:33.629> a<00:04:33.749> little<00:04:34.020> bit<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:35.240> not

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
one last night just a little bit and not

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.080 
one last night just a little bit and not
even<00:04:36.509> a<00:04:36.629> lot<00:04:36.900> went<00:04:37.110> down<00:04:37.199> but<00:04:37.849> this<00:04:38.849> one<00:04:39.060> just

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
even a lot went down but this one just

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.010 
even a lot went down but this one just
smells<00:04:39.569> like<00:04:39.779> a<00:04:40.849> clean<00:04:42.590> sweet<00:04:43.789> kitchen<00:04:45.020> if

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
smells like a clean sweet kitchen if

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.899 
smells like a clean sweet kitchen if
that<00:04:46.229> makes<00:04:46.409> sense<00:04:46.560> like<00:04:46.889> there's<00:04:47.639> a<00:04:47.699> little

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
that makes sense like there's a little

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.140 
that makes sense like there's a little
bit<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.150> lemon<00:04:48.539> in<00:04:48.659> there<00:04:49.039> it<00:04:50.039> just<00:04:50.639> smells<00:04:50.879> so
