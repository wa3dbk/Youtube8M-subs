won't mess it up or anything the main
thing<00:02:35.939> I<00:02:36.209> don't<00:02:36.269> like<00:02:36.689> about<00:02:37.139> this<00:02:37.709> case<00:02:38.040> is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
thing I don't like about this case is

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.490 
thing I don't like about this case is
that

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.730 
that
the<00:02:39.590> buttons<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.400> volume<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:42.470> switch

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
the buttons the volume and the switch

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.170 
the buttons the volume and the switch
are<00:02:42.920> really<00:02:43.900> really<00:02:44.900> hard<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.350> get<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:46.180> like

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
are really really hard to get to like

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.410 
are really really hard to get to like
you<00:02:47.390> really<00:02:47.870> gotta<00:02:48.080> press<00:02:48.500> them<00:02:48.770> but<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:49.580> over

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
you really gotta press them but if over

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.780 
you really gotta press them but if over
time<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:51.350> rubber<00:02:51.590> does<00:02:51.800> kind<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.130> expand<00:02:52.640> that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
time the rubber does kind of expand that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.690 
time the rubber does kind of expand that
would<00:02:52.910> get<00:02:53.030> softer<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.930> does<00:02:54.140> get<00:02:54.320> easier

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
would get softer so it does get easier

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.280 
would get softer so it does get easier
but<00:02:55.700> when<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:55.940> first<00:02:56.209> get<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.600> just<00:02:56.840> notice

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
but when you first get it just notice

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.370 
but when you first get it just notice
that<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.709> will<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.370> kind<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:58.640> tough<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.780> get

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
that it will be kind of tough to to get

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.060 
that it will be kind of tough to to get
your<00:03:00.470> power<00:03:00.709> button<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.250> such<00:03:02.110> for<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.140> little

well you can use it with ease there's no
problem<00:04:27.650> at<00:04:27.770> all<00:04:27.919> which<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:28.669> very<00:04:29.090> nice<00:04:29.860> see<00:04:30.860> as

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
problem at all which is very nice see as

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.440 
problem at all which is very nice see as
you<00:04:31.130> can<00:04:31.280> see<00:04:31.460> it's<00:04:31.610> kind<00:04:31.820> of<00:04:31.880> its<00:04:32.240> kind<00:04:32.330> of

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
you can see it's kind of its kind of

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.450 
you can see it's kind of its kind of
difficult<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.900> do<00:04:33.020> at<00:04:33.140> first<00:04:33.380> but<00:04:33.590> it

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
difficult to do at first but it

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.520 
difficult to do at first but it
eventually<00:04:34.790> eases<00:04:35.240> up<00:04:35.270> over<00:04:35.660> time<00:04:35.870> don't<00:04:36.140> you

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
eventually eases up over time don't you

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.230 
eventually eases up over time don't you
you<00:04:36.710> guys<00:04:36.890> shouldn't<00:04:37.130> worry<00:04:37.310> about<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.729> and

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
you guys shouldn't worry about that and

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.690 
you guys shouldn't worry about that and
I<00:04:38.810> would<00:04:39.110> recommend<00:04:39.140> you<00:04:39.950> get<00:04:40.840> this<00:04:41.840> black

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
I would recommend you get this black

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.820 
I would recommend you get this black
case<00:04:43.700> instead<00:04:44.180> of<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.600> white<00:04:44.840> one<00:04:45.080> there<00:04:45.620> is<00:04:45.800> a

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
case instead of the white one there is a

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.880 
case instead of the white one there is a
white<00:04:46.130> case<00:04:46.400> style<00:04:47.240> for<00:04:47.510> this<00:04:47.630> umm<00:04:47.930> core<00:04:48.590> case

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
white case style for this umm core case

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.640 
white case style for this umm core case
but<00:04:49.729> do<00:04:49.880> not<00:04:50.030> get<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.390> white<00:04:50.570> one<00:04:50.599> do<00:04:50.960> not<00:04:51.169> do

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
but do not get the white one do not do

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
shows way more on the white cases

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.770 
shows way more on the white cases
especially<00:04:56.240> on<00:04:56.740> on<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:58.070> sides<00:04:58.340> here<00:04:58.780> it'll

actually go like black or blue depending

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.350 
actually go like black or blue depending
on<00:05:03.410> what<00:05:03.740> colors<00:05:04.130> you're<00:05:04.520> here<00:05:04.730> like<00:05:04.880> pockets

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.550 
be reviewing the griffin survivor
all-terrain<00:05:42.980> case<00:05:43.550> eventually<00:05:44.180> here<00:05:44.560> but

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
all-terrain case eventually here but

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.610 
all-terrain case eventually here but
this<00:05:46.130> is<00:05:46.600> probably<00:05:47.600> my<00:05:47.750> favorite<00:05:47.780> some<00:05:48.380> case

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
this is probably my favorite some case

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.260 
this is probably my favorite some case
right<00:05:49.100> now<00:05:49.420> it<00:05:50.420> was<00:05:50.750> the<00:05:51.170> new<00:05:51.800> agey<00:05:52.160> scout<00:05:52.550> but

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
right now it was the new agey scout but

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.810 
right now it was the new agey scout but
I<00:05:53.420> like<00:05:53.720> this<00:05:53.900> way<00:05:54.260> way<00:05:54.920> better<00:05:55.160> because<00:05:55.340> it's

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
I like this way way better because it's

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.360 
I like this way way better because it's
a<00:05:55.910> lot<00:05:56.120> thinner<00:05:56.390> and<00:05:56.750> it<00:05:57.440> offers<00:05:57.860> great

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
a lot thinner and it offers great

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.870 
a lot thinner and it offers great
protection<00:05:58.610> I<00:05:59.270> would<00:06:00.140> give<00:06:00.320> this<00:06:00.590> case<00:06:00.880> four

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
protection I would give this case four

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.240 
protection I would give this case four
and<00:06:01.970> a<00:06:02.000> half<00:06:02.030> out<00:06:02.540> of<00:06:02.570> five<00:06:02.870> stars<00:06:03.250> just

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
and a half out of five stars just

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.370 
and a half out of five stars just
because<00:06:04.640> accessibility<00:06:05.300> wise<00:06:05.780> button<00:06:06.200> wise

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
because accessibility wise button wise

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.430 
because accessibility wise button wise
it<00:06:06.890> takes<00:06:07.610> a<00:06:07.700> little<00:06:07.850> while<00:06:08.000> for<00:06:08.169> the<00:06:09.169> buttons

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
it takes a little while for the buttons

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.370 
it takes a little while for the buttons
