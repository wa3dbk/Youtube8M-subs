00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.950
 welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.070
 we will prepare a chicken with corn flakes 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.020
 we'll need a chicken breast or two of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.630
 beauties of the people of lemons 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.230
 of the sweet cart curry lawyer 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.410
 spicy cardamom mustard white yogurt 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.420
 sugar-free crème fresh and the 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.520
 conflict without sugar too 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.520
 let's start by cutting the chicken's breast 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.530
 chicken should be cut into cubes as if 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:54.250
 they were then chicken nuggets 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:57.850
 size of about 2 cm x 2 given the 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.470
 we put chicken in a dish and clean it 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.360
 the less our work plan is 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.400
 important after using the chicken 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.650
 clean well because the chicken to many 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.780
 we wash our raw bacteria and 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.409
 prepare the sauce based sauce 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.500
 yogurt 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:21.070
 will therefore be yogurt with spices in the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.800
 bowl we will put some mustard not 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.140
 too much or otherwise I would have too much taste 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.229
 then we take the cardamom has a taste 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.580
 a little lemon is very good a bit 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.580
 strong exhaust 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.690
 and a bit of sweet heart 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.049
 The Yogurt 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.189
 I recommend you not sweetened otherwise 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.539
 becomes a sweet and curry chicken 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.539
 mix everything with a spoon 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.960
 take a lemon 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.200
 he cuts it in half 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.720
 and the extreme a little to depend on 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.820
 tastes I don't really like lemon 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.680
 if you like it with a lot of lemons you can 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.280
 put much more 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.660
 we mix again will use the sauce for 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.709
 marinate my chicken in a baking dish 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.350
 put it on the pole we cover it with the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.680
 our our cardamom yogurt sauce 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.319
 and mustard we mix to make sure that 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.209
 the whole room is well blended with 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.400
 neck now we have to cover the chicken 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.500
 with the film paper and leave 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.660
 rest in the refrigerator for at least one 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.580
 couple of hours better if a night like that 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.950
 the chicken really takes the taste of 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.950
 yogurt and all the spices mustard 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.630
 and washed in the refrigerator 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.520
 I already have a question of time 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.070
 prepared before otherwise we would have 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.100
 had to spend the night all together at 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.780
 my one that rested about 4 hours 4 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.100
 5 hours and is ready to be 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.230
 used 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.510
 I take those bamboo sticks 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.520
 that are found on the market and infilzo ad 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.270
 one by one my little pieces I say of 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.460
 chicken which I will later learn in the former conf 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.440
 freezer icon look at them a little 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.030
 on the hands so roughly it goes 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.070
 very well 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.080
 keep crumbling up to 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.870
 get a fair amount for 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.870
 learn all your chicken pieces 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.780
 take the skewered bamboo sticks 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.770
 your chicken and breaded in conf 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.930
 the former and place it on a baking sheet that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.390
 you have already prepared with baking paper 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.670
 doing so you will have an inner side 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.230
 very soft chicken and crunchy 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.730
 out for conflicts 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.330
 finished the neck we can bake it in 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.950
 preheated oven at 200 220 degrees for 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.950
 about 15 minutes 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.910
 now we can prepare ours 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.739
 salsa we will use 12 vowels depending on 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:12.019
 how much sauce you want to eat it 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:16.519
 we split into two with the help of a 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:19.130
 spoon we take the pulp and the 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.850
 put in the mixer in the bowl 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.950
 however, we put spoons of crème fresh 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.600
 or some sour cream if you want yogurt 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.780
 is that they color becomes a little bit more 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:37.360
 acid a bit of orange lemon given 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:37.360
 first I closed it and rolled it 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.990
 vito of whisk adjusted to taste it 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.360
 put in a bowl with attention 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.789
 the lawyer because he risks becoming 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.479
 black cannot be prepared much 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.639
 advance 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.780
 a help I can give is that of 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.550
 put does not know who has placed in a 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.849
 closed bag so that it does not take 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.849
 air 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.510
 now offers the room and I can take 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.370
 my chicken from the oven but first I want 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.200
 show you the pitcher I prepared 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.460
 I took a glass pitcher and got it 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.380
 put in the install of the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.630

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:17.380
 with the flowers on it that are mine 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:19.300
 chicken I take it from the oven the chicken yes 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.940
 he sees that it is cooked when everything is beautiful 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.470
 golden to the outside if you are not 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.810
 sure you are afraid to cook it 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.580
 too little is enough to cut them to make a test 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.140
 therefore it does not affect stretched in yet 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.380
