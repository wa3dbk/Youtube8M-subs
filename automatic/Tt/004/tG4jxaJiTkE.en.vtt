hey<00:00:00.510> youtube<00:00:01.110> Brendan<00:00:01.530> here<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.310> this

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hey youtube Brendan here and in this

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.249 
hey youtube Brendan here and in this
lesson<00:00:02.669> we'll<00:00:02.820> be<00:00:02.970> talking<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.870> basic

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
lesson we'll be talking about a basic

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.970 
lesson we'll be talking about a basic
scar<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.130> pattern<00:00:05.899> so<00:00:06.899> here<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.560> chord

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
scar of the pattern so here is the chord

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:23.500 
scar of the pattern so here is the chord
progression<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.550> we'll<00:00:08.849> be<00:00:08.970> working<00:00:09.120> with

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.009 

so<00:00:24.510> let<00:00:24.689> me<00:00:24.840> break<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.410> down<00:00:26.840> basically<00:00:27.840> as

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
so let me break this down basically as

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.800 
so let me break this down basically as
you<00:00:28.170> can<00:00:28.199> see<00:00:28.910> we'll<00:00:29.910> stick<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.449> chord<00:00:30.720> for

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you can see we'll stick to one chord for

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.460 
you can see we'll stick to one chord for
right<00:00:31.080> now

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
right now

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.910 
right now
and<00:00:31.850> basically<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.270> every<00:00:33.809> single<00:00:34.260> down

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and basically on every single down

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.639 
and basically on every single down
stroke<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:35.940> picking<00:00:36.420> hand<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:37.530> I'm

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
stroke with my picking hand what I'm

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.000 
stroke with my picking hand what I'm
doing<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.370> actually<00:00:39.440> all<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> notes<00:00:40.829> are

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
doing is I'm actually all the notes are

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.270 
doing is I'm actually all the notes are
muted<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.020> on<00:00:43.020> every<00:00:43.440> single<00:00:43.620> down<00:00:43.890> stroke

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
muted and on every single down stroke

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.600 
muted and on every single down stroke
it's<00:00:45.149> always<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> mute<00:00:46.520> basically<00:00:47.520> I'm<00:00:47.579> doing

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it's always a mute basically I'm doing

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.330 
it's always a mute basically I'm doing
this<00:00:47.910> by<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.180> resting<00:00:49.020> my<00:00:49.320> fingers<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.100> top

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
this by just resting my fingers on top

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.950 
this by just resting my fingers on top
of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> strings<00:00:50.879> without<00:00:51.120> actually<00:00:51.780> pushing

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
of the strings without actually pushing

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.490 
of the strings without actually pushing
them<00:00:52.230> down<00:00:53.239> okay<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> down

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
them down okay so that's for the down

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.619 
them down okay so that's for the down
strokes<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.520> strokes<00:00:56.879> I'm

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
strokes now for the up strokes I'm

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.349 
strokes now for the up strokes I'm
actually<00:00:58.100> pushing<00:00:59.100> down<00:00:59.280> my<00:00:59.640> fingers<00:00:59.699> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
actually pushing down my fingers and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.100 
actually pushing down my fingers and
fretting<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> chord<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.870> when<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.930> put

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
fretting the chord and when you put

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.899 
fretting the chord and when you put
these<00:01:04.229> two<00:01:04.409> together<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.339> effect<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
these two together the effect that you

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:16.550 
these two together the effect that you
get<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.470> mute<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.049> something<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.409> can

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
get is mute so that's something you can

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.310 
get is mute so that's something you can
practice<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:17.100> there<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.909> chord

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
practice right there just on one chord

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:30.560 
practice right there just on one chord
you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.380> eventually<00:01:19.890> speed<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> up

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.420 

and<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.140> once<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:32.130> bit<00:01:32.219> more

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and then once you get a little bit more

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.450 
and then once you get a little bit more
comfortable<00:01:33.409> what<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.680> start<00:01:34.979> doing<00:01:35.130> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
comfortable what you can start doing is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.539 
comfortable what you can start doing is
you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.289> apply<00:01:37.289> this<00:01:37.350> rhythm<00:01:38.070> pattern<00:01:38.399> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you can apply this rhythm pattern to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.990 
you can apply this rhythm pattern to
chord<00:01:38.939> progressions<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.710> this<00:01:40.710> case<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.700> one

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
chord progressions in this case this one

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:56.749 
chord progressions in this case this one
is<00:01:42.030> C<00:01:42.509> major<00:01:42.689> E<00:01:43.350> minor<00:01:43.710> F<00:01:44.520> major<00:01:45.119> G<00:01:45.810> major<00:01:55.759> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
is C major E minor F major G major and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.169 
is C major E minor F major G major and
there's<00:01:57.659> also<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.110> more<00:01:58.890> up-tempo<00:01:59.700> scale

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
there's also that more up-tempo scale

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:10.059 
there's also that more up-tempo scale
that<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.450> hear<00:02:01.819> what<00:02:02.819> that<00:02:02.849> sounds<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.479> is

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.640 

it's<00:02:11.069> basically<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.610> same<00:02:11.760> concept<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.650> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's basically the same concept just you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.199 
it's basically the same concept just you
know<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.830> takes<00:02:14.010> more<00:02:14.160> practice<00:02:14.549> I'm<00:02:14.760> kind<00:02:15.150> of

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
know it takes more practice I'm kind of

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.319 
know it takes more practice I'm kind of
sloppy<00:02:15.420> at<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:16.220> but<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.400> takes<00:02:18.120> more

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
sloppy at it but just takes more

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.780 
sloppy at it but just takes more
practice<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.160> eventually<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.400> get<00:02:20.670> that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
practice and eventually you can get that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.610 
practice and eventually you can get that
same<00:02:21.090> rhythm<00:02:21.269> pattern<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.110> play<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.470> at

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
same rhythm pattern and just play it at

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.620 
same rhythm pattern and just play it at
faster<00:02:23.519> speeds<00:02:23.549> um<00:02:25.849> and<00:02:26.849> yeah<00:02:27.000> that's<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.269> basic

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
faster speeds um and yeah that's a basic

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.420 
faster speeds um and yeah that's a basic
scar<00:02:27.989> rhythm<00:02:28.260> pattern<00:02:28.500> right<00:02:28.650> kind<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.220> right

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
scar rhythm pattern right kind of right

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.840 
scar rhythm pattern right kind of right
there<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.200> hope<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.680> helped<00:02:32.040> feel<00:02:32.700> free

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
there and I hope that helped feel free

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.400 
there and I hope that helped feel free
