00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.630
 Priora car is not old there for two years 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.580
 the maximum was then 3 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.570
 then we make the client dressed on the street 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.660
 elevated let's see what's here 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.660
 us 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:39.170
 liters per hundred 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:44.489
 really need a lot 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 raise the hood look under the hood behind 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 mate here too here and under the hood that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:02.399
 here I please open standard 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.930
 the ball priorovskie came to hand pedals 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:14.010
 and use on changed 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:22.140
 quickly nulevik catalyst removed costs 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:23.570
 spider 41 a number of incompetent about what they are 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.930
 are connected 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.900
 motor runs smoothly and quietly 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.900
 do with to start there for example 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:44.150
 gas analyzer take the end of his sandalwood 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:49.090
 here he probe tower and insert 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:57.050
 car exhaust pipe inserted 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:59.210
 turned on the sock began to swing pro 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.870
 control the temperature of the motor by hand 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:08.440
 in warmed up 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:11.630
 motor warmed up to 90 degrees come here 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.500
 see what we have here now 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.500
 shows 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.970
 but it is gas analyzers we go 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.280
 slight delay is natural 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.160
 phenomenon in what is the hose about 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.400
 swing bacon here analyze here 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.220
 look at this top parameter near 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.220
 056 who is his father 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.930
 excellent readings to units I am very 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:46.580
 I count how many ch ideals are 180 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.600
 clearly up to 200 it is generally like units 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.870
 it's tighter gorgeous value option 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:03:00.860
 co2 here the more the better here 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.989
 13 and a half percent is already excellent 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.070
 parameter 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.430
 Minister of oxygen, we do not see us 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.269
 here the sensor is faulty bidding on 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.470
 idle 9 ask our 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:18.190
 owner keep paces somewhere in 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.190
 3000 area 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.590
 In theory, for the sake of setting yourself, you should 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.590
 improve let's see 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.959
 asked vision 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.730
 Here we are seeing a drop in ch that is 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.900
 motor became better Jedi fuel 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:58.400
 decreased by more economical deaths 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.709
 let's go co2 grew up also has that 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.099
 motor effectively works well 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.099
 panel 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:16.310
 that's enough 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.310
 pause often must
