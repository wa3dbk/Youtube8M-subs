00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.640
 Alright, today's question 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.420
 If the Creator is God, how can that happen? 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.660
 I do not believe that God existed from the beginning. 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.340
 --- I got the question 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880
 This question, is --- 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.680
 There is God 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.500
 How can this be explained? 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.780
 This is the same question. 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.220
 So today, this question 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.300
 By asking yourself, 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.120
 I want to start this answer, 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.140
 If this one says something --- 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 Why does the real world exist? That is the case. 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.220
 The real world exists 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.580
 The person who denies that 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.440
 First, I don't think there is. 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.040
 I myself was thinking about the answer. 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.960
 My existence itself is reality, you are also a reality. Why --- 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.800
 Does the real world exist? 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.840
 I will tell the answer three, as usual. 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.940
 There are only three possibilities. 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.040
 One, the real world is created by itself, 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.440
 "created by yourself" 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.980
 Is happening alone 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.620
 But the way to say this is a contradiction 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.580
 Nothing is missing 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.920
 It is impossible to create something. So --- 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.680
 The so-called self-created is impossible. 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.820
 The second possibility is --- 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.540
 The real world exists from the beginning 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.540
 It's termed --- 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.400
 Real, 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.920
 Materially the world exists from the beginning. However--- 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 There is a beginning in the real world 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.520
 One way of thinking is, for example, --- 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.080
 As one theory to explain the beginning of space 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.140
 There is a "Big Bang Theory" This is --- 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.320
 Turns out the world, 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.620
 The one called "Starting from now" 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.360
 It seems possible, is --- 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 There is scientific data that shows the place, because of that --- 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.140
 The real world is 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.300
 It cannot be said that "there is from long ago eternity" 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.440
 The third possibility is --- 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.660
 That real world, 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.980
 It is eternal, made by, 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.460
 That is the third option 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.440
 This 2nd and 3rd, 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.460
 Third 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.980
 "Created by whose existence is eternal" 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.900
 By someone who can't accept that, 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.420
 Everything exists since eternity 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.740
 It is something that is nothing but going to that place, but --- 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.060
 What must be asked, is the "law of causality" 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.140
 When compared to causes and results 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.420
 The result is similar to the cause, thus --- 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.580
 The cause of childbirth results. 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.780
 Among that there is "correlation" 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.160
 If an object is eternal existence, why is it there, 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.660
 Why is there someone with a "human" personality? Why --- 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.420
 This is called "human" 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.280
 Is there a moral ethic? Say that 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.200
 Things that cannot be explained more. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.780
 The Bible says "Man was created to imitate the image of God" 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.540
 I will teach it. It is, 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.980
 The real world is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.700
 Depends on one's logic and moral personality, 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.220
 This proves that it was created 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.320
 To believe in the existence of an eternal God 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.420
 As far as someone thinks 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.560
 This is not an illogical thing. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.100
 Actually that is the most logical conclusion 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.420
 See you again at the following Q &amp; A. 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.260
 thanks.
