00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.200
 let's all your race split I'm 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.809
 always with android and good we are going to 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.120
 do two speed tests at a 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:11.610
 microsd card of the brand alex to 16 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 gigas class 10 but that I did a test 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.930
 of speed using my samsung 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.310
 galaxy mini 2 also say a boxing and 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.340
 Now we are going to do a work of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 speed with the ato even be the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.199
 story itself meis marc we have to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.199
 choose the unit the unit 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.610
 and we're going to do the speed test 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 mean mega to 8 we will lower what 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.330
 so much 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.850
 until 2 megabytes so it's not too 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.590
 long 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.590
 and we are going to start the text 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.600
 As you can see, this test is testing 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.190
 write and then to read first I'm a 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.019
 half mega file some file of 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.600
 one mega then two megs or four if I was going 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.640
 doubling the size of the file 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.960
 microsd card I've put it in the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.079
 adapter that comes with the card that 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.080
 it's a usb adapter and places the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.240
 test with an sd adapter location that 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.130
 converts the micro sd into a normal sd 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.100
 to the property that they give us as always 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.049
 at the beginning with very large file sizes 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.549
 small of some values that are not 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.120
 real that are very very slow as 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.120
 you see now 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.560
 go out a lot the speed and the beginning 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.360
 when I get 100 mega files 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.060
 we had several more or less real today 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.090
 welcomes good speeds 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.649
 of reading writing is closer to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.950
 the actual speed carries a file 8 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.870
 megas it takes 8 megabytes per second and 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.780
 from 10 megabytes per second of reading 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.150
 in bucket file 16 is already taking almost 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.150
 11 megs per second of writing 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.950
 and there was reading there 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.170
 work a little the truth is that these 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.240
 data are not 100% real too 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.090
 the system load depends on the bus 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.890
 system data so to do 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.830
 totally reliable data should 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.330
 be a type of device that only 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 dedicate to do the test that is not 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.500
 using the data bus for other things 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.810
 how is the computer 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.250
 but good are some data that in some 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.800
 of the tests give us some values 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.910
 approximate reality as you see 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.200
 almost 20 megabytes per second of reading and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.569
 13 and peak writing 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.069
 to grade 15 of writing that is very 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.069
 ok this card as class 10 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.920
 and good as you see we have 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.320
 obtained are they have writing of 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.530
 about 15 megabytes per second and reading 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.850
 about 18 or 19 megabytes per second 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.670
 very good data as I said a 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.580
 Class 10 card from the alexa brand 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.600
 leave now let's do the test 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.600
 with the other program 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.160
 it's called smart glass 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.050
 we open is a little simpler 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.440
 visually in the other that is to say they are a 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.569
 last is to say that the maximum file of 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.660
 one giga just like before the unit is the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.050
 and 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.120
 and we're going to start 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.050
 to start preparing the file and what 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.050
 start doing the tests 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.380
 young people to give a sequential reading of 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.070
 18 with 75 which is quite similar to the 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.070
 another test 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.730
 as you see, he has given us 15 with 70 of 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.440
 write speed megabytes per second 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.170
 and it is more or less the data very similar 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.430
 to those that we have obtained with the data 16 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.720
 sea 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.940
 we will see 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.470
 These data are more or less 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.400
 real using what you see 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.110
 leave microsd of lexar brand of class 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.110
 10 and of distinctive capabilities 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.549
 as you see 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.769
 00 06 the data we are going that they are not worth 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.079
 nothing and good now I will proceed to 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.670
 do the same tests with what is the 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.900
 micro sd introducing adapters are 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.689
 should say with seeing as if it were a 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.160
 sd card and I'm really just going to put 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.780
 the final data so that as you can 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.850
 check the speed is to create 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.940
 really at the end and I will proceed to 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.940
 it 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.320
 good as you see using instead of a 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.390
 usb adapter to connect the micro sd 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.970
 to the computer used the adapter sd a 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.350
 sd card that has a new mind 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.630
 slot to enter it means and 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.610
 in 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.640
 the dice are close to those of ba 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.590
 before there are fluctuations can be 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.420
 so it is the system of thought 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.240
 operating system can be by the 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.110
 tablets and the card industry but 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.110
 they are not the values 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.680
 let say 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.449
 very different 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.600
 Now proceed to do the test with the 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.280
 another program 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.810
 well let's do the test with the 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.370
 smart crystal program 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.910
 let's choose here the unity of the 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.250
 card 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.250
 and do the test with a thousand megabytes 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.110
 sequence 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.400
 to start preparing the file for 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.100
 do the tests and well could you put 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.419
 directly the result so that 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.150
 we can compare with the results that 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.750
 gave us using place of the sd adapter the 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.750
 USB adapter 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.030
 and we have the results as you see 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.830
 they look a lot like the results using 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.099
 the usb adapter instead of the adapter 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.699
 of 18 megabytes per second of reading 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.500
 and 15 megabytes per second of writing the 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.270
 grace is a very good speed a 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.340
 Class 10 card which guarantees us 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.139
 according to the manufacturer and according to the standard 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.699
 have to have at least once that 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.190
 Minimum constant of 10 megabytes per second 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.199
 as you see this card when exhaling what 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.780
 It fulfills and well, it is liked this 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.430
 video we see the following you can 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.800
 leave me comments of what you want 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.470
 to like I like the video if you
