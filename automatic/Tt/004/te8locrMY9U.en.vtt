 that I distribute it because with so much 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.090
 pincer with so much dryer with so much thing 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.770
 the hair falls breaks and burns 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.359
 and right now we are in the stage of 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.280
 reconstruction here of my hair that 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.990
 They were pleased of course what happens is 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.789
 to remember that I was talking about 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.679
 this oil that good finally in to 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.200
 sometimes it is not very easy to find it but 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.079
 we are already in these girls investigate 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.000
 this notice that this oil has 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.590
 many antioxidants among others is 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.990
 the vitamin d that will help us the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.200
 elasticity of course of the hair and 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.759
 note that it has omega 3 and omega 9 that 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.590
 they will help us to strengthen 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.780
 obviously our our leather 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.880
 scalp and provide them with greasy 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.069
 when we have dry scalp 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.659
 how are we going to use it because it's very 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.569
 important I brought again our 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.920
 hair massage brush 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.840
 remember that this brush is good 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.569
 very important because what we are going to 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.759
 do is brush our hair several 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:05.179
 times back let's say about 20 times 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.090
 back 20 times forward 20 a 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:11.180
 one side 20 to the other and they will feel that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.650
 warm scalp ok then what 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.870
 what are we going to do is we're going to take 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.730
 a little bit of our argan oil and 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.430
 let's face it in our in 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.840
 our hands and we are going to apply in the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.200
 scalp and we're going to 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.440
 a massage in circles that obviously 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.840
 let's get our wonderful 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.790
 usually sorry interrupts press that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.379
 when you use the oils you 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.930
 recommend not using it in leather 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.670
 scalp this if you dress and wonderful 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.319
 if it is and with confidence nothing of what means 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.690
 to spikes oil direct scalp 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.730
 clear because it will strengthen is going to 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.470
 strengthen then what will happen 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.940
 people who constantly fall 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.319
 good hair let's take into account that 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.450
 stress has a lot to do so that 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.230
 this happens but if we help him 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.810
 to strengthen from the root 10 east this 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.720
 oil is characterized by is because we 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.670
 will strengthen from the root imagine 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.380
 when we make our our 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.690
 massage we are already doing our 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.209
 brushing our massage we apply the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.370
 oil we put on the cap and apply a 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.120
 little bit of heat then what are we 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.950
 doing is helping to truly penetrate 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.720
 on our scalp and obviously 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.250
 in the fiber of the hair if we are 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.349
 talking about a hair that we what 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.349
 they process every day true mate 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.000
 is formed then we really go to 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.430
 cut those tips let's start with 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.500
 the treatment but it is very important 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.910
 that you analyze if you have a leather 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.850
 fatty scalp 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.650
 there we need this oil a lot more 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.440
 we're going to need media 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.540
 tips if in your case your leather 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.160
 scalp is fatty do not use it there 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.620
 let's try means to ends 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.140
 because sometimes the fatty scalp 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.640
 Look, it's funny because you have grace 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.440
 of the scalp but it turns out that the 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.150
 tips are dry 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.010
 that is very true then what happens 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.170
 with this that people who have 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.390
 This situation does not get your hair 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.150
 so it 's important if you have your 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.460
 oily scalp pulls your hair 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.930
 every night that fat girl who is 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.510
 generating during the day 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.670
 You will go through a bullet 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.250
 all your hair to the length of your 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.799
 hair and that natural fat that is what 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.720
 better you take it you are going to provide it 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.120
 along your hair to the tips 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.530
 they even go restoring and for that 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.570
 you can use this type of comb that 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.940
 half because it has to sow more 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.590
 closed and you're going to allow that even when 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.650
 be the argan oil that is the one you go 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.170
 to accept all your own gravity the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.320
 scalp this you're going to see what you're going 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.840
 to accept what you are going to displace in all your 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.180
 hair in the long d 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.330
 so they stay there when we go 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.699
 to put the treatment and then little 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.650
 if you have dry scalp that 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.020
 already says it makes us a little dandruff and 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.600
 else then if we are going to give this 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.360
 massage let's do it from the root 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.250
 towards the point my dear coconut how much 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.510
 time they will not need in how much 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.460
 time I should leave the treatment 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.250
 already once I submit it to heat that 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.930
 It can be with a dryer or you can 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.729
 be it in the matter of aesthetics and 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.130
 Special equipment specialist in the 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.229
 heat how long should I leave 10 to 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.030
 15 minutes ok now we're almost 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.130
 doing our treatment once per 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.280
 month then let's leave the 10 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.600
 minutitos not necessarily really what 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.700
 win does not have to do twice to the 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.620
 week is not necessary but yes 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.050
 do it because it really is a 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.870
 wonder and the best thing with a droplet 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.289
 really gives you a lot very much 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.940
 then look for argan oil 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.360
 I have detected that there are also 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.580
 some some good lines SEs 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.860
 obviously handle in stores and in 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.539
 the contested ask why is a 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.320
 oil that not so easy we're going to 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.000
 find 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.590
 however there are already brands that 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.020
 they show the people inside of 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.030
 the republic by some catalog and others 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.550
 that he probably already wanted to bring it 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.400
 also or containing this asset does not 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.470
 of primary is pure that is the oil 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.940
 pure argan and why he tells me is that 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.590
 this oil was also handled 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.230
 so good that it is handled for the skin 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.120
 the face and now imagine for the 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.470
 hair and its presentation and direct the 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.690
 Yes scalp must help 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.490
 protect it because all our lives we are 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.100
 exposed simply to pollution 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.230
 of the hair everything on the street what's up 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.150
 I was checking that to cook the gold 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.370
 liquid in morocco not only for 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.290
 the hair for good skin is used 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.750
 even as excellent intention of the 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.330
 food that is really what they use 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.340
 as for everything and it is very very healthy and very 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.930
 healthy are used that way not 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.090
 for the burns I was also 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.340
 seeing clearly that it also works a lot 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.590
 and very, very much, and remember, I insist 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.290
 much in that the gentlemen gentleman lord 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.910
 and young people are jealous because young people 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.160
 in their adolescence they begin to have 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.450
 a lot of dryness and then they are 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.480
 with the girlfriend and here it's like 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.980
 christmas christmas that happiness with 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.530
 life and see that nothing but surprise says 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.970
 no no me in the blue hair and from 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.340
 this oil costs a lot after putting together 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.900
 of the hair not for nothing is a battle 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.590
 no no no no, it's the other way around 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.810
 oils that do not get as much fat 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.810
 use it my beloved vehicle uses
