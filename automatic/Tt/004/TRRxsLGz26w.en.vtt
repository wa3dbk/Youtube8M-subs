00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.109
 as far as two hours 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:12.599
 disable how to measure the image will 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.980
 turn off and it was not well 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.980
 habitat combination 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.090
 swimming risk your 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 reset brains reset 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.829
 and batteries are not so simple 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.829
 here is the story 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.070
 everything 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.280
 and now all 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.620
 you show 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.620
 everyone is poor here 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.210
 turtle which means reduced 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.960
 power hybrid installation well 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.440
 accordingly, the battery is busy 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.440
 by you sly 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.250
 so as not to relive the speakers 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.250
 armani 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.289
 Well, in general, 300 24 volt show how 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.729
 it now charges a very minute they 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.729
 example 16 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.110
 they were often 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.780
 8gb charging goes bailout procedure on 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.320
 skin and temperature on principle not 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.690
 warmed up 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.850
 because it was charging for two hours 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.620
 room temperature and why then 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.489
 not charged 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:26.790
 then it is the charge level for voltage even 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:28.300
 small here is a delta 20 percent now 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.870
 she will test 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.090
 will rise was the last time 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.490
 how much 76 76 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.730
 that is, the lower the delta theme level 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.750
 this tank is a factory deal yes it 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.390
 Deal on for 10 and 11 plus 20 0 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.800
 percent well you actually write 20 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.110
 percent not up to this load program 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.110
 laid it should be 0 percent 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.540
 and before when after you first 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.930
 connect the device in three hours 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.969
 how much delta excitement at 2 percent was 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.920
 56 but this again is not 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.900
 it was all your son was subjective 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.270
 because the delta showed 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.510
 we haven't driven yet 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.510
 natali the bug went out 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.510
 but 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:37.080
 here is 39 the delta seemed broken 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.020
 completely through Nastya probably three minutes 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.590
 until only then released 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:49.050
 Question 4 canons plan twice 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:53.880
 two cycles charged discharged if 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:59.450
 Michael said that he was 56 then 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.450
 Now 39 half yes yes, and apparently 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:16.910
 the question here is now forty nine 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.980
 and a half again the error caught fire 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:24.250
 see two hours 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:28.700
 started charging but now you can see if 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:33.580
 said it was less than this is delta s 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:39.550
 where 49 percent is the battery charge 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:45.130
 Capacity closer to set closer to ideal 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.130
 the ideal is 20 percent on new pluses 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:53.570
 when before taking this car on 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.150
 recovery was 56 now total 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.460
 after 5 hours 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.460
 charging 49
