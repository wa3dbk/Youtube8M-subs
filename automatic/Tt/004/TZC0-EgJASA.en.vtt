00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.520
 nowhere is there likely more 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.259
 new horny games than on the e3 and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.150
 then two brand new consoles 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.280
 you can even gamble yourself there falls 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.380
 The choice, of course, incredibly difficult 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.089
 but faithful to sugar spectators 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.590
 Imagine there is a game on 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.400
 Personally, I am very special 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.930
 Rejoice and that's the wood 2 I have it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
 You can also play here 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.650
 bandai namco because behind me see 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.000
 we stand there and the people are snake 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.279
 is really just a very illustrious 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.989
 circle of journalists who let in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.700
 become to myself once her luck 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.530
 try and demo too dark souls 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 Two of them really have it in them 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.829
 in fact in the apron it was called yes 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.989
 At least everything should be a little bit 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.730
 becoming more accessible becomes a little easier 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.950
 and of course dark souls 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.390
 Fans like me get scared because of this 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.250
 incredible difficulty heard there 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.930
 of course , and I can 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.760
 but reassuring at least the demo of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.890
 dark souls two who got it right in 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.850
 She's as tough as she is 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.570
 the original 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.379
 but there are also a few differences 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.170
 Overall , for example, that can be me 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.850
 fighting system a bit more comfortable 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.770
 that, for example, when you hit 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.970
 also gets caught by weaker opponents 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.040
 even if the blocks with the shield 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.060
 that then the reaction time until one 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.520
 can attack again 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.020
 it is a little bit longer 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.880
 even less possible 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.920
 is just going to vote wildly 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.729
 and furiously beating the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.729
 opponents to get small 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.990
 the demo we could play the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.650
 led and into an areal the consisted 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.770
 an abandoned castle ruin with 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.450
 outside areas 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.530
 There was a very dark area and there 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.030
 For the first time I was able to do one of the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.860
 try new features namely the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.850
 there was already fluorescent in there 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.320
 The corner and I just have mine 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.390
 torch lit and then I'm in the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.250
 dark catacombs gone the big one 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.509
 disadvantage of course I had then 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.369
 no sign in the left hand and 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.369
 that was really difficult 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.410
 So the railway celebrates the beacons 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.550
 of course come back and this time 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.920
 it will be possible for everyone 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.980
 to couple beacon of the game 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.240
 which unfortunately was not the predecessor 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.890
 Finally , there was bossgegner and who 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.610
 This is where the bus opponent would create 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.170
 to defeat 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.030
 bandai namco has a t-shirt for that 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.530
 I have not promised it unfortunately 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.480
 But no one else did it 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.830
 journalist in this sense dark souls 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.420
 two I am even more on it and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.920
 can not wait until all the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.450
 march finally comes because optically has that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.310
 an incredible leap forward 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.600
 made her look so much better 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.100
 the predecessors can really be there 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.910
 So look forward to it again 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.910
 At least I do 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.709
 many go
