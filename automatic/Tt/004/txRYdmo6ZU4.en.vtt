real fairly basic set design for a show

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.849 
real fairly basic set design for a show
that<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.130> did<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> couple<00:00:27.060> years<00:00:27.359> ago<00:00:27.590> okay<00:00:28.590> as

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that I did a couple years ago okay as

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.099 
that I did a couple years ago okay as
with<00:00:29.160> any<00:00:29.369> time<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.849> Sketchup<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
with any time in Sketchup you know the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.479 
with any time in Sketchup you know the
first<00:00:31.320> thing<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.619> want<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.160> get<00:00:32.340> your

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
first thing you want to do is get your

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.639 
first thing you want to do is get your
view<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> proper<00:00:33.870> place<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.290> I'm<00:00:34.380> just

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
view in the proper place so I'm just

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
view in the proper place so I'm just
gonna<00:00:34.739> select<00:00:34.950> my<00:00:35.130> orbit<00:00:35.700> tool<00:00:35.940> those<00:00:36.540> two

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
gonna select my orbit tool those two

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
gonna select my orbit tool those two
blue<00:00:36.989> arrows<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.950> kind<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> look<00:00:38.399> around

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
blue arrows and kind of look around

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.650 
blue arrows and kind of look around
moving<00:00:39.270> my<00:00:40.790> moving<00:00:41.790> my<00:00:41.940> view<00:00:42.210> around<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
moving my moving my view around and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.260 
moving my moving my view around and
really<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> think<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.440> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.739> initial<00:00:44.309> just

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
really I think this kind of initial just

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.549 
really I think this kind of initial just
slightly<00:00:45.570> off<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> stage<00:00:49.230> left

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
slightly off to the to the stage left

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
slightly off to the to the stage left
side<00:00:49.890> view<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.850> from<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> front<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.570> what

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
side view of this from the front is what

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
side view of this from the front is what
I<00:00:51.750> want<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.230> first<00:00:52.500> image<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:52.980> just

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
I want for my first image so I'm just

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.459 
I want for my first image so I'm just
going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> set<00:00:53.579> my<00:00:53.610> view<00:00:54.079> exactly<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> want

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
going to set my view exactly how I want

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.779 
going to set my view exactly how I want
the<00:00:55.590> image<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.860> show<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.550> then<00:00:56.640> I'm<00:00:56.760> just

Sketchup but you know of course select
moving<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.450> is

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
moving it there this is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.980 
moving it there this is
three<00:02:04.790> dimensional<00:02:04.940> things<00:02:05.450> this<00:02:05.540> is<00:02:05.690> just<00:02:05.900> a

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
three dimensional things this is just a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.810 
three dimensional things this is just a
flat<00:02:06.140> image<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.770> can<00:02:06.950> drop<00:02:07.130> in<00:02:07.370> anywhere

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
flat image that I can drop in anywhere

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.120 
flat image that I can drop in anywhere
and<00:02:08.060> then<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.050> can<00:02:09.350> come<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.650> here<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
and then I can come in here and the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.790 
and then I can come in here and the
Sketchup<00:02:10.430> and<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.990> know<00:02:12.050> for<00:02:12.260> example<00:02:12.620> if<00:02:12.710> I

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
Sketchup and you know for example if I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.340 
Sketchup and you know for example if I
want<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.070> show<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:14.240> know<00:02:14.330> some<00:02:14.570> construction

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
want to show you know some construction

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.100 
want to show you know some construction
detail<00:02:15.860> on<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.340> back<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.910> know<00:02:17.000> how<00:02:17.810> we're

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
detail on the back you know how we're

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.560 
detail on the back you know how we're
gonna<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.440> building<00:02:18.950> something<00:02:19.310> then<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> can

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
gonna be building something then I can

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.590 
gonna be building something then I can
come<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:20.900> here<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.320> go<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.130> know<00:02:22.160> file<00:02:22.610> export

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
come in here and go you know file export

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.820 
come in here and go you know file export
2d<00:02:24.020> graphic<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.700> call<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.330> give<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.500> two

want and you're just again looking
here's<00:02:45.710> that<00:02:45.860> other<00:02:46.070> flat<00:02:46.430> image<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:47.360> we<00:02:47.480> can

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
here's that other flat image that we can

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.590 
here's that other flat image that we can
come<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.260> look<00:02:48.530> at<00:02:48.740> so<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.450> way

come in and look at so this is the way
you<00:02:50.660> can<00:02:51.020> go<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:51.680> create<00:02:52.040> lots<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.900> know

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
you can go in create lots of you know

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.900 
you can go in create lots of you know
sample<00:02:54.440> images<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.100> very<00:02:55.280> quickly<00:02:55.580> are

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
sample images that very quickly are

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.500 
sample images that very quickly are
gonna<00:02:56.060> be<00:02:56.240> available<00:02:58.120> for<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.210> to<00:02:59.240> use

simple straightforward way to share your
design<00:03:07.910> with<00:03:08.180> someone<00:03:08.480> who<00:03:08.600> might<00:03:08.780> not<00:03:08.959> have

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
design with someone who might not have

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.590 
design with someone who might not have
Sketchup<00:03:09.650> installed<00:03:10.130> or<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:11.060> include<00:03:11.420> those

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.170 
images in PowerPoint or just email them
to<00:03:15.260> someone<00:03:15.650> or<00:03:15.860> print<00:03:16.070> them<00:03:16.130> out<00:03:16.250> however<00:03:17.000> you

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
to someone or print them out however you

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.100 
to someone or print them out however you
want<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.420> do<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.690> okay<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:19.420> next<00:03:20.420> we'll<00:03:20.959> be

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
want to do that okay so next we'll be

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.740 
want to do that okay so next we'll be
talking<00:03:21.380> about<00:03:22.390> creating<00:03:23.390> three-dimensional

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
talking about creating three-dimensional

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.610 
talking about creating three-dimensional
animations<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:25.070> we'll<00:03:26.060> start<00:03:26.330> with<00:03:26.420> 2d<00:03:27.290> stuff

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
animations but we'll start with 2d stuff

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.310 
animations but we'll start with 2d stuff
okay
