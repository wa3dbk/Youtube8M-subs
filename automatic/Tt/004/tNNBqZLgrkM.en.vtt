00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.070
 1 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.059
 what I like a lot with May 10 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.940
 art challenge is that we work with 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.500
 the leaders of tomorrow on the one hand and 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.170
 in addition they are French 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.040
 john lasseter is obviously a 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.560
 very very great connoisseur of 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.430
 the animation he knows that France is a 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.430
 great country of animation 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.850
 very good promotion this year done 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.649
 by French people we are proud of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.360
 the level has increased compared to 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.840
 last year's printing is 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.660
 interesting 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.700
 each of the dukes 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.980
 fold 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.930
 actually to create his universe and that opens 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.340
 to many points of history that he himself 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.800
 hides behind me I find that there is 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.480
 many who are great and I have not 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.620
 my favorite for now I am 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.150
 still head in the comic images 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.150
 a hundred to see I continue 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.940
 317 finalists selected by a jury 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.580
 so I was there in Asia when I 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.580
 am going to do this is first call and 17 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 finalists 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.420
 i do not know 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.520
 2 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.450
 he has limited the breath 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.870
 I spent a lot of time I'm not going 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.610
 to make a plane or a bird or something 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.020
 like that so I had fun with the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.550
 animals that I like and that is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.570
 fun to draw I found that 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.400
 many in fact to make only one 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.960
 character in fact this is not necessary 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.729
 that a little interaction we saw 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.840
 finally a relationship between the two 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.610
 characters because a character all 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.000
 only we have more trouble justifying this 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.000
 that he does there 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.540
 I always liked what's going on in 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.800
 the tunes of which already lowered to translate it 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.960
 a bit with the composition of the image 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.970
 it is to place the camera in diving 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.290
 like that it's enough talking 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.610
 in terms of image composition one can 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.180
 quickly get on things 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.550
 interesting 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.260
 it's crazy when it's crazy it's crazy 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.440
 because that's a huge visibility in 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.440
 made 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.020
 I like when I make an image 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.880
 it does not always tell things 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.200
 extraordinary we will not lie but 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.190
 I like to say something I come 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.660
 to please me to tell a story 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.410
 little story is a little why 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.069
 I chose the cinema professions 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.450
 animation 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.850
 it's to tell stories too 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.680
 when I have an idea it comes a little 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.110
 like that finally I know a little bit of flashes 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.400
 when you read a topic and as and when 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.450
 measure with the references you have 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.790
 it's mostly the references that go 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.440
 to make sure that's going to be unlocked in fact I 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.700
 yeah think it was us is a fireball 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.700
 obviously it paid 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.940
 it's true that at first we said good 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.440
 we choose that 10 finally we have 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.640
 practically chose the double it was 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.030
 impossible and it's true that they 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.030
 had full 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.650
 at 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.730
 of everything 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.819
 I totally agree with the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.849
 Jury especially the first stunning it 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.800
 call on children to make dreams come true 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.330
 and except that he's really successful he 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.000
 really stands out from the rest 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.890
 others to make it into an account in fact 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.930
 drawing can not be a story that 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.460
 would make a very good sign for children 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.170
 we are really awesome 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.540
 stories especially the bat the 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.310
 firefly has found good is good 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.990
 thought it's well played there really 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.450
 three styles clearly different so 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.440
 it's very good that they were demarcated 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.120
 of the lot 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.920
 the lightning was pretty framing 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.690
 was nice too so no it was cool 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.880
 to sing is a woman annie this idea 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.640
 salt and it's a shame he did not 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.110
 saw when I was a student 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.480
 it's a good slap I want to 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.630
 become best congratulations to them 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.070
 bravo congratulations to all of you really 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.330
 it was very very good and black a 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.160
 third year next we're going 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.750
 start putting these bodies up 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.850
 is undoubtedly the theme of the 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.110
 next pixar movie coming out summer 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.320
 next but we'll see we'll announce it 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.320
 beens
