that you can use to rehabilitate

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.419 
that you can use to rehabilitate
plumeria<00:00:06.120> cuttings<00:00:06.660> now<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:07.950> method<00:00:08.189> is

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
plumeria cuttings now this method is

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.950 
plumeria cuttings now this method is
mainly<00:00:08.670> used<00:00:08.970> for<00:00:09.120> cuttings<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.690> have

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
mainly used for cuttings that have

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.600 
mainly used for cuttings that have
either<00:00:10.110> been<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.500> Sun<00:00:10.800> too<00:00:10.830> long<00:00:11.010> or

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
either been in the Sun too long or

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.640 
either been in the Sun too long or
you've<00:00:12.059> got<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:12.540> people<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:13.049> planted<00:00:13.410> them

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
you've got or people have planted them

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.470 
you've got or people have planted them
and<00:00:14.009> they<00:00:14.250> shriveled<00:00:14.700> up<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.030> they're<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
and they shriveled up and they're on the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.779 
and they shriveled up and they're on the
verge<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.809> rotting<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.199> dying<00:00:16.440> or<00:00:16.890> basically

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
verge of rotting and dying or basically

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.310 
verge of rotting and dying or basically
they<00:00:18.090> were<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.420> cut<00:00:18.570> off<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> tree<00:00:19.109> that

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
they were just cut off of a tree that

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.080 
they were just cut off of a tree that
was<00:00:19.470> already<00:00:19.800> shriveling<00:00:20.430> up<00:00:20.609> or<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.060> a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
was already shriveling up or it was a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.460 
was already shriveling up or it was a
bad<00:00:21.330> branch<00:00:21.630> or<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.080> know<00:00:22.199> something<00:00:22.380> like

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
bad branch or you know something like

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.900 
bad branch or you know something like
that<00:00:22.590> basically<00:00:23.100> they<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.519> wrinkles

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
that basically they just have wrinkles

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.640 
that basically they just have wrinkles
in<00:00:24.000> them<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.990> know<00:00:25.109> they're<00:00:25.380> not

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
in them and or you know they're not

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.009 
in them and or you know they're not
looking<00:00:25.949> too<00:00:26.070> healthy<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:27.119> here's<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.900> you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.870 
looking too healthy so here's what you
can<00:00:28.199> actually<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.980> rehabilitate<00:00:29.730> those

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
can actually do to rehabilitate those

and<00:00:36.840> heavy<00:00:37.079> enough<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.710> support<00:00:38.190> cutting

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and heavy enough to support cutting

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.340 
and heavy enough to support cutting
that's<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> sit<00:00:39.750> inside<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.260> of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
that's going to sit inside of it of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.860 
that's going to sit inside of it of
course<00:00:40.850> with<00:00:41.850> water<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.329> fill<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.660> water

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
course with water you fill it with water

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
course with water you fill it with water
and<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.200> stick<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.530> cutting<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.309> would

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and you stick the cutting in it I would

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.459 
and you stick the cutting in it I would
say<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.600> maybe<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.960> week<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> half

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
say for about maybe a week and a half

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.950 
say for about maybe a week and a half
and<00:00:46.969> after<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> week<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.329> half<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.629> notice

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and after a week and a half you notice

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
and after a week and a half you notice
that<00:00:49.140> these<00:00:49.410> wrinkles<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> branches

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that these wrinkles on the branches

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.939 
that these wrinkles on the branches
start<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.270> diminish<00:00:51.719> they<00:00:51.989> either<00:00:52.110> start<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
start to diminish they either start to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.860 
start to diminish they either start to
turn<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> brown<00:00:53.430> color<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.879> they<00:00:54.149> started<00:00:54.510> they

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
turn a brown color and they started they

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990 
turn a brown color and they started they
start<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.440> hard<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.820> plumeria

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
start to get really hard or the plumeria

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
start to get really hard or the plumeria
just<00:00:57.420> plumps<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> stock<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.620> very

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
just plumps up and the stock is very

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.849 
just plumps up and the stock is very
hard<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.399> firm<00:00:59.670> now<00:01:00.570> either<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> those

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
hard and firm now either one of those

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
hard and firm now either one of those
two<00:01:02.219> things<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:02.609> happen<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.149> most<00:01:03.449> people

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
two things will happen and most people

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.500 
two things will happen and most people
when<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.460> wrinkles<00:01:06.150> turning

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
when they see the the wrinkles turning
brown<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.900> hard<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.500> oh<00:01:07.619> my<00:01:07.770> gosh

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
branch or whatever that was shriveled up

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.969 
branch or whatever that was shriveled up
if<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.750> very<00:01:15.930> hard<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> firm<00:01:16.680> after

if it's if it's very hard to firm after

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.620 
if it's if it's very hard to firm after
you've<00:01:17.220> done<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> water<00:01:17.759> treatment<00:01:18.030> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you've done the water treatment that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.810 
you've done the water treatment that
means<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.460> rehabilitated<00:01:20.460> if

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
means it's you know rehabilitated if

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.600 
means it's you know rehabilitated if
it's<00:01:21.090> still<00:01:21.299> soft<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.650> still<00:01:22.890> mushy<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it's still soft and it's still mushy you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.670 
it's still soft and it's still mushy you
know<00:01:23.759> kind<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.119> black<00:01:24.360> rowdy<00:01:24.750> looking<00:01:25.259> then

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
know kind of black rowdy looking then

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
know kind of black rowdy looking then
yeah<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.729> working<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.630> most

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
yeah it's not working and you it's most

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.990 
yeah it's not working and you it's most
likely<00:01:28.170> gonna<00:01:28.320> die<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.189> most<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> time<00:01:29.700> that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
likely gonna die but most the time that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.429 
likely gonna die but most the time that

you can use to rehabilitate chimeric
cuttings<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> lot<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> people<00:01:43.530> out

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
cuttings because a lot of people out

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.429 
cuttings because a lot of people out
there<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:44.189> try<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.399> grow<00:01:44.700> cuttings<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.439> soil

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
there will try to grow cuttings in soil

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.539 
there will try to grow cuttings in soil
and<00:01:46.619> stuff<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.100> are<00:01:47.130> they're<00:01:47.369> water

them too much or whatever and they start
to<00:01:48.990> rot<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:50.130> shriveled<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.820> it's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
to rot and get shriveled up and it's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.600 
to rot and get shriveled up and it's
very<00:01:51.630> easy<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> use<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.560> method<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.250> make

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
try to prevent that as much as possible

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.220 
try to prevent that as much as possible
not<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:17.820> because<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.300> sell<00:02:18.630> plumerias<00:02:19.080> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
not just because I sell plumerias and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.890 
not just because I sell plumerias and
that<00:02:19.320> would<00:02:19.440> take<00:02:19.590> away<00:02:19.800> business<00:02:19.980> from<00:02:20.340> me

them without you know knowing what type

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.440 
them without you know knowing what type
of<00:03:24.930> health<00:03:25.320> level<00:03:25.709> they're<00:03:25.860> at<00:03:25.970> because<00:03:26.970> even

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
of health level they're at because even

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.910 
of health level they're at because even
though<00:03:27.570> they<00:03:27.720> look<00:03:27.989> like<00:03:28.049> they're<00:03:28.470> healthy<00:03:28.769> on

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
though they look like they're healthy on

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.250 
though they look like they're healthy on
the<00:03:28.950> outside<00:03:29.430> inside<00:03:30.269> they<00:03:30.510> could<00:03:30.660> be<00:03:30.810> rotting

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
the outside inside they could be rotting

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.660 
the outside inside they could be rotting
or<00:03:31.500> anything<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.160> won't<00:03:32.310> even<00:03:32.400> know<00:03:32.640> just

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
or anything and you won't even know just

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.449 
or anything and you won't even know just
by<00:03:33.000> looking<00:03:33.299> at<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> outside<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.920> would

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
by looking at the outside so I would

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.759 
by looking at the outside so I would
recommend<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.090> as<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.360> way<00:03:36.630> of

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
recommend this as a way of

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.690 
recommend this as a way of
rehabilitating<00:03:37.769> cuttings<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.310> also

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
rehabilitating cuttings and also

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.449 
rehabilitating cuttings and also
prepping<00:03:39.299> cuttings<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.200> actually<00:03:40.769> be<00:03:40.920> planted

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
prepping cuttings to actually be planted

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.509 
prepping cuttings to actually be planted
so<00:03:42.120> either<00:03:42.570> way<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.380> great<00:03:43.620> method<00:03:43.830> for

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
so either way it's a great method for

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.830 
so either way it's a great method for
you<00:03:44.820> know<00:03:44.940> planting<00:03:45.330> cuttings<00:03:45.690> or

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
rehabilitating cuttings and it worked it

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.310 
rehabilitating cuttings and it worked it
would<00:03:47.730> work<00:03:47.880> well<00:03:48.150> for<00:03:48.330> anybody<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:48.989> go<00:03:49.170> ahead

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
would work well for anybody so go ahead

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.539 
would work well for anybody so go ahead
and<00:03:49.440> give<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.739> try<00:03:49.860> if<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.220> have<00:03:50.340> some
