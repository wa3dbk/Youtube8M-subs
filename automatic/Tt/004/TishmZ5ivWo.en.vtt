00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi everyone I'm fox 565 and I'm here 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.820
 for another criticism of another videogame of 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.530
 3ds the game is mario tennis open but 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.330
 before I want to apologize for my great 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.210
 absence on youtube from here on 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.580
 I will upload some videos of critical tricks 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.340
 or hidden functions of the 3ds and several 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.189
 more things I want to tell you also that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.890
 I will not make videos of the wwf because I 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.140
 stopped liking xd and good as in my 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.179
 previous review I will tell you a bit about 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.189
 what is the game mario tennis open 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.730
 it's a game where the characters of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.190
 Mario, they play tennis, that's not the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 title of the game where the goal then 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.090
 is to play tennis winning tournaments 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.190
 individual or in pairs too 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.860
 we can play matches only by 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.379
 fun and love of the game novelties 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.629
 I play something that has new game but 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.610
 it's not new just different than thanks to 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.649
 the touch screen is that in some 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.260
 parties we can make special shots 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.629
 as bats high hits strong between 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.820
 others the touch screen facilitates us 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.280
 this will appear the drawing on the ground and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 we on the touch screen press 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.850
 depending on the color 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.550
 the blow like that will not be easier to win 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.800
 like also losing something yes that does not have 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.320
 those things like the deck in the wii data 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.240
 of the game the game has several 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.100
 good things like the screen 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 touch that makes us easier to play 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.270
 also that each character has some 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.550
 special game mode and I even had 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.130
 also with the wide choice of 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.840
 characters a total of 20 characters without 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 count the unlockables with the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.180
 qr codes also the offline mode that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.729
 with a playing card playing up to 4 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.920
 people and the online you play with 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.869
 people from your region and a ranking of 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.210
 qualifications and also with the great 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.040
 variety of outfits that you can put on 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.280
 your mii with different abilities each 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.280
 one 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.670
 the game are not only matches too 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.390
 has several mini-games like 'super 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.390
 mario ' tennis 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.729
 i 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.860
 shot to the ring 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.420
 red mania 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.120
 today 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.920
 galactic rally 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.239
 now the critic intro good as the 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.430
 game does not have any kind of story 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.040
 I will have to take the intro the intro is 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.319
 pretty ugly good not ugly but boring 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.450
 and cuts are just a few scenes of 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.580
 the courts of the game and nothing else like 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.010
 the intro of mario tennis power of wii that 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.099
 It's long and fun but good intro 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.410
 I give him the minimum that would be 6 out of 10 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.510
 music the music is good is not so 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.030
 nice or sticky but it looks good 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.390
 game but it's something repetitive I give 7 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.670
 over 10 graphs the graphs are very 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.530
 good those effects that when you give 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.019
 the ball with the purple star looks 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.180
 great the graphics are almost like those of 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.010
 3d land 'but I like the 3d ones 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.930
 land 'for the good use of 3d 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.400
 here 3d looks good but being a 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.769
 game in which there is not much movement 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.660
 of scenarios and so on is not so great 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.000
 and when you want to play at first 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.209
 person can not play with 3D 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.980
 that I give an 8 out of 10 gameplay the 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.379
 playability is very good and with the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.660
 touch screen makes everything easy for you 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.700
 every hit there is an answer and for each 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.950
 response there is a blow the game has 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.160
 an entertaining gameplay that when 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.050
 do not 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.300
 you want for the first time is very addictive 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.280
 but at the time it tires you a little so 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.500
 that is always the same and the parties to 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.190
 Sometimes they have many sets and something does 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.790
 boring 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.740
 I give it an 8 out of 10 difficulty well what 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.110
 that saves and compensates a lot this game 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.970
 is the difficulty the difficulty is good 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.950
 in the final cup and also so 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.170
 change the scenario at every moment what 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.810
 it's great and in master mode it's fine 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.850
 difficult that's what I liked except 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.590
 that in the last tournaments there are many 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.600
 sets and being difficult it does it extremely 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.970
 long and somewhat boring 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.400
 I give a 9 out of 10 well if we add 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.040
 The whole game has a total of 7 points 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.110
 6 the game seems good to me in particular 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.600
 but it's not so good I think it's good 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.430
 that qualification to add something the 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.350
 First-person mode sucks 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.600
 due to what the character moves 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.880
 only the only thing you do is press 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.220
 the buttons but well I think it 's 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.410
 rating is good and good with that 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.690
 I finish this analysis and criticize Mario 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.880
 open tennis and you know if they have any 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.590
 indifference claim between me 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.510
 and you can tell me for the 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.460
 comments and if you liked it and want 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.440
 congratulate me or give me advice 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.690

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.590
 mentioned at the beginning of the video and 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.289

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.840
