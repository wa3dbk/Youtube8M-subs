00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.690
 hypothermia hypothermia represents 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.140
 a decrease in the temperature of the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.019
 human body 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.030
 these main causes are immersion 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.519
 in cold water and prolonged exposure 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.210
 at low temperatures 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.980
 especially in clothes 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.150
 wet 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.510
 the degree of hypothermia symptoms 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.220
 can vary the tremor and the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.109
 speech disorders are the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.140
 first signs 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.970
 the victim is conscious but discreet 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.450
 in the progression of discomfort its cost 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.829
 decreases and his breathing becomes slow 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.989
 a lack of coordination 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.059
 an appearance of irrationality 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.870
 confusion and drowsiness characterizes 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.480
 the victim at the final stage she breathes 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.680
 barely his pulse and irregular is 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.690
 almost nonexistent at this stage the loss 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.969
 of conscience remains a threat 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.120
 constant and care is required 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.760
 urgent 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.109
 how to treat hypothermia 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.239
 firstly it is important to move the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.510
 victim of hypothermia from the source of 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.070
 cold it is urgent to remove it from 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.320
 water keeping it sheltered from the wind 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.159
 and spray inside the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.560
 boat cabin 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.810
 if possible, remove his clothes 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
 wet and wrap it in a bag of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.340
 sleeping or covering it with blanket 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.659
 of wool 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.000
 it is essential to stop the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.549
 cooling the body while warming 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.729
 the person slowly and slowly and 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.720
 as appropriate replace the clothes 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.860
 wet by dry clothes 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.600
 wrapped the person with 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.250
 blankets cover the head and neck of 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.229
 the person using a tuque or a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.619
 scarf because heat losses are 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.479
 important at these places warm up the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.479
 nobody with hot and dry objects 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.180
 if the condition of the victim allows him to 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.100
 hold a cup 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.619
 it's good to give him a drink 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.450
 syed liquid such as soup 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.759
 coffee tea or cocoa are 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.149
 not recommended because they are irritants 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.290
 cardiac never give alcohol to 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.840
 a victim of hypothermia 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.170
 because alcohol produces no heat 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.880
 on the body it is very simple 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.160
 yet not to massage or rub 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.110
 the body surface as this activates the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.930
 blood circulation and cold blood 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.930
 limbs goes back to vital organs
