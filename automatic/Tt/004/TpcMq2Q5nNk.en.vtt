00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.830
 two very precious qualities one of those 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 percent what we use 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.800
 the garbage for this irrigation system 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.200

 after 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.550
 finally a very good system for the plant 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.309

 the amount of water that falls 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.939
 can venture a liter and a half of water can last for example a couple of days 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.459
