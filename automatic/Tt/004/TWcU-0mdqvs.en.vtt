00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.580
 so we now look once under her 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.610
 driver's seat of the team after I enter 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.010
 have rebuilt you see here, the b to b 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 The baby will be from the first battery 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.520
 powered by the vehicle he then generates 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.600
 a higher voltage adapted 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.600
 can be on the following 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.720
 battery type and then load it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.220
 the ride when the machine is not running 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.470
 the additional batteries installed 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.610
 are 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.949
 another advantage is 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.420
 unlike the trend relay that one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.350
 higher voltage is generated with it when 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:14.640
 The batteries also full to reach 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.890
 a much higher state of charge 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.020
 b-to-b also monitors the voltage of the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.550
 first battery means you can not 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.290
 accidentally the first battery is empty 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.899
 drive around the second battery 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.970
 to refill the b to b works off 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.039
 a voltage of 13 5 volts from the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.380
 first battery then only starts 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.190
 state of charge as I said you can 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.690
 adjust charge to each battery type 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.119
 and thus an optimal loading result 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.970
 reach and the battery or the battery 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.929
 maximum protection 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.209
 I have the whole thing now as follows 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.709
 built up 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:50.849
 Here is the maximum distance to the housing 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:52.380
 from the battery to the poles and on 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.149
 the same side that has of course 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.880
 the disadvantage that here once 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.789
 must be crossed of course that leads 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.899
 at a slightly higher voltage loss and 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.819
 that you have a bit higher k here 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.950
 But I realized it was just too easy 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.759
 Dangerously continue with the battery 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.630
 the metal parts to come 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.069
 In general it is so that all 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.760
 live part now up here 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.280
 are alone 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.849
 that means I can not do anything 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.569
 happen 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.870
 There must be no tension from anywhere 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.040
 then be inadvertently diverted 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.599
 that we are already the proud ones 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.430
 namely to get on the bars then 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.590
 equal 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.299
 the protective housing the whole then too 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.879
 protect accordingly 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:38.549
 so it does not afterwards problems ried 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:40.950
 or short circuits of the other we have 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.159
 here two sockets now twice two 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.200
 additional sockets for 12 o'clock in it 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.590
 are fed and where we do not 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.590
 be able to win 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.719
 230 volt charger on the 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.439
 Schedule should be used or 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.590
 or 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.450
 because before 30 wanted to get it and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.090
 the generator does not speak machine 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.280
 the mobile will be switched off then will 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.530
 also can it available on the here 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.510
 campsite or via a generator 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:17.519
 or were other 230 volt power source 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.109
 also the system of the second 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.469
 third fourth battery filled up 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.639
 become 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:24.629
 You can see the picture from the campsite 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.200
 if necessary with full batteries 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.200
 Get rid of 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.080
 so that no problem is under use 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.690
 closes the whole then with one 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.100
 appropriate step magic off 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.600
 not so easy the protective cap on it 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:54.340
 to make and try at the same time 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:58.180
 want to use camera 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.310
 I do not have the screws with me now 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.610
 is that covered 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.900
 there is no danger that either 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.500
 live parts contact from the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.290
 get battery contact up to the seat 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.820
 so that's my installation in the second 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.820
 Battery in my t 4
