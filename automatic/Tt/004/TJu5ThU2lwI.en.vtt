00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 the beginning let's sort the chorus he plays like that 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.680
 [music] 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.249
 [music] 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.770
 here you present fifth on 6 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.120
 country 4 frets 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.730
 [music] 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.730
 further from 2 to 6 countries 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.060
 once fast we play fifth from 6 to 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.040
 5 countries 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.090
 farther quinto from open 6 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:45.410
 from 5 second 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:01:19.379
 and from 5 or 4 play that fight 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:01:19.379
 [music] 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.160
 then we go to buy the original 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.200
 The guitar version of the song is only in 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.170
 second verse and she plays the same 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.280
 part of the chorus at the Vani concert 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:50.369
 performs such a thing 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:50.369
 [music] 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.690
 here we have three chords 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.750
 Quint from 4 to 6 strings and from 2 to 6 strings 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.570
 and and chord e 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.200
 either both major 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:14.560
 we hold the first chord playing 6 5 4 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.710
 and 1 2 3 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.410
 [music] 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.780
 1 2 and 3 hidden 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.910
 [music] 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.920
 then we put a second chord play those 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.810
 same countries 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.459
 [music] 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.310
 after we put the third chord playing 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.310
 again the fifth fifth 4 1 2 3 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.220
 and then 6 5 4 3 and we are silent until the end 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.020
 next measure 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.880
 [music] 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.710
 after that everything is played the same way 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.270
 Only 1 block does not beat 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.690
 differently 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.690
 already 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.930
 we play 6 5 4 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.420
 then 4 by 8 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.830
 then again 4 at the sixth 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.240
 and 5 clamped our master of ceremonies 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.540
 [music] 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.880
 and again we continue just like 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.740
 many played we pinch on the fourth 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.040
 string 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.850
 6 fret on the third string 8 and on the second 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.799
 string 9 playing 4 3 2 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.950
 [music] 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:46.570
 we hold the fourth on the fourth 3 6 and 2 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.680
 on the seventh and edge again 4 3 2 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.970
 [music] 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.940
 In principle, you can collect 4 3 2 1 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.190
 [music] 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.750
 they are in different places playing it all by 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.580
 so do differently for your 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.220
 discretion either 4 3 2 or 4 3 2 1 or 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:11.230
 total 4 3 1 2 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.420
 [music] 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.209
 what do you like more do not be afraid 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.570
 experiment play your own way 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.549
 next we clamp 4 on the second third on 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:27.880
 fourth and second too on fourth 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:30.060
 play 4 3 2 and here we play 2 on 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.020
 fifth 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.639
 [music] 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.080
 then leaving it with your finger and playing again 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.550
 fourth 3 second and first 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.550
 [music] 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.220
 and again we are silent until the end of the tact and again 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.170
 us all repeats on these elements 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.120
 guitar part ends song 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.730
 very simple so you can 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.620
 try to add your own elements 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.620
 experiment you will succeed
