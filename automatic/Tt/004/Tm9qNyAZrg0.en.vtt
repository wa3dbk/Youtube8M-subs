king g2 very nice

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.170 
king g2 very nice
in<00:03:16.340> fact<00:03:17.150> if<00:03:17.870> he<00:03:17.930> doubles<00:03:18.350> King<00:03:18.620> G<00:03:18.800> two<00:03:19.180> tanks

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
in fact if he doubles King G two tanks

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:35.440 
in fact if he doubles King G two tanks
or<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.540> h1<00:03:21.100> his<00:03:22.100> mate<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:34.820> looks<00:03:35.000> pretty

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
or a h1 his mate that looks pretty

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.100

crushing neither of King G to her that

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.230 
crushing neither of King G to her that
so<00:03:42.260> if<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.470> takes<00:03:42.800> this<00:03:43.100> rope<00:03:43.280> h1<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:43.820> takes<00:03:44.030> the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
so if it takes this rope h1 it takes the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.170 
so if it takes this rope h1 it takes the
rook<00:03:44.590> let's<00:03:45.590> rotate<00:03:45.770> six<00:03:48.100> okay<00:03:49.130> that<00:03:49.970> really

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
rook let's rotate six okay that really

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.710 
rook let's rotate six okay that really
works

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
works

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.020 
works
so<00:03:51.230> having<00:03:51.440> be<00:03:51.800> five<00:03:52.130> now

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030
