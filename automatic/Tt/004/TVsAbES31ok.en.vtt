00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
so I've already removed my nail polish

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.940 
so I've already removed my nail polish
and<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.540> nail<00:00:09.660> polish<00:00:09.900> remover<00:00:10.350> I<00:00:10.380> use<00:00:10.680> is

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
and the nail polish remover I use is

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.650 
and the nail polish remover I use is
this<00:00:11.220> one<00:00:11.460> even<00:00:12.120> though<00:00:12.300> it's<00:00:12.510> without

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
this one even though it's without

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.049 
this one even though it's without
acetone<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.410> works<00:00:13.620> really<00:00:13.860> well<00:00:13.980> I've<00:00:14.850> read

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
acetone it works really well I've read

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.490 
acetone it works really well I've read
that<00:00:15.209> it's<00:00:15.389> actually<00:00:15.780> better<00:00:15.959> to<00:00:16.049> use<00:00:16.260> pure

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
that it's actually better to use pure

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.230 
that it's actually better to use pure
acetone<00:00:16.800> as<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.340> more<00:00:17.520> effective<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.210> I

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
acetone as it is more effective but I

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.740 
acetone as it is more effective but I
don't<00:00:18.450> know<00:00:18.539> where<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.810> buy<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.500> yeah

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
don't know where to buy it so yeah

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
don't know where to buy it so yeah
moving<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.110> remove<00:00:22.650> my<00:00:22.800> cuticles<00:00:23.250> when<00:00:23.430> I'm

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
moving on I remove my cuticles when I'm

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.980 
moving on I remove my cuticles when I'm
in<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> shower<00:00:23.940> because<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.540> warm<00:00:24.750> water

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
in the shower because the warm water

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.630 
in the shower because the warm water
will<00:00:25.290> soften<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.980> make<00:00:26.100> them<00:00:26.220> easier<00:00:26.490> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
will soften them and make them easier to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.670 
will soften them and make them easier to
remove<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.690> show<00:00:27.870> you<00:00:27.930> how<00:00:28.110> I<00:00:28.140> remove<00:00:28.380> my

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
remove to show you how I remove my

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.260 
remove to show you how I remove my
cuticles<00:00:29.100> let's<00:00:29.430> just<00:00:29.730> pretend<00:00:29.940> that<00:00:30.120> this

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
cuticles let's just pretend that this

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.569 
cuticles let's just pretend that this
bottle<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.630> warm<00:00:30.840> water<00:00:31.110> is<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> shower<00:00:31.620> so

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
bottle of warm water is the shower so

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.310 
bottle of warm water is the shower so
after<00:00:32.879> my<00:00:32.969> nails<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.390> soaked<00:00:33.629> for<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:33.899> 10

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
after my nails have soaked for about 10

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.049 
after my nails have soaked for about 10
minutes<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.100> jump<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> scrape<00:00:35.670> off<00:00:35.910> my

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
minutes I just jump to scrape off my

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.329 
minutes I just jump to scrape off my
cuticles<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.899> nail<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.800> might<00:00:38.039> seem<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
cuticles with my nail this might seem a

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.130 
cuticles with my nail this might seem a
little<00:00:38.429> bit<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.910> hygienic<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.719> I've<00:00:39.899> done

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
little bit and hygienic but I've done

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.049 
little bit and hygienic but I've done
this<00:00:40.289> for<00:00:40.350> over<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.829> year<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.370> I've<00:00:41.699> never<00:00:41.850> had

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
this for over a year and I've never had

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.389 
this for over a year and I've never had
any<00:00:42.269> problems<00:00:42.749> with<00:00:42.839> infections<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:43.920> anything

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
any problems with infections or anything

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.299 
any problems with infections or anything
like<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.609> I<00:00:45.710> know<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.100> many

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
like that I know there are many

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.610 
like that I know there are many
misconceptions<00:00:47.519> about<00:00:48.329> what<00:00:48.749> the<00:00:49.109> cuticle<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
misconceptions about what the cuticle is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.459 
misconceptions about what the cuticle is
so<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.159> going<00:00:50.339> to<00:00:50.519> quickly<00:00:50.789> explain<00:00:51.179> it

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
so I'm just going to quickly explain it

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.750 
so I'm just going to quickly explain it
the<00:00:52.469> skin<00:00:52.739> around<00:00:52.949> your<00:00:53.129> nail<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the skin around your nail is the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.849 
the skin around your nail is the
proximal<00:00:54.210> nail<00:00:54.390> fold<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> cuticle<00:00:55.710> as

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
proximal nail fold not the cuticle as

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:56.689 
proximal nail fold not the cuticle as
many<00:00:56.069> people<00:00:56.370> think

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
many people think

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
many people think
unlike<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> proximal<00:00:58.019> nail<00:00:58.140> fold<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
unlike the proximal nail fold the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.590 
unlike the proximal nail fold the
cuticle<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.219> dead<00:00:59.429> skin<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.179> completely

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
cuticle is dead skin so it's completely

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.509 
cuticle is dead skin so it's completely
safe<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> remove<00:01:01.199> however<00:01:02.069> it's<00:01:02.309> still

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
safe to remove however it's still

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.310 
safe to remove however it's still
important<00:01:03.089> to<00:01:03.120> make<00:01:03.329> sure<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.749> the<00:01:03.960> cuticle

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
important to make sure that the cuticle

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.290 
important to make sure that the cuticle
is<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.920> soft<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.700> you're<00:01:05.880> gentle

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
is really soft and that you're gentle

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.990 
is really soft and that you're gentle
when<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.450> scrape<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.810> off<00:01:07.340> I'm<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> cut

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
when you scrape it off I'm going to cut

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
when you scrape it off I'm going to cut
my<00:01:09.150> nails<00:01:09.180> all<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.690> way<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> take<00:01:10.649> up

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
my nails all the way down so I take up

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
my nails all the way down so I take up
some<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> lengths<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.640> nail<00:01:11.820> clippers

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
some of the lengths with nail clippers

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
some of the lengths with nail clippers
my<00:01:12.899> nails<00:01:13.110> are<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.590> dry<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.219> I<00:01:14.280> always<00:01:14.640> cut

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
my nails are very dry so I always cut

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.389 
my nails are very dry so I always cut
them<00:01:15.090> directly<00:01:15.570> after<00:01:15.869> I've<00:01:16.079> showered<00:01:16.399> this

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
them directly after I've showered this

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.160 
them directly after I've showered this
is<00:01:17.579> because<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> warm<00:01:18.270> water<00:01:18.509> will<00:01:18.719> also<00:01:18.869> make

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
is because the warm water will also make

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.780 
is because the warm water will also make
the<00:01:19.290> actual<00:01:19.530> nail<00:01:19.740> softer<00:01:20.130> preventing<00:01:20.640> them

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the actual nail softer preventing them

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.149 
the actual nail softer preventing them
from<00:01:20.820> chipping<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.719> they're<00:01:21.840> cast<00:01:22.159> after

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
from chipping when they're cast after

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.249 
from chipping when they're cast after
I've<00:01:23.490> cut<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.969> my<00:01:24.119> nails<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.630> Pat<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.110> dry

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
I've cut all of my nails I Pat them dry

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.289 
I've cut all of my nails I Pat them dry
and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:25.710> apply<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:26.039> cuticle<00:01:26.399> and<00:01:26.759> an<00:01:26.939> oil

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
and then apply some cuticle and an oil

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.350 
and then apply some cuticle and an oil
I<00:01:27.770> left<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> oil<00:01:29.070> sit<00:01:29.399> for<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> few<00:01:29.850> minutes<00:01:30.149> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
I left the oil sit for a few minutes and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690 
I left the oil sit for a few minutes and
then<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.539> massage<00:01:30.899> it<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.399> then<00:01:32.399> I<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:32.670> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
then I massage it in then I use a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.429 
then I massage it in then I use a
crystal<00:01:33.000> file<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.539> file<00:01:33.689> straight<00:01:33.960> across<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
crystal file and file straight across to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.499 
crystal file and file straight across to
shape<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.770> nails<00:01:34.799> square<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.460> always<00:01:36.090> file<00:01:36.329> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
shape my nails square I always file in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.910 
shape my nails square I always file in
one<00:01:36.659> direction<00:01:36.810> when<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.320> use<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.590> crystal

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
one direction when I use the crystal
