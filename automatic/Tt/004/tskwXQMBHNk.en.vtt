wearing rose-colored glasses as I post
this<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.920> I'm<00:00:35.489> thinking<00:00:36.050> that<00:00:37.050> wrestling<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
this and I'm thinking that wrestling is

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.850 
this and I'm thinking that wrestling is
above<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.790> beyond<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.360> media<00:00:39.840> scrutiny<00:00:40.410> but

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
above and beyond the media scrutiny but

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.500 
above and beyond the media scrutiny but
I<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.040> think<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.670> being<00:00:41.879> unfairly

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I do think that it's being unfairly

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.770 
I do think that it's being unfairly
targeted<00:00:43.290> specifically<00:00:43.829> after<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.390> Nancy

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.350 
targeted specifically after the Nancy
