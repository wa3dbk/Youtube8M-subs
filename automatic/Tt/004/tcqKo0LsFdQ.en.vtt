00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everyone in this video we are going to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.810
 learn how to make a dragon paper phyto 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.929
 like this one here the only thing 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.559
 we need is a square sheet of ones 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.299
 15 centimeters or so we started what 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.539
 first thing we do is mark the two 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.090
 we mark a split and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.070
 we mark the other there are hundreds of 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.859
 dragons in the world of origami but 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.160
 I found this simple and friendly in 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.450
 a future of other models 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.790
 so perfect we unfold 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.340
 and now what we do is take this 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.070
 sheet of paper and take it to the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.800
 bone center to the central line that 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.600
 I just scored not much care here 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.970
 with the little corners you know that always 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.180
 we are rebels we unfold and do what 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.690
 same with this tab took up the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.690
 center 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:00.000
 and I always take care in the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.830
 little corner we unfolded very well 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.070
 180 degrees the paper and we repeat the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.730
 process in this area came this plate 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.730
 To the center 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.520
 A) Yes 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.009
 perfect unfold and do the same 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.329
 with this and we would have these four 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:23.509
 basic divisions completed good 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.980
 because we do this now we see it and 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.050
 unfold 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.270
 very well I have here this line and 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.220
 I have this line what I'm going to do is 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.790
 go around here bending here 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.590
 and I'm crushing 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.480
 and I am forming here a little bit 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 important and I'm crushing crushing 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.590
 crushing until you reach the point in the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.840
 that the two lines are cut 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.750
 and what I do with this piquito for what 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.439
 knocked to the right for example so 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.439
 it seems right to me ok we have this 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.750
 structure we turn 180 degrees the figure 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.050
 and we do the same here 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.750
 I'm closing by these lines I close 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.000
 I close I close I reached the point of 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.070
 cut should have this little bit but in 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.350
 this time he knocks it to the left 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.880
 not because the paper rotates 180 degrees but 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.200
 Well, it's exactly the same to put them 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.280
 one way to the other what 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.450
 important is that both are in the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.400
 same sense very well we take the figure 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.220
 of paper like that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.549
 we turn it around and go down this 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.480
 tab is lowered alone without problem and 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.730
 Now what we are going to do is what 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.140
 next is an interesting step I'm going to 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.960
 Bend 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.459
 this little eyelash that I just downloaded 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.709
 I'm not going to fold it on the line that 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.680
 connect to these two vertices I'm going to 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.430
 fold on a line that is lower 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.830
 for example around here and a 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.490
 line that is around here pretty much what 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.819
 I do and see it 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.489
 I'm going to fold but I stop before 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.530
 you see that I have not reached the vertex and nothing 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.150
 he simply completed the division and already 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.620
 is here nothing has happened with this 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.940
 we managed to give it more realism in the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.830
 figure 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.810
 we leave the paper like this and now divided to 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:10.099
 Half here around here 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.250
 that is, we divide our figurine and much 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.349
 be careful with the tips because the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.510
 paper starts to be dangerous man 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.440
 there are figures with hundreds of steps and 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.910
 then yes you have to have a lot 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.830
 careful is this one does not have many 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.819
 but good 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.700
 we have this structure 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.050
 we put it in this position here we have 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.060
 a list and here is the other 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.980
 over here there is a line I do not know if you see it 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.580
 you will see it in your very paper 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.850
 weak here marked 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.700
 lame is the mine and bent it so that 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.030
 just fall the edge on that line 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.370
 almost perfect you see the typical 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.510
 wings we do not flip the paper and 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.990
 we do the same with the other with the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.500
 partner doubled and more or less I stay 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:00.120
 that's how it's worth, the other one is not 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.530
 we turn the paper over to leave it 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.300
 how was it 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.400
 I have this blade had doubled it 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.640
 so that this falls right on this 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.290
 line is worth it and then we are going to invest 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.120
 this division to make the head the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.440
 neck are not these typical divisions that 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.350
 They are also very common in 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.000
 birds for example 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.730
 we have this unfolded open here and 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.140
 I'm going to invest this division you know 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.930
 to invest I'm crushing I'm going 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.820
 closing the paper turns around and 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.760
 we have the same thing that we had before but 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.689
 the paper is inverted 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.159
 so very well 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.679
 and now let's take a step a little 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:39.319
 more delicate good more or less we are going to 

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:42.229
 open here and I'm going to double this 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:46.699
 eyelash on a line that connects 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.689
 these two points are worth I have this I open a 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.750
 bit 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.129
 raised all this 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.770
 more or less 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:57.800
 until you reach the 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.020
 to the vertices these well we go with 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.950
 cautious 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.770
 because once we have this we close 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.169
 the figure 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.900
 and we have the neck of our 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.940
 dragon not now here we can manipulate 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.039
 this a little bit if you want is worth the 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.590
 hands to look for another orientation but 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.680
 I like it like it was for example 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.500
 do not 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.590
 for the head then what always 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.770
 we first make a rough division 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.770
 A) Yes 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.479
 we unfold 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.690
 we open here and we are going to invest 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.690
 division 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.810
 well more or less but what's up this 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.789
 head like that does not make much sense 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.289
 it looks more like a bird because nothing 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.479
 we do a little trick and here has not 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:50.009
 past nothing we just open a 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:52.630
 little head and hide paper 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:56.140
 we hide something like this 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.690
 and we close again and I enter we have 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.040
 a square head and it 's like more 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.710
 sense we can also put other 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.530
 orientations I like more or less 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.900
 that is so good because we make the tail 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.900
 and already and we're done with forgiveness that almost 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.630
 I break the camera we turn around I go to 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.990
 double here 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:19.030
 I bring you all this tail like this 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.170
 it and now I will invest is 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.610
 division is the same as we did with the 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.920
 head exactly the same but with more 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.270
 paper 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.320
 unfold I open here and I'm going to invest 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.960
 all this division 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.500
 so beware that here there is already enough 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.830
 paper 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.710
 so it has to be perfect all 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.660
 horizontal the division started here already 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.480
 we have this and now as we did with the 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.820
 head I'm going to open up a little 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.200
 and I'm going to double all this again but 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.150
 I'm not going to double down the line that connects 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.380
 these two points is worth I'm going to be a 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.560
 shortly before I will double more or less 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.930
 I go through a line that goes through here 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.529
 and we see it we have this we 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.390
 be lost 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:05.400
 I open the paper a little, I fold everything 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.520
 well you see that you have not reached 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.440
 the vertices I stay here and now 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.600
 I return to close the figure and while 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.890
 I close the paper and it turns around and 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.860
 now this queue will be a bit rebellious 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.020
 ok we oriented it a little bit and I 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.380
 like to put the horizontal 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.930
 so perfect 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.610
 worth nothing is simply to make a 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.500
 fold fold and double back what 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.849
 it happens that it is difficult to maneuver sometimes 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.580
 in such small areas 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:34.919
 Now I'm going to fold a little bit like that 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.689
 paper this is approximate to give 

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:38.039
 realism I just hide a little bit 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:40.889
 of paper so that the body is more 

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:43.830
 I do the same thing around here 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:46.220
 a little bit of paper nothing something like that or 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.790
 less does not matter much either 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.080
 and now a couple of final details that 

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:55.630
 They make the figure that much 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.630
 best curve mos the tail 

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:02.780
 well more or less not and we're also going to 

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:06.530
 bend the curve wings let's go a little bit 

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.510
 around here kurt we go like that you know 

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.680
 not these last minute details that 

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.920
 they always help the figure stay 

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.880
 better and we would have in principle the 

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.130
 finished dragoncito 

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:21.020
 I hope you liked it and how 

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.020
 We always see each other in another video
