00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm here to record. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.720
 you 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.250
 the Turkish and the little room of Miguel 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.570
 finally got ready and here at the door 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.570
 from the room 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.180
 this room was an office here in 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.510
 House 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.820
 so we adapted true to the curtain 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:35.969
 He does not have that bench here. 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:39.570
 I immediately put the dresser in the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.040
 We preferred to keep the bench for more 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.710
 front he can use to study 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:53.600
 and has a niche up there 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:57.210
 some pets there are some gifts 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.760
 I told him to name him with these 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:06.949
 letters at the vital pregnant woman's fair 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.949
 little book he got a baby shower 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.229
 down here I improvised a way like this 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:20.820
 I already had this box has a bunny 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.530
 here he also won and the baby 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 comfort that is up here by 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.540
 While 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.799
 and all this part of the closet here 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.549
 drawer 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.820
 we still use the office 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.520
 computer is still on the phone and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.409
 I put the sixth place is to put the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.740
 laundry downstairs and an animal to 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.119
 play cotton swab 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.119
 so here 's the rope 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:03.850
 on this other wall where you put the paper 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:08.420
 wallpaper by placing three niches 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.840
 I wanted to do the nautical theme but nothing 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.390
 very exaggerated with which the little animals that 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.000
 had to do with the sea 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.060
 the animals I bought there in 25 2t and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.820
 I think 60 reais in the three much 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.850
 down here has the armchair of 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.269
 breast-feeding 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:37.790
 this rug I put a neutral tone 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:41.300
 also have a small table to have the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.019
 support is to place a 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.760
 breastfeeding needs to support something 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:50.050
 who has another little book that he won 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.050

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:02.100
 and here is the cradle 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:05.520

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.040

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.600
 I left his stroller here for now. 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.600
 and this part of the closet here 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.620

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:35.340

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.690
 so this is it, this is the little room 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.990

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.550
