00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
hence the reason why all the previous

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.190 
hence the reason why all the previous
clips<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.380> kind<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.100> missed<00:02:40.720> every<00:02:41.720> time<00:02:41.930> apart

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
clips I kind of missed every time apart

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.040 
clips I kind of missed every time apart
from<00:02:42.380> wants<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.210> then<00:02:44.210> I<00:02:44.300> got<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.600> outer<00:02:44.720> ring

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
from wants and then I got the outer ring

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.400 
from wants and then I got the outer ring
so<00:02:45.350> then<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.620> was<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:46.510> bit<00:02:47.510> crap<00:02:47.750> really<00:02:47.990> how<00:02:48.350> to

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
so then it was a bit crap really how to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.490 
so then it was a bit crap really how to
answer<00:02:48.740> your<00:02:49.280> question<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:50.720> quite
