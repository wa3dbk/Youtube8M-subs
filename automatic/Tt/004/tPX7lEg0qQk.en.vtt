00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.040
 the mobile now we scream the usb 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.000
 keeping pressing the key after looking 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.000
 we connect the user 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.020
 or something like that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.020
 and start and install it 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:07.740
 estrada understand and disconnect now 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.740
 we have pressed 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:18.060
 and it will start to restart 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.060
 from here on the stick 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.260
 delete files if you want to address by 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.380
 the case here quickly give the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.380
 key 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.030
 once medium and recovery may take 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.340
 a little bit between valence and what to give 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.130
 all the time the button you have to go 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.510
 do a white datafactory reset is 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.510
 It is the third option 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.100
 this is how to start formatting we hope to 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.680
 that that format 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.590
 then he came to make a backup in case 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.170
 but perhaps if a backup storage 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.050
 these house files let's go let's 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.569
 uruguay cache partition that is the fourth 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.260
 option we give to yes 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.689
 and until now we are going to urge 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.969
 type flowers sd card 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.599
 from sd card and we will search for files 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:33.440
 that we have that we have put to the sd here 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.710
 is my version 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.490
 three sections of age that you would like 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.490
 start installing 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.910
 now we go in the video so that 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.760
 install and now I return mother we are of 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.260
 Jazz spin installed may 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.200
 install car complete the descent 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.990
 decade ago we are going to give you wood system 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.290
 side and we will start to restart the 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.290
 mobile 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.730
 both the attic are worth initiating is what 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.070
 late because it 's a new one that we've 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.260
 installed take a little then the 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.470
 that this law will take a bit 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.060
 it's going to happen a little bit to make it 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.910
 in half so that you see that give a 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.139
 little is normal for the start to take a 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.180
 little so a little patience 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.770
 here begins to start no longer 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.830
 it took a lot on the start screen 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.169
 the piece is x but a bit a good 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.990
 not much time but a little worth is already 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.990
 does not kill this bar with much 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.999
 ok here you choose this we give to 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.960
 default launcher is worth the other no 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.909
 I know what it is 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.490
 I do not think it 's the screen blocker 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:51.319
 just do not give him there I think there's only a 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.319
 the many more and take a little 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.260
 fully charged and alternate a little 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.260
 in boot 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.539
 this was already initiated can 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.849
 take a little while to start this is the 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.919
 notifications bar we can change 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.259
 the design if we want to leave here 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.080
 down where he puts subjects we can change 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.150
 Here there is the camera is very good 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.699
 would do very well if he waited and we left him 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.980
 rest for a while and with 15 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.740
 minutes out there will make roy very well 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.530
 the music is also very good for 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.840
 music the application is good 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.200
 here these calls agents messages 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.790
 browser valeri to you 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.120

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.990
 I break you Kiko as I told you we're going 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.710
 to what the system is and we're going to 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.710
 bring the phone closer 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.860
 if here the irrigation system bones is the 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.080
 vision 20 and 2.3 can not be seen does not look good 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.690
 2.3 Android points so whether it's already 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.080

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.790
 here you have notifications and this 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.340
 then change the language once it happens 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.600
 a good bearish time of this branch is 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.310
