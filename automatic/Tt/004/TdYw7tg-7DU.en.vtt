I want to show you an easy way to shrink
a<00:00:15.750> mold<00:00:16.020> using<00:00:16.949> your<00:00:17.160> original<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.090> make<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.510> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
a mold using your original and make it a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.000 
a mold using your original and make it a
mole<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> same<00:00:19.140> way<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.350> normally<00:00:19.800> would<00:00:22.010> you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
mole the same way you normally would you

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
mole the same way you normally would you
take<00:00:23.220> your<00:00:23.369> original<00:00:23.960> glue<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.080> down<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
take your original glue it down to a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.540 
take your original glue it down to a

mold base seal off any areas where you

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.189 
mold base seal off any areas where you
don't<00:00:29.730> want<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> silicone<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> flow<00:00:30.869> through

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
don't want the silicone to flow through

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.250 
don't want the silicone to flow through
here<00:00:31.679> we're<00:00:31.830> using<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.219> tape<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.780> construct

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
here we're using the tape and construct

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.170 
here we're using the tape and construct
the<00:00:34.380> mold<00:00:34.590> box<00:00:34.829> around<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.280> piece<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.969> same

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the mold box around your piece the same

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.670 
the mold box around your piece the same
way<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.390> would<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.989> were<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.140> making<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
way you would if you were just making a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.729 
way you would if you were just making a
regular<00:00:37.890> mold<00:00:43.129> glue<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.340> seal<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.820> box<00:00:45.739> down

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
regular mold glue and seal the box down

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.950 
regular mold glue and seal the box down
to<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> base<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.180> very<00:00:48.390> important<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
to the base this is very important and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.420 
to the base this is very important and
I'll<00:00:49.020> show<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.489> why<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> minute<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:53.160> trick

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
I'll show you why in a minute the trick

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.910 
I'll show you why in a minute the trick
of<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> shrinking<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:55.020> mold<00:00:55.260> comes<00:00:55.710> with

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
of the shrinking your mold comes with

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.369 
of the shrinking your mold comes with
how<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.129> mix<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.550> silicone<00:00:57.289> you're<00:00:58.289> gonna

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
how you mix your silicone you're gonna

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.889 
how you mix your silicone you're gonna
mix<00:00:58.680> your<00:00:58.949> silicone<00:00:59.760> still<00:01:00.120> ten-to-one<00:01:00.570> by

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
mix your silicone still ten-to-one by

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.150 
mix your silicone still ten-to-one by
weight<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.649> we're<00:01:01.800> using<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
weight here we're using the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.820 
weight here we're using the
high-strength<00:01:02.550> too<00:01:03.350> but<00:01:04.350> we're<00:01:04.470> gonna<00:01:04.559> add<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
high-strength too but we're gonna add a

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100 
high-strength too but we're gonna add a
part<00:01:05.280> C<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> third<00:01:06.090> component<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:07.020> that's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
part C or a third component and that's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.250 
part C or a third component and that's
odorless<00:01:07.680> mineral<00:01:07.710> spirits<00:01:09.260> odorless

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
odorless mineral spirits odorless

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.219 
odorless mineral spirits odorless
mineral<00:01:10.290> spirits<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.210> solvent<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.080> be

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
mineral spirits is a solvent that can be

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.149 
mineral spirits is a solvent that can be
added<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> silicone<00:01:15.979> here<00:01:16.979> we're<00:01:17.130> using

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
added to the silicone here we're using

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.230 
added to the silicone here we're using
about<00:01:17.610> 30<00:01:18.030> percent<00:01:18.770> by<00:01:19.770> weight<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.939> still

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
about 30 percent by weight so we still

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
about 30 percent by weight so we still
use<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.780> base<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.799> catalyst<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.490> an

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
use the base in the catalyst as an

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.630 
use the base in the catalyst as an
attendant<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.360> ratio<00:01:24.979> but<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.159> instance<00:01:26.280> if

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
attendant one ratio but for instance if

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.990 
attendant one ratio but for instance if
we<00:01:26.790> had<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.299> hundred<00:01:27.930> grams<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:29.100> would<00:01:29.250> add<00:01:29.400> 30

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
we had a hundred grams we would add 30

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.429 
we had a hundred grams we would add 30
grams<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:32.030> odorless<00:01:33.030> mineral<00:01:33.060> spirits<00:01:36.439> this

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
grams of odorless mineral spirits this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
grams of odorless mineral spirits this
will<00:01:37.650> greatly<00:01:37.950> thin<00:01:38.400> down<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> silicone<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
will greatly thin down the silicone and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.410 
will greatly thin down the silicone and
as<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.520> actually<00:01:41.700> leaked

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
as you can see here it actually leaked

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.870 
as you can see here it actually leaked
out<00:01:43.049> our<00:01:43.320> mold<00:01:43.590> box<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:44.250> why<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.520> very

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
out our mold box that's why it's very

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.300 
out our mold box that's why it's very
very<00:01:45.149> important<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> seal<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> mold<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.220> we

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
very important to seal the mold so we

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.600 
very important to seal the mold so we
had<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> mix<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.939> more<00:01:48.210> silicone<00:01:49.430> using<00:01:50.430> that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
had to mix up more silicone using that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
had to mix up more silicone using that
same<00:01:50.820> 30%<00:01:51.659> mixed<00:01:51.990> ratio<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.710> top<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.909> off<00:01:54.710> now

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
same 30% mixed ratio and top it off now

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.249 
same 30% mixed ratio and top it off now
once<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.250> silicone<00:01:56.490> cures<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.719> want<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> de

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
once the silicone cures we want to de

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.370 
once the silicone cures we want to de
mold<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.799> remove<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.280> from<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.579> mold<00:01:59.790> box

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
mold it and remove it from the mold box

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.490 
mold it and remove it from the mold box
we<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.619> cut<00:02:02.430> our<00:02:02.579> mold<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.290> remove<00:02:04.290> our

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
we then cut our mold to remove our

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.580 
we then cut our mold to remove our
original<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:06.450> trick<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.350> now<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
original and the trick of this is now to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.490 
original and the trick of this is now to
leave<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.250> silicone<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.509> let<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.140> air

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
leave the silicone out and let it air

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.690 
leave the silicone out and let it air
dry<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.280> at<00:02:12.239> least<00:02:12.270> 7<00:02:12.900> days

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
dry for at least 7 days

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.080 
dry for at least 7 days
what<00:02:14.700> happens<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.990> silicone<00:02:16.820> will<00:02:17.820> not

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
what happens is the silicone will not

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.030 
what happens is the silicone will not
contain<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.900> odor<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.290> Smurfs<00:02:19.680> spirits

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
contain the odor of the Smurfs spirits

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.680 
contain the odor of the Smurfs spirits
in<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> odorless<00:02:20.700> mineral<00:02:20.730> spirits<00:02:21.360> wall<00:02:21.570> of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
in the odorless mineral spirits wall of

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.880 
in the odorless mineral spirits wall of
britain<00:02:22.050> evaporate<00:02:22.890> or<00:02:23.160> flash<00:02:23.490> off<00:02:24.770> when<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
britain evaporate or flash off when the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.010 
britain evaporate or flash off when the
odorless<00:02:26.220> mineral<00:02:26.250> spirits<00:02:26.880> evaporate<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
odorless mineral spirits evaporate the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.800 
odorless mineral spirits evaporate the
mold<00:02:28.320> condenses<00:02:29.160> or<00:02:29.400> shrinks<00:02:30.090> because<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
mold condenses or shrinks because a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.390 
mold condenses or shrinks because a
structure<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.530> silicone<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.160> still<00:02:32.459> there

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
structure of the silicone is still there

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.130 
structure of the silicone is still there
this<00:02:35.400> takes<00:02:35.700> time<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.390> needs<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.630> be<00:02:36.720> open

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
this takes time and it needs to be open

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.630 
this takes time and it needs to be open
to<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.410> air<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.800> why<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.130> important<00:02:38.580> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
to the air that's why it's important to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.210 
to the air that's why it's important to
remove<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.209> from<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.540> mold<00:02:39.810> box<00:02:40.110> as<00:02:40.740> soon<00:02:41.070> as

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
remove it from the mold box as soon as

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.250 
remove it from the mold box as soon as
you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.660> be<00:02:42.780> more<00:02:42.990> careful

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
you can but you have to be more careful

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.130 
you can but you have to be more careful
with<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.770> silicone<00:02:44.570> because<00:02:45.570> it's<00:02:45.750> much<00:02:45.930> more

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
with the silicone because it's much more

we<00:03:03.480> had<00:03:03.630> some<00:03:03.840> leftover<00:03:04.350> silicone<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.100> we<00:03:05.190> made

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
we had some leftover silicone so we made

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.080 
we had some leftover silicone so we made
a<00:03:05.430> little<00:03:05.780> Bulldog<00:03:06.780> here<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:08.489> was<00:03:08.640> used<00:03:08.880> as<00:03:09.060> a

a little Bulldog here that was used as a
beer<00:03:09.420> tap<00:03:10.550> for<00:03:11.550> reference<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.150> see<00:03:12.510> how

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
beer tap for reference you can see how

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.750 
beer tap for reference you can see how
the<00:03:12.780> mold<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:14.220> original<00:03:14.640> pipe<00:03:14.850> has<00:03:15.330> shrank

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
the mold in the original pipe has shrank

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.310 
the mold in the original pipe has shrank
you<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:17.910> also<00:03:18.090> see<00:03:18.420> how<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.600> original<00:03:19.170> no

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
you can also see how the original no

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.020 
you can also see how the original no
longer<00:03:19.650> fits<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> mold<00:03:20.519> because<00:03:20.880> it's

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
longer fits in the mold because it's

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.050 
longer fits in the mold because it's
simply<00:03:21.390> too<00:03:21.420> big<00:03:22.100> but<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.220> cast<00:03:23.459> piece<00:03:23.820> that

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
simply too big but the cast piece that

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.430 
simply too big but the cast piece that
we<00:03:24.180> made<00:03:25.580> fits<00:03:26.580> in<00:03:26.790> fine<00:03:30.080> this<00:03:31.080> gives<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.410> a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
we made fits in fine this gives you a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.740 
we made fits in fine this gives you a
little<00:03:31.590> better<00:03:31.830> perspective<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:33.030> how<00:03:33.480> much

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
little better perspective of how much

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.490 
little better perspective of how much
the<00:03:33.959> mold<00:03:34.170> will<00:03:34.350> shrink<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:36.989> also<00:03:37.170> see

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
the mold will shrink you can also see

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.680 
the mold will shrink you can also see
the<00:03:37.650> difference<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.310> two<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:39.180> original

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
the difference in the two the original

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.120 
the difference in the two the original
as<00:03:40.680> well<00:03:40.920> as<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.310> cast<00:03:41.549> replica<00:03:42.829> here<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.980> can

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
as well as the cast replica here you can

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.530 
as well as the cast replica here you can
see<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.430> in<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.670> lures<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.209> actually

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
see it in the lures that we actually

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.940 
see it in the lures that we actually
made<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:48.660> mold<00:03:48.870> shrank<00:03:49.230> approximately

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
made the mold shrank approximately

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.750 
made the mold shrank approximately
fifteen<00:03:50.430> percent<00:03:51.980> there<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.010> no<00:03:53.280> set<00:03:53.610> amount

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
fifteen percent there is no set amount

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.670 
fifteen percent there is no set amount
of<00:03:54.239> order<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.570> us<00:03:54.690> mineral<00:03:55.019> spirits<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.500> gives

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
of order of us mineral spirits it gives

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.979 
of order of us mineral spirits it gives
you<00:03:55.799> an<00:03:55.920> exact<00:03:56.400> shrinkage<00:03:57.030> every<00:03:57.480> parts<00:03:57.780> gonna

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
you an exact shrinkage every parts gonna

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.020 
you an exact shrinkage every parts gonna
be<00:03:58.140> different<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.769> doing<00:03:59.010> two<00:03:59.310> piece<00:03:59.549> molds

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
be different and doing two piece molds

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.610 
be different and doing two piece molds
are<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.450> even<00:04:00.750> going<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.959> be<00:04:01.049> tougher<00:04:01.470> because

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
are you even going to be tougher because

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.229 
are you even going to be tougher because
the<00:04:02.010> two<00:04:02.220> sides<00:04:02.459> need<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.000> shrink

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
the two sides need to shrink

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.900 
the two sides need to shrink
proportionately<00:04:04.100> this<00:04:05.100> really<00:04:05.430> works<00:04:05.670> well

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
proportionately this really works well

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.509 
proportionately this really works well
for<00:04:06.180> doing<00:04:06.299> one-piece<00:04:06.959> molds<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.459> said

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
for doing one-piece molds and as I said

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.150 
for doing one-piece molds and as I said
the<00:04:09.239> smaller<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.870> mold<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.709> larger

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
the smaller the mold the larger

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.509 
the smaller the mold the larger
percentage<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.850> shrink<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.360> can<00:04:12.540> expect<00:04:13.519> if

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
percentage of shrink you can expect if

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.370 
percentage of shrink you can expect if
