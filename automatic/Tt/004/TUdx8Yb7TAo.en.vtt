this was designed by Oscar Poorna Feld
have<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> look<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> there's<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.379> bunch<00:01:01.530> of

have you look at it there's a bunch of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590 
have you look at it there's a bunch of
rings<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> whole<00:01:02.640> reason<00:01:03.059> behind<00:01:03.239> this

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
rings but the whole reason behind this

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
rings but the whole reason behind this
is<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.049> look<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.320> middle<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:05.159> kind

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
is if you look in the middle it's kind

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.859 
is if you look in the middle it's kind
of<00:01:05.460> flower<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.450> supposed<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> represent

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
of flower and it's supposed to represent
life<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.799> feel<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.220> maybe<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> should<00:01:08.670> be

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
life I feel like maybe it should be

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550 
life I feel like maybe it should be
green<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> inside<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.470> know

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
green on the inside because you know

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.770 
green on the inside because you know
green<00:01:10.920> live<00:01:11.369> plant<00:01:11.909> life<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> sort<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.630> thing

just<00:01:36.990> had<00:01:37.110> its<00:01:37.259> fourth<00:01:37.560> successful<00:01:38.280> launch<00:01:38.490> on

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
just had its fourth successful launch on

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.060 
just had its fourth successful launch on
May<00:01:38.970> 20th<00:01:39.479> however<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> NASA<00:01:40.799> mission

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
planet society you know spacecraft is

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.719 
planet society you know spacecraft is
cool<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.710> all<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:01.799> did<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.219> guys<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
cool and all but did you guys know that

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
cool and all but did you guys know that
moons<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.390> dance<00:02:03.689> well<00:02:04.200> okay<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:05.009> a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
moons can dance well okay it's really a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.280 
moons can dance well okay it's really a
metaphor<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.790> recently<00:02:06.659> people<00:02:06.869> got<00:02:07.200> an

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
metaphor because recently people got an

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.150 
metaphor because recently people got an
opportunity<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.950> see<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> moon's<00:02:08.550> shadow

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
opportunity to see the moon's shadow

opportunity to see the moon's shadow
dance<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.180> Jupiter<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.990> I'm<00:02:11.080> not<00:02:11.200> talking<00:02:11.470> to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
dance on Jupiter and I'm not talking to

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.020 
dance on Jupiter and I'm not talking to
our<00:02:11.680> moons<00:02:11.950> I'm<00:02:12.130> talking<00:02:12.370> Jupiter's<00:02:12.760> moons

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
our moons I'm talking Jupiter's moons

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.760 
our moons I'm talking Jupiter's moons
right<00:02:13.300> because<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:13.750> kind<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.990> far<00:02:14.200> away<00:02:14.320> now

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
right because it's kind of far away now

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.230 
right because it's kind of far away now
if<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:14.950> guys<00:02:15.070> got<00:02:15.310> outside<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.730> May<00:02:15.820> 28th

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
if you guys got outside on May 28th

if you guys got outside on May 28th
around<00:02:16.480> 8:10<00:02:17.050> p.m.<00:02:17.520> EDT<00:02:18.520> time<00:02:19.180> now<00:02:19.660> get

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
around 8:10 p.m. EDT time now get

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.540 
around 8:10 p.m. EDT time now get
something<00:02:20.230> as<00:02:20.290> simple<00:02:20.500> as<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.740> 90<00:02:21.130> millimeter

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
something as simple as a 90 millimeter

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.980 
something as simple as a 90 millimeter
telescope<00:02:22.090> you'd<00:02:22.240> be<00:02:22.390> able<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.690> see<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
telescope you'd be able to see the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.740 
telescope you'd be able to see the
shadows<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:24.280> moons<00:02:24.520> on<00:02:24.760> Jupiter<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.630> it's

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
shadows of the moons on Jupiter and it's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.540 
shadows of the moons on Jupiter and it's
crazy<00:02:25.930> because<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.530> can't<00:02:26.770> actually<00:02:26.950> see<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
crazy because you can't actually see the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.430 
crazy because you can't actually see the
moons<00:02:27.850> but<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.690> shadows<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.170> they're

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
moons but the shadows that they're

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.140 
moons but the shadows that they're
making<00:02:29.590> are<00:02:29.860> like<00:02:30.010> three<00:02:30.280> times<00:02:30.520> sizers<00:02:31.000> so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
making are like three times sizers so

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.730 
making are like three times sizers so
they<00:02:31.240> were<00:02:31.300> like<00:02:31.450> all<00:02:31.660> over<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.020> surface<00:02:32.230> so

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
they were like all over the surface so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.080 
they were like all over the surface so
anyways<00:02:33.040> guys<00:02:33.070> thanks<00:02:33.520> for<00:02:33.550> watching<00:02:33.640> that's
