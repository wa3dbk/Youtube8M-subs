normal<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:34.920> then<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.220> also<00:02:35.370> only<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.940> one

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
normal but then I also only have one

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.940 
normal but then I also only have one
audio<00:02:36.600> which<00:02:36.810> usually<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.380> your<00:02:37.590> left<00:02:37.800> and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
audio which usually of your left and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.530 
audio which usually of your left and
right<00:02:38.070> audio<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:39.450> only<00:02:39.720> has<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.110> white<00:02:40.230> saw

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
right audio this only has the white saw

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.710 
right audio this only has the white saw
so<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:42.960> got<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.320> plugged<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:45.210> now<00:02:45.360> it's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
so we got that plugged in so now it's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.920 
so we got that plugged in so now it's
splitting<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.700> TV<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:50.480> at<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.900> moment

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
splitting to the TV and to at the moment

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.970 
splitting to the TV and to at the moment
nothing<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.970> take<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.900> last<00:02:55.410> end<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.860> our

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
nothing so we take the last end of our

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.440 
nothing so we take the last end of our
RCA<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.020> we<00:02:58.020> plug<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.410> into<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.670> colors<00:03:00.240> on

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
RCA and we plug it into the colors on

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.340 
RCA and we plug it into the colors on
the<00:03:00.690> dazzle<00:03:01.880> like<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.030> said<00:03:03.210> before<00:03:03.350> matching

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
the dazzle like I said before matching

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.220 
the dazzle like I said before matching
colors<00:03:04.680> should<00:03:04.860> be<00:03:05.010> fairly<00:03:05.280> easy<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:06.240> people

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
colors should be fairly easy to people

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.150 
colors should be fairly easy to people
who<00:03:07.470> are<00:03:07.620> over<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:07.920> age<00:03:08.070> of<00:03:08.370> 10<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:11.880> down<00:03:12.120> so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
who are over the age of 10 that down so

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.620 
who are over the age of 10 that down so
you<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.340> match<00:03:14.520> up<00:03:14.550> whatever<00:03:14.970> color<00:03:15.390> goes

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
you just match up whatever color goes

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.400 
you just match up whatever color goes
where<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:18.690> looks<00:03:18.840> all<00:03:18.990> nice<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.380> pretty

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
where and it looks all nice and pretty

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.230 
where and it looks all nice and pretty
like<00:03:19.740> that<00:03:20.060> now<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.120> take<00:03:21.480> your<00:03:21.540> dazzle<00:03:22.200> after

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
like that now you take your dazzle after

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.460 
like that now you take your dazzle after
