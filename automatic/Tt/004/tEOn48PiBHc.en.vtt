00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello to all italease escaping ad where 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.099
 going to brazil is a study of the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.750
 brookings institution has published 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.450
 published a search that helps 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.309
 understand which are the main regions 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.070
 of brazil from the point of view 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.789
 economy and without many surprises 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.600
 the main areas are the large areas 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.119
 metropolitan this is a factor that 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.359
 common throughout the developed world e 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 not so when it comes to going to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.500
 looking for work abroad 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 it seems precisely that it is better 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.510
 focus on these large areas 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.360
 subways because they may have one 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.930
 percentage not a percentage 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.090
 higher than pil compared to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.739
 percentage of population within 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.710
 of the nation itself and therefore I am more 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.699
 more active dynamics produce more and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.329
 therefore they offer more accordingly 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:05.970
 likely to find a job 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:09.869
 these are 13 areas in Brazil 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 13 areas have been identified e 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.619
 the occupation here has grown more 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.799
 faster than average 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.450
 national during the period from 1990 to 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.900
 2012 so this is another clue 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.340
 that make you understand that the real engine 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.970
 Brazilian economy is found 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.070
 precisely within these 13 areas 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.909
 which are are san paolo rio de janeiro 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:42.869

 victory fortaleza manaus and santos has le 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.670
 my apologies for the pronunciation in the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.759
 my Portuguese that doesn't exist anyway 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.899
 these 13 large metropolitan areas are 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.780
 precisely those that in principle 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.680
 offer 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.420
 more opportunities because they are 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.340
 most dynamically most active economically 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.480
 stronger then if you are thinking 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.840
 just to go to Brazil 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.980
 these are just the ones that offer more 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.430
 opportunity 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.310
 if you go to the brookings website 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.489
 institution you will find then dejan of the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.870
 English guidebooks to every each for 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.650
 the union of these large areas 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.560
 subways where there is practically 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.510
 explain what they specialize in and 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.650
 what are the major opportunities of 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.959
 work which sectors are the most 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.459
 details of each of hate I quote in 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.090
 Good luck see you soon
