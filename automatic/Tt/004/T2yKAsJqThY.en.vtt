00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.139
 hello friends in this tutorial we'll do 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.090
 this novena that can serve them as 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.790
 I remember for the first communion or 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.920
 I baptize only by adding the label 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.420
 here with the child's name or for 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.330
 any other occasion that you say 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.710
 good to do it we're going to need two 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.599
 clean pipes 9 accounts like these and one 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.580
 extra that I put in this part that 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.529
 It makes highlight a little more 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.110
 I chose these that are heart shaped 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.270
 cited and well if you do not have can 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.700
 put a different color like 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.840
 this same model or not any other 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.270
 pebble that you find that you 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.520
 can decorate this good part we're going to 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.130
 start 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.560
 The first thing we are going to do is to form 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.450
 the cross with our clean pipes of the 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.850
 color we choose now I will choose the 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.410
 This was in blue white and well let's 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 start 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.000
 let's first make a double 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.080
 about this part of three 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.080
 centimeters more or less 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.630
 and we make another one of the same size other 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.630
 double is like that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.250
 Now we are going to do the same in this 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.360
 part one of plus or minus 3 centimeters 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450
 approximately 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.420
 we also oppress this part so that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.840
 stay together and do not see space and good 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.259
 finally 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.049
 let's make another fold of it 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.049
 size that is like this down 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.840
 and we will stay like this now let's turn the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.030
 clean type here in this part so that 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.290
 remain united and go again 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.220
 to lower it here we oppress well and come back 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.340
 to upload it and this part we are going to double the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.340
 half 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.310
 and well look, we will have been 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.710
 formed what is our cross 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.530
 that nothing else we oppress well well for 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.170
 give it shape and look here is already formed 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.260
 our cross now with clean pipe 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.180
 remaining what we are going to do is 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.180
 let's first fold it in half 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.510
 so is 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.990
 and we are going to put it here to what it is 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.990
 our cross 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.570
 now let's put the little heart in 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.570
 this part 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.410
 we put the two ends of the clean 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.500
 pipes and very carefully we are going to 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.500
 put it here between this part and the cross 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.310
 There, yes 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.500
 if we want we can put a little 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.150
 of glue so that it does not move us anymore 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.890
 or if not 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.290
 Now what we have to do is go 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.680
 putting the accounts 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.120
 from this side 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.120
 let's put first 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.810
 one that will be in the middle as 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.200
 we made here so this is the number 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.880
 9 and the others are well centered 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.880
 now we are going to put 4 on each side 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.950
 A) Yes 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.260
 and good now and nothing else what we are going to 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.260
 to do is to bend the little points 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.590
 and turn so that it closes well 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.590
 our novena 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.629
 and now we're just going to accommodate 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.069
 and look, we have already been well trained and 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.949
 very nice now and nothing else if we want 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:33.199
 give it a little bit of enhancement we can use 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.509
 this glitter that comes with glue on 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.050
 golden color to enhance it 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.050
 what is the cross 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.979
 ready look how nice to be her decorated 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.200
 and well I hope you liked it and 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.850
 above all that is useful and we 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.970
 we see in the following tutorial up 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.970
 then
