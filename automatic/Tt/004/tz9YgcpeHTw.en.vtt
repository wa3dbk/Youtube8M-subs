having my gadgets completely naked but

having my gadgets completely naked but
sometimes<00:00:15.320> bad<00:00:15.860> things<00:00:15.920> happen<00:00:16.369> so<00:00:17.150> when<00:00:17.240> I<00:00:17.269> do

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
sometimes bad things happen so when I do

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.390 
sometimes bad things happen so when I do
look<00:00:17.720> for<00:00:17.900> a<00:00:17.930> case<00:00:18.109> I<00:00:18.289> tend<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:18.590> ask<00:00:18.830> myself<00:00:18.980> two

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
look for a case I tend to ask myself two

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.570 
look for a case I tend to ask myself two
questions<00:00:19.430> one<00:00:20.270> does<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:20.990> case<00:00:21.350> improve<00:00:22.310> or

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
questions one does the case improve or

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.090 
questions one does the case improve or
maintain<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:23.480> look<00:00:23.690> of<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:23.930> phone<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:24.380> two

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
maintain the look of the phone and two

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.279 
maintain the look of the phone and two
what<00:00:25.670> protection<00:00:26.150> does<00:00:26.240> it<00:00:26.360> add<00:00:26.510> now<00:00:26.990> since<00:00:27.199> we

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
what protection does it add now since we

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.560 
what protection does it add now since we
talk<00:00:27.470> about<00:00:27.590> an<00:00:27.830> iPhone<00:00:28.250> 6<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:28.850> 6<00:00:29.090> plus<00:00:29.210> as<00:00:29.480> you

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
talk about an iPhone 6 and 6 plus as you

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.359 
talk about an iPhone 6 and 6 plus as you
may<00:00:29.690> know<00:00:29.869> it<00:00:30.050> is<00:00:30.199> they<00:00:30.590> are<00:00:30.619> quite<00:00:31.010> slippery

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
may know it is they are quite slippery

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.729 
may know it is they are quite slippery
so<00:00:31.820> also<00:00:32.059> had<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.329> ask<00:00:32.509> what<00:00:32.629> grip<00:00:33.050> does<00:00:33.379> it<00:00:33.559> add

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
so also had to ask what grip does it add

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.380 
so also had to ask what grip does it add
now<00:00:34.129> in<00:00:34.190> my<00:00:34.309> opinion<00:00:34.430> I<00:00:34.760> think<00:00:34.999> this<00:00:35.149> case

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
now in my opinion I think this case

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.969 
now in my opinion I think this case
nails<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:35.929> design<00:00:36.199> aspect<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.739> looks

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:36.979 
nails the design aspect it looks

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:38.950 
nails the design aspect it looks
extremely<00:00:37.339> nice<00:00:37.699> and<00:00:37.940> in<00:00:38.300> fact<00:00:38.479> it's<00:00:38.690> one<00:00:38.870> of

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
extremely nice and in fact it's one of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.259 
extremely nice and in fact it's one of
the<00:00:39.050> nicest<00:00:39.319> cases<00:00:39.920> I've<00:00:40.069> seen<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:40.519> one<00:00:41.179> of

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
the nicest cases I've seen and one of

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.029 
the nicest cases I've seen and one of
the<00:00:41.329> best<00:00:41.510> things<00:00:41.749> is<00:00:42.019> that<00:00:42.319> there<00:00:42.769> are

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
the best things is that there are

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.189 
the best things is that there are
multiple<00:00:43.309> color<00:00:43.789> choices<00:00:44.120> for<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.659> frame<00:00:44.929> of

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
multiple color choices for the frame of

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.889 
multiple color choices for the frame of
the<00:00:45.679> case<00:00:45.949> I<00:00:46.280> myself<00:00:46.460> opted<00:00:47.059> for<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.479> gunmetal

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
the case I myself opted for the gunmetal

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.840 
the case I myself opted for the gunmetal
frame<00:00:48.289> which<00:00:48.620> looks<00:00:48.949> great<00:00:49.219> but<00:00:49.670> if<00:00:49.729> you<00:00:49.819> have

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
frame which looks great but if you have

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.939 
frame which looks great but if you have
a<00:00:49.969> gold<00:00:50.359> iPhone<00:00:50.659> I<00:00:51.019> suggest<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.440> guys<00:00:51.559> look<00:00:51.799> at

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
a gold iPhone I suggest you guys look at

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.910 
a gold iPhone I suggest you guys look at
the<00:00:52.600> metal<00:00:53.600> slate<00:00:53.870> combination<00:00:54.499> which<00:00:54.679> my

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
the metal slate combination which my

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.680 
the metal slate combination which my
opinion<00:00:55.190> just<00:00:55.219> looks<00:00:55.489> awesome<00:00:55.639> it<00:00:56.149> results<00:00:56.600> in

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
opinion just looks awesome it results in

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.840 
opinion just looks awesome it results in
some<00:00:56.899> sexy<00:00:57.469> awesomeness<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.159> this<00:00:58.519> case<00:00:58.699> has

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
some sexy awesomeness so this case has

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.459 
some sexy awesomeness so this case has
two<00:00:59.120> parts<00:00:59.479> as<00:00:59.629> you<00:00:59.659> can<00:00:59.839> probably<00:00:59.989> see<00:01:00.139> the

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
two parts as you can probably see the

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.739 
two parts as you can probably see the
rubber<00:01:00.829> shelter<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:01.549> the<00:01:01.760> frame<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.239> this

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
rubber shelter and the frame and this

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:04.719 
rubber shelter and the frame and this
basically<00:01:03.019> means<00:01:03.229> two<00:01:03.499> things<00:01:03.530> one<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.549> case

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
basically means two things one the case

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.030 
basically means two things one the case
will<00:01:05.000> stay<00:01:05.089> tight<00:01:05.479> with<00:01:05.990> your<00:01:06.170> phone<00:01:06.409> which<00:01:06.890> is

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
will stay tight with your phone which is

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.070 
will stay tight with your phone which is
good<00:01:07.220> in<00:01:07.370> terms<00:01:07.520> of<00:01:07.670> protection<00:01:08.000> but<00:01:08.570> two<00:01:08.780> it

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
good in terms of protection but two it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.320 
good in terms of protection but two it
does<00:01:09.440> make<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.800> harder<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.100> remove<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.880> one<00:01:11.240> of

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
does make it harder to remove and one of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.000 
does make it harder to remove and one of
the<00:01:11.420> reasons<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:11.870> might<00:01:12.020> want<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.530> do<00:01:12.650> this<00:01:12.770> is

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
the reasons you might want to do this is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.220 
the reasons you might want to do this is
because<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.700> cutouts<00:01:14.060> off<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.450> case<00:01:14.690> are<00:01:14.960> not

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
because the cutouts off the case are not

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.110 
because the cutouts off the case are not
wide<00:01:15.410> enough<00:01:15.440> for<00:01:15.950> every<00:01:16.280> type<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.520> cable<00:01:16.850> and

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
wide enough for every type of cable and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.450 
wide enough for every type of cable and
this<00:01:17.540> might<00:01:18.110> be<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.290> problem<00:01:18.530> with<00:01:18.710> headphone

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
this might be a problem with headphone

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.820 
this might be a problem with headphone
or<00:01:19.760> charging<00:01:20.270> cables<00:01:20.630> on<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.200> note<00:01:21.380> they<00:01:21.800> are

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
or charging cables on that note they are

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.130 
or charging cables on that note they are
also<00:01:22.280> quite<00:01:22.580> deep<00:01:22.790> cutouts<00:01:23.150> which<00:01:23.420> means<00:01:23.810> that

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
also quite deep cutouts which means that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.870 
also quite deep cutouts which means that
there<00:01:24.440> is<00:01:24.470> more<00:01:24.620> space<00:01:24.920> for<00:01:25.430> dust<00:01:25.730> to

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
there is more space for dust to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.970 
there is more space for dust to
accumulate<00:01:26.120> and<00:01:26.450> sneak<00:01:27.050> into<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.410> case<00:01:27.620> which

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
accumulate and sneak into the case which

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.580 
accumulate and sneak into the case which
in<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.370> end<00:01:28.520> can<00:01:28.730> cause<00:01:28.970> scratches<00:01:29.590> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
in the end can cause scratches the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.500 
in the end can cause scratches the
deepness<00:01:30.800> also<00:01:31.250> affects<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.820> silent<00:01:32.240> switch

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
deepness also affects the silent switch

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.390 
deepness also affects the silent switch
which<00:01:32.840> I<00:01:32.990> know<00:01:33.050> some<00:01:33.290> of<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.530> don't<00:01:33.650> like<00:01:33.800> it

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
which I know some of you don't like it

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.490 
which I know some of you don't like it
makes<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.790> harder<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.060> reach<00:01:35.360> but<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.290> should

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
makes it harder to reach but you should

I<00:02:29.540> definitely<00:02:30.140> cannot<00:02:30.380> guarantee<00:02:30.770> it<00:02:31.010> will<00:02:31.190> do

I definitely cannot guarantee it will do

I definitely cannot guarantee it will do

the same on a rocky bumpy surface and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.890 
the same on a rocky bumpy surface and
also<00:02:34.340> bending<00:02:35.090> issues<00:02:35.420> for<00:02:35.600> those<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.810> you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
also bending issues for those of you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.720 
also bending issues for those of you
worried<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.590> case<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:37.010> not<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.340> strongest

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
worried this case is not the strongest

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.210 
worried this case is not the strongest
since<00:02:38.270> it<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.600> made<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.930> flexible<00:02:39.140> plastic<00:02:39.590> but

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
since it is made of flexible plastic but

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.860 
since it is made of flexible plastic but
if<00:02:40.310> you're<00:02:40.490> not<00:02:40.760> bending<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.240> yourself<00:02:41.720> or

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
if you're not bending it yourself or

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.690 
if you're not bending it yourself or
putting<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.230> under<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.590> lot<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:42.860> pressure<00:02:42.980> it

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
putting it under a lot of pressure it

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.640 
putting it under a lot of pressure it
should<00:02:43.730> help<00:02:44.180> prevent<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.840> bit<00:02:44.990> now<00:02:45.470> as<00:02:45.590> I

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
should help prevent it a bit now as I

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.930 
should help prevent it a bit now as I
said<00:02:45.770> earlier<00:02:46.100> another<00:02:46.370> question<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.790> asked

said earlier another question I asked
just<00:02:47.210> because<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.810> an<00:02:47.990> iphone<00:02:48.320> six-plus

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
just because this is an iphone six-plus

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.120 
just because this is an iphone six-plus
was<00:02:49.550> what<00:02:49.970> did<00:02:50.090> help<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:51.140> get<00:02:51.410> more<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.890> grip

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
was what did help you get more of a grip

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.860 
was what did help you get more of a grip
on<00:02:52.310> your<00:02:52.460> phone<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.480> where<00:02:53.630> the

although it looks rubbery it's actually

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.070 
although it looks rubbery it's actually

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
out there overall I do like this case a

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.270 
out there overall I do like this case a
lot<00:03:11.570> but<00:03:11.930> there<00:03:12.170> are<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.740> few<00:03:12.890> things<00:03:13.070> I

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
lot but there are just a few things I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.190 
lot but there are just a few things I
dislike<00:03:13.550> as<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.910> result<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.660> protection<00:03:15.080> it

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
dislike as a result of the protection it

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.170 
dislike as a result of the protection it
offers<00:03:15.590> for<00:03:15.950> example<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.460> extra<00:03:16.790> bump<00:03:17.030> at

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
offers for example that extra bump at

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.670 
offers for example that extra bump at
the<00:03:17.210> front<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:17.600> protects<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.170> screen<00:03:18.470> also

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
the front that protects the screen also

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.010 
the front that protects the screen also
removes<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.190> curved<00:03:19.460> feel<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.270> edges<00:03:20.600> which

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
removes a curved feel of the edges which

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.390 
removes a curved feel of the edges which
is<00:03:21.050> a<00:03:21.140> feature<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.709> new<00:03:21.800> iPhones<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.370> I

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
is a feature of the new iPhones that I

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.880 
is a feature of the new iPhones that I
really<00:03:22.820> like<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.270> since<00:03:23.720> its<00:03:23.900> rubber<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.680> also

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
really like and since its rubber it also

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.830 
really like and since its rubber it also
causes<00:03:25.310> dust<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:26.000> stick<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.570> whenever

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
causes dust to stick to it whenever

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.720 
causes dust to stick to it whenever
wiping<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.620> screen<00:03:27.860> clean<00:03:28.130> but<00:03:28.489> most

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
wiping the screen clean but most

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.340
