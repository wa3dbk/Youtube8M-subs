00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.290
 the noisies at home you are presented by pierre lopes 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.659
 the story and here 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.069
 and yet it's not a rubber toy 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.069
 media a motorcycle tire 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.410
 what is expected of him a super maneuverability 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.749
 great adherence and predictable behavior on 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.939
 and all forces must be transmitted on a surface of the waist 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.749
 a coin of 20 cents 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:31.770
 in turns 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.560
 Forex contact area constantly 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.970
 how the smaller so keep control 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.720
 - dominic if the world knows with some seem to be united one has 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.810
 need more than ten years 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.160
 we had the idea to use different mixes at the shoulders and 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.390
 pit stops to get the key in what is expected in an inclined position 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 against a week 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 this is the secret of Aveyron 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.870
 are decisive whether it's too much 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.800
 where they are the sign of a technology we call it the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.830
 multi-touch technology fast or multi band if you imagine the curvature of the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.740
 tire you have according to the inclined position a different mix that 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.990
 is in contact with the ground and generates the adhesion you need m 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.990
 there is only one woman jogging and only one defeat 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.560
 the materials are just as modern as the tire 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.910
 bands plus remote work at the properties of movies 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.940
 precisely and starts the power thanks to synthetic fibers like 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.230
 family 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.560
 a tire is composed of several layers with specific properties 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.610
 the superposition of multiple layers and the insertion of reinforcements not sure that a 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.610
 high resistance to framing 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.070
 yet the tire is still a bit more complicated the belt layers here 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.740
 I am offered 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.340
 and the running surface 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.560
 must meet stability heat resistance 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.000
 and branches 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.110
 the tapes of work six tents are wrapped by the belt 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.069
 longitudinal 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.909
 the running surface is laid 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.909
 accurately and compressed 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.859
 the lower layer and the structure its assembled manually and thanks to 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.859
 technology 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.499
 vulcanization forms the most races 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.939
 the latter provides prior consultation on the circuit 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.059
 during enduro races 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.429
 he must be replaced 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.429
 a little fast then to control m for change 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.560
 one of them what mixes me 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.560
 to shed some light on the stabbings 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.999
 growth in africa 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.180
 today with ford 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.490
 the factories machines we equip develops around 200 horses and 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.919
 weighs about 165 to 170 pounds 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:52.979
 when we accelerate 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:57.149
 the forces involved are so huge we need a very high contact surface 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.849
 wide but for this force and energy to be transmitted to the 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.999
 soil is especially seeing out of bend or in long lines 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.300
 right that these important forces 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.590
 a fair return alas it must be said that money a large contact area 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.679
 samuel 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:16.039
 elektra 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.189
 this is valid for the rear tire 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.599
 the front tire to another structure and other functions 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:24.739
 facing them alone 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.400
 at each scene match but to no avail 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.330
 work is going on we see you closer the tire is still 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.119
 solicited only for a brief moment 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:37.799
 always according to frederic mitterrand in a turn so we need a 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.249
 front tire that stabilize when braking that fall easily 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:45.209
 that's why it's very narrow a very wide front tire to be a 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.569
 load bearing inertia force and it would be impossible to change 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.149
 trajectory quite quickly suddenly we note that for once the three p'tits 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.049
 points q to be able to maneuver the bike as easily as possible in the 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.969
 turns in the match wall street progresses 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.969
 only six weeks the market 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.840
 extreme speeds on the circuits are possible only 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.930
 thanks to the mixture 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.999
 and to high tech materials flow 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.159
 on the track as on the road 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.809
 entrusts his life to a surface equivalent to a piece of 20 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:15.599
 cents 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.560
 should I choose 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.560
 the right tires 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.910
 a 5th that you have presented by mood
