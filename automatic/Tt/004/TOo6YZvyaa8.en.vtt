engine<00:00:12.559> gearbox<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.920> out<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.610> having<00:00:14.670> the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
engine gearbox is out I was having the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.640 
engine gearbox is out I was having the
problem<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.830> flitch<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:17.039> spitting<00:00:18.109> in<00:00:19.109> fourth

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
problem of flitch was spitting in fourth

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.300 
problem of flitch was spitting in fourth
and<00:00:19.890> fifth<00:00:20.210> but<00:00:21.650> quite<00:00:22.650> easy<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.980> pull<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> heavy

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and fifth but quite easy to pull a heavy

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.029 
and fifth but quite easy to pull a heavy
trailer<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> obviously<00:00:28.439> thought<00:00:28.619> maybe<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
trailer so obviously thought maybe the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.360 
trailer so obviously thought maybe the
clutch<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.929> taking<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> gearbox<00:00:31.410> out

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.910 

videos<00:00:38.540> here<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.879> that<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.960> clutch

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
videos here we have it that the clutch

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:54.830 
videos here we have it that the clutch
operating<00:00:44.399> lever<00:00:47.059> was<00:00:48.059> C<00:00:48.239> solid<00:00:52.430> this<00:00:53.840> could

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
operating lever was C solid this could

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.200 
operating lever was C solid this could
not<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.050> moved<00:00:56.120> even<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> fairly<00:00:59.210> strong

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
not be moved even with a fairly strong

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660 
not be moved even with a fairly strong
leaver<00:01:01.070> certainly<00:01:02.070> couldn't<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.340> moved<00:01:02.460> by

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
leaver certainly couldn't be moved by

taking it apart using lots of oil first

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:22.960 
taking it apart using lots of oil first
of<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:14.060> bolt<00:01:15.060> here

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.280 

this<00:01:23.970> comes<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.360> easy<00:01:24.540> no<00:01:24.780> cost<00:01:25.080> colored

this comes out easy no cost colored
freed<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.040> bit<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.280> difficult

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
freed it's a little bit more difficult

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
freed it's a little bit more difficult
if<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.970> haven't<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.020> turn<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> lever

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
if you haven't can then turn the lever

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.609 
if you haven't can then turn the lever
to<00:01:29.280> move<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.580> force<00:01:29.760> away<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.659> main

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to move the force away from the main

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.080 
to move the force away from the main
drive<00:01:31.860> shaft<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:33.200> take<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:35.000> there<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
drive shaft and take it out there you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.510 
drive shaft and take it out there you
have<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> shaft<00:01:37.310> okay<00:01:40.009> there's<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.100> seal<00:01:41.310> in

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
have the shaft okay there's a seal in

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.510 
have the shaft okay there's a seal in
there<00:01:41.700> obviously<00:01:42.690> that's<00:01:43.050> worn<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:44.220> shaft

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
there obviously that's worn the shaft

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.200 
there obviously that's worn the shaft
was<00:01:45.259> quite<00:01:46.259> badly<00:01:46.440> rusted<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:48.060> this

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
was quite badly rusted up in this

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.120 
was quite badly rusted up in this
portion<00:01:48.509> here<00:01:51.380> I'll<00:01:52.380> clean<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:52.979> I'm

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
portion here I'll clean that up now I'm

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.669 
portion here I'll clean that up now I'm
gonna<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.460> some<00:01:53.610> grease<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.500> put<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
gonna put some grease on it put in to

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.630 
gonna put some grease on it put in to
the<00:01:55.770> ceiling<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.340> pop<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.270> back<00:01:57.679> so<00:01:58.679> that<00:01:59.520> was

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the ceiling and pop it back so that was

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.980 
the ceiling and pop it back so that was
a<00:01:59.670> result<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.119> clutch<00:02:00.590> spinning<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:02.550> in<00:02:03.240> fourth

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
a result of clutch spinning at in fourth

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.370 
a result of clutch spinning at in fourth
and<00:02:04.229> fifth<00:02:04.340> because<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.229> simply<00:02:07.229> wasn't

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and fifth because the simply wasn't

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.190 
and fifth because the simply wasn't
returning<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:09.330> lever<00:02:09.509> was<00:02:09.720> stopping<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
returning the lever was stopping the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.860 
returning the lever was stopping the
clutch<00:02:10.380> engaging<00:02:11.180> after<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> few<00:02:12.390> miles<00:02:12.600> it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
clutch engaging after a few miles it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.960 
clutch engaging after a few miles it
would<00:02:12.959> be<00:02:13.050> fine<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.310> was<00:02:14.430> working<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.760> way

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
would be fine so it was working this way

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.600 
would be fine so it was working this way
back<00:02:15.180> okay

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
back okay

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.030 
back okay
that's<00:02:17.610> up<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:17.880> now
