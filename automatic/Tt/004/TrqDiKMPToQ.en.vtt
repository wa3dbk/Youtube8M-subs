00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
selection screen but um I decided to

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.640 
selection screen but um I decided to
start<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.010> her<00:00:17.520> ugly<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.300> mr.<00:00:19.080> mine<00:00:19.320> because

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
start with her ugly and mr. mine because

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.130 
start with her ugly and mr. mine because
they<00:00:19.800> both<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.279> Chesto<00:00:21.210> berries<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.930> saw

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
they both have Chesto berries and I saw

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.890 
they both have Chesto berries and I saw
that<00:00:22.350> he<00:00:22.560> had<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:23.070> dark<00:00:23.369> ride<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> team<00:00:24.060> but

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that he had a dark ride on the team but

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.689 
that he had a dark ride on the team but
I<00:00:25.019> guess<00:00:25.199> when<00:00:25.380> he<00:00:25.500> saw<00:00:25.680> my<00:00:25.920> team<00:00:26.189> he<00:00:26.369> decided

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
I guess when he saw my team he decided

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.070 
I guess when he saw my team he decided
he<00:00:26.910> wasn't<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.420> use<00:00:27.539> legendaries<00:00:28.849> so

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
he wasn't going to use legendaries so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.799 
he wasn't going to use legendaries so
pretty<00:00:31.080> even<00:00:31.170> bet<00:00:31.890> he<00:00:32.759> starts<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.390> weavile

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
pretty even bet he starts with weavile

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.190 
pretty even bet he starts with weavile
and<00:00:34.079> uh<00:00:35.329> hansgrohe<00:00:36.329> when<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.630> both<00:00:36.809> try<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and uh hansgrohe when we both try to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.860 
and uh hansgrohe when we both try to
fake<00:00:37.710> each<00:00:37.890> other<00:00:38.100> out<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:39.000> he<00:00:39.149> used<00:00:39.390> fake<00:00:39.690> out
