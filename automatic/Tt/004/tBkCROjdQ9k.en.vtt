00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
itemization in this game a little bit

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.389 
itemization in this game a little bit
better<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.440> may<00:00:37.710> also<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.950> wondering<00:00:38.280> why

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
better so it may also be wondering why

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.369 
better so it may also be wondering why
why<00:00:38.820> am<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.969> even<00:00:39.000> making<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.540> video<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:39.989> well

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
why am I even making this video now well

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.530 
why am I even making this video now well
there<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> couple<00:00:41.489> reasons<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.180> first<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
there are a couple reasons so first of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.450 
there are a couple reasons so first of
all<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:43.079> now<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.290> patch<00:00:43.469> 2.1<00:00:43.950> point<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
all we're now in patch 2.1 point to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.660 
all we're now in patch 2.1 point to
where<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.600> basically<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.440> another<00:00:47.370> item

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
where we basically have another item

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.690 
where we basically have another item
wipe<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.480> ancient<00:00:48.870> items<00:00:49.590> you're<00:00:49.920> slowly<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
wipe so ancient items you're slowly but

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.369 
wipe so ancient items you're slowly but
surely<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.390> getting<00:00:51.539> rid<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
surely going to be getting rid of all of

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
surely going to be getting rid of all of
your<00:00:52.500> existing<00:00:53.010> gear<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> exception<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
your existing gear with the exception of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.880 
your existing gear with the exception of
lick<00:00:54.809> rings<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.199> amulets<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.800> they

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
lick rings and amulets because they

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.410 
lick rings and amulets because they
don't<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.129> benefit<00:00:56.640> from<00:00:56.670> being<00:00:56.969> ancient

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
don't really benefit from being ancient

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.090 
don't really benefit from being ancient
because<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.350> ancient<00:00:58.739> modifier<00:00:59.160> does<00:00:59.430> not

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
because the ancient modifier does not

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.470 
because the ancient modifier does not
increase<00:01:02.100> stats<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:02.699> percentage<00:01:03.210> based

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
increase stats that are percentage based

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.520 
increase stats that are percentage based
so<00:01:03.660> you're<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.199> more<00:01:04.350> like

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so you're not going to get more like

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140 
so you're not going to get more like

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
crit chance crit damage own mental

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.310

else<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> furnace<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.680> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
else is going to want a furnace and the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.050 
else is going to want a furnace and the
other<00:01:46.920> reason<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.729> drop<00:01:47.909> rate

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
other reason is because the drop rate

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
other reason is because the drop rate
for<00:01:48.360> very<00:01:48.570> rare<00:01:48.840> items<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> furnace

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
for very rare items like the furnace

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.370 
for very rare items like the furnace
witching<00:01:50.430> hour<00:01:50.549> smk<00:01:51.299> wand<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.810> woe<00:01:51.990> things

witching hour smk wand of woe things

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.889 
witching hour smk wand of woe things
like<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> has<00:01:53.490> been<00:01:53.670> increased<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.450> players

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
like that has been increased so players

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.510 
like that has been increased so players
are<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> get<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.590> lot<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.040> players<00:01:56.399> can

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
are going to get a lot more players can

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.550 
are going to get a lot more players can
get<00:01:56.640> access<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.210> these<00:01:57.299> items<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.899> which<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
get access to these items and which is a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.959 
get access to these items and which is a
good<00:01:58.799> thing<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.640> great<00:01:59.820> thing

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969

hit points and the old furnace used to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.940 
hit points and the old furnace used to
do<00:02:55.000> eight<00:02:55.209> percent<00:02:55.690> damage<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:56.260> current<00:02:56.680> hit

do eight percent damage of current hit
points<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.180> that's<00:02:58.420> why<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.829> torment<00:02:59.829> six

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
points and that's why the torment six

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.710 
points and that's why the torment six
malthael<00:03:00.489> runs<00:03:00.790> were<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.090> popular<00:03:01.329> because

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
malthael runs were so popular because

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.410 
malthael runs were so popular because
you<00:03:02.019> could<00:03:02.140> burn<00:03:02.290> down<00:03:02.530> t6<00:03:03.069> mouth<00:03:03.250> el<00:03:03.489> very

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
you could burn down t6 mouth el very

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.449 
you could burn down t6 mouth el very
very<00:03:04.660> quickly<00:03:04.930> if<00:03:05.319> just<00:03:05.799> everybody<00:03:06.220> in<00:03:06.370> your

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
very quickly if just everybody in your

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.750 
very quickly if just everybody in your
party<00:03:06.849> had<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.450> furnace<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.430> was<00:03:09.549> nerfed

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
party had a furnace and so was nerfed

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.699 
party had a furnace and so was nerfed
from<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.360> change<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.290> fifty<00:03:11.500> percent

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
from that and change to fifty percent

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.390 
from that and change to fifty percent
elite<00:03:11.950> damage<00:03:12.340> but<00:03:12.660> for<00:03:13.660> all<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.829> like<00:03:14.950> super

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
elite damage but for all but like super

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.120 
elite damage but for all but like super
super<00:03:15.790> high<00:03:16.150> greater<00:03:16.569> rift<00:03:16.900> tears<00:03:17.230> where<00:03:17.859> you

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
super high greater rift tears where you

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.099 
super high greater rift tears where you
know<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.730> would<00:03:18.850> matter<00:03:19.030> on<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.359> rift<00:03:19.690> guardian

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
know it would matter on a rift guardian

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.069 
know it would matter on a rift guardian
it's<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.519> basically<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.389> same<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.959> it

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
it's it's basically the same so it

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.569 
it's it's basically the same so it
hasn't<00:03:23.260> really<00:03:23.620> been<00:03:23.859> nerfed<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.310> that's<00:03:24.430> why

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
hasn't really been nerfed and that's why

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.699 
hasn't really been nerfed and that's why
that's<00:03:25.359> something<00:03:25.569> I've<00:03:25.750> mentioned<00:03:25.989> as<00:03:26.530> soon

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
that's something I've mentioned as soon

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.140 
that's something I've mentioned as soon
as<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.889> nerf<00:03:27.069> was<00:03:27.280> announced<00:03:27.639> that<00:03:27.670> guys<00:03:27.910> like

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
as the nerf was announced that guys like

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.190 
as the nerf was announced that guys like
it<00:03:28.329> what's<00:03:28.510> not<00:03:28.810> really<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.079> nerf<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.109> know

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
it what's not really a nerf but you know

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.080 
it what's not really a nerf but you know
it's<00:03:32.440> again<00:03:33.099> Blizzard<00:03:33.430> got<00:03:33.549> rid<00:03:33.700> of<00:03:33.730> crushing

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
it's again Blizzard got rid of crushing

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.759 
it's again Blizzard got rid of crushing
blow<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.389> they<00:03:34.450> changed<00:03:34.630> rinehart<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.440> they

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
blow and they changed rinehart and they

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.379 
blow and they changed rinehart and they
also<00:03:35.920> change<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.280> furnace<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.269> no

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
also change the furnace so that it's no

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.780 
also change the furnace so that it's no
longer<00:03:37.540> percentage<00:03:38.079> damage<00:03:38.530> but<00:03:39.280> it's<00:03:39.519> still

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
longer percentage damage but it's still

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.409 
longer percentage damage but it's still
it's<00:03:40.090> still<00:03:40.530> overpowered<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:42.609> really

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
it's still overpowered and I really

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.180 
it's still overpowered and I really
don't<00:03:43.599> use<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.780> word<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.230> much<00:03:44.410> but<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:45.040> is

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
don't use that word that much but it is

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.640 
don't use that word that much but it is
and<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:46.209> reason<00:03:46.450> for<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:47.139> pretty<00:03:47.380> simple

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
and the reason for that is pretty simple

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.039 
and the reason for that is pretty simple
and<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.609> a<00:03:48.639> very<00:03:49.120> well<00:03:49.480> rolled<00:03:49.750> not

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
and this is a very well rolled not

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.270 
and this is a very well rolled not
ancient<00:03:50.200> furnace<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.650> I've<00:03:50.799> music<00:03:51.099> for<00:03:51.250> a

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
ancient furnace that I've music for a

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.909 
ancient furnace that I've music for a
long<00:03:51.430> time<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.169> reason<00:03:53.319> for<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.620> is

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
long time and the reason for that is

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.140 
long time and the reason for that is
because<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:56.010> big<00:03:57.010> modifier<00:03:57.579> on<00:03:57.609> it<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
because the big modifier on it the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.909 
because the big modifier on it the
damage<00:03:58.599> against<00:03:58.810> deletes<00:03:59.169> the<00:03:59.380> secondary

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
damage against deletes the secondary

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.949 
damage against deletes the secondary
property<00:04:00.340> it's<00:04:00.519> not<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.790> primary<00:04:01.120> property<00:04:01.690> so

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
property it's not a primary property so

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.759 
property it's not a primary property so
items<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:05.220> cold<00:04:06.220> mace<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:08.230> bomb

damage on it or like the upcoming

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.050 
damage on it or like the upcoming
wormwood<00:04:14.109> which<00:04:14.349> will<00:04:14.530> roll<00:04:14.709> 25%<00:04:15.669> poison

wormwood which will roll 25% poison
damage<00:04:16.950> those<00:04:17.950> are<00:04:18.099> all<00:04:18.250> primary<00:04:18.849> properties

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
damage those are all primary properties

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.759 
damage those are all primary properties
or<00:04:19.299> Maximus<00:04:19.750> which<00:04:19.870> was<00:04:20.049> twenty<00:04:20.320> percent<00:04:20.560> fire

or Maximus which was twenty percent fire

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.589 
or Maximus which was twenty percent fire
damage<00:04:21.070> those<00:04:21.220> are<00:04:21.310> all<00:04:21.430> primaries<00:04:22.030> so<00:04:22.510> they

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
damage those are all primaries so they

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.210 
damage those are all primaries so they
take<00:04:22.810> up<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:23.080> primary<00:04:23.560> role

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
take up a primary role

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.210 
take up a primary role
and<00:04:25.110> they<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.410> therefore<00:04:26.830> they<00:04:26.950> don't<00:04:27.100> really

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
and they and therefore they don't really

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.580 
and they and therefore they don't really
compete<00:04:27.700> or<00:04:28.480> they<00:04:28.900> can't<00:04:29.140> compete<00:04:29.290> with<00:04:29.530> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
compete or they can't compete with the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.080 
compete or they can't compete with the
furnace<00:04:29.860> because<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.190> furnace<00:04:30.490> is<00:04:30.580> not<00:04:30.790> waste

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
furnace because the furnace is not waste

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.390 
furnace because the furnace is not waste
one<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.450> its<00:04:31.570> primary<00:04:31.630> roles<00:04:32.320> on<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.650> elite

one of its primary roles on the elite

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.280 
one of its primary roles on the elite

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
damage it's a secondary role but then

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.050 
damage it's a secondary role but then
let's<00:04:35.470> look<00:04:35.590> at<00:04:35.740> something<00:04:35.980> like<00:04:36.190> this<00:04:36.460> this

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
let's look at something like this this

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.880 
let's look at something like this this
blackguard<00:04:37.360> random<00:04:38.050> sword<00:04:38.260> completely

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890

useless same damage range completely

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.030 
useless same damage range completely
unrolled<00:04:41.460> but<00:04:43.140> look<00:04:44.140> at<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.380> secondaries<00:04:44.920> on

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
unrolled but look at the secondaries on

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.240 
unrolled but look at the secondaries on
it<00:04:45.160> they<00:04:45.370> suck<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:45.880> if<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.420> was<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.660> go<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.250> try

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
it they suck and if I was to go and try

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.240 
it they suck and if I was to go and try
to<00:04:48.310> enchant<00:04:49.080> these<00:04:50.080> secondaries<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:51.130> know

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
to enchant these secondaries you know

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.610 
to enchant these secondaries you know
these<00:04:52.240> are<00:04:52.330> my<00:04:52.390> choices<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:53.200> these<00:04:53.410> are<00:04:53.590> my

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
these are my choices so these are my

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.160 
these are my choices so these are my
options<00:04:53.890> for<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.400> secondary<00:04:54.790> role<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.780> compare

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
options for a secondary role so compare

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.490 
options for a secondary role so compare
all<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.560> this<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:57.390> you<00:04:58.390> know<00:04:58.510> forty<00:04:59.170> to<00:04:59.260> fifty

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
all of this to you know forty to fifty

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.930 
all of this to you know forty to fifty
percent<00:04:59.740> of<00:04:59.830> League<00:04:59.980> damage<00:05:00.280> obviously<00:05:00.820> they

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
percent of League damage obviously they

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.090 
percent of League damage obviously they
can't<00:05:00.970> compete<00:05:01.480> at<00:05:01.600> all<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:01.840> that's<00:05:02.050> why<00:05:02.410> the

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
can't compete at all and that's why the

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.530 
can't compete at all and that's why the
furnace<00:05:03.520> is<00:05:03.640> just<00:05:03.880> it's<00:05:04.210> so<00:05:04.630> opie<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:06.510> so<00:05:07.510> i

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
furnace is just it's so opie and so i

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.560 
furnace is just it's so opie and so i
think<00:05:07.720> what<00:05:08.340> i'm<00:05:09.340> hoping<00:05:09.910> buzz<00:05:10.270> were<00:05:10.390> doing

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
think what i'm hoping buzz were doing

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.820 
think what i'm hoping buzz were doing
again<00:05:10.750> i<00:05:10.810> don't<00:05:10.870> call<00:05:11.140> for<00:05:11.290> nurse<00:05:11.440> that<00:05:11.680> much

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
again i don't call for nurse that much

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.860 
again i don't call for nurse that much
but<00:05:12.040> i<00:05:12.100> think<00:05:12.370> this<00:05:12.550> is<00:05:12.730> this<00:05:13.030> is<00:05:13.150> gonna<00:05:13.360> be<00:05:13.570> for

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
but i think this is this is gonna be for

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.430 
but i think this is this is gonna be for
the<00:05:14.110> good<00:05:14.230> of<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.410> game<00:05:14.560> i<00:05:15.460> think<00:05:16.440> otherwise

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
the good of the game i think otherwise

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.630 
the good of the game i think otherwise
everybody<00:05:17.740> is<00:05:17.919> going<00:05:18.010> to<00:05:18.070> have<00:05:18.190> an<00:05:18.370> ancient

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
everybody is going to have an ancient

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.300 
everybody is going to have an ancient
furnace<00:05:18.760> i<00:05:19.320> think<00:05:20.320> they<00:05:20.440> need<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.620> take<00:05:20.919> the

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
furnace i think they need to take the

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.040 
furnace i think they need to take the
fifty<00:05:21.970> forty<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.390> fifty<00:05:22.570> percent<00:05:22.810> of<00:05:22.930> lead

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
fifty forty to fifty percent of lead

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.230 
fifty forty to fifty percent of lead
damage<00:05:23.410> modifier<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.430> move<00:05:24.790> it<00:05:24.910> to<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.060> primary

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
damage modifier and move it to a primary

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.690 
damage modifier and move it to a primary
so<00:05:26.050> keep<00:05:26.320> it<00:05:26.470> keep<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:26.890> where<00:05:27.040> it<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.190> but<00:05:27.640> just

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
so keep it keep it where it is but just

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.630 
so keep it keep it where it is but just
make<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.330> primary<00:05:28.840> role<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:30.130> you<00:05:30.430> can<00:05:30.550> even

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
make it a primary role and you can even

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.520 
make it a primary role and you can even
give<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.030> furnace<00:05:31.390> some<00:05:31.600> sort<00:05:31.870> of<00:05:31.900> secondary

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
give the furnace some sort of secondary

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.110 
give the furnace some sort of secondary
property<00:05:32.980> like<00:05:33.100> give<00:05:33.310> it<00:05:33.430> another<00:05:33.640> legendary

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
property like give it another legendary

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.300 
property like give it another legendary
property<00:05:34.630> that<00:05:34.780> makes<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.110> cool<00:05:35.290> that<00:05:36.190> maybe

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
property that makes it cool that maybe

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.770 
property that makes it cool that maybe
even<00:05:36.490> does<00:05:36.790> something<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.390> know<00:05:37.510> maybe<00:05:37.690> it

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
even does something you know maybe it

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.540 
even does something you know maybe it
does<00:05:37.900> some<00:05:38.050> AOE<00:05:38.290> damage<00:05:38.410> or<00:05:38.980> you<00:05:39.310> know<00:05:39.430> it's

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
does some AOE damage or you know it's

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.830 
does some AOE damage or you know it's
called<00:05:39.729> the<00:05:39.820> furnace<00:05:40.180> so<00:05:40.360> maybe<00:05:40.540> it<00:05:40.690> has

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
called the furnace so maybe it has

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.500 
called the furnace so maybe it has
something<00:05:40.870> to<00:05:41.440> do<00:05:41.590> with<00:05:41.910> five<00:05:42.910> or<00:05:43.090> destruction

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
something to do with five or destruction

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.960 
something to do with five or destruction
I<00:05:43.900> have<00:05:44.020> no<00:05:44.140> idea<00:05:44.290> maybe<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:45.220> has<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.370> proc<00:05:45.700> like

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
I have no idea maybe it has a proc like

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.620 
I have no idea maybe it has a proc like
the<00:05:46.090> maximus<00:05:46.630> has<00:05:46.780> a<00:05:46.810> proc<00:05:47.140> but<00:05:47.500> if<00:05:48.460> at<00:05:49.419> that

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
the maximus has a proc but if at that

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.120 
the maximus has a proc but if at that
point<00:05:49.690> it<00:05:50.260> would<00:05:50.410> be<00:05:50.500> competitive<00:05:51.010> because

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
point it would be competitive because

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.800 
point it would be competitive because
now<00:05:51.400> you<00:05:51.460> have<00:05:51.610> something<00:05:52.060> like<00:05:52.390> fifty

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
now you have something like fifty

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.219 
now you have something like fifty
percent<00:05:53.140> elite<00:05:53.560> damage<00:05:53.950> versus<00:05:55.229> 25%

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
percent elite damage versus 25%

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:57.270 
percent elite damage versus 25%
elemental<00:05:56.680> damage<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:57.070> even<00:05:57.100> though

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
elemental damage and even though

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.980 
elemental damage and even though
elemental<00:05:57.700> damage<00:05:57.820> is<00:05:58.120> arguably<00:05:58.600> a<00:05:58.660> little

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
elemental damage is arguably a little

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.510 
elemental damage is arguably a little
bit<00:05:59.080> easier<00:05:59.229> to<00:05:59.470> get<00:05:59.680> on<00:05:59.830> items<00:06:00.160> that<00:06:00.310> elite

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
bit easier to get on items that elite

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.409 
bit easier to get on items that elite
damages<00:06:01.440> now<00:06:02.440> it's<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:03.160> little<00:06:03.820> first<00:06:04.240> it's

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
damages now it's a little first it's

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:05.670 
damages now it's a little first it's
still<00:06:04.660> probably<00:06:04.900> going<00:06:05.260> to<00:06:05.320> be<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.410> go-to

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
still probably going to be the go-to

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.140 
still probably going to be the go-to
choice<00:06:05.830> but<00:06:06.280> it's<00:06:06.400> going<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:06.550> be<00:06:06.669> a<00:06:06.700> little<00:06:07.000> bit

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
choice but it's going to be a little bit

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.460 
choice but it's going to be a little bit
more<00:06:07.300> competitive<00:06:07.810> because<00:06:07.930> now<00:06:08.260> you're

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
more competitive because now you're

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.409 
more competitive because now you're
thinking<00:06:08.830> okay<00:06:09.040> twenty-five<00:06:09.880> percent<00:06:10.060> extra

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
thinking okay twenty-five percent extra

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.540 
thinking okay twenty-five percent extra
damage<00:06:10.570> against<00:06:10.990> everything<00:06:11.550> including

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
damage against everything including

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.180 
damage against everything including
elites<00:06:12.820> or<00:06:13.030> fifty<00:06:13.600> percent<00:06:13.930> damage<00:06:14.169> but<00:06:14.740> just

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
elites or fifty percent damage but just

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.150 
elites or fifty percent damage but just
against<00:06:15.610> elites<00:06:15.910> and<00:06:16.090> that's<00:06:16.750> where<00:06:17.169> that's

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
against elites and that's where that's

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.860 
against elites and that's where that's
where<00:06:18.370> you<00:06:18.610> actually<00:06:18.790> have<00:06:19.060> some<00:06:19.240> choices<00:06:19.479> and

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
where you actually have some choices and

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.510 
where you actually have some choices and
at<00:06:19.990> some<00:06:20.320> point<00:06:20.680> maybe<00:06:20.830> if<00:06:21.100> you<00:06:21.190> have<00:06:21.310> like<00:06:21.460> a

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
at some point maybe if you have like a

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.330 
at some point maybe if you have like a
really<00:06:21.820> well<00:06:22.180> rolled<00:06:22.450> non<00:06:22.720> furnace<00:06:23.200> then<00:06:24.190> it

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
really well rolled non furnace then it

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.040 
really well rolled non furnace then it
might<00:06:24.490> be<00:06:24.669> better<00:06:24.850> than<00:06:25.060> like<00:06:25.270> a<00:06:25.450> mediocre

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
might be better than like a mediocre

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.030 
might be better than like a mediocre
furnace<00:06:26.560> but<00:06:27.280> as<00:06:27.490> it<00:06:27.850> stands<00:06:28.560> this<00:06:29.560> bad<00:06:29.800> boy

furnace but as it stands this bad boy
for<00:06:30.100> those<00:06:30.340> you<00:06:30.460> could<00:06:30.640> watch<00:06:30.760> my<00:06:30.970> solar<00:06:31.240> grid

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
i prided this patch i topped out at 37

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.590 
i prided this patch i topped out at 37
then<00:06:36.130> in<00:06:36.370> 38

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
then in 38

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.540 
then in 38
i<00:06:37.690> got<00:06:38.110> i<00:06:38.140> crafted<00:06:38.590> a<00:06:38.680> Devastator<00:06:39.100> not<00:06:39.370> the

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
i got i crafted a Devastator not the

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.980 
i got i crafted a Devastator not the
best<00:06:39.760> but<00:06:39.880> it's<00:06:40.090> not<00:06:40.210> bad<00:06:40.420> this<00:06:40.630> is<00:06:40.750> an<00:06:40.840> ancient

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
best but it's not bad this is an ancient

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.130 
best but it's not bad this is an ancient
Devastator<00:06:41.530> it's<00:06:41.710> like<00:06:41.950> an<00:06:42.040> okay<00:06:42.490> one<00:06:42.730> and

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
Devastator it's like an okay one and

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.740 
Devastator it's like an okay one and
also<00:06:44.140> found<00:06:44.560> an<00:06:44.740> ancient<00:06:45.420> Firebirds<00:06:46.420> I<00:06:46.510> which

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
also found an ancient Firebirds I which

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.170 
also found an ancient Firebirds I which
again<00:06:46.990> is<00:06:47.200> okay<00:06:47.620> it's<00:06:48.340> not<00:06:48.490> it's<00:06:48.550> not<00:06:48.760> bad<00:06:49.060> it's

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
again is okay it's not it's not bad it's

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.150 
again is okay it's not it's not bad it's
definitely<00:06:49.570> better<00:06:50.140> than<00:06:50.260> any<00:06:50.560> non<00:06:50.770> ancient

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
definitely better than any non ancient

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.860 
definitely better than any non ancient

this<00:06:56.470> non<00:06:57.130> ancient<00:06:57.580> furnace<00:06:57.760> because<00:06:58.210> it's

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 
this non ancient furnace because it's

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.320 
this non ancient furnace because it's
just<00:06:58.600> so<00:06:58.780> we'll<00:06:59.170> rolled<00:06:59.380> so<00:07:00.210> anyway<00:07:01.210> guys

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
just so we'll rolled so anyway guys

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.150 
just so we'll rolled so anyway guys
that's<00:07:01.660> just<00:07:02.080> kind<00:07:02.620> of<00:07:02.680> my<00:07:02.740> take<00:07:02.980> on<00:07:03.100> it

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
that's just kind of my take on it

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.860 
that's just kind of my take on it
because<00:07:03.430> I've<00:07:03.910> seen<00:07:03.940> a<00:07:04.180> lot<00:07:04.270> of<00:07:04.390> posts<00:07:04.780> on

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:04.870 
because I've seen a lot of posts on

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.120 
because I've seen a lot of posts on

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
really want that ancient furnace and

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.790 
really want that ancient furnace and
their<00:07:09.780> craft<00:07:10.780> they're<00:07:10.990> wondering<00:07:11.410> like<00:07:11.530> when

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
their craft they're wondering like when

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.920 
their craft they're wondering like when
is<00:07:11.950> when<00:07:12.310> can<00:07:12.580> I<00:07:12.640> craft<00:07:12.910> a<00:07:13.060> non<00:07:13.210> ancient<00:07:13.630> item

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
is when can I craft a non ancient item

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.610 
is when can I craft a non ancient item
or<00:07:14.140> a<00:07:14.380> non<00:07:14.860> furnace<00:07:15.310> ancient<00:07:15.930> that<00:07:16.930> is<00:07:17.380> going

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
or a non furnace ancient that is going

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.380 
or a non furnace ancient that is going
to<00:07:17.710> be<00:07:17.800> competitive<00:07:18.340> with<00:07:18.550> a<00:07:18.910> non<00:07:19.090> ancient

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390 
to be competitive with a non ancient

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.000 
to be competitive with a non ancient
furnace<00:07:19.540> and<00:07:20.160> the<00:07:21.160> answer<00:07:21.520> is<00:07:22.230> maybe<00:07:23.230> but<00:07:23.800> it's

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010 
furnace and the answer is maybe but it's

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.410 
furnace and the answer is maybe but it's
going<00:07:24.130> to<00:07:24.220> be<00:07:24.340> tough<00:07:24.490> it's<00:07:24.700> not<00:07:24.940> going<00:07:25.330> to

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.420 
going to be tough it's not going to

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.850 
going to be tough it's not going to
happen<00:07:25.510> right<00:07:25.690> away<00:07:25.840> just<00:07:26.020> because<00:07:26.290> of<00:07:26.650> you

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:26.860 
happen right away just because of you

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.100 
happen right away just because of you
know<00:07:26.950> but<00:07:27.190> first<00:07:27.340> as<00:07:28.090> a<00:07:28.150> secondary<00:07:28.630> property

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110 
know but first as a secondary property

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.070 
know but first as a secondary property
that<00:07:29.410> is<00:07:29.650> the<00:07:30.640> strongest<00:07:31.150> secondary<00:07:31.660> property

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 
that is the strongest secondary property

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.530 
that is the strongest secondary property
in<00:07:32.230> the<00:07:32.350> entire<00:07:32.560> game<00:07:33.120> barring<00:07:34.120> against

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:34.540 
in the entire game barring against

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.450 
in the entire game barring against
something<00:07:34.810> like<00:07:35.110> blade<00:07:35.530> a<00:07:35.560> prophecy<00:07:36.100> where<00:07:36.430> a

something like blade a prophecy where a

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.950 
something like blade a prophecy where a
