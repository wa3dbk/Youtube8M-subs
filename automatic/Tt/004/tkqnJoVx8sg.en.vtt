00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
lake used to flow to the south and you

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.250 
lake used to flow to the south and you
can<00:00:42.129> see<00:00:42.370> that<00:00:42.609> remnant<00:00:43.149> of<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:43.359> 60<00:00:44.079> mile

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
can see that remnant of that 60 mile

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.160 
can see that remnant of that 60 mile
wide<00:00:44.620> kind<00:00:45.399> of<00:00:45.579> path<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:46.180> this<00:00:46.359> river<00:00:46.719> of<00:00:46.899> grass

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
wide kind of path of this river of grass

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.500 
wide kind of path of this river of grass
and<00:00:47.649> that's<00:00:48.160> a<00:00:48.280> water<00:00:48.850> in<00:00:49.000> Lake<00:00:49.180> Okeechobee

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
and that's a water in Lake Okeechobee

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.020 
and that's a water in Lake Okeechobee
would<00:00:50.019> flood<00:00:50.350> over<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.949> flick<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.550> south

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
would flood over and flick to the south

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.569 
would flood over and flick to the south
very<00:00:52.510> slowly<00:00:53.019> would<00:00:53.379> move<00:00:53.620> down<00:00:53.649> to<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:54.309> south

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
very slowly would move down to the south

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.029 
very slowly would move down to the south
tip<00:00:54.940> of<00:00:55.090> Florida<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.690> Florida<00:00:56.230> Bay<00:00:56.589> and<00:00:56.859> that

tip of Florida and Florida Bay and that

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.119 
tip of Florida and Florida Bay and that
was<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.280> all<00:00:57.850> Sawgrass<00:00:58.539> marshes<00:00:59.109> and<00:00:59.440> beautiful

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
was a all Sawgrass marshes and beautiful

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.860 
was a all Sawgrass marshes and beautiful
Sawgrass<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:00.760> slowly<00:01:01.089> flowing<00:01:01.570> would

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
Sawgrass and slowly flowing would

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.560 
Sawgrass and slowly flowing would
evaporate<00:01:02.140> up<00:01:02.620> into<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.460> air<00:01:03.579> and<00:01:03.879> condense

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
evaporate up into the air and condense

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.600 
evaporate up into the air and condense
into<00:01:04.780> clouds<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.379> rain<00:01:05.530> back<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:06.310> would<00:01:06.460> also

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
into clouds and rain back and would also

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.640 
into clouds and rain back and would also
percolate<00:01:07.330> down<00:01:07.540> into<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:07.960> groundwater<00:01:08.320> and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
percolate down into the groundwater and

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.370 
percolate down into the groundwater and
what's<00:01:09.070> happened<00:01:09.520> is<00:01:09.670> is<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.390> has<00:01:11.140> been

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
what's happened is is that has been

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.170 
what's happened is is that has been
interrupted<00:01:11.650> that<00:01:12.130> river<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.610> grass<00:01:12.759> has<00:01:13.150> been

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
interrupted that river of grass has been

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.870 
interrupted that river of grass has been
blocked<00:01:13.689> off<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.950> they<00:01:15.280> built<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.670> dike

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
blocked off because they built the dike

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.210 
blocked off because they built the dike
around<00:01:15.909> Lake<00:01:16.509> Okeechobee<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:18.070> those

hurricanes and came across in 26 and 28
they<00:01:21.820> they<00:01:22.270> built<00:01:22.600> a<00:01:22.780> dike<00:01:22.990> around<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.439> lake

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
they they built a dike around the lake

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.190 
they they built a dike around the lake
not<00:01:23.829> 35<00:01:24.399> foot<00:01:24.640> high<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.149> improved<00:01:25.720> these<00:01:25.899> two

the west coast and those two estuaries

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.350 
the west coast and those two estuaries
are<00:01:37.540> critical<00:01:38.530> estuary<00:01:39.310> habitats<00:01:39.909> for<00:01:40.180> our

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
are critical estuary habitats for our

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.719 
are critical estuary habitats for our
South<00:01:41.290> coastal<00:01:41.740> Florida<00:01:42.189> these<00:01:42.310> coastal

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
South coastal Florida these coastal

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.700 
South coastal Florida these coastal
estuaries<00:01:42.939> are<00:01:43.329> really<00:01:43.899> really<00:01:44.170> important

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
estuaries are really really important

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.609 
estuaries are really really important
and<00:01:45.159> so<00:01:45.369> what's<00:01:45.909> happened<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.509> we<00:01:46.630> disrupted

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
and so what's happened that we disrupted

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.639 
and so what's happened that we disrupted
them<00:01:47.799> by<00:01:47.979> dumping<00:01:48.430> tons<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.119> tons<00:01:49.149> of

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
them by dumping tons and tons of

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.840 
them by dumping tons and tons of
billions<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.740> gallons<00:01:51.070> of<00:01:51.189> water<00:01:51.250> out<00:01:51.610> into

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
billions of gallons of water out into

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
there and as the pollution has caused

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.830 
there and as the pollution has caused
that<00:01:53.950> really<00:01:54.399> disruption<00:01:55.030> in<00:01:55.149> those<00:01:55.360> estrine

from<00:02:44.380> coming<00:02:44.740> in<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.850> problem<00:02:46.330> is<00:02:46.510> now<00:02:46.720> of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
from coming in the problem is now of

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.000 
from coming in the problem is now of
course<00:02:47.170> at<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.530> lake

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
course at the lake

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.090 
course at the lake
whenever<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.790> lake<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.180> too<00:02:49.480> high<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.990> we

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
whenever the lake is too high and we

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.580 
whenever the lake is too high and we
channelized<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.310> Kissimmee<00:02:51.700> River<00:02:52.590> cut

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
channelized the Kissimmee River cut

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.380 
channelized the Kissimmee River cut
right<00:02:53.800> through<00:02:54.040> those<00:02:54.190> ox<00:02:54.520> boats<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.060> now<00:02:55.180> it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
right through those ox boats and now it

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.390 
right through those ox boats and now it
takes<00:02:55.570> less<00:02:55.840> than<00:02:56.050> three<00:02:56.350> days<00:02:56.560> for<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.190> water

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
takes less than three days for the water

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.000 
takes less than three days for the water
from<00:02:57.700> there<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.090> reach<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.300> de<00:02:59.110> lake<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.560> then

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
from there to reach the de lake and then

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.800 
from there to reach the de lake and then
now<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.550> doesn't<00:03:00.790> even<00:03:01.030> get<00:03:01.270> down<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.690> the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
now it doesn't even get down to the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.430 
now it doesn't even get down to the
Everglades

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
Everglades

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.230 
Everglades
so<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.710> Everglades<00:03:03.160> are<00:03:03.340> starving<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.030> Lower

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
so the Everglades are starving the Lower

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.300 
so the Everglades are starving the Lower
East<00:03:04.330> Coast<00:03:04.780> water<00:03:05.110> supply<00:03:05.530> is<00:03:05.590> not<00:03:05.980> there

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
East Coast water supply is not there

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.120 
East Coast water supply is not there
it's<00:03:06.460> not<00:03:06.550> percolating<00:03:07.300> in<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.709> farmers

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
it's not percolating in and the farmers

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.010 
it's not percolating in and the farmers
are<00:03:09.220> getting<00:03:09.370> perfect<00:03:09.790> water<00:03:10.150> conditions<00:03:10.750> and

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
are getting perfect water conditions and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.190 
are getting perfect water conditions and
so<00:03:11.320> we<00:03:11.500> need<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:12.010> get<00:03:12.820> back<00:03:13.150> some<00:03:13.570> of<00:03:13.630> that<00:03:13.870> flow

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
so we need to get back some of that flow

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.350 
so we need to get back some of that flow
away<00:03:14.320> south<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:15.160> give<00:03:15.730> back<00:03:15.970> some<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.270> that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
away south and give back some of that

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.120 
away south and give back some of that
agricultural<00:03:17.110> land<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.440> move<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.920> water

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
the C 44 or single C canal is another

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.640 
the C 44 or single C canal is another
part<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.360> watershed<00:05:32.690> about<00:05:33.260> a<00:05:33.289> hundred

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
part of the watershed about a hundred

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.920 
part of the watershed about a hundred
and<00:05:33.740> sixteen<00:05:34.160> thousand<00:05:34.700> acres<00:05:35.000> of<00:05:35.479> also

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
and sixteen thousand acres of also

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.960 
and sixteen thousand acres of also
citrus<00:05:36.440> land<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.890> drains<00:05:37.160> into<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.669> canal

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
citrus land that drains into the canal

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.909 
citrus land that drains into the canal
so<00:05:38.210> we<00:05:38.390> may<00:05:38.539> not<00:05:38.690> even<00:05:38.750> get<00:05:39.140> this<00:05:39.380> charted<00:05:39.740> just

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
so we may not even get this charted just

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.860 
so we may not even get this charted just
from<00:05:40.100> the<00:05:40.250> lake<00:05:40.460> we're<00:05:41.090> still<00:05:41.360> having<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.690> deal

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
from the lake we're still having to deal

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.930 
from the lake we're still having to deal
with<00:05:41.900> discharges<00:05:42.770> from<00:05:42.979> her<00:05:43.100> own<00:05:43.310> watershed

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
primarily C 23 24 and the C 44 basin

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.730 
primarily C 23 24 and the C 44 basin
around<00:05:49.160> the<00:05:49.760> c-44<00:05:50.450> canal<00:05:50.479> so<00:05:51.020> that<00:05:51.229> could<00:05:51.470> rank

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
around the c-44 canal so that could rank

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.040 
around the c-44 canal so that could rank
all<00:05:52.039> locally<00:05:52.610> could<00:05:52.880> run<00:05:53.090> off<00:05:53.240> into<00:05:53.510> there<00:05:53.810> and

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
all locally could run off into there and

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.440 
all locally could run off into there and
we<00:05:54.710> have<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:55.010> really<00:05:55.310> get<00:05:55.430> upstream<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.210> stop

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
we have to really get upstream and stop

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.890 
we have to really get upstream and stop
it

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
it

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.600 
it
