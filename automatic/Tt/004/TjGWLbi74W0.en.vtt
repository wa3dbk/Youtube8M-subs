00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.750
 nobody likes to have opaque tires and 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.610
 no shine because they look awful they are 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.980
 the cars today we are going to 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.660
 teach as with all zinc we're going 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.279
 to see out shine and life to those tires 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.580
 and plastics that are completely 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.380
 dried 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.560
 for example observe this rim 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.539
 it looks dry and dull and makes the 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.160
 car look bad what we're going to do 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.870
 let's kiss him , this tire shines in 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
 question of seconds 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.500
 let's apply a little bit of all the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.680
 dressing our applicator again 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.690
 as always friends three lines is all 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.940
 what we need because with our 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.579
 little products can do much for 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.460
 your 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.870
 to observe how we started to apply 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.870
 on the rim 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.980
 the brightness is almost instantaneous as 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.870
 it starts to shine 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 selections to apply it a little bit 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.070
 the inside of the rim 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.960
 so that it stays better 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:12.060
 and that gives good results is time to 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.060
 apply it on the lip of the rim 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.560
 so that it is very bright 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.830
 in uniform 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.640
 it is applied in that way 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.020
 very easy to apply and also has been 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.420
 dry to the touch and has a coconut smell 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.909
 excellent now I'm going to show you how 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.149
 we can also use it in plastics 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.880
 and the sides of the car come to 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.640
 here this plastic is also found 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.960
 a little opaque and rough we will have 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.710
 served life in a matter of seconds 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.720
 observe how he was in this way is 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.049
 starting to revive in a way 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.049
 Excellent 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.670
 look that he is leaving the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.670
 plastic 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.799
 and has renewed life in a matter of 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.799
 seconds 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.420
 if it has a little bit of overcast 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.670
 they grab a microfiber towel 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.670
 and eliminate the excess that was moved 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.560
 Easy to put on and gives it shine in 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.970
 seconds now if you are from the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.210
 people who like to have the tires 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.950
 a little brighter 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.260
 but what do you have to do to leave 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.390
 brighter expose a little bit more of 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.430
 all 13 on the rim but if you in 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.070
 the people who like to have that look 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.270
 mate that is being used nowadays 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.270
 just take a microfiber towel 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.040
 and will remove the excess of 13 in the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.040
 rim in this way 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.750
 giving it a matte look 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.750
 but at the same time dark 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.280
 and dry to the touch once more 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.780
