00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.830 
d kilograms so I'm actually very very
close<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:06.010> all<00:02:06.130> three<00:02:06.370> of<00:02:06.430> those<00:02:06.610> targets<00:02:07.120> a

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
close to all three of those targets a

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.450 
close to all three of those targets a
while<00:02:08.320> back<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.710> was<00:02:08.800> looking<00:02:09.070> like<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.220> was

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
while back it was looking like I was

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.859 
while back it was looking like I was
going<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.640> get<00:02:09.729> nowhere<00:02:09.970> near<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.479> squat<00:02:10.780> in

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
going to get nowhere near the squat in

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:11.970 
going to get nowhere near the squat in
particular<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.410> I'll<00:02:11.500> make<00:02:11.650> some<00:02:11.830> pretty

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
particular so I'll make some pretty

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.710 
particular so I'll make some pretty
massive<00:02:12.340> progress<00:02:12.790> there<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.450> can<00:02:13.570> actually

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
massive progress there you can actually

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.230 
massive progress there you can actually
go<00:02:13.930> about<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.290> go<00:02:14.410> back<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.770> january<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:16.120> you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
go about you go back to january if you

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.670 
go about you go back to january if you
can<00:02:16.360> be<00:02:16.450> asked<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:16.900> find<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.350> for<00:02:17.530> that

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
can be asked you can find that for that

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.010 
can be asked you can find that for that
video<00:02:17.830> we're<00:02:18.310> saying<00:02:18.640> about<00:02:18.820> mods<00:02:19.090> discuss<00:02:19.840> my

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020

video we're saying about mods discuss my
targets<00:02:21.690> again<00:02:22.690> one<00:02:22.930> thinking<00:02:23.380> now<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.560> that

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860

keep<00:02:40.810> those<00:02:41.050> three<00:02:41.440> goals<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.430> will<00:02:42.610> be

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
keep those three goals so it will be

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.600 
keep those three goals so it will be
technically<00:02:43.270> 2015<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:45.130> know<00:02:45.220> what<00:02:45.370> kind

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
technically 2015 but you know what kind

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.040 
technically 2015 but you know what kind
of<00:02:45.670> wedge<00:02:45.850> between<00:02:45.940> friends<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.570> if<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.870> can

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
of wedge between friends so if I can

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.140 
of wedge between friends so if I can
keep<00:02:47.200> those<00:02:47.410> three<00:02:48.370> targets<00:02:48.760> I'll<00:02:48.910> be

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
maybe a little bit optimistic but my

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.870 
maybe a little bit optimistic but my
shoulder<00:03:05.890> felt<00:03:06.040> good<00:03:06.280> at<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.400> competition<00:03:06.820> I

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
shoulder felt good at the competition I

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.460 
shoulder felt good at the competition I
felt<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.150> lot<00:03:07.299> stronger<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.810> feel<00:03:08.049> like<00:03:08.200> that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
felt a lot stronger so I feel like that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.800 
felt a lot stronger so I feel like that
is<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:09.640> know<00:03:09.730> very<00:03:09.760> close<00:03:10.239> for<00:03:10.420> being<00:03:10.600> there

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
is you know very close for being there

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.410 
is you know very close for being there
so<00:03:11.769> it's<00:03:11.890> possible<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.519> like<00:03:12.790> dead<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.239> we're

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
so it's possible and like dead if we're

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.350 
so it's possible and like dead if we're
talking<00:03:13.570> about<00:03:13.810> another<00:03:14.640> five<00:03:15.640> pounds<00:03:15.970> so

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
talking about another five pounds so

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.650 
talking about another five pounds so
again<00:03:16.690> we're<00:03:16.930> talking<00:03:16.959> like<00:03:17.380> what<00:03:17.680> to

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
again we're talking like what to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.150 
again we're talking like what to
everyone<00:03:19.660> no<00:03:19.810> sorry<00:03:20.049> another<00:03:20.200> 10<00:03:20.470> pounds<00:03:20.500> o<00:03:20.920> 5

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
everyone no sorry another 10 pounds o 5

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.789 
everyone no sorry another 10 pounds o 5
kilograms<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:21.820> again<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.600> something<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.739> I

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
kilograms so again is something that I

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.080 
kilograms so again is something that I
think<00:03:23.920> is<00:03:24.190> there<00:03:24.400> i<00:03:24.430> mean<00:03:24.549> i<00:03:24.610> felt<00:03:24.820> like<00:03:24.910> i<00:03:25.060> had

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
think is there i mean i felt like i had

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.220 
think is there i mean i felt like i had
a<00:03:25.269> chance<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.750> getting<00:03:25.989> out<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
a chance of getting out of the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.570 
a chance of getting out of the
competition<00:03:26.500> obviously<00:03:27.040> didn't<00:03:27.280> work<00:03:27.310> out

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
competition obviously didn't work out

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.820 
competition obviously didn't work out
that<00:03:27.640> way<00:03:27.880> by<00:03:28.060> fuller<00:03:28.390> come<00:03:28.570> i'm<00:03:28.810> close<00:03:29.799> to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
that way by fuller come i'm close to

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.070 
that way by fuller come i'm close to
being<00:03:30.220> there<00:03:30.340> right<00:03:30.549> now<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:30.940> hopefully<00:03:31.600> you

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
being there right now so hopefully you

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.990 
being there right now so hopefully you
know<00:03:32.170> if<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.500> heat<00:03:32.739> six<00:03:33.160> weeks<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.549> read<00:03:33.820> these

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
know if I heat six weeks and read these

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.490 
know if I heat six weeks and read these
and<00:03:34.180> training<00:03:34.540> it's<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.140> to<00:03:35.170> be<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.320> little

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
and training it's going to be a little

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.020
