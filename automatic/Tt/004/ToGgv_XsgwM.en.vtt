00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.779

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.529
 corresponding links first question 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.850
 favorite book undoubtedly harry potter and 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.680
 the prisoner of azkaban movie 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.210
 favorite undoubtedly harry potter and the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.649
 prisoner of azkaban movie less 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.750
 favorite harry potter and the prince 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.539
 mestizo or the mystery of the prince ' what 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.760
 adaptation shit did what the fuck 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.260
 of film part of the books of the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.420
 movies that made you cry in the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.129
 books cry I think with the death of 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.839
 David in the movie also believes that the 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.120
 death of two but the part that made me 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.010
 I shudder inside and mourn for 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.659
 the part where harry potter and the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.789
 relics of death part 2 are put 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.859
 everyone to make the dome to protect 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.010
 howard this part you see me in the cinema 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.260
 as super excited because I thought 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.000
 very powerful if you can get involved with a 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.770
 character of harry potter with what would be 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.960
 I think I would do it with symptoms because 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.180
 He is very handsome in movies and that's 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.820
 Favorite character to bellatrix lestrange 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.740
 how would your pattern be used is if it is the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.240
 thing you want most would be with the face 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.980
 of my boyfriend but I do not think it would be with 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.620
 my boyfriend's face the truth is difficult 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.080
 so I think it would be a kind of 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.150
 lady gaga with a weird hat or something 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.830
 so if you could have any of the three 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.480
 relics of death 'which one would you choose 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.520
 the invisibility cloak because I 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.260
 would allow many more things to be done in 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.240
 what house would you be the truth is that according to 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.800
 pottermore would not be a gryffindor and is 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.450
 I do not know if I would like to be much 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.640
 a gryffindor so I would not care 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.190
 minus a slytherin I do not want to be 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.740
 slytherin thank you if you could meet 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.510
 Some member of the movies of the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.000
 actors whom I would meet I would like 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.770
 much to know my dear snape now 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.880
 same I do not remember what it 's called the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.890
 real life but I would like very much 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.340
 know him and also loves with the real by 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.860
 favor 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.300
 maggie smith marry me sometime 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.640
 have you played any of the video games by 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.500
 course in the psp and the nintendo dsi in 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.330
 the computer in the play in the wii in 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.580
 all the sites that I can play because 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.920
 They are about two great 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.390
 you have to play and now and right now 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.160
 if he was on the care team 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.420
 where would you be that I think of goalkeeper 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.090
 although all my life I've taken 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.710
 hosts is quite different in the quid 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.880
 and if I like it enough, you were happy with 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.370
 the final the truth is that yes although in 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.500
 the movie this way to make them 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.510
 old I did not like anything but I think that 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.150
 yes it was a worthy ending even if 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.920
 killed some good person more though 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.319
 jk rowling good makes a good kill 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.060
 but I would have killed someone else I do not know 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.310
 and finally what does it mean? 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.980
 Harry Potter for you for me means 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.469
 my childhood my adolescence and it's a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.689

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.670

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.590
 things that I like and one of my 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.780

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.760
 it means a lot and it will be something that 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.439
