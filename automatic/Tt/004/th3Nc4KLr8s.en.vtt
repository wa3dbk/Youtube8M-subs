00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.740 
and tons of resources super easy because
a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> people<00:01:54.360> traditionally<00:01:56.450> they<00:01:57.450> put

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
a lot of people traditionally they put

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.380 
a lot of people traditionally they put
their<00:01:58.579> storages<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> middle<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.240> their

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
their storages in the middle of their

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.060 
their storages in the middle of their
base<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.840> their<00:02:01.200> minds<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> outside

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
base and their minds on the outside

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.649 
base and their minds on the outside
because<00:02:02.189> they're<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.640> important<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:05.659> so

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
because they're not as important so so

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.150 
because they're not as important so so
just<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> recap<00:02:07.079> real<00:02:07.500> quickly<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.009> first

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
just to recap real quickly the first

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.290 
just to recap real quickly the first
thing<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.369> want<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:08.879> are<00:02:09.060> they

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
thing you want to look for is are they

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.940 
thing you want to look for is are they
in<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.450> league<00:02:09.629> renard<00:02:09.929> second<00:02:10.770> thing<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
in a league renard second thing you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.710 
in a league renard second thing you
don't<00:02:11.099> want<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> check<00:02:11.520> out<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.849> what<00:02:12.569> other

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
don't want to check out is what other

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.830 
don't want to check out is what other
storages<00:02:13.230> look<00:02:13.410> like

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
storages look like

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.990 
storages look like
ok<00:02:14.260> are<00:02:14.470> their<00:02:14.620> storage<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:15.010> empty<00:02:15.160> are<00:02:15.580> they

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
ok are their storage is empty are they

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.380 
ok are their storage is empty are they
filled<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:17.620> aware<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.010> lower<00:02:18.940> level

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
filled be aware that lower level

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.949 
filled be aware that lower level
storages<00:02:20.019> always<00:02:20.920> fill<00:02:21.459> before<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.720> higher

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
storages always fill before the higher

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.589 
storages always fill before the higher
level<00:02:23.440> storage<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:24.940> because<00:02:25.060> one

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
level storage is so just because one

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.890 
level storage is so just because one
storage<00:02:25.959> maybe<00:02:26.319> oozing<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.129> gold<00:02:27.400> or<00:02:27.580> elixir

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
storage maybe oozing with gold or elixir

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.240 
storage maybe oozing with gold or elixir
doesn't<00:02:28.900> necessarily<00:02:29.440> mean<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.680> they<00:02:30.010> all

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
doesn't necessarily mean that they all

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.039 
doesn't necessarily mean that they all
are<00:02:30.489> then<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.390> last<00:02:31.540> thing<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.810> you're

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
are then the last thing that you're

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.210 
are then the last thing that you're
going<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.290> you're<00:02:32.650> going<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.830> want<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.010> check

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
going to you're going to want to check

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.850 
going to you're going to want to check
for<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.730> what<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.569> mines<00:02:34.780> look<00:02:35.019> like<00:02:35.200> our

for is what the mines look like our

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.380 
for is what the mines look like our
minds<00:02:36.670> filled<00:02:37.390> are<00:02:37.660> they<00:02:37.840> empty<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:39.390> ideally

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
minds filled are they empty and ideally

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
let's take a living this guy's based ok

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.089 
let's take a living this guy's based ok
we<00:03:08.829> can<00:03:08.860> see<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> top<00:03:09.549> left<00:03:09.879> eye<00:03:10.860> he<00:03:11.860> has

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
we can see in the top left eye he has

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.470 
we can see in the top left eye he has
not<00:03:12.340> been<00:03:12.579> placed<00:03:12.849> on<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.090> league<00:03:13.269> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
seasons been going for a couple days and

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.220 
seasons been going for a couple days and
come<00:03:16.060> down<00:03:16.239> here<00:03:16.420> check<00:03:16.720> out<00:03:16.840> all<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.049> his

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
come down here check out all of his

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.759 
come down here check out all of his
storages<00:03:17.799> they<00:03:18.310> were<00:03:18.370> all<00:03:18.730> empty<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.620> then

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
storages they were all empty and then

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.640 
storages they were all empty and then
come<00:03:20.950> over<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.220> his<00:03:21.340> mind's<00:03:22.200> excited<00:03:23.200> elixir

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
come over to his mind's excited elixir

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.020 
come over to his mind's excited elixir
lines<00:03:23.889> are<00:03:24.069> full<00:03:24.370> as<00:03:24.810> are<00:03:25.810> his<00:03:26.170> gold<00:03:26.650> mines<00:03:27.030> ok

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
lines are full as are his gold mines ok

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.319 
lines are full as are his gold mines ok
so<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:29.200> means<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.920> by<00:03:30.489> simply<00:03:30.730> attacking

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
so that means that by simply attacking

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.690 
so that means that by simply attacking
the<00:03:31.420> mines<00:03:31.630> we<00:03:31.840> should<00:03:32.049> be<00:03:32.170> able<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.410> get<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.859> ton

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
the mines we should be able to get a ton

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.750 
the mines we should be able to get a ton
if<00:03:34.000> not<00:03:34.480> all<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:35.049> this<00:03:35.319> guy's<00:03:35.560> moved<00:03:35.889> so<00:03:36.609> it's

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
if not all of this guy's moved so it's

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.060 
if not all of this guy's moved so it's
going<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.060> speed<00:03:37.239> it<00:03:37.269> up

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.940 

bringing<00:03:41.070> archers<00:03:41.490> in

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.010 

already<00:03:47.879> we're<00:03:48.120> almost<00:03:48.270> at<00:03:48.569> 200<00:03:49.230> down

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
already we're almost at 200 down

00:03:51.020 --> 00:04:01.390 
already we're almost at 200 down
and<00:03:51.230> just<00:03:51.770> been<00:03:51.950> attacking

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.010 

in<00:04:01.790> terms<00:04:02.060> of<00:04:02.269> resources

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.780 

really<00:04:06.770> naughty<00:04:06.980> not<00:04:07.520> not<00:04:08.120> having<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.570> work

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.640 

okay<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:16.209> while<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.419> mines<00:04:16.600> are<00:04:16.720> gone<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:17.169> got

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
okay so while the mines are gone I got

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.890 
okay so while the mines are gone I got
