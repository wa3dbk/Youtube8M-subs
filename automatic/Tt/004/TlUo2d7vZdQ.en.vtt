00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.359 
not you know before you're about to rip
it<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.469> half<00:02:07.500> you're<00:02:07.829> just<00:02:07.979> getting<00:02:08.250> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it in half you're just getting that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.589 
it in half you're just getting that
crease<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.819> you're<00:02:08.910> gonna<00:02:09.000> want<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> cut

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
lightly into it just to give it that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.130 
lightly into it just to give it that
Bend<00:02:11.220> all<00:02:11.879> right<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.540> see<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:13.020> did

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
Bend all right so now you can see we did

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.370 
Bend all right so now you can see we did
this

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
this

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.170 
this
same<00:02:13.470> thing<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.920> side<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.430> well<00:02:14.910> as<00:02:15.000> this

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
same thing to this side as well as this

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.270 
same thing to this side as well as this
side<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:16.020> last<00:02:16.200> step<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.830> fold<00:02:17.130> this

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
side the last step is just to fold this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.850 
side the last step is just to fold this
side<00:02:17.570> fold<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.780> top<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.320> now<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.740> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
side fold it on top so now we have the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.400 
side fold it on top so now we have the
shape<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.280> box<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:21.600> we<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.050> either

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
shape of a box and we can just either

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.490 
shape of a box and we can just either
trim<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.460> top<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.420> cut<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.750> all<00:02:24.930> off<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.380> can

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
trim the top and cut this all off we can

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.670 
trim the top and cut this all off we can
trim<00:02:25.710> right<00:02:25.830> here<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.280> remove<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.180> extra<00:02:27.680> or

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
trim right here and remove this extra or

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.070 
trim right here and remove this extra or
what<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.100> do<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.580> cut<00:02:30.180> lightly<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:30.930> we've

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
what we can do is cut lightly so we've

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.180 
what we can do is cut lightly so we've
created<00:02:31.200> another<00:02:31.380> fold<00:02:31.770> mine

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
created another fold mine

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.830 
created another fold mine
and<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.550> fact<00:02:32.790> fold<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.240> top<00:02:33.540> right<00:02:33.780> over

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and the fact fold this top right over

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.570 
and the fact fold this top right over
that's<00:02:34.200> right<00:02:34.500> over<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.830> top<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.430> other

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
that's right over the top of the other

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.640 
that's right over the top of the other
two<00:02:35.820> folds<00:02:36.120> we<00:02:36.240> have<00:02:36.390> before<00:02:36.780> let<00:02:37.350> me<00:02:37.440> go<00:02:37.560> ahead

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
two folds we have before let me go ahead

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.160 
two folds we have before let me go ahead
and<00:02:37.770> do<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.280> show<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> end<00:02:38.790> result
