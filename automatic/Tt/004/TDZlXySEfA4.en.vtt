00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.670
 Hello, my name is Anna Baklanova 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.770
 Today I will show you the work of gel polishes with 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.230
 using the author's technique of painting 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.660
 nail gel paints on standard 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.480
 the scheme we prepared the nails of the model 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.630
 made a manicure treated buff now 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.630
 my chery moves i took the kinel fool 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.239
 Now we will process the nails to Bandera 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.710
 us serves to clutch artificial 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.400
 material with a natural like 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.400
 Double-sided tape 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.040
 The next step I have to wear shoes 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.870
 super base thanks to its super base 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.850
 from en garde gel varnish is removed very 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.350
 quickly within five to seven minutes with 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.480
 swinging I'll put it in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.190
 all movements very very subtle it 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.820
 one of the secrets of what gel polish will be 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.820
 stay very long 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.590
 dry in the lamp 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.950
 i work with led lamp gelish 36 watt and 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.950
 dry 30 seconds 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.899
 after drying, remove the layer from the base of the fish 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.380
 I chose 2 colors for the design 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.330
 blue and blue under blue to us 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.220
 need a white substrate it can 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.250
 apply white gel polish I chose 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.290
 ivory number 32 ingarden 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:25.660
 one layer of white backing is enough 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.660
 can be put in one layer without pro beaches 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.920
 we put a white substrate where we have 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.920
 will be blue 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.610
 now selected gel polishes are applied 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.790
 for two words drying each in the lamp 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.360
 I remind you that we put on a white substrate 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.040
 126 iris 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.200
 from ingar to cover turned 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.070
 as close to the cuticle as possible 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.920
 apply gel polish 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.540
 with your left thumb try 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.540
 a little run down 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.579
 where we have no white backing we 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.090
 will use 110 color lagoon from 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.090
 ingar come on 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.099
 we send you to dry 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.099
 we put the second layer 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.240
 seal the end 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.040
 the nails that we covered more light 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:06.650
 gel varnish and cover top ingarden 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:09.170
 two in one nails darker we 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.500
 we cover with matte top everything is cool 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.500
 design 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.550
 our tops are dry and remove the sticky layer 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.520
 our cover is ready coupon for design i 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.510
 chose two gel-paint without a sticky layer 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.510
 number three and number 4 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.050
 I recommend taking gel paint on 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.720
 palette 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.250
 for design, I chose the brush run it 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.250
 number one short nap 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.230
 the design doesn't have to be 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.330
 symmetrical now white gel paint 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.480
 fit in our black monograms 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.320
 so that it turns black as if 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.320
 stroke 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.720
 in some places it is possible for emphasis 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.800
 volume to volume was more appetizing 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:04.509
 put 2 layers of paint do not be afraid here 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.509
 not worth learning to wear matrix 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.530
 design is ready 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.280
 today we learned how to do work length 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.740
