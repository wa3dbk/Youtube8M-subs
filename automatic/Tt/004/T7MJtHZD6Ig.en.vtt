00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.779
 Hello, we are talking today about the game 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.950
 date with you captain of the matrix 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:33.010
 driver and today we rather not 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:39.460
 educational video is probably entertaining 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.350
 I have accumulated such 100 coupons today 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.060
 I want to review 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.770
 open them all at the same time see how 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.870
 probability theory will act 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.060
 will I fall like any 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.890
 being and 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:04.180
 five star check as better 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.860
 choose five stars and 1 to 5 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.840
 cards on one card 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.630
 but in my opinion it is absolutely without 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.869
 the differences are not that give it 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.869
 values 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.229
 Well, of course there will be slightly more coupons 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.610
 because if anyone knows when you 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.670
 get a 4 star famous map 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:33.039
 then you can click on the facebook icon and 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.479
 then click there to share and sunset for 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.770
 every such click 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.579
 you are given one coupon that is for 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.819
 one card to one additional cube he 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:53.319
 but so let's go all the same 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:58.340
 let's see for a long time I have not received 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:05.530
 I would very much like any useful maps 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:08.690
 so that something has changed now and so 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:13.250
 I'll tell you three - star double - digit 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.060
 Cards are not interesting to me so much 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.060
 go further 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:29.290
 yeah now the forerunner is already in principle 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.290
 not bad, this card will be useful to me 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.180
 the knight of hell is also not a bad card 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.690
 so far four star 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.720
 we twist further 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.370
 so hypnotist 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:59.580
 not so useful in my opinion aha 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.210
 Forms mbar is better now 4 star 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.760
 cards 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:10.760
 started to fall wait wait maybe all 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:14.450
 still give me a 5 star 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.450
 would love to 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.880
 go ahead 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.159
 no bedtime can immediately see 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:34.930
 five star they are so halo 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:41.129
 shine until nothing is almost half 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.129
 coupons I opened my knight 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:53.639
 51 left so that despite the fact that 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:57.459
 about five so exactly I pulled 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:00.819
 four star creatures nothing yet 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.980
 would very much like a creature with liquidation 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:09.159
 myself because I don't have a single one 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:13.419
 and on the gate card I very seriously of course 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.439
 stuck now without them one more 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:19.720
 precursor 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:22.599
 sand and being four star 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.789
 Good cards, but I want to 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:29.349
 Of course we gave you more 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:34.440
 try one by one maybe by one 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.440
 lucky dark lord 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.130

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.130

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.600
 being five star I got already 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:14.900
 slightly upon a basically no sin 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.510

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.180

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.100

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.770
 100 coupons and even longer to get even 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.990
 120

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:13.009
 immortal and about 20 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:16.190
 four star basically but about 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.900
 I expected this result 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.910
 be 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.349
 there was hope some kind of five star 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:28.630
 being pull out more useful to me but 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:32.560
 nevertheless , in principle, it will be nice 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:36.620
