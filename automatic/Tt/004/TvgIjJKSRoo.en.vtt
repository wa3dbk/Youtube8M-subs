moisture with the correct moisture meter

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.539 
moisture with the correct moisture meter
in<00:00:10.240> our<00:00:11.240> case<00:00:11.510> as<00:00:11.750> subfloor<00:00:12.410> is<00:00:12.619> wood<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.070> the

completed your room should look like
this<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:53.180> will<00:00:53.300> need<00:00:53.450> to<00:00:53.660> cut<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.140> male<00:00:54.350> part

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
this you will need to cut the male part

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.130 
this you will need to cut the male part

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
of the click system off so the expansion

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.920 
of the click system off so the expansion
gap<00:00:57.559> is<00:00:57.770> not<00:00:57.980> compromised
