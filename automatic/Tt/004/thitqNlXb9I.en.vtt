of enemies down there so let's try and
line<00:01:44.259> them<00:01:44.380> up<00:01:44.500> here<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:44.860> it's<00:01:45.009> best<00:01:45.280> not<00:01:45.640> to

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
line them up here and it's best not to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.859 
line them up here and it's best not to
do<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.240> not<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.750> kind<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:48.509> its<00:01:49.509> best<00:01:49.719> to

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
do this not to kind of its best to

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.240 
do this not to kind of its best to
flying<00:01:50.079> around<00:01:50.259> in<00:01:50.350> a<00:01:50.439> circle<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:50.890> my<00:01:50.920> opinion

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
flying around in a circle in my opinion

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.800 
flying around in a circle in my opinion
that<00:01:51.340> works<00:01:51.610> best<00:01:51.880> but<00:01:52.119> if<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.360> want<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.630> kind

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
that works best but if you want to kind

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.959 
that works best but if you want to kind
of<00:01:52.869> really<00:01:53.619> over<00:01:53.950> exaggerate<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:54.670> line<00:01:54.939> your

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
of really over exaggerate and line your

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.370 
of really over exaggerate and line your
gunner<00:01:55.329> up<00:01:55.479> there's<00:01:55.719> no<00:01:55.780> problem<00:01:56.229> with<00:01:56.350> that

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
gunner up there's no problem with that

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.560 
gunner up there's no problem with that
but<00:01:56.500> what<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:56.770> usually<00:01:56.950> do<00:01:57.219> is<00:01:57.399> fly<00:01:58.030> around<00:01:58.149> in<00:01:58.479> a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
but what I usually do is fly around in a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.929 
but what I usually do is fly around in a
circle<00:01:58.840> like<00:01:58.990> this<00:01:59.140> around<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.100> flag<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.610> my

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
circle like this around a flag that my

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.880 
circle like this around a flag that my
team<00:02:01.149> is<00:02:01.180> trying<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.539> cap<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.469> really

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
team is trying to cap and it really

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.910 
team is trying to cap and it really
really<00:02:03.009> really<00:02:03.600> does<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.810> think<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:05.619> I'm<00:02:05.710> voice

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
really really does to think so I'm voice

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.219 
really really does to think so I'm voice
crack<00:02:06.219> does<00:02:06.490> two<00:02:06.729> things<00:02:06.759> for<00:02:07.329> you<00:02:07.479> guys<00:02:07.659> the

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
crack does two things for you guys the

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.930 
crack does two things for you guys the
first<00:02:08.500> thing<00:02:08.740> is<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:09.039> get<00:02:09.160> skills<00:02:09.490> obviously

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
first thing is it get skills obviously

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.190 
first thing is it get skills obviously
but<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.330> second<00:02:10.660> thing<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:10.930> think<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
but the second thing and I think the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.780 
but the second thing and I think the
bigger<00:02:11.440> thing<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.830> does<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.190> cause<00:02:12.760> a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
bigger thing it does is cause a

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.170 
bigger thing it does is cause a
distraction<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.620> know<00:02:14.740> we<00:02:15.430> can<00:02:15.790> say<00:02:16.030> that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
distraction and you know we can say that

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.699 
distraction and you know we can say that
this<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.330> just<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.690> video<00:02:16.900> game<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.230> yes<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.590> is

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
this is just a video game and yes it is

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.530 
this is just a video game and yes it is
but<00:02:18.280> if<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.489> have<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.640> giant<00:02:18.940> transport

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
but if you have a giant transport

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.850 
but if you have a giant transport
chopper<00:02:19.840> flying<00:02:20.080> above<00:02:20.290> your<00:02:20.440> head<00:02:20.620> maybe

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
chopper flying above your head maybe

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.210 
chopper flying above your head maybe
