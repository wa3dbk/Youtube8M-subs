when I get a minute to talk I want to
talk<00:00:25.320> about<00:00:25.470> kind<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.180> simple<00:00:27.180> principles

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
talk about kind of my simple principles

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.939 
talk about kind of my simple principles
of<00:00:27.660> cutting<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.289> sure<00:00:28.470> who<00:00:28.590> told<00:00:28.800> me

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
of cutting and I'm not sure who told me

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.460 
of cutting and I'm not sure who told me
this<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.429> said<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:30.179> use<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> ABCs<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
this but they said you use the ABCs and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.190 
this but they said you use the ABCs and
I've<00:00:31.769> added<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.250> D<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> cutting<00:00:33.480> principles

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
I've added a D to the cutting principles

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
I've added a D to the cutting principles
the<00:00:34.860> first<00:00:34.890> thing<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.399> want<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.969> always

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the first thing we want to do is always

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.560 
the first thing we want to do is always
we<00:00:36.719> want<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.930> anchor<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.890> tool<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.390> want

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
we want to anchor the tool and we want

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.569 
we want to anchor the tool and we want
to<00:00:39.629> anchor<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.200> before<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> touches<00:00:40.950> any<00:00:41.309> wood

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
to anchor it before it touches any wood

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.299 
to anchor it before it touches any wood
anchor<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> tool<00:00:42.930> rest<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:44.040> next

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
anchor it on the tool rest the next

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.270 
anchor it on the tool rest the next
thing<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.550> want<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> B<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> bevel

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
thing we want to do the B is the bevel

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.830 
thing we want to do the B is the bevel
the<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> try<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.690> on

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the and what we want to try to do is on

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720 
the and what we want to try to do is on
our<00:00:49.140> tools<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.710> most<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.070> our<00:00:50.160> gauges<00:00:50.520> we

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
our tools like most of our gauges we

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
our tools like most of our gauges we
want<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> try<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> rub<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> bevel<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.800> we

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
want to try to rub a bevel and so we

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.160 
want to try to rub a bevel and so we
anchor<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.270> put<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> bevel<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
anchor it then we put the bevel on the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.700 
anchor it then we put the bevel on the
tool<00:00:55.530> we're<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:56.520> cutting<00:00:56.850> yet<00:00:57.210> okay<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.440> now

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
tool we're not cutting yet okay and now

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.549 
tool we're not cutting yet okay and now
we<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.850> some<00:00:59.879> another<00:01:00.539> fulcrum<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
we can have some another fulcrum or a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
we can have some another fulcrum or a
support<00:01:02.100> point<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.520> tourists<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> bevel

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
support point the tourists and the bevel

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.560 
support point the tourists and the bevel
is<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.989> support<00:01:04.500> point<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> C<00:01:06.450> we

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
is a support point and then the C we

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320 
is a support point and then the C we
want<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> do<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.110> cut<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.340> cut<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.060> now

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
want to do is cut so now we cut and now

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.149 
want to do is cut so now we cut and now
you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.659> start<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> shavings

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you can start to see that the shavings

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.200 
you can start to see that the shavings
are<00:01:11.520> coming<00:01:11.790> off

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
are coming off

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
are coming off
so<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.570> anchored<00:01:13.080> I've<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> bevel

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so I'm anchored I've got the bevel

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.300 
so I'm anchored I've got the bevel
rubbing<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.240> I'm<00:01:15.420> cutting<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.920> D<00:01:17.130> I've

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
rubbing and now I'm cutting the D I've

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
rubbing and now I'm cutting the D I've
at<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.850> direction<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.600> there's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.900> lot<00:01:19.080> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
at is is direction and there's a lot of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.800 
at is is direction and there's a lot of
things<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:19.650> far<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.860> direction<00:01:20.400> goes<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
things as far as direction goes the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.179 
things as far as direction goes the
first<00:01:22.080> thing<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.350> always<00:01:22.530> want<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
first thing I always want to think of is

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.550 
first thing I always want to think of is
the<00:01:23.340> direction<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> flute<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:25.350> I'm

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560

I'm<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.920> cut<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.310> going<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
I'm going this kind of a cut is going to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.010 
I'm going this kind of a cut is going to
get<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> catch<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.600> quite<00:01:39.780> dangerous

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
get a catch it will be quite dangerous

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.469 
get a catch it will be quite dangerous
for<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.829> make<00:01:41.009> sure<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.400> close<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
for you so make sure you close it in the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.899 
for you so make sure you close it in the
direction<00:01:42.720> you're<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.380> also<00:01:44.189> want<00:01:44.700> as

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
far as the direction goes I want the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.950 
far as the direction goes I want the
tool<00:01:46.500> pointed<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.340> direction<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:48.240> want<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
tool pointed in that direction I want to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.859 
tool pointed in that direction I want to
point<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.530> direction<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:51.149> we're

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
point it in that direction and we're

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.990 
point it in that direction and we're
going<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> cut<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.500> direction<00:01:53.159> cut<00:01:53.579> uphill

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
going to cut this direction cut uphill

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.819 
going to cut this direction cut uphill
because<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.869> remember<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.409> showed<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
because just remember we showed you the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.459 
because just remember we showed you the
broom<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.520> fibers<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:58.140> want<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.350> make

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
broom the fibers there you want to make

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.200 
broom the fibers there you want to make
sure<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.979> going<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> direction<00:01:59.700> so

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
sure that it's going that direction so

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.359 
sure that it's going that direction so
we'll<00:02:00.960> cut<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.770> direction

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
we'll cut that direction

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.280 
we'll cut that direction
the<00:02:02.670> handles<00:02:03.090> pointing<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.420> direction<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the handles pointing that direction and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.530 
the handles pointing that direction and
here's<00:02:04.560> another<00:02:04.680> D<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.820> want<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.149> handle

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
here's another D we want that handle

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.859 
here's another D we want that handle
down<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.550> there's<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> ABC<00:02:09.360> DS<00:02:09.599> of

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
down on that so there's the ABC DS of

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.229 
down on that so there's the ABC DS of
cutting
