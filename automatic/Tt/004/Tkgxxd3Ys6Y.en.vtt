the<00:01:44.640> video<00:01:45.170> probably<00:01:46.170> five<00:01:46.470> times<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.340> tried<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the video probably five times I tried it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.180 
the video probably five times I tried it
my<00:01:48.210> nail<00:01:48.420> got<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:49.140> sore<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.920> just

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
my nail got really sore and I just

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.440 
my nail got really sore and I just
couldn't<00:01:50.490> figure<00:01:50.610> out<00:01:50.759> how<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.940> do<00:01:51.149> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
couldn't figure out how to do it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.830 
couldn't figure out how to do it
but<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.979> easiest<00:01:53.310> way<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.030> once<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
but the easiest way to do it is once you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.550 
but the easiest way to do it is once you
take<00:01:55.020> out<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.289> SIM<00:01:55.649> tray<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.960> look<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.259> here

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
take out the SIM tray you look in here

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.749 
take out the SIM tray you look in here
and<00:01:59.090> this<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> really<00:02:01.399> thin<00:02:02.399> piece<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
and this is a really thin piece of

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.120 
and this is a really thin piece of
plastic<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.080> weakest<00:02:04.470> part<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
plastic and it's the weakest part of the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.309 
plastic and it's the weakest part of the
entire<00:02:05.399> frame<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.869> don't<00:02:07.020> need<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> really

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
entire frame and you don't need a really

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
underneath that part where you just came

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.449 
underneath that part where you just came
up<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.790> go<00:02:54.030> up<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.930> down<00:02:55.040> turn<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.130> corner

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
up and go up and down turn the corner

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.009 
up and go up and down turn the corner
and<00:02:56.579> go<00:02:56.700> around<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.150> when<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.780> you'll

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
and go around and when I do this you'll

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.770 
and go around and when I do this you'll
hear<00:02:58.170> all<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.440> clips<00:02:58.769> disengaging<00:02:59.579> so<00:02:59.910> we'll

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
hear all the clips disengaging so we'll

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:10.179 
hear all the clips disengaging so we'll
just<00:03:00.959> listen<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.739> that

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.330 

all<00:03:11.189> right<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.500> there's<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:13.950> clips<00:03:14.189> on

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
all right so there's all the clips on

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.599 
all right so there's all the clips on
the<00:03:14.430> one<00:03:14.579> side<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:16.170> would<00:03:16.890> recommend<00:03:17.189> doing

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
the one side and I would recommend doing

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.470 
the one side and I would recommend doing
this<00:03:17.879> very<00:03:18.120> often<00:03:18.420> because<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.790> cases<00:03:21.359> are

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
this very often because the cases are

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.209 
this very often because the cases are
really<00:03:21.659> hard<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:21.989> come<00:03:22.170> by<00:03:22.379> they<00:03:22.709> don't<00:03:22.890> sell

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:23.219 
really hard to come by they don't sell

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.460 
really hard to come by they don't sell
replacements<00:03:23.879> for<00:03:24.060> them<00:03:24.269> they<00:03:24.989> don't<00:03:25.109> sell

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
replacements for them they don't sell

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.050 
replacements for them they don't sell
the<00:03:25.620> bamboo<00:03:25.950> cases<00:03:26.400> right<00:03:26.579> now<00:03:26.609> they're<00:03:26.939> out

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
the bamboo cases right now they're out

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.360 
the bamboo cases right now they're out
of<00:03:27.090> stock<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.799> break<00:03:29.010> one<00:03:29.189> of<00:03:29.250> these

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
of stock and if you break one of these

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.360 
of stock and if you break one of these
clips<00:03:29.700> then<00:03:30.659> it's<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.379> kind<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.709> game<00:03:32.010> over

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
clips then it's it's kind of game over

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.830 
clips then it's it's kind of game over
and<00:03:32.609> there's<00:03:33.060> really<00:03:33.209> nothing<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:33.629> do

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
and there's really nothing you can do

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.280 
and there's really nothing you can do
