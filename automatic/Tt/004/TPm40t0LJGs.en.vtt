that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.080 
that
so<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:14.010> course<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.550> going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:14.820> emotional

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so of course it going to get emotional

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300 
so of course it going to get emotional
over<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.930> when<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.710> finish<00:02:17.070> like

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
over it and when you have a finish like

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.850 
over it and when you have a finish like
60<00:02:17.700> floors<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:19.140> hard<00:02:19.410> not<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.710> get<00:02:19.800> a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
60 floors then it's hard not to get a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.470 
60 floors then it's hard not to get a
little<00:02:19.950> bit<00:02:20.130> emotional<00:02:20.340> because<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.210> so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
little bit emotional because they are so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.600 
little bit emotional because they are so
different<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.080> they<00:02:22.590> are<00:02:22.620> individual<00:02:23.430> as

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
different and they are individual as

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.330 
different and they are individual as
well<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.180> each<00:02:25.080> floor<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.740> unique<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
well so each floor is unique to the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.980 
well so each floor is unique to the
house<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.150> nor<00:02:27.360> even<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.660> fit<00:02:27.870> out

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
house that it's in nor even the fit out

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.890 
house that it's in nor even the fit out
that<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.510> okay<00:02:30.510> even<00:02:30.780> though<00:02:30.870> I
