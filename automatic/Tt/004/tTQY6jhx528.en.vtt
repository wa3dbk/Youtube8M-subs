00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
we've got our last petal here that we're

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.610 
we've got our last petal here that we're
going<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:23.050> thin<00:02:23.380> out<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.720> if<00:02:25.720> any<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.410> these

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
going to thin out and if any of these

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.790 
going to thin out and if any of these
should<00:02:26.920> tear<00:02:27.370> or<00:02:27.730> rip

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
should tear or rip

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.340 
should tear or rip
you<00:02:29.130> can<00:02:29.280> always<00:02:29.490> cut<00:02:30.210> another<00:02:30.480> one<00:02:30.570> or<00:02:31.020> you

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
you can always cut another one or you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.620 
you can always cut another one or you
can<00:02:31.500> take<00:02:31.710> some<00:02:32.010> vanilla<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.580> paint<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.540> over

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
can take some vanilla and paint it over

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.380 
can take some vanilla and paint it over
the<00:02:33.900> little<00:02:34.050> ripped<00:02:34.710> part<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.460> just<00:02:36.090> set<00:02:36.300> it

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the little ripped part and just set it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.110 
the little ripped part and just set it
aside<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.900> dry<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.890> really<00:02:38.100> helps<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.670> so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
aside to dry and that really helps it so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.580 
aside to dry and that really helps it so
before<00:02:39.450> we<00:02:39.600> do<00:02:39.750> our<00:02:39.870> yellow<00:02:40.230> we're<00:02:40.500> gonna

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
before we do our yellow we're gonna

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.040 
before we do our yellow we're gonna
switch<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.130> our<00:02:41.250> thick<00:02:41.580> foam<00:02:41.880> here<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.510> we're

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
switch to our thick foam here and we're

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.670 
switch to our thick foam here and we're
gonna<00:02:43.110> cup<00:02:43.790> push<00:02:44.790> our<00:02:45.030> ball<00:02:45.240> tool<00:02:45.630> into<00:02:46.290> these

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
gonna cup push our ball tool into these

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.240 
gonna cup push our ball tool into these
petals<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:48.120> they<00:02:48.300> kind<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.660> cup<00:02:48.960> up<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.620> then

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
petals so they kind of cup up and then

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.220 
petals so they kind of cup up and then
one<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.670> center<00:02:51.120> there<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.600> again<00:02:51.990> it's

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
one in the center there and again it's

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.260 
one in the center there and again it's
gonna<00:02:52.350> fall<00:02:52.710> back<00:02:52.890> open<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:54.000> from<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
gonna fall back open just from the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.930 
gonna fall back open just from the
weight<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:56.220> fondant<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:56.760> that's

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
weight of the the fondant but that's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.840 
weight of the the fondant but that's
okay<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.770> we're<00:02:58.770> gonna<00:02:58.860> set<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.250> aside<00:02:59.400> for<00:02:59.760> a

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
okay so we're gonna set this aside for a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.030 
okay so we're gonna set this aside for a
second<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.270> dry<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:01.230> one<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.620> our<00:03:01.740> flower

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
second to dry on one of our flower

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.290 
second to dry on one of our flower
formers<00:03:03.020> there<00:03:04.020> we<00:03:04.170> go<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.980> then<00:03:05.220> we're<00:03:06.210> gonna

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
formers there we go and then we're gonna

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.720 
formers there we go and then we're gonna
get<00:03:06.510> our<00:03:06.600> yellow<00:03:07.490> and<00:03:08.490> roll<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.270> out<00:03:10.730> really

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
get our yellow and roll this out really

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790 
get our yellow and roll this out really
thin<00:03:11.880> about<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.570> thickness<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.140> dime<00:03:13.320> again

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
thin about the thickness of a dime again

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.770 
thin about the thickness of a dime again
and<00:03:14.130> if<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.000> ever<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.390> one<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.630> these<00:03:15.720> little

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
and if you ever get one of these little

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.130 
and if you ever get one of these little
rolling<00:03:16.350> pins<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:17.400> has<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.090> rings<00:03:18.390> on<00:03:18.780> them

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
rolling pins that has the rings on them

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
rolling pins that has the rings on them
you<00:03:20.070> can<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.670> think<00:03:21.120> it's<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.890> what<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.130> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
you can I think it's the what is it the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.850 
you can I think it's the what is it the
pink<00:03:23.550> ring<00:03:23.910> that's<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.870> thinnest<00:03:25.290> one<00:03:25.560> and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
pink ring that's the thinnest one and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.370 
pink ring that's the thinnest one and
you<00:03:26.520> can<00:03:26.730> use<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.330> help<00:03:27.360> measure<00:03:28.080> how

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
you can use that to help measure how

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.690 
you can use that to help measure how
thick<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.830> want<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.160> we're<00:03:29.280> going<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.430> cut

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
thick you want it so we're going to cut

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.030 
thick you want it so we're going to cut
out<00:03:29.850> another<00:03:30.840> one<00:03:31.080> here<00:03:32.090> from<00:03:33.090> our<00:03:33.239> yellow<00:03:33.540> but

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
out another one here from our yellow but

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.380 
out another one here from our yellow but
we<00:03:35.040> don't<00:03:35.220> need<00:03:35.459> all<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.850> these<00:03:36.120> we're

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
we don't need all of these we're

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.000 
we don't need all of these we're
actually<00:03:36.630> just<00:03:36.900> going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:38.090> tear<00:03:39.090> off<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:40.010> you

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
actually just going to tear off and you

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.160 
actually just going to tear off and you
can<00:03:41.190> use<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.340> cutter<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.900> would<00:03:43.020> work

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
can use a cutter that that would work

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.479 
can use a cutter that that would work
great<00:03:43.320> or<00:03:43.680> if<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.890> don't<00:03:43.980> have<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.160> cutter<00:03:44.370> you

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
great or if you don't have a cutter you

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.040 
great or if you don't have a cutter you
can<00:03:44.520> just<00:03:44.760> rip<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:44.940> off<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.540> just<00:03:45.690> want<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.900> tear

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
can just rip it off we just want to tear

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.040 
can just rip it off we just want to tear
off<00:03:46.200> two<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.670> petals<00:03:48.030> here<00:03:48.420> we<00:03:48.660> don't<00:03:48.780> need

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
off two of the petals here we don't need

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.110 
off two of the petals here we don't need
everything<00:03:49.650> else<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.610> we're<00:03:50.700> going<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.880> set

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
everything else so we're going to set

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.430 
everything else so we're going to set
our<00:03:51.300> yellow<00:03:51.480> aside<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:53.100> get<00:03:53.250> our<00:03:53.370> thin<00:03:53.700> foam

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
our yellow aside and get our thin foam

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.199 
our yellow aside and get our thin foam
and<00:03:55.440> put<00:03:55.620> our<00:03:55.709> two<00:03:55.890> petals<00:03:56.160> on<00:03:56.489> there<00:03:56.730> and

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
and put our two petals on there and

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.620 
and put our two petals on there and
we're<00:03:57.360> going<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.510> thin<00:03:57.870> out<00:03:58.280> our<00:03:59.280> two<00:03:59.880> yellow

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
we're going to thin out our two yellow

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.670 
we're going to thin out our two yellow
petals<00:04:02.300> because<00:04:03.300> if<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.660> look<00:04:03.900> at<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.050> pansy<00:04:04.560> it

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
petals because if you look at a pansy it

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.840 
petals because if you look at a pansy it
it's<00:04:05.070> kind<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.940> layered<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.600> on<00:04:06.780> one<00:04:07.050> side

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
it's kind of layered just on one side

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.199 
it's kind of layered just on one side
the<00:04:08.850> whole<00:04:09.030> thing<00:04:09.300> is<00:04:09.480> not<00:04:09.690> double<00:04:10.140> layered<00:04:10.350> so

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
the whole thing is not double layered so

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.660 
the whole thing is not double layered so
we're<00:04:12.209> thinning<00:04:12.570> out<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:14.010> side<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.489> can

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
we're thinning out that side and you can

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.420 
we're thinning out that side and you can
thin<00:04:14.910> out<00:04:15.270> the<00:04:15.600> little<00:04:15.810> part<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.430> ripped

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
thin out the little part that you ripped

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.180 
thin out the little part that you ripped
off<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.880> kind<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.260> make<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.290> look<00:04:19.590> more

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
off to kind of make it look more

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.250 
off to kind of make it look more
realistic<00:04:20.430> okay
