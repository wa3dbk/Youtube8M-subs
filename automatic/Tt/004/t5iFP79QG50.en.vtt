00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 and well only separate from 0 0 so 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.950
 today we find ourselves in the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.920
 pointed doses to make a click for 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.530
 duplicate these blocks 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.650
 so no matter what we're going 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.080
 do we will go live at the earliest we 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 so you will need blocks and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.670
 random so me during the countdown 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:33.030
 of the earth and then the block that you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:35.579
 therefore want increased to take 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 no diamond blocks i'm going to take 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.579
 that a point to hot stones credit 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 so so you have four re Islands 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:50.000
 stone and two repeaters and a 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.789
 torch here and I forgot the sides 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.190
 to instigate biston otherwise it works 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.010
 there so what are we going to do 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.199
 it's going to be a loop 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.159
 we will pass a piston here a repeater 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.580
 here two-way up and the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.080
 restaurant so suddenly in fact what we 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 is going to do is we go to him but that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.740
 so it's going to flow from there 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.150
 make a sacred continuous claret that's it 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.040
 must do is interrupt the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.150
 re circuit is going to have the reposition drew 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.610
 So that's it, so we're going 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.270
 just put a restaurant thing that you 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:37.229
 can go further and there what that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.500
 is that it does that and so the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:45.540
 silk do is we will place the block 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.490
 that you want so it's like that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.909
 blow is to do is we will spend the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.619
 random block in so he's going to believe 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.680
 than that to make a blog becomes a member of 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.590
 blow it will duplicate 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.250
 So here it is too bad to muddy 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 little bug 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.040
 so it works we learn 3.2 ya between 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:15.110
 is also in addition 3.1 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.110
 so the crowd has to find the place 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.990
 find you the place where we finally put 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.150
 the block 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:30.180
 here you go, that's it 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.110
 stops at 15 like all the bush that 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.970
 push no more than 15 blocks and after 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.600
 what are we going to do next here for 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.510
 stop him doing that so that goes on and on 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.620
 after we can the cases it is suddenly 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.570
 after is offered to 9 10 rebounds per block 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.950
 when you can know it and so that 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:57.810
 really walked all the blocks doing 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:00.959
 to learn I have not less than their 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.980
 wants to take order - entirely 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.630
 we will take him to tell my god oh no 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.610
 we will take emerald blocks like 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.970
 So here we are going to replace the rest 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:18.120
 single mans then we will place 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.050
 blocks that you do not want when you 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.870
 you have plenty of zeppelin blocks 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.910
 caubel stone bah you it's not con 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.550
 do this I do it for you to do that so 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.200
 if there is anybody to say yeah but me 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.010
 I do not know how to build blogs 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.650
 and all it's very simple it's new and 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.430
 happy to do that so I you 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:51.050
 showed waiting for the crafting head 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.540
 hop the pop 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.769
 so be fore you know we're going 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:01.880
 here I showed we are clearly 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:03.900
 seized with the others 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.410
 fills anyway you know how to do it 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.900
 block 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.230
 then when you put it back it does not give 9 10 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.890
 before simply 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.889
 so here there are small faye also in 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:21.380
 this thing after we can very well 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.380
 resume via mans 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.780
 and so that's good brief anyway you 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.670
 can see that it works 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.860
 So here it was for 0-0 we can 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.040
 so tutorial to make a glitch for 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.510
 duplicate these blocks 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.310
 so if we read kraft we take three 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.400
 points but me it works if we learn 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.730
 at three points 2 sorry for the little 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.600
 fashion 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:51.250
 so it would be so so subscribe 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.250
 and a gel everyone
