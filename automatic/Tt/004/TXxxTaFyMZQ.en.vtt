know you get a good good flame here so

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.559 
know you get a good good flame here so
it's<00:01:46.729> not<00:01:46.819> something<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.119> probably<00:01:47.270> want<00:01:47.539> to

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
going in or siphon I guess it starts to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.650 
going in or siphon I guess it starts to
siphon<00:02:10.220> there's<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.789> wick<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.239> runs<00:02:11.480> up

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
through the center and there's again all

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.550 
through the center and there's again all
parts<00:02:15.620> listing<00:02:16.010> here<00:02:16.220> on<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.430> back

I<00:02:17.680> can<00:02:18.099> kind<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.400> show<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.910> it's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
I can kind of show you that it's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.550 
I can kind of show you that it's
probably<00:02:19.599> not<00:02:19.690> going<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.900> come<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.170> very<00:02:20.200> well

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
probably not going to come in very well

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.190 
probably not going to come in very well
but<00:02:21.060> there's<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.420> wick<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.750> runs<00:02:23.050> up

but there's like a wick that runs up
through<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.440> center<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.989> um<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.050> did<00:02:26.860> do

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
through the center so um I did do

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.530 
through the center so um I did do
because<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.550> know<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:27.880> been<00:02:28.000> sitting<00:02:28.330> for<00:02:28.360> a

that this is actually the better way to
get<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:24.990> to<00:05:25.020> let<00:05:25.259> off<00:05:25.439> so<00:05:25.680> we'll<00:05:26.009> see<00:05:26.159> how<00:05:26.250> this

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
get it to let off so we'll see how this

there is no flame now it's actually

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.709 
there is no flame now it's actually
burning<00:05:37.319> down<00:05:38.219> inside<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:39.050> matting<00:05:40.050> in<00:05:40.199> here

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
burning down inside the matting in here

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.999 
burning down inside the matting in here
you<00:05:42.719> know<00:05:42.810> I<00:05:42.839> was<00:05:43.110> going<00:05:43.229> to<00:05:43.319> do<00:05:43.439> a<00:05:43.469> night<00:05:43.740> shot
