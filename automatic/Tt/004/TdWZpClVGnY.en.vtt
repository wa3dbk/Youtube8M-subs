we're<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> cheat<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.320> do<00:00:19.380> something

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
we're going to cheat and do something

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.019 
we're going to cheat and do something
different<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.430> way<00:00:20.490> we're<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
different the way we're going to do it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.900 
different the way we're going to do it
is<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.840> come<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> brush<00:00:22.410> tool

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
is going to come up to the brush tool

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
is going to come up to the brush tool
okay<00:00:23.910> we're<00:00:24.029> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.210> change<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.779> actual

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
okay we're going to change the actual

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.679 
okay we're going to change the actual
brush<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> feather<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.539> whole

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
brush so that the feather is the whole

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.000 
brush so that the feather is the whole
way<00:00:27.840> down<00:00:28.019> i'm<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> make<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> brush<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
way down i'm going to make the brush a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.609 
way down i'm going to make the brush a
little<00:00:29.130> bit<00:00:29.400> smaller<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.939> essentially<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
little bit smaller so essentially the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.810 
little bit smaller so essentially the
brush<00:00:31.800> size<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.189> want<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.759> be

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
brush size we want is going to be

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.990 
brush size we want is going to be
quarter<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> size<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.750> our<00:00:33.870> border<00:00:34.230> okay

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
quarter of the size of our border okay

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.549 
quarter of the size of our border okay
so<00:00:36.000> what<00:00:36.120> we're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> with<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
so what we're going to do is with the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.690 
so what we're going to do is with the
feather<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> whole<00:00:38.040> way<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:38.370> i<00:00:38.520> mean<00:00:38.640> so

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
feather of the whole way down i mean so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.310 
feather of the whole way down i mean so
we're<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> heritage<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.140> just

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we're going to get a heritage so just

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
we're going to get a heritage so just
line<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.860> cross<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> center<00:00:41.879> at

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
line up the cross here in the center at

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.280 
line up the cross here in the center at
the<00:00:42.030> edge<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.420> seven<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.930> probably<00:00:43.170> too

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the edge actually seven is probably too

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.479 
the edge actually seven is probably too
big<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> make<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> slightly

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
big so it's going to make it slightly

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.900 
big so it's going to make it slightly
smaller<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> we're<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> line

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
smaller and so we're just going to line

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.010 
smaller and so we're just going to line
it<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.480> i'm<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> hold<00:00:48.840> down<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it up and i'm going to hold down the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.990 
it up and i'm going to hold down the
shift<00:00:49.110> key<00:00:49.350> before<00:00:49.590> i<00:00:49.739> start<00:00:50.010> clicking<00:00:50.219> i'll

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
shift key before i start clicking i'll

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.090 
shift key before i start clicking i'll
open<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> click<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> then<00:00:52.050> drag<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.920> whole

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
open and click and then drag the whole

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
open and click and then drag the whole
way<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.690> nothing's<00:00:54.690> happened<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
way down and nothing's happened and the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.330 
way down and nothing's happened and the
reason<00:00:55.379> why<00:00:55.440> nothing's<00:00:55.739> happened<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.129> because

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
reason why nothing's happened is because

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.619 
reason why nothing's happened is because
I've<00:00:56.489> forgotten<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> set<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> exposure<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
I've forgotten to set the exposure to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.540 
I've forgotten to set the exposure to
minus<00:00:58.079> four<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.100> still<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> nice

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
minus four so we still get a nice

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.529 
minus four so we still get a nice
straight<00:00:59.940> line<00:01:00.289> okay<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.910> minus<00:01:03.359> four

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
straight line okay so that minus four

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.609 
straight line okay so that minus four
will<00:01:03.719> stay<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.110> us<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> whole<00:01:04.379> way<00:01:04.500> through

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
will stay with us the whole way through

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
will stay with us the whole way through
as<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:06.450> quite<00:01:06.630> ready<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:06.960> with

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
as we do this not quite ready there with

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.719 
as we do this not quite ready there with
that<00:01:07.290> they<00:01:07.560> roll<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.830> whole<00:01:07.920> across<00:01:08.220> now

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.340 

again<00:01:11.729> line<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> corner<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.049> top<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
again line up the corner and the top and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.320 
again line up the corner and the top and
the<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.830> precise<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.310> obviously<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
the more precise you are obviously the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.030 
the more precise you are obviously the
better<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.630> wouldn't<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.930> an<00:01:19.080> effect<00:01:19.380> well

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
better you wouldn't have an effect well

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.230 
better you wouldn't have an effect well
consider<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.520> still<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:20.970> true

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
consider we can still kind of see true

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.359 
consider we can still kind of see true
here<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> way<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.020> solve<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
here so the way to solve that is to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.780 
here so the way to solve that is to
right-click<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.360> duplicate<00:01:25.790> but

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
right-click on it and go duplicate but

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.130 
right-click on it and go duplicate but
that's<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.119> dark<00:01:27.299> enough<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.689> again<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> can

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that's not dark enough it again you can

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.319 
that's not dark enough it again you can
duplicate<00:01:28.470> another<00:01:28.710> time<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.939> many<00:01:30.090> times

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
duplicate another time or as many times

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:30.740 
duplicate another time or as many times
as<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.570> like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
as you like

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.510 
as you like
so<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> triplicate<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.130> put<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
so the triplicate will just put the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.850 
so the triplicate will just put the
setting<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.850> top<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.180> each<00:01:33.299> other<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
setting on top of each other so if you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.200 
setting on top of each other so if you
want<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.460> those<00:01:35.610> settings<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> change

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
want to get at those settings to change

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
want to get at those settings to change
them<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.600> each<00:01:36.720> individual<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
them on each individual one you have to

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.440 
them on each individual one you have to
delete<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> pin<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.700> go<00:01:38.820> back<00:01:39.000> there's<00:01:39.360> no

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
delete the pin and go back there's no

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
delete the pin and go back there's no
other<00:01:39.570> way<00:01:39.750> around<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.310> time<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.520> we've

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
other way around in time so we've

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.700 
other way around in time so we've
created<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.180> nice<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:42.540> neat<00:01:42.689> border<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
created a nice little neat border and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.530 
created a nice little neat border and
how<00:01:43.829> accurate<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.399> depends<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.149> how

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
how accurate is depends really on how

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.240 
how accurate is depends really on how
accurate<00:01:46.049> our<00:01:46.200> drawing<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.920> our<00:01:47.040> selection

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
accurate our drawing is in our selection

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.090 
accurate our drawing is in our selection
of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> initial<00:01:48.000> point<00:01:48.229> but<00:01:49.229> let's<00:01:49.740> say<00:01:49.950> we

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
of the initial point but let's say we

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
of the initial point but let's say we
want<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> white<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.020> could

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
want to have a white one so we could

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.240 
want to have a white one so we could
drag<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.409> cross<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.829> try<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
drag this cross and try and have the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.130 
drag this cross and try and have the
white<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:54.060> wise<00:01:54.420> because<00:01:54.720> we're<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.869> mixing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
white but wise because we're just mixing

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.319 
white but wise because we're just mixing
minus<00:01:55.619> 4<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.950> plus<00:01:56.100> 4<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> other<00:01:56.520> ones<00:01:56.790> so

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
minus 4 and plus 4 on the other ones so

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.459 
minus 4 and plus 4 on the other ones so
what<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.509> need<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.049> need<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> delete

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
what we need to do is we need to delete

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.569 
what we need to do is we need to delete
these<00:02:00.259> to<00:02:01.259> get<00:02:01.829> back<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> our<00:02:02.159> original<00:02:02.189> one

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
these to get back to our original one

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.319 
these to get back to our original one
and<00:02:03.020> select<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.880> then<00:02:05.880> bring<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.210> up

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
and select that and then bring that up

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210 
and select that and then bring that up
to<00:02:06.479> +4<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.619> becomes<00:02:07.860> white

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
to +4 and that becomes white

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.559 
to +4 and that becomes white
now<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:08.970> getting<00:02:09.209> rid<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.330> everything

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
now it's not getting rid of everything

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.789 
now it's not getting rid of everything
there<00:02:09.780> completely<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.590> again<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.920> same<00:02:11.069> story

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
there completely so again the same story

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.330

duplicate<00:02:17.389> see<00:02:18.389> that's<00:02:18.540> made<00:02:18.689> it<00:02:18.810> white<00:02:19.019> now

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
duplicate see that's made it white now

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.649 
duplicate see that's made it white now
just<00:02:20.249> out<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> curiosity<00:02:20.730> if<00:02:20.999> I<00:02:21.060> press<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.450> Z

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
just out of curiosity if I press the Z

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.959 
just out of curiosity if I press the Z
key<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.139> zoom<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:23.280> can<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.700> it's

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
key and zoom in you can see that it's

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.819 
key and zoom in you can see that it's
kind<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.299> slightly<00:02:24.629> sloppy<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.349> think<00:02:25.650> some<00:02:25.799> of

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
kind of slightly sloppy I think some of

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.739 
kind of slightly sloppy I think some of
that<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.249> do<00:02:26.340> with<00:02:26.370> our<00:02:26.549> drawing<00:02:26.749> somewhere

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:27.749 
that is to do with our drawing somewhere

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.300 
that is to do with our drawing somewhere
else<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.049> might<00:02:28.200> also<00:02:28.409> be<00:02:28.590> tilled<00:02:28.859> with<00:02:28.920> grain

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
else it might also be tilled with grain

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.740 
else it might also be tilled with grain
so<00:02:29.639> just<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.969> turn<00:02:30.090> off<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.359> green<00:02:30.540> for

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
so just going to turn off the green for

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.679 
so just going to turn off the green for
a<00:02:30.780> second<00:02:31.079> here<00:02:35.629> nope<00:02:36.629> it's<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.139> green<00:02:38.689> so

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
a second here nope it's not the green so

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.989 
a second here nope it's not the green so
it's<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.079> our<00:02:40.290> drawing<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.919> if<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.849> want

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:41.999 
it's just to our drawing so if you want

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.280 
it's just to our drawing so if you want
to<00:02:42.060> try<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.269> get<00:02:42.389> in<00:02:42.540> use<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> smaller<00:02:43.200> brush

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
to try and get in use a smaller brush

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.890 
to try and get in use a smaller brush
and<00:02:43.469> be<00:02:43.739> more<00:02:43.919> accurate<00:02:44.599> that<00:02:45.599> will<00:02:45.719> give<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
and be more accurate that will give you

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.750 
and be more accurate that will give you
more<00:02:45.959> accurately<00:02:46.409> as<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.739> can<00:02:46.889> see<00:02:47.040> there<00:02:47.219> but

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
more accurately as you can see there but

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.580 
more accurately as you can see there but
it<00:02:48.150> depends<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.719> kind<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.109> what<00:02:49.200> level<00:02:49.379> you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
it depends on you kind of what level you

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.119 
it depends on you kind of what level you
want<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:49.919> go<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.659> but<00:02:51.829> if<00:02:52.829> you<00:02:53.010> make

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
want to go to and but if you make

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.470 
want to go to and but if you make
smaller<00:02:53.400> brushes<00:02:53.639> of<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:53.969> will<00:02:54.090> obviously

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
smaller brushes of that will obviously

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.580 
smaller brushes of that will obviously
make<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.409> better<00:02:56.150> okay<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.409> want<00:02:58.530> to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
make it better okay so if you want to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.229 
make it better okay so if you want to
square<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.919> off<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.129> do<00:02:59.219> it<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.459> let's

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
square it off you do it like that let's

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.789 
square it off you do it like that let's
just<00:03:00.359> give<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.540> an<00:03:00.599> idea<00:03:00.689> something<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.650> can

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
just give you an idea something you can

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.319 
just give you an idea something you can
start<00:03:02.010> for<00:03:02.219> just<00:03:02.370> creating<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:02.909> borders

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
start for just creating little borders

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.109 
start for just creating little borders
inside<00:03:03.750> develop
