coating<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.989> we're<00:02:50.200> gonna<00:02:50.319> let<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.709> rest

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
coating and we're gonna let it rest

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.629 
coating and we're gonna let it rest
covered<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.410> dough<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.890> been<00:02:54.040> resting<00:02:54.430> for

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
covered so dough is been resting for

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.050 
covered so dough is been resting for
about<00:02:54.700> 10<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.359> 12<00:02:55.600> minutes<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.819> let's<00:02:57.819> take<00:02:58.030> a

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
about 10 to 12 minutes and let's take a

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.650 
about 10 to 12 minutes and let's take a
look<00:02:58.829> nice<00:02:59.829> now<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> lot<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.549> people<00:03:00.790> ask<00:03:01.030> us<00:03:01.329> and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
look nice now a lot of people ask us and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.120 
look nice now a lot of people ask us and
this<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.019> question<00:03:02.319> we<00:03:02.410> get<00:03:02.530> all<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.920> time

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
this is a question we get all the time

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.580 
this is a question we get all the time
is<00:03:03.400> do<00:03:04.060> we<00:03:04.180> really<00:03:04.450> need<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.989> let<00:03:05.139> the<00:03:05.440> dough

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
is do we really need to let the dough

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.250 
is do we really need to let the dough
rest<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:07.000> answer<00:03:07.329> would<00:03:07.450> be<00:03:07.510> yes<00:03:07.810> you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
rest and the answer would be yes you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.900 
rest and the answer would be yes you
always<00:03:08.500> need<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:08.980> let<00:03:09.250> your<00:03:09.430> dough<00:03:09.609> rest

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
always need to let your dough rest

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.759 
always need to let your dough rest
especially<00:03:10.870> if<00:03:11.049> you're<00:03:11.200> adding<00:03:11.500> things<00:03:11.620> like

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
especially if you're adding things like

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.309 
especially if you're adding things like
salt<00:03:12.160> into<00:03:12.609> your<00:03:12.639> dough<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.540> if<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.840> can<00:03:13.989> see

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
salt into your dough so if you can see

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.800 
salt into your dough so if you can see
there<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:15.069> can<00:03:15.130> see<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.459> little<00:03:15.579> grains<00:03:16.569> of

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
there you can see the little grains of

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.690 
there you can see the little grains of
salt<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.350> finally<00:03:17.769> kind<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.100> softened<00:03:18.549> up

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
salt that finally kind of softened up

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.879 
salt that finally kind of softened up
them<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.209> kind<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.630> gotten<00:03:19.870> into<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.290> the

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
them and kind of gotten into the the

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.009 
them and kind of gotten into the the
dough<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.430> now<00:03:22.060> when<00:03:22.239> we<00:03:22.269> need<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.600> one<00:03:22.840> more

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
dough and now when we need it one more

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.949 
dough and now when we need it one more
time<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.739> fully<00:03:24.609> incorporate<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
time it's going to fully incorporate the

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.870 
time it's going to fully incorporate the
flavor<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.440> salt<00:03:26.680> or<00:03:26.980> whatever<00:03:27.280> spices<00:03:27.579> you're

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
flavor of salt or whatever spices you're

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.520 
flavor of salt or whatever spices you're
using<00:03:28.060> within<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.569> dough<00:03:28.720> you're<00:03:29.319> going<00:03:29.470> to

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
using within the dough you're going to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.220 
using within the dough you're going to
need<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:29.859> one<00:03:30.040> more<00:03:30.250> time<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.660> we<00:03:31.870> do<00:03:32.019> have<00:03:32.200> our

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
need it one more time and we do have our

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.300 
need it one more time and we do have our
oil<00:03:32.350> already<00:03:33.299> heating<00:03:34.299> out<00:03:34.420> for<00:03:34.660> deep<00:03:34.840> frying

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
oil already heating out for deep frying

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.740 
oil already heating out for deep frying
are<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.459> going<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.730> make<00:03:36.849> little<00:03:36.970> balls<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:37.630> we

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
are we going to make little balls so we

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.740 
are we going to make little balls so we
can<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.079> start<00:03:38.799> rolling<00:03:39.160> now<00:03:40.090> anytime<00:03:40.420> that

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
can just start rolling now anytime that

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.569 
can just start rolling now anytime that
you're<00:03:40.900> deep-frying<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.859> want<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.280> avoid

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
you're deep-frying you want to avoid

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.660 
you're deep-frying you want to avoid
using<00:03:43.060> dry<00:03:43.389> powders<00:03:44.139> because<00:03:44.859> anytime<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.430> do

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
using dry powders because anytime you do

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.309 
using dry powders because anytime you do
that<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:46.299> moment<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.690> put<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.169> oil

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
that the moment you put it in the oil

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.050 
that the moment you put it in the oil
above<00:03:47.620> on<00:03:47.739> your<00:03:47.889> oil<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.459> course<00:03:48.700> you'll<00:03:48.880> get

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
above on your oil of course you'll get

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.690 
above on your oil of course you'll get
dirty<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.419> lot<00:03:49.630> faster

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
dirty a lot faster

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.770 
dirty a lot faster
and<00:03:50.790> number<00:03:51.030> two<00:03:51.150> it's<00:03:51.300> going<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.569> like<00:03:51.750> to

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
and number two it's going to like to

the baler or the rolling pin and you can
start<00:04:13.019> rolling<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.790> we're<00:04:24.360> going<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.630> just

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
start rolling and we're going to just

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.680 
start rolling and we're going to just
grease<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.860> knife<00:04:26.220> just<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.790> little<00:04:27.060> bit<00:04:27.210> you

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
grease the knife just a little bit you

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.320 
grease the knife just a little bit you
make<00:04:27.900> small<00:04:28.229> diamond<00:04:28.770> shape<00:04:29.070> pieces<00:04:29.729> or<00:04:30.210> you

make small diamond shape pieces or you

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.659 
make small diamond shape pieces or you
can<00:04:30.479> make<00:04:30.630> longer<00:04:30.930> strips<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:32.310> diamond

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
can make longer strips the diamond

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.810 
can make longer strips the diamond
shapes<00:04:32.880> are<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.389> traditional<00:04:33.840> ways<00:04:34.050> but<00:04:34.820> make

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
shapes are the traditional ways but make

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:43.150 
shapes are the traditional ways but make
your<00:04:35.970> own<00:04:36.030> rules

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.040 

we're<00:04:44.160> at<00:04:44.250> about<00:04:44.430> 45<00:04:45.030> degree<00:04:45.389> angle<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.900> can

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
we're at about 45 degree angle you can

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.790 
we're at about 45 degree angle you can
be<00:04:46.139> done

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
be done

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:59.850 
be done
it<00:04:47.700> doesn't<00:04:48.000> make<00:04:48.090> looking<00:04:48.389> longer<00:04:48.630> strips

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.450 

let's<00:05:00.860> try<00:05:01.789> one<00:05:02.139> you<00:05:03.139> can<00:05:03.259> always<00:05:03.500> test<00:05:03.770> oil<00:05:04.069> by

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
let's try one you can always test oil by

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.070 
let's try one you can always test oil by
dropping<00:05:05.180> in<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.360> little<00:05:05.569> piece<00:05:07.659> now<00:05:08.659> there's

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
dropping in a little piece now there's

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.869 
dropping in a little piece now there's
you<00:05:09.710> know<00:05:09.740> different<00:05:10.219> temperatures<00:05:10.639> that<00:05:10.819> you

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:10.879 
you know different temperatures that you

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.839 
you know different temperatures that you
fry<00:05:11.150> at<00:05:11.360> if<00:05:11.800> your<00:05:12.800> item<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:13.520> you're<00:05:13.610> frying

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
fry at if your item that you're frying

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.969 
fry at if your item that you're frying
requires<00:05:14.300> lower<00:05:14.930> heat<00:05:15.259> lower<00:05:15.530> temperature

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
requires lower heat lower temperature

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.279 
requires lower heat lower temperature
then<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.819> should<00:05:17.000> do<00:05:17.090> what<00:05:17.300> we<00:05:17.389> just<00:05:17.419> did<00:05:17.840> sink

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
then it should do what we just did sink

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:19.809 
then it should do what we just did sink
to<00:05:18.379> the<00:05:18.469> bottom<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:18.949> then<00:05:19.069> gradually<00:05:19.490> come<00:05:19.669> up

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
to the bottom and then gradually come up

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.300 
to the bottom and then gradually come up
but<00:05:20.419> sometimes<00:05:21.259> if<00:05:21.620> you<00:05:21.740> want<00:05:21.889> to<00:05:21.949> check<00:05:22.099> the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
but sometimes if you want to check the

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.219 
but sometimes if you want to check the
rightness<00:05:22.699> or<00:05:22.939> doneness<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.419> oil<00:05:23.629> you<00:05:23.900> drop<00:05:24.110> it

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
rightness or doneness of oil you drop it

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.379 
rightness or doneness of oil you drop it
in<00:05:24.349> and<00:05:24.469> it<00:05:24.590> pops<00:05:24.889> up<00:05:25.129> then<00:05:25.520> you<00:05:25.639> know<00:05:25.789> that

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
in and it pops up then you know that

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.820 
in and it pops up then you know that
that's<00:05:26.569> good<00:05:26.779> for<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.349> things<00:05:27.529> that<00:05:27.680> need

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
that's good for the things that need

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.779 
that's good for the things that need
quick<00:05:28.099> frying<00:05:28.370> like<00:05:29.000> we've<00:05:29.360> done<00:05:29.569> yeah<00:05:30.789> all

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
quick frying like we've done yeah all

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:41.619 
quick frying like we've done yeah all
right<00:05:31.969> so<00:05:32.270> we'll<00:05:32.479> be<00:05:32.629> all<00:05:32.719> ready<00:05:40.449> you<00:05:41.449> just

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
right so we'll be all ready you just

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.450 
right so we'll be all ready you just
slightly<00:05:41.900> press<00:05:42.379> them<00:05:42.590> so<00:05:42.770> they<00:05:42.919> dump<00:05:43.159> inside

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
slightly press them so they dump inside

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:52.690 
slightly press them so they dump inside
the<00:05:43.610> oil

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.880 

so<00:05:53.700> when<00:05:53.850> we're<00:05:53.970> frying<00:05:54.180> just<00:05:54.720> keep<00:05:55.650> an<00:05:55.770> eye<00:05:55.860> on

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
so when we're frying just keep an eye on

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.890 
so when we're frying just keep an eye on
them<00:05:56.220> you<00:05:56.370> can<00:05:56.520> turn<00:05:56.730> them<00:05:57.000> they're<00:05:57.570> getting<00:05:57.840> a

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
them you can turn them they're getting a

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:05.200 
them you can turn them they're getting a
little<00:05:58.050> round<00:05:58.710> they're<00:05:59.310> ready<00:05:59.490> to<00:05:59.550> be<00:05:59.700> flipped

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.260 

and<00:06:05.690> when<00:06:05.810> they're<00:06:05.930> nice<00:06:06.080> and<00:06:06.110> golden-brown

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
and when they're nice and golden-brown

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.180 
and when they're nice and golden-brown
let's<00:06:08.270> start<00:06:08.540> pulling<00:06:08.750> them<00:06:08.990> out<00:06:09.110> one<00:06:10.040> of<00:06:10.070> the

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
let's start pulling them out one of the

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.790 
let's start pulling them out one of the
other<00:06:10.220> ways<00:06:10.490> that<00:06:10.550> you<00:06:10.790> can<00:06:10.940> tell<00:06:11.120> your<00:06:11.800> fried

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
other ways that you can tell your fried

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.550 
other ways that you can tell your fried
items<00:06:13.160> are<00:06:13.310> completely<00:06:13.700> fried<00:06:13.910> is<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:15.140> amount

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
items are completely fried is the amount

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.040 
items are completely fried is the amount
of<00:06:15.650> bubbles<00:06:16.070> will<00:06:16.400> decrease<00:06:16.970> over<00:06:17.360> time<00:06:17.390> so

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
of bubbles will decrease over time so

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.150 
of bubbles will decrease over time so
right<00:06:18.230> when<00:06:18.380> you<00:06:18.440> put<00:06:18.620> it<00:06:18.710> in<00:06:18.800> at<00:06:18.980> first

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
right when you put it in at first

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.340 
right when you put it in at first
they're<00:06:19.670> bubbling<00:06:20.360> a<00:06:20.660> lot<00:06:20.870> because<00:06:21.050> there's<00:06:21.290> a

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
they're bubbling a lot because there's a

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.140 
they're bubbling a lot because there's a
lot<00:06:21.470> of<00:06:21.500> moisture<00:06:21.680> and<00:06:22.070> as<00:06:22.460> the<00:06:22.640> moisture<00:06:22.880> gets

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
lot of moisture and as the moisture gets

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.600 
lot of moisture and as the moisture gets
dehydrated<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:24.050> bubbles<00:06:24.350> stop<00:06:24.620> this<00:06:25.490> is

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
dehydrated the bubbles stop this is

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.950 
dehydrated the bubbles stop this is
looking<00:06:25.850> perfect<00:06:31.150> and<00:06:32.150> once<00:06:32.390> they<00:06:32.570> come<00:06:32.720> out

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
looking perfect and once they come out
