00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
Challenger by burns armories this is now

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.130 
Challenger by burns armories this is now
the<00:00:29.770> version<00:00:30.550> 10<00:00:30.910> of<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:31.180> alpha<00:00:31.599> so<00:00:31.869> I<00:00:31.930> imagine

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
the version 10 of the alpha so I imagine

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.740 
the version 10 of the alpha so I imagine
this<00:00:32.500> would<00:00:32.650> be<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.920> last<00:00:33.160> version<00:00:33.580> of<00:00:34.390> the

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
this would be the last version of the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.869 
this would be the last version of the
Alpha<00:00:35.140> now<00:00:35.830> the<00:00:35.890> reason<00:00:36.220> I'm<00:00:36.280> on<00:00:36.340> this<00:00:36.400> screen

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
Alpha now the reason I'm on this screen

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.689 
Alpha now the reason I'm on this screen
is<00:00:37.180> because<00:00:37.600> he<00:00:38.470> did<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.680> couple<00:00:38.830> changes<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.550> be

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
is because he did a couple changes to be

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.340 
is because he did a couple changes to be
stopped<00:00:39.940> on<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.210> other<00:00:40.330> which<00:00:40.960> I'm<00:00:41.140> going<00:00:41.290> to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.140 
there might be
guards<00:02:22.750> not<00:02:23.750> too<00:02:23.900> sure<00:02:24.220> one<00:02:25.220> thing<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.700> need<00:02:25.760> to

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
guards not too sure one thing I need to

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.170 
guards not too sure one thing I need to
say<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:27.220> AGM<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.459> now<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:30.080> have<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> GM

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
say is AGM is now you have to have a GM

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.309 
say is AGM is now you have to have a GM
yes<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.209> requirement<00:02:33.019> now<00:02:33.140> for<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.269> challenges

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
yes a requirement now for the challenges

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.960 
yes a requirement now for the challenges
most<00:02:36.319> of<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.560> big<00:02:36.790> communities<00:02:37.790> are<00:02:37.879> now

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
most of the big communities are now

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.770 
most of the big communities are now
using<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.330> GM<00:02:38.630> but<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.620> GM<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.010> needed<00:02:40.780> because

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
using a GM but a GM is needed because

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.350 
using a GM but a GM is needed because
the<00:02:42.620> normal<00:02:42.980> range<00:02:43.220> incan<00:02:43.580> armor<00:02:43.910> doesn't

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
the normal range incan armor doesn't

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.940 
the normal range incan armor doesn't
really<00:02:44.510> work<00:02:44.780> with<00:02:45.050> these<00:02:45.230> tanks

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
really work with these tanks

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.759 
really work with these tanks
however<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.550> ranging<00:02:47.030> in<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.360> GM<00:02:47.660> does<00:02:47.930> so

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
however the ranging in a GM does so

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.420 
however the ranging in a GM does so
obviously<00:02:49.010> that's<00:02:49.160> now<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:50.019> dependency<00:02:51.430> right

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
obviously that's now a dependency right

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.030 
obviously that's now a dependency right
so<00:02:52.760> I'm<00:02:53.000> gonna<00:02:53.180> jump<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.440> driver's<00:02:54.739> seat

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
so I'm gonna jump in the driver's seat

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.059 
so I'm gonna jump in the driver's seat
actually<00:02:55.910> before<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.239> do<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.590> as<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.739> can<00:02:57.890> see

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
actually before I do that as you can see

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.050 
actually before I do that as you can see
the<00:02:58.340> textures<00:02:58.730> are<00:02:58.940> more<00:02:59.209> higher-quality<00:02:59.599> now

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
the textures are more higher-quality now

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.339 
the textures are more higher-quality now
which<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.209> really<00:03:02.630> really<00:03:02.750> nice

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
which is really really nice

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.140 
which is really really nice
and<00:03:03.470> these<00:03:03.590> are<00:03:03.739> just<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.700> little<00:03:04.880> bits<00:03:05.030> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
and these are just a little bits and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.780 
and these are just a little bits and
bobs<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:06.019> I'm<00:03:06.079> gonna<00:03:06.170> jump<00:03:06.380> into<00:03:06.680> driver<00:03:06.890> now

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.690 

inside<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.060> textures<00:03:11.480> haven't<00:03:11.810> changed<00:03:12.170> much

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
inside the textures haven't changed much

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.370 
inside the textures haven't changed much
here<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.970> back<00:03:14.150> but<00:03:14.450> these<00:03:14.660> are<00:03:15.019> now<00:03:15.170> more

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
here in the back but these are now more

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.880 
here in the back but these are now more
clear<00:03:16.150> as<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.269> can<00:03:17.420> see<00:03:17.660> now<00:03:18.170> here<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.860> have

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
clear as you can see now here we have

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.000 
clear as you can see now here we have
set<00:03:19.370> callsign<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.299> Scott's<00:03:21.049> wagon<00:03:21.440> UK<00:03:21.709> flag

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
set callsign and Scott's wagon UK flag

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.650 
set callsign and Scott's wagon UK flag
so<00:03:22.670> now<00:03:22.819> I'm<00:03:22.940> actually<00:03:23.030> gonna<00:03:23.239> go<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.480> the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
so now I'm actually gonna go to the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.129 
so now I'm actually gonna go to the
outside<00:03:24.470> now<00:03:25.180> with<00:03:26.180> army<00:03:26.510> obviously<00:03:26.959> thought

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
outside now with army obviously thought

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.680 
outside now with army obviously thought
a<00:03:27.380> lot<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.680> people<00:03:28.190> will<00:03:28.370> just<00:03:28.519> make<00:03:28.760> if<00:03:29.090> it's<00:03:29.359> a

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
a lot of people will just make if it's a

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.270 
a lot of people will just make if it's a
course<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.410> tank<00:03:30.650> would<00:03:30.950> people<00:03:31.130> want

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
course and the tank would people want

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.190 
course and the tank would people want
want<00:03:31.579> for<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.850> whole<00:03:32.000> thing<00:03:32.239> burns<00:03:33.019> has

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
want for the whole thing burns has

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.660 
want for the whole thing burns has
really<00:03:33.410> thought<00:03:33.650> about<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.489> thought

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
really thought about this and thought

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.309 
really thought about this and thought
well<00:03:34.940> every<00:03:35.209> tank<00:03:35.450> doesn't<00:03:35.810> want<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.079> be<00:03:36.170> one

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
well every tank doesn't want to be one

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.229 
well every tank doesn't want to be one
one<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.829> obviously<00:03:37.340> people<00:03:37.639> at<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:37.970> look<00:03:38.150> at

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
one and obviously people at a look at

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.720 
one and obviously people at a look at
the<00:03:38.359> tanks<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.470> if<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.799> set<00:03:40.069> this<00:03:40.130> cosine<00:03:40.549> two

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
the tanks so if I set this cosine two

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.319 
the tanks so if I set this cosine two
one<00:03:40.880> two

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
one two

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.930 
one two
if<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.660> just<00:03:41.810> look<00:03:41.989> at<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.230> one<00:03:42.410> one<00:03:42.590> sign<00:03:42.940> and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
if you just look at the one one sign and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.569 
if you just look at the one one sign and
changed<00:03:44.389> to<00:03:44.450> one<00:03:44.720> two<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.530> now<00:03:45.859> if<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:46.040> set<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.430> 1

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
changed to one two and now if I set to 1

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.990 
changed to one two and now if I set to 1
3<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.690> 1/4<00:03:48.400> because<00:03:49.400> obviously<00:03:49.549> there's<00:03:49.819> four

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
3 and 1/4 because obviously there's four

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.020 
3 and 1/4 because obviously there's four
versions<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.480> tanks<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.760> is

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
versions of the tanks so the that is

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.539 
versions of the tanks so the that is
great<00:03:53.299> that's<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.780> great<00:03:54.049> feature<00:03:54.560> really

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
great that's a great feature really

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.849 
great that's a great feature really
great<00:03:55.730> feature<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.410> can<00:03:57.769> actually

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
great feature so you can actually

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.920 
great feature so you can actually
aesthetically<00:03:58.790> look<00:03:59.030> at<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.329> 1/4<00:03:59.720> tank

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
aesthetically look at the 1/4 tank

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.410 
aesthetically look at the 1/4 tank
rather<00:04:00.680> than<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.889> call<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.190> one<00:04:01.310> for<00:04:01.549> all<00:04:02.150> so

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
rather than to call it one for all so

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.839 
rather than to call it one for all so
obviously<00:04:02.720> these<00:04:02.900> are<00:04:03.139> British<00:04:03.560> made<00:04:03.799> so<00:04:04.670> we

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
obviously these are British made so we

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.270 
obviously these are British made so we
have<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.389> Scots<00:04:05.959> flag<00:04:06.230> there<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.859> exchange

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
have a Scots flag there and the exchange

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.080 
have a Scots flag there and the exchange
up<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.549> UK<00:04:07.940> flag<00:04:08.239> also<00:04:09.010> which<00:04:10.010> is<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:10.459> great

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
up to UK flag also which is a great

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.690 
up to UK flag also which is a great
little<00:04:11.450> feature<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:13.190> we've<00:04:13.310> got<00:04:13.400> drivers

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
little feature so we've got drivers

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.409 
little feature so we've got drivers
monitors<00:04:14.180> night<00:04:14.359> vision<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:14.959> color<00:04:15.200> so<00:04:15.950> that

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
monitors night vision and color so that

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.339 
monitors night vision and color so that
that'll<00:04:17.419> go<00:04:17.539> night<00:04:17.780> vision

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
that'll go night vision

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.750 
that'll go night vision
well<00:04:19.010> it's<00:04:19.220> night<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.700> then<00:04:19.940> color<00:04:21.550> we<00:04:22.550> have

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
well it's night and then color we have

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.580 
well it's night and then color we have
the<00:04:23.060> commander<00:04:23.570> sea<00:04:23.780> which<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.110> pretty<00:04:24.500> much

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
the commander sea which is pretty much

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.050 
the commander sea which is pretty much
the<00:04:24.710> same<00:04:25.039> with<00:04:25.370> other<00:04:25.490> maps<00:04:25.729> in<00:04:25.849> there<00:04:25.970> as

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
the same with other maps in there as

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.540 
the same with other maps in there as
usual<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:27.229> much<00:04:27.410> has<00:04:27.560> changed<00:04:28.510> back<00:04:29.510> really

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
usual so much has changed back really

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.620 
usual so much has changed back really
he's<00:04:31.550> alter<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.880> sound<00:04:32.030> levels<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:32.570> the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
he's alter the sound levels and the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.810 
he's alter the sound levels and the
tanks<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.260> they're<00:04:33.409> not<00:04:33.500> as<00:04:33.650> loud<00:04:33.860> or<00:04:34.280> not<00:04:34.729> as

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
tanks so they're not as loud or not as

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.050 
tanks so they're not as loud or not as
quiet<00:04:35.120> as<00:04:35.300> last<00:04:35.510> time

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
quiet as last time

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.970 
quiet as last time
and<00:04:38.060> that's<00:04:38.240> about<00:04:38.330> it<00:04:38.480> really<00:04:38.630> new<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.800> him

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
and that's about it really new to him

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.190 
and that's about it really new to him
rather<00:04:40.340> than<00:04:40.490> them<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:41.840> know<00:04:41.960> there's

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
rather than them you know there's

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.350 
rather than them you know there's
nothing<00:04:42.320> new<00:04:42.650> with<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:43.180> sounds<00:04:44.180> of<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
nothing new with the sounds of the

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.690 
nothing new with the sounds of the
weapons<00:04:44.780> or<00:04:45.020> anything<00:04:45.380> like<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.680> it's<00:04:46.610> just

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
weapons or anything like that it's just

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.330 
weapons or anything like that it's just
mainly<00:04:47.000> aesthetic<00:04:47.900> stuff<00:04:48.230> and<00:04:48.560> removing

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
mainly aesthetic stuff and removing

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.790 
mainly aesthetic stuff and removing
stuff<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.880> isn't<00:04:50.510> working<00:04:50.810> right<00:04:51.080> now<00:04:51.440> and

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
stuff that isn't working right now and

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.320 
stuff that isn't working right now and
obviously<00:04:52.840> making<00:04:53.840> it<00:04:54.250> generally<00:04:55.250> better<00:04:55.490> so

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
obviously making it generally better so

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.850 
obviously making it generally better so
if<00:04:56.450> we<00:04:56.570> can<00:04:56.720> go<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.080> test<00:04:57.230> a<00:04:57.350> smoke<00:04:57.650> screen

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
if we can go and test a smoke screen

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.110 
if we can go and test a smoke screen
here<00:04:58.900> so<00:04:59.900> if<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.020> just<00:05:00.139> jump<00:05:00.230> in<00:05:00.650> as<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.490> commander

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
here so if I just jump in as a commander

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.659 
here so if I just jump in as a commander
if<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:03.260> will<00:05:03.410> let<00:05:03.590> me<00:05:03.620> jump<00:05:03.889> in<00:05:04.040> as<00:05:04.160> a<00:05:04.190> commander

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
if it will let me jump in as a commander

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.890 
if it will let me jump in as a commander
you<00:05:04.850> know<00:05:05.470> can<00:05:06.470> we<00:05:06.500> smoke<00:05:06.889> screen<00:05:07.720> he's<00:05:08.720> got<00:05:08.870> a

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
you know can we smoke screen he's got a

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.159 
you know can we smoke screen he's got a
smoke<00:05:09.110> screen<00:05:09.290> there<00:05:10.630> which<00:05:11.630> I<00:05:11.810> don't<00:05:11.870> think

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
smoke screen there which I don't think

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.600 
smoke screen there which I don't think
that's<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.950> part<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.250> it<00:05:13.430> now

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
that's a part of it now

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.950 
that's a part of it now
read<00:05:14.090> that<00:05:14.210> if<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.360> saw<00:05:14.479> one<00:05:14.600> of<00:05:14.690> his<00:05:14.750> videos

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
read that if you saw one of his videos

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.629 
read that if you saw one of his videos
but<00:05:15.470> there's<00:05:15.620> actually<00:05:15.680> smoke<00:05:16.040> screen<00:05:16.400> coming

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
but there's actually smoke screen coming

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.860 
but there's actually smoke screen coming
out<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.790> back<00:05:16.970> I'm<00:05:17.180> not<00:05:17.360> sure<00:05:17.570> if<00:05:17.690> you<00:05:17.750> had<00:05:17.840> a

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
out the back I'm not sure if you had a

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.440 
out the back I'm not sure if you had a
bat<00:05:18.110> yet<00:05:18.320> also<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.639> feature<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:20.030> commander

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
bat yet also the feature the commander

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.940 
bat yet also the feature the commander
is<00:05:20.600> you<00:05:21.110> okay<00:05:21.680> smoke<00:05:22.010> screen<00:05:22.160> on<00:05:22.490> there<00:05:23.180> we<00:05:23.270> go

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
is you okay smoke screen on there we go

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.159 
is you okay smoke screen on there we go
so<00:05:24.950> as<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.100> can<00:05:25.220> see<00:05:25.450> the<00:05:26.450> smoke<00:05:26.720> screens<00:05:27.050> were

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
so as you can see the smoke screens were

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.900 
so as you can see the smoke screens were
deployed<00:05:27.500> out<00:05:27.770> of<00:05:27.860> these<00:05:27.950> little<00:05:28.070> hatches<00:05:28.639> now

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
deployed out of these little hatches now

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.270 
deployed out of these little hatches now
what<00:05:29.270> that<00:05:29.300> enables<00:05:30.200> if<00:05:30.470> I<00:05:30.590> jump<00:05:30.919> into<00:05:31.130> the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
what that enables if I jump into the

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.719 
what that enables if I jump into the
drivers<00:05:31.760> see<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:33.410> that<00:05:33.770> enables<00:05:34.370> you<00:05:34.700> to

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
drivers see that that enables you to

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.770 
drivers see that that enables you to
make<00:05:35.720> your<00:05:35.960> own<00:05:36.080> smoke<00:05:36.410> screen<00:05:37.600> rather<00:05:38.600> than

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
make your own smoke screen rather than

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.320 
make your own smoke screen rather than
just<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.050> thing<00:05:39.290> to<00:05:39.560> play<00:05:39.740> another<00:05:39.979> back<00:05:40.330> we

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
just a thing to play another back we

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.200 
just a thing to play another back we
have<00:05:41.450> a<00:05:41.479> trail<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:42.169> smoke<00:05:42.880> so<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:43.970> could<00:05:44.090> go

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
have a trail of smoke so you could go

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.940 
have a trail of smoke so you could go
around<00:05:44.300> his<00:05:44.510> circles<00:05:44.990> maybe<00:05:45.169> like<00:05:45.380> this<00:05:45.620> and

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
around his circles maybe like this and

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.770 
around his circles maybe like this and
just<00:05:45.979> get<00:05:46.520> put<00:05:46.880> your<00:05:47.000> own<00:05:47.060> smoke<00:05:47.270> screen<00:05:47.630> out

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
just get put your own smoke screen out

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.500 
just get put your own smoke screen out
rather<00:05:48.590> than<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:48.860> two<00:05:49.039> things<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:50.270> things

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
rather than the two things the things

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.409 
rather than the two things the things
firing<00:05:50.930> out<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.140> side<00:05:52.030> which<00:05:53.030> is<00:05:53.150> actually<00:05:53.390> a

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
firing out the side which is actually a

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.820 
firing out the side which is actually a
really<00:05:53.660> nice<00:05:53.930> feature<00:05:54.169> which<00:05:54.470> I've<00:05:54.650> never

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
really nice feature which I've never

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.740 
really nice feature which I've never
seen<00:05:54.979> before<00:05:55.310> and<00:05:55.880> that<00:05:56.180> can<00:05:56.330> be<00:05:56.390> constantly

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
seen before and that can be constantly

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.930 
seen before and that can be constantly
are<00:05:57.080> not<00:05:57.289> so<00:05:57.410> you<00:05:57.500> turn<00:05:57.650> it<00:05:57.830> off<00:05:57.979> and<00:05:58.490> that's

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
are not so you turn it off and that's

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.390 
are not so you turn it off and that's
off<00:05:59.210> and<00:05:59.539> then<00:06:00.140> also<00:06:00.440> if<00:06:00.740> we<00:06:00.830> jump<00:06:01.039> back<00:06:01.070> into

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
off and then also if we jump back into

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.790 
off and then also if we jump back into
the<00:06:01.490> commander's<00:06:01.940> seat<00:06:02.210> we're<00:06:02.960> able<00:06:03.140> to<00:06:03.410> open

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
the commander's seat we're able to open

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.000 
the commander's seat we're able to open
all<00:06:04.010> hatches<00:06:05.229> and<00:06:06.229> obviously<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:06.680> can<00:06:06.800> see<00:06:06.889> in

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
all hatches and obviously you can see in

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.420 
all hatches and obviously you can see in
the<00:06:07.100> inside<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.669> interior<00:06:08.030> there<00:06:09.430> okay

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
the inside the interior there okay

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.360 
the inside the interior there okay
coughs<00:06:10.610> just<00:06:10.820> kind<00:06:10.940> of<00:06:10.970> jump<00:06:11.660> out<00:06:11.950> also<00:06:12.950> there

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
coughs just kind of jump out also there

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.250 
coughs just kind of jump out also there
was<00:06:13.490> a<00:06:13.520> problem<00:06:13.850> before<00:06:14.210> with<00:06:15.110> AI<00:06:15.380> not<00:06:17.110> kind<00:06:18.110> of

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
was a problem before with AI not kind of

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.719 
was a problem before with AI not kind of
doing<00:06:18.590> stuff<00:06:18.740> correctly<00:06:19.160> in<00:06:19.220> the<00:06:19.310> tank<00:06:19.550> so

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
doing stuff correctly in the tank so
