change of possession but as you can see
the<00:02:35.170> defensive<00:02:36.040> back<00:02:36.250> here<00:02:36.580> he<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:38.070> watching

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
the defensive back here he is watching

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.270 
the defensive back here he is watching
the<00:02:40.270> quarterback<00:02:40.840> pretty<00:02:41.770> much<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.160> entire

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
the quarterback pretty much the entire

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.380 
the quarterback pretty much the entire
time<00:02:44.160> realistic<00:02:45.160> movements<00:02:45.730> by<00:02:45.880> him<00:02:46.150> there

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
time realistic movements by him there

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.460 
time realistic movements by him there
wasn't<00:02:46.780> too<00:02:46.959> much<00:02:48.330> sliding<00:02:49.330> by<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.810> defensive

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
wasn't too much sliding by the defensive

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.930 
wasn't too much sliding by the defensive
bags<00:02:50.709> as<00:02:51.010> much<00:02:51.250> as<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.670> assumed<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.930> would<00:02:53.500> be

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
bags as much as I assumed it would be

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.690 
bags as much as I assumed it would be
but<00:02:54.940> again<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:56.320> know<00:02:56.440> adjusting<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.220> sliders

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
but again you know adjusting the sliders

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.690 
but again you know adjusting the sliders
you<00:02:58.360> can<00:02:58.540> get<00:02:58.690> different<00:02:58.870> results<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.830> I<00:03:00.070> like

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
you can get different results so I like

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.900 
you can get different results so I like
how<00:03:00.850> he's<00:03:01.030> watching<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:02.640> quarterback<00:03:03.640> and

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
how he's watching the quarterback and

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.990 
how he's watching the quarterback and
playing<00:03:04.450> his<00:03:04.690> own<00:03:05.100> properly<00:03:06.100> he<00:03:06.580> looks<00:03:06.790> at<00:03:06.910> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
playing his own properly he looks at the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.840 
playing his own properly he looks at the
wide<00:03:07.180> receiver<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> left<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.130> then<00:03:09.730> he's

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
wide receiver to the left and then he's

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.850 
wide receiver to the left and then he's
going<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.090> look<00:03:10.269> at<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.480> football<00:03:10.690> make<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
going to look at the football make the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.100 
going to look at the football make the
interception<00:03:12.360> again<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.420> did<00:03:13.600> not<00:03:13.720> change<00:03:13.959> it

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
interception again I did not change it

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.810 
interception again I did not change it
to<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.320> wide<00:03:14.500> receiver<00:03:14.920> because<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.280> wanted<00:03:15.670> to

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
to the wide receiver because I wanted to

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.360 
to the wide receiver because I wanted to
see<00:03:16.120> how<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.170> computer<00:03:17.769> would<00:03:17.950> let<00:03:18.190> this

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
see how the computer would let this

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.660
