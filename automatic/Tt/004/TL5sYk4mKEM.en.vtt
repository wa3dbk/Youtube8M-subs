00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.499 
all these sixes
no<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.989> didn't<00:01:04.440> hack<00:01:04.759> just<00:01:05.759> to<00:01:05.880> start<00:01:06.149> that<00:01:06.330> off

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.700 
no I didn't hack just to start that off
so<00:01:07.410> I<00:01:07.440> decided<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.009> reset<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> I've<00:01:10.170> prestiged

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and now I have three points some random

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.870 
and now I have three points some random
number<00:01:13.830> e<00:01:14.630> plus<00:01:15.630> 44<00:01:16.350> which<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.920> probably<00:01:17.369> three

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
number e plus 44 which is probably three

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820 
number e plus 44 which is probably three
point<00:01:18.210> six<00:01:18.479> five<00:01:18.810> I'm<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.289> going<00:01:19.410> to<00:01:19.440> guess

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
point six five I'm just going to guess

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550 
point six five I'm just going to guess
three<00:01:20.550> point<00:01:20.789> six<00:01:20.940> five<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:21.990> forty<00:01:22.320> four

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
three point six five and then forty four

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.920 
three point six five and then forty four
zero<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.009> behind<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:26.180> that's<00:01:27.180> seven<00:01:27.660> point

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
zero is behind it that's seven point

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.410 
zero is behind it that's seven point
three<00:01:27.990> plus<00:01:28.440> 40<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.920> 40<00:01:29.369> four<00:01:29.610> zeroes<00:01:30.000> behind

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
three plus 40 is 40 four zeroes behind

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
three plus 40 is 40 four zeroes behind
that<00:01:31.280> one<00:01:32.280> cursor<00:01:32.819> is<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.149> need<00:01:33.599> I<00:01:37.310> was

golden cookies would spawn ever and I
had<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.109> fully<00:03:11.590> upgraded<00:03:12.219> so<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:14.310> that's<00:03:15.310> 125

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
had it fully upgraded so and that's 125

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.720 
had it fully upgraded so and that's 125
thousand<00:03:16.420> cookies<00:03:16.889> that's<00:03:17.889> a<00:03:18.069> month<00:03:18.400> of
