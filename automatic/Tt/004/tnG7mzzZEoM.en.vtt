Brennan's 6-2 as well he's weighing in

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.889 
Brennan's 6-2 as well he's weighing in
at<00:01:54.750> 219<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> our<00:01:56.909> our<00:01:57.240> calorie<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
at 219 so our our calorie and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:07.160 
at 219 so our our calorie and
macronutrient<00:02:05.090> age<00:02:06.090> weight<00:02:06.719> height<00:02:06.750> and

macronutrient age weight height and
activity<00:02:07.890> level<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:09.239> going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.660> give

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
activity level and it's going to give

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.790 
activity level and it's going to give
you<00:02:10.289> yeah<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.459> was<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.739> reprimand

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you yeah it was going to reprimand

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.340 
you yeah it was going to reprimand
Aras<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.130> basal<00:02:14.850> metabolic<00:02:15.060> rate<00:02:15.900> it's

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
Aras is basal metabolic rate it's

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.740 
Aras is basal metabolic rate it's
basically<00:02:16.740> or<00:02:16.950> its<00:02:17.340> resting<00:02:18.090> metabolic<00:02:18.390> rate

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
basically or its resting metabolic rate

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.270 
basically or its resting metabolic rate
it<00:02:18.960> kind<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.200> falls<00:02:19.650> along<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.070> same

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
it kind of falls along the same

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.150 
it kind of falls along the same
guidelines<00:02:21.150> where<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.590> your<00:02:22.860> body

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
guidelines where it's what your body

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.370 
guidelines where it's what your body
burns<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:24.180> many<00:02:24.390> calories<00:02:24.630> your<00:02:24.930> body<00:02:24.990> burns

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
burns as many calories your body burns

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.410 
burns as many calories your body burns
at<00:02:25.620> rest<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.160> if<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.340> laid<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.730> bed<00:02:26.910> all<00:02:27.060> day<00:02:27.090> is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
at rest so if you laid in bed all day is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.230 
at rest so if you laid in bed all day is
what<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:27.930> body<00:02:28.110> would<00:02:28.470> use<00:02:28.800> as<00:02:29.130> far<00:02:29.850> as<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
what your body would use as far as the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.020 
what your body would use as far as the
energy<00:02:30.630> needs<00:02:30.840> caloric<00:02:31.470> needs<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.790> keep

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
energy needs caloric needs to just keep

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.880 
energy needs caloric needs to just keep
your<00:02:33.180> body<00:02:33.390> running<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.080> that's<00:02:34.530> kind<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
your body running so that's kind of the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.130 
your body running so that's kind of the
baseline<00:02:35.250> what<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.640> need<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.970> start<00:02:36.240> any<00:02:36.870> kind

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
baseline what you need to start any kind

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.100 
baseline what you need to start any kind
of<00:02:37.230> real<00:02:37.770> eating<00:02:38.130> program<00:02:38.510> exactly<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.930> we've

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
of real eating program exactly so we've

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.960 
of real eating program exactly so we've
included<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> description<00:02:41.370> so

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
included that in the description so

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.950 
included that in the description so
that'll<00:02:42.240> give<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.540> pretty<00:02:42.720> good

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
that'll give you a pretty good

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.350 
that'll give you a pretty good
indication<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.830> where<00:02:44.280> you're<00:02:44.430> at<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.640> we

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
indication of where you're at and we

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.130 
indication of where you're at and we
also<00:02:45.630> included<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.620> macro<00:02:47.720> calculator<00:02:48.720> as<00:02:48.900> well

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
also included a macro calculator as well

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.200 
also included a macro calculator as well
now<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:49.920> will<00:02:50.220> do<00:02:50.370> you'll<00:02:50.580> enter<00:02:50.820> those

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
now what that will do you'll enter those

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.960 
now what that will do you'll enter those
calories<00:02:51.930> you've<00:02:52.410> gotten<00:02:52.890> off<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.490> BMR

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
calories you've gotten off of the BMR

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.150 
calories you've gotten off of the BMR
calculator<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.990> then<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.710> can<00:02:55.890> kind<00:02:56.100> of

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
calculator and then you can kind of

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.890 
calculator and then you can kind of
break<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.580> down<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.910> your<00:02:57.030> specific<00:02:57.660> needs

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
break it down in your specific needs

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.500 
break it down in your specific needs
like<00:02:58.140> if<00:02:58.320> you're<00:02:58.470> cutting<00:02:58.800> or<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.760> know<00:02:59.880> what

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
like if you're cutting or you know what

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.630 
like if you're cutting or you know what
have<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.960> like<00:03:01.260> what<00:03:01.500> we're<00:03:01.770> going<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.430> be

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
have you like what we're going to be

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.550 
have you like what we're going to be
doing<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.690> will<00:03:03.810> kind<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.110> break<00:03:04.290> down

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
doing and it will kind of break down

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.590 
doing and it will kind of break down
those<00:03:04.830> macros<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.460> give<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.970> good<00:03:06.150> idea<00:03:06.180> of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
those macros to give you a good idea of

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.650 
those macros to give you a good idea of
what<00:03:06.960> percentage<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.560> should<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:07.980> having<00:03:08.250> our

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
what percentage you should be having our

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.810 
what percentage you should be having our
percentage<00:03:09.680> basically<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.770> breaking<00:03:11.250> down<00:03:11.280> to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
percentage basically is breaking down to

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.840 
percentage basically is breaking down to
something<00:03:12.030> very<00:03:12.180> similar<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.850> 50%

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
something very similar to this 50%

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.390 
something very similar to this 50%
protein<00:03:16.250> 30%<00:03:17.250> carbs<00:03:18.050> 20%<00:03:19.050> fat<00:03:19.320> now<00:03:20.010> that's

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
protein 30% carbs 20% fat now that's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.949 
protein 30% carbs 20% fat now that's
going<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.640> fluctuate<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:21.180> little<00:03:21.570> bit

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
going to fluctuate a little bit

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.110 
going to fluctuate a little bit
mostly<00:03:22.440> carbs<00:03:22.950> because<00:03:23.160> we<00:03:23.430> usually<00:03:23.760> keep<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
mostly carbs because we usually keep the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.610 
mostly carbs because we usually keep the
carbs<00:03:24.390> pretty<00:03:24.630> moderate<00:03:25.020> during<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.440> week

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
carbs pretty moderate during the week

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.290 
carbs pretty moderate during the week
and<00:03:25.860> we<00:03:25.920> pump<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.340> up<00:03:26.489> quite<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.880> bit<00:03:27.060> on<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
and we pump it up quite a bit on the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.199 
and we pump it up quite a bit on the
weekend<00:03:27.750> but<00:03:28.620> more<00:03:29.190> or<00:03:29.370> less<00:03:29.430> that's<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
weekend but more or less that's the

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.120 
weekend but more or less that's the
percentage<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:30.900> going<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.140> stay<00:03:31.410> at<00:03:31.620> but

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
percentage it's going to stay at but

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.490 
percentage it's going to stay at but
