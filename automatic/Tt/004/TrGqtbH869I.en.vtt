00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
I've got three great reasons on why you

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.210 
I've got three great reasons on why you
should<00:00:16.930> convince<00:00:17.200> your<00:00:17.560> spouse<00:00:17.950> or

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
should convince your spouse or

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
there and get your instrument rated the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.340 
there and get your instrument rated the

on insurance this is especially
important<00:00:33.940> if<00:00:33.999> you<00:00:34.120> decide<00:00:34.569> you<00:00:34.809> want<00:00:35.019> to

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:35.109 
important if you decide you want to

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.829 
important if you decide you want to
become<00:00:35.979> an<00:00:36.100> aircraft<00:00:36.640> owner<00:00:36.940> one<00:00:37.239> day<00:00:37.479> and<00:00:37.749> as

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
become an aircraft owner one day and as

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.419 
become an aircraft owner one day and as
a<00:00:37.899> matter<00:00:38.050> of<00:00:38.170> fact<00:00:38.409> there<00:00:38.829> may<00:00:38.979> be<00:00:39.010> certain

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
a matter of fact there may be certain

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.369 
a matter of fact there may be certain
aircraft<00:00:39.579> you<00:00:39.999> have<00:00:40.179> your<00:00:40.329> eyeballs<00:00:40.719> on<00:00:40.989> that

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
aircraft you have your eyeballs on that

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.849 
aircraft you have your eyeballs on that
you<00:00:41.559> couldn't<00:00:41.979> even<00:00:42.100> get<00:00:42.519> insured<00:00:43.089> for

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
you couldn't even get insured for

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.529 
you couldn't even get insured for
without<00:00:44.859> an<00:00:45.190> instrument<00:00:45.879> rating

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
without an instrument rating

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.479 
without an instrument rating
so<00:00:46.989> think<00:00:47.679> about<00:00:47.739> getting<00:00:48.069> the<00:00:48.129> instrument

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
so think about getting the instrument

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.099 
so think about getting the instrument
rating<00:00:48.699> just<00:00:48.729> to<00:00:49.149> save<00:00:49.420> some<00:00:49.690> money<00:00:49.870> on

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
rating just to save some money on

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.469 
rating just to save some money on
insurance<00:00:50.489> costs<00:00:51.489> if<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.999> ever<00:00:52.209> plan<00:00:52.420> on

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
insurance costs if you ever plan on

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.750 
insurance costs if you ever plan on
being<00:00:52.719> an<00:00:52.839> aircraft<00:00:53.289> owner<00:00:53.559> one<00:00:53.889> day<00:00:54.100> the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
being an aircraft owner one day the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.029 
being an aircraft owner one day the
other<00:00:54.879> is<00:00:55.120> increased<00:00:55.749> safety<00:00:56.289> it<00:00:56.530> makes<00:00:56.769> sense

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
other is increased safety it makes sense

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.829 
other is increased safety it makes sense
we<00:00:57.339> are<00:00:57.429> still<00:00:57.699> flight<00:00:58.059> trained<00:00:58.389> we're

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
we are still flight trained we're

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.169 
we are still flight trained we're
learning<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.440> new<00:00:59.709> task<00:01:00.100> we<00:01:00.819> are<00:01:00.850> thus

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
learning a new task we are thus

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.809 
learning a new task we are thus
increasing<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.019> safety<00:01:02.289> of<00:01:02.739> ourselves<00:01:03.280> as

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
increasing the safety of ourselves as

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.090 
increasing the safety of ourselves as
pilot<00:01:04.270> as<00:01:04.960> pilots<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.680> increase<00:01:05.920> in<00:01:06.040> the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
pilot as pilots and increase in the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.700 
pilot as pilots and increase in the
safety<00:01:06.550> of<00:01:06.670> our<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.810> our<00:01:07.900> passengers<00:01:08.470> as<00:01:08.680> they

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
safety of our for our passengers as they

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.950 
safety of our for our passengers as they
travel<00:01:09.280> with<00:01:09.400> us<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.560> last<00:01:11.770> one<00:01:12.070> here<00:01:12.400> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
travel with us and the last one here is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.410 
travel with us and the last one here is
more<00:01:13.960> flying<00:01:14.620> days<00:01:15.340> now<00:01:15.790> this<00:01:15.970> makes<00:01:16.240> sense

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
more flying days now this makes sense

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.870 
more flying days now this makes sense
but<00:01:16.960> but<00:01:17.500> picture<00:01:18.040> it<00:01:18.100> like<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.490> I'm<00:01:18.730> not

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
but but picture it like this I'm not

saying we're going out and we're

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.960 
saying we're going out and we're
plugging<00:01:20.290> through<00:01:20.680> some<00:01:20.980> you<00:01:21.460> know<00:01:21.490> crazy

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
plugging through some you know crazy

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.880 
plugging through some you know crazy
weather<00:01:22.360> we're<00:01:22.660> still<00:01:22.930> fair<00:01:23.200> weather<00:01:23.440> fliers

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
weather we're still fair weather fliers

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.640 
weather we're still fair weather fliers
but<00:01:24.810> imagine<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:25.930> you<00:01:26.200> get<00:01:26.380> out<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.620> the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
but imagine this you get out to the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.050 
but imagine this you get out to the
airport<00:01:26.860> you're<00:01:27.310> going<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.670> fly<00:01:28.030> for

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
airport you're going to fly for

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.910 
airport you're going to fly for
breakfast<00:01:28.690> or<00:01:28.840> visit<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.140> friend<00:01:29.320> somewhere

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
breakfast or visit a friend somewhere

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.730 
breakfast or visit a friend somewhere
and<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.760> airport<00:01:31.150> is<00:01:31.210> just<00:01:31.270> socked<00:01:31.780> in<00:01:32.050> IFR

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
and the airport is just socked in IFR

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.680 
and the airport is just socked in IFR
because<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.190> some<00:01:33.400> low-level<00:01:33.850> fog<00:01:34.300> when<00:01:34.570> you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
because of some low-level fog when you

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.020 
because of some low-level fog when you
and<00:01:34.840> I<00:01:34.930> both<00:01:35.170> know<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:35.740> morning<00:01:36.490> fog<00:01:36.760> is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030

and I both know that morning fog is
gonna<00:01:37.210> burn<00:01:37.450> off<00:01:37.660> as<00:01:37.870> soon<00:01:38.110> as<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.260> Sun<00:01:38.560> comes

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
gonna burn off as soon as that Sun comes

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.220 
gonna burn off as soon as that Sun comes
up<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.160> little<00:01:39.280> bit<00:01:39.490> more<00:01:39.670> however<00:01:40.360> as<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.720> VFR

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
up a little bit more however as a VFR

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.740 
up a little bit more however as a VFR
pilot<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.680> couldn't<00:01:41.980> go<00:01:42.100> flying<00:01:42.430> in<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.750> so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
pilot you couldn't go flying in that so

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.600 
pilot you couldn't go flying in that so
you<00:01:44.080> could<00:01:44.380> file<00:01:44.680> your<00:01:44.890> IFR<00:01:45.310> flight<00:01:45.580> plan

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.550 
you could file your IFR flight plan
depart<00:01:46.390> through<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:46.720> fog<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.200> by<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.320> time

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
you get to your destination it's

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.700
