00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.770
 and hello that such a youtube community I 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.080
 I am Catalan 343 as always with halo 4 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.790
 a player managed to extract certain things 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.460
 secrets of the registration codes of 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.200
 halo 4 a note these things could be 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.940
 only options that were left 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.650
 back but the funny thing is that they are very 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.570
 innovative and are in the game 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.009
 technically also three four 3 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.689
 industries said a long time ago that 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.460
 they managed to finish all the modes of 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.560
 game or options but that really 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.359
 they thought of including them in the future in a 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.890
 good massive update the list of 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.960
 custom options that removed 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.000
 at least for the killer mode were the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.980
 following observing team that is 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.630
 basically a viewer mode gives you the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.460
 ability to observe players 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.500
 a game instead of playing yourself 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.180
 auto equipment balance when a 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 player abandons the computer as of 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.540
 the equipment so they have the same 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.880
 number of players player glow 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.890
 something very simple they give it certain brightness 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.900
 color a player to identify him 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.360
 options given to a certain amount of 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.220
 players options like movement damage 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.930
 appearance or resistance will only affect 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.520
 to certain chosen players and not to 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.020
 all where the starting teams 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.970
 sharing life each team has 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.009
 certain amount of life if you die the 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.010
 team has a life - basically like 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.200
 I used to do in you 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.300
 and grenade regeneration as easy as 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.860
 it sounds your grenades are regenerated with the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.260
 the passage of time when you've used them 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.880
 new round cleaning I'm not very 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.620
 sure but I think everything goes back to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.230
 default when the round has been 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.940
 finish scope damage of weapons I can only 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.950
 suppose but I think it would be 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.170
 besides editing the damage of certain 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.540
 weapons how far your shot could 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.010
 get egg in style the waypoint this 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.780
 small arrow that marks where 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.310
 find the objectives as well as the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.990
 flag in capturing the flag by 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.790
 example this will allow you to edit the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.320
 basically the look and feel of the icon 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.150
 but hey these are all options 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.250
 maybe we'll see them in the future or maybe not 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.500
 we will never know until it happens but 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.510
 well that was all now a semi ad 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.160

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.290
