very strong-minded plus confident that

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.550 
very strong-minded plus confident that
you<00:01:59.420> have<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.630> peripheral<00:02:00.020> vision<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:00.350> get

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
you have the peripheral vision you get

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.680 
you have the peripheral vision you get
the<00:02:00.650> hand<00:02:00.920> speed<00:02:01.340> at<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.090> lower<00:02:02.270> center<00:02:02.600> of

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
the hand speed at the lower center of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.510 
the hand speed at the lower center of
gravity<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.290> they<00:02:03.440> learn<00:02:03.650> through<00:02:04.190> breathing

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
gravity so they learn through breathing

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.859 
gravity so they learn through breathing
dropping<00:02:05.060> their<00:02:05.180> breathing<00:02:05.510> instead<00:02:05.780> of

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
dropping their breathing instead of

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.960 
dropping their breathing instead of
having<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.170> up<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.530> their<00:02:06.710> top<00:02:06.970> respiratory

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
having it up in their top respiratory

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:28.830 
having it up in their top respiratory
it's<00:02:08.270> lower<00:02:08.509> their<00:02:08.990> breathing

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.450 

I'm<00:02:29.320> feeling<00:02:29.560> really<00:02:29.650> good<00:02:29.830> feeling<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.280> better
