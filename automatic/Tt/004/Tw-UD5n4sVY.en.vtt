Outfitters and today I'm going to give
you<00:00:09.559> a<00:00:09.620> couple<00:00:10.240> casting<00:00:11.240> pointers<00:00:11.690> and<00:00:11.900> we're

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
you a couple casting pointers and we're

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.959 
you a couple casting pointers and we're
going<00:00:12.379> to<00:00:12.410> talk<00:00:12.650> specifically<00:00:13.340> about<00:00:13.490> your

going to talk specifically about your

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.630 
going to talk specifically about your
anchor<00:00:14.420> and<00:00:14.920> we're<00:00:15.920> going<00:00:16.039> to<00:00:16.070> be<00:00:16.250> doing<00:00:16.610> just

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
anchor and we're going to be doing just

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.000 
anchor and we're going to be doing just
a<00:00:16.970> snap<00:00:17.270> T<00:00:17.510> cast<00:00:17.869> here<00:00:18.230> but<00:00:18.470> all<00:00:18.650> of<00:00:18.920> these

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
a snap T cast here but all of these

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.080 
a snap T cast here but all of these
things<00:00:19.340> that<00:00:19.430> we're<00:00:19.640> going<00:00:19.760> to<00:00:19.820> talk<00:00:20.060> about

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
things that we're going to talk about

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.410 
things that we're going to talk about
apply<00:00:20.690> to<00:00:20.750> any<00:00:21.430> casts<00:00:22.430> that<00:00:22.460> are<00:00:22.730> of<00:00:23.330> a

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
apply to any casts that are of a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.080 
apply to any casts that are of a
waterborne<00:00:24.020> anchor<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:24.650> your<00:00:24.860> snap<00:00:25.730> tease

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
waterborne anchor so your snap tease

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.900 
waterborne anchor so your snap tease
your<00:00:26.720> reverse<00:00:27.590> double<00:00:28.010> spaced<00:00:28.250> regular

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
your reverse double spaced regular

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.000 
your reverse double spaced regular
double<00:00:29.180> spaced<00:00:29.450> reverse<00:00:30.080> snap<00:00:30.380> tease<00:00:30.680> and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
double spaced reverse snap tease and

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.330 
double spaced reverse snap tease and
peri<00:00:31.280> pokes<00:00:31.640> and<00:00:32.079> so<00:00:33.079> real<00:00:33.649> quick<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:34.070> want<00:00:34.100> to

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
peri pokes and so real quick I want to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.160 
peri pokes and so real quick I want to
just<00:00:34.460> kind<00:00:34.640> of<00:00:34.760> talk<00:00:35.000> about<00:00:35.030> kind<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:35.840> the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
just kind of talk about kind of the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.890 
just kind of talk about kind of the
basics<00:00:36.800> behind<00:00:37.220> an<00:00:37.340> anchor<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.850> idea<00:00:38.180> can

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
basics behind an anchor and the idea can

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.020 
basics behind an anchor and the idea can
be<00:00:39.020> sort<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.410> translated<00:00:40.040> in<00:00:40.190> role<00:00:40.430> casting

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
be sort of translated in role casting

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.060 
be sort of translated in role casting
and<00:00:41.180> basically<00:00:41.960> when<00:00:42.290> you<00:00:42.410> come<00:00:42.649> up<00:00:42.770> to<00:00:42.800> do<00:00:43.040> a

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
and basically when you come up to do a

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.819 
and basically when you come up to do a
good<00:00:43.579> old-fashioned<00:00:44.239> role<00:00:44.450> cast<00:00:44.750> you<00:00:45.470> create

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
good old-fashioned role cast you create

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.740 
good old-fashioned role cast you create
all<00:00:46.040> three<00:00:46.370> elements<00:00:46.760> that<00:00:46.880> a<00:00:46.940> spade<00:00:47.210> cast<00:00:47.480> has

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
all three elements that a spade cast has

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.990 
all three elements that a spade cast has
you<00:00:47.989> have<00:00:48.110> an<00:00:48.200> anchor<00:00:48.620> which<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.460> line<00:00:49.700> on

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
you have an anchor which is the line on

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.430 
you have an anchor which is the line on
the<00:00:50.210> water<00:00:50.450> in<00:00:50.630> front<00:00:50.809> of<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.050> which<00:00:51.170> is<00:00:51.320> going

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
the water in front of you which is going

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.830 
the water in front of you which is going
to<00:00:51.530> give<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:51.890> some<00:00:52.489> grip<00:00:52.820> or<00:00:53.030> resistance<00:00:53.630> when

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
to give you some grip or resistance when

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.110 
to give you some grip or resistance when
you<00:00:53.960> hit<00:00:54.380> the<00:00:54.530> rod<00:00:54.680> forward<00:00:55.130> you've<00:00:55.880> got<00:00:56.090> a

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
you hit the rod forward you've got a

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.240 
you hit the rod forward you've got a
deal<00:00:56.420> OOP<00:00:56.630> which<00:00:56.840> forms<00:00:57.230> off<00:00:57.410> of<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.710> rod<00:00:57.890> tip

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
deal OOP which forms off of the rod tip

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.180 
deal OOP which forms off of the rod tip
and<00:00:58.460> you've<00:00:59.000> got<00:00:59.180> a<00:00:59.210> forward<00:00:59.630> cast<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.230> so

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
and you've got a forward cast and so

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.689 
and you've got a forward cast and so
basically<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.750> straighter<00:01:03.260> line<00:01:03.829> you

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
basically the the straighter line you

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.700 
basically the the straighter line you
can<00:01:04.879> make<00:01:05.119> with<00:01:05.509> those<00:01:05.780> three<00:01:06.140> elements<00:01:06.590> in

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
can make with those three elements in

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.139 
can make with those three elements in
other<00:01:06.890> words<00:01:07.070> getting<00:01:07.340> them<00:01:07.490> all<00:01:07.640> lined<00:01:07.880> up

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
other words getting them all lined up

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.059 
other words getting them all lined up
the<00:01:08.719> more<00:01:08.929> efficient<00:01:09.319> the<00:01:09.350> cast<00:01:09.619> is<00:01:09.829> going<00:01:10.009> to

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:10.069 
the more efficient the cast is going to

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.340 
the more efficient the cast is going to
be<00:01:10.219> if<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:10.490> deviate<00:01:10.729> from<00:01:10.999> that<00:01:11.270> angle<00:01:11.899> it's

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
be if you deviate from that angle it's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.199 
be if you deviate from that angle it's
going<00:01:12.469> to<00:01:12.619> become<00:01:12.889> less<00:01:13.069> efficient<00:01:13.609> so<00:01:13.999> that's

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:14.209 
going to become less efficient so that's

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.359 
going to become less efficient so that's
what's<00:01:14.450> called<00:01:14.659> 180<00:01:15.259> degree<00:01:15.619> rule<00:01:15.829> which<00:01:16.069> most

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
what's called 180 degree rule which most

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.029 
what's called 180 degree rule which most
people<00:01:16.759> know<00:01:16.939> about<00:01:16.969> and<00:01:17.329> so<00:01:17.959> the<00:01:18.109> first<00:01:18.319> goal

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
people know about and so the first goal

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.550 
people know about and so the first goal
with<00:01:19.369> your<00:01:19.399> anchor<00:01:19.939> is<00:01:20.119> to<00:01:20.749> put<00:01:20.959> your<00:01:21.109> fly<00:01:21.350> in<00:01:21.499> a

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
with your anchor is to put your fly in a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.620 
with your anchor is to put your fly in a
position<00:01:22.069> so<00:01:22.609> that<00:01:22.639> when<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.029> come<00:01:23.240> around<00:01:23.329> to

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
position so that when you come around to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.449 
position so that when you come around to
make<00:01:23.779> your<00:01:23.929> D<00:01:24.139> loop<00:01:24.380> it's<00:01:24.889> going<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.189> line<00:01:25.429> up

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
make your D loop it's going to line up

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.489 
make your D loop it's going to line up
not<00:01:26.179> only<00:01:26.209> with<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.749> anchor<00:01:27.139> but<00:01:27.319> your

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
not only with the anchor but your

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.709 
not only with the anchor but your
forward<00:01:27.859> cast<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.909> that's<00:01:29.119> a<00:01:29.240> pretty<00:01:29.420> basic

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
forward cast so that's a pretty basic

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.080 
forward cast so that's a pretty basic
rule<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.229> most<00:01:30.529> people<00:01:30.889> know<00:01:31.069> about<00:01:31.369> there's

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
rule that most people know about there's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.519 
rule that most people know about there's
two<00:01:32.270> other<00:01:32.450> rules<00:01:32.779> that<00:01:32.959> I<00:01:32.990> think<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.319> lot<00:01:33.499> of

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:33.529 
two other rules that I think a lot of

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:35.769 
two other rules that I think a lot of
people<00:01:33.859> forget<00:01:34.009> about<00:01:34.219> and<00:01:34.639> these<00:01:35.479> are<00:01:35.689> the

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:35.779 
people forget about and these are the

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:37.120 
people forget about and these are the
ones<00:01:35.959> that<00:01:36.079> we're<00:01:36.259> going<00:01:36.349> to<00:01:36.439> focus<00:01:36.649> on<00:01:36.979> today

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
ones that we're going to focus on today

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.830 
ones that we're going to focus on today
so<00:01:37.909> number<00:01:38.509> one<00:01:39.459> slack<00:01:40.459> is<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.969> enemy<00:01:41.299> anytime

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
so number one slack is the enemy anytime

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.589 
so number one slack is the enemy anytime
you<00:01:41.990> have<00:01:42.109> slack<00:01:42.469> in<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.740> system<00:01:43.299> bad<00:01:44.299> things

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:44.599 
you have slack in the system bad things

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.029 
you have slack in the system bad things
are<00:01:44.749> going<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:44.929> happen<00:01:45.139> because<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.649> rod<00:01:46.009> you

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
are going to happen because the rod you

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.190 
are going to happen because the rod you
can<00:01:46.340> just<00:01:46.609> see<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:46.939> on<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.119> water<00:01:47.389> the<00:01:47.990> rod

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
can just see this on the water the rod

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.289 
can just see this on the water the rod
doesn't<00:01:48.469> start<00:01:48.859> to<00:01:48.979> bend<00:01:49.189> until<00:01:49.609> that<00:01:49.849> slack

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
doesn't start to bend until that slack

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.499 
doesn't start to bend until that slack
is<00:01:50.509> picked<00:01:50.810> up<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.799> one<00:01:52.579> common<00:01:52.880> casting

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
is picked up so one common casting

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.940 
is picked up so one common casting
mistake<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:53.959> see<00:01:54.139> a<00:01:54.169> lot<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.409> people<00:01:54.740> make

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
mistake I see a lot of people make

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.980 
mistake I see a lot of people make
especially<00:01:55.759> with<00:01:56.060> their<00:01:56.209> snap<00:01:56.479> tee<00:01:56.689> as<00:01:56.810> they

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
especially with their snap tee as they

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.809 
especially with their snap tee as they
lift<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:57.499> they<00:01:57.679> come<00:01:57.889> down<00:01:58.039> so<00:01:58.340> hard<00:01:58.639> that

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
lift and they come down so hard that

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.789 
lift and they come down so hard that
they<00:01:58.969> get<00:01:59.149> all<00:01:59.359> these<00:01:59.599> squiggles<00:02:00.200> out<00:02:00.380> here<00:02:00.649> in

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
they get all these squiggles out here in

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.979 
they get all these squiggles out here in
front<00:02:01.219> of<00:02:01.399> on<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.789> water<00:02:01.999> so<00:02:02.539> when<00:02:02.689> they<00:02:02.779> come

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
front of on the water so when they come

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.779 
front of on the water so when they come
around<00:02:03.079> to<00:02:03.409> load<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.829> rod<00:02:04.099> the<00:02:04.340> rod<00:02:04.369> has<00:02:04.759> to

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
around to load that rod the rod has to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.699 
around to load that rod the rod has to
pick<00:02:05.149> up<00:02:05.299> all<00:02:05.569> that<00:02:05.749> slack<00:02:06.109> before<00:02:06.319> it

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
pick up all that slack before it

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.699 
pick up all that slack before it
actually<00:02:06.950> starts<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.639> bend<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.929> every

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
actually starts to bend and so every

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.500 
actually starts to bend and so every
Spey<00:02:09.979> casting<00:02:10.009> instructor<00:02:10.970> has<00:02:11.150> probably

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
Spey casting instructor has probably

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.600 
Spey casting instructor has probably
told<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.470> slow<00:02:12.770> down<00:02:12.800> slow<00:02:13.370> down<00:02:13.400> slow

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
told you to slow down slow down slow

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.690 
told you to slow down slow down slow
down<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.420> that's<00:02:15.080> great<00:02:15.410> advice<00:02:15.770> but<00:02:16.250> often

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
down and that's great advice but often

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.190 
down and that's great advice but often
times<00:02:16.940> we<00:02:17.090> forget<00:02:17.360> wire

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
times we forget wire

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.630 
times we forget wire
going<00:02:18.470> fast<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.099> that's<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.430> bigger

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
going fast and that's the bigger

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.570 
going fast and that's the bigger
question<00:02:20.209> why<00:02:20.870> am<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.140> going<00:02:21.349> fast<00:02:21.770> well<00:02:22.129> if

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
question why am I going fast well if

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.130 
question why am I going fast well if
you've<00:02:22.819> got<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.030> bunch<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.480> slack<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:24.110> that

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
you've got a bunch of slack in that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.130 
you've got a bunch of slack in that
system<00:02:24.530> you've<00:02:25.489> got<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.849> basically<00:02:26.269> move<00:02:26.900> that

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
system you've got to basically move that

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.900 
system you've got to basically move that
line<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.590> much<00:02:27.830> faster<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> pick<00:02:28.580> up<00:02:28.760> that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
line that much faster to pick up that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.780 
line that much faster to pick up that
slack<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.379> key<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:31.129> line<00:02:31.430> lays

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
slack so it's key that that line lays

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.030 
slack so it's key that that line lays
out<00:02:32.030> perfectly<00:02:32.720> flat<00:02:33.170> when<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.500> make<00:02:33.830> this

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
out perfectly flat when you make this

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.640 
out perfectly flat when you make this
move<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:35.390> when<00:02:35.599> I<00:02:35.630> start<00:02:36.019> moving<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.410> rod

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
move so when I start moving that rod

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.880 
move so when I start moving that rod
around<00:02:36.800> me<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.569> get<00:02:38.569> instant<00:02:39.080> load<00:02:39.319> I'm<00:02:39.500> getting

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
around me I get instant load I'm getting

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.309 
around me I get instant load I'm getting
that<00:02:40.040> feedback<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:41.060> sweet<00:02:41.750> feel<00:02:42.019> that<00:02:42.230> we

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
that feedback that sweet feel that we

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.380 
that feedback that sweet feel that we
all<00:02:42.470> love<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.860> feel<00:02:43.190> when<00:02:43.400> we<00:02:43.519> spay<00:02:43.790> cast<00:02:44.120> and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
all love to feel when we spay cast and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.990 
all love to feel when we spay cast and
you<00:02:45.260> know<00:02:45.380> everybody<00:02:46.160> out<00:02:46.250> there<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:46.700> spent

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
you know everybody out there that spent

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.570 
you know everybody out there that spent
any<00:02:47.120> time<00:02:47.209> with<00:02:47.629> a<00:02:47.660> fly<00:02:47.959> rod<00:02:48.069> they<00:02:49.069> know<00:02:49.310> what<00:02:49.549> a

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
any time with a fly rod they know what a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.460 
any time with a fly rod they know what a
fly<00:02:49.819> rod<00:02:50.000> feels<00:02:50.330> like<00:02:50.599> when<00:02:50.810> it's<00:02:50.930> loaded<00:02:51.319> and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
fly rod feels like when it's loaded and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.080 
fly rod feels like when it's loaded and
when<00:02:51.650> it's<00:02:51.799> loaded<00:02:52.250> that's<00:02:52.549> when<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.880> take

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
when it's loaded that's when you take

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.660 
when it's loaded that's when you take
your<00:02:53.239> time<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.200> make<00:02:54.410> nice<00:02:54.739> smooth<00:02:55.250> casts

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
your time and you make nice smooth casts

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.229 
your time and you make nice smooth casts
it's<00:02:56.480> when<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.930> have<00:02:57.079> that<00:02:57.230> slack<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:59.090> you

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
it's when you have that slack that you

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.360 
it's when you have that slack that you
end<00:02:59.390> up<00:02:59.569> going<00:02:59.810> much<00:03:00.140> faster<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.010> just

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
end up going much faster and that just

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.789 
end up going much faster and that just
leads<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.849> lot<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.120> bad<00:03:02.329> things<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:02.989> now

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
leads to a lot of bad things so now

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.680 
leads to a lot of bad things so now
we've<00:03:04.040> got<00:03:04.220> basically<00:03:04.970> our<00:03:05.120> fly<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.599> the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
we've got basically our fly in the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.750 
we've got basically our fly in the
position<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.230> we<00:03:06.349> want<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.890> be<00:03:07.099> with<00:03:07.730> a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
position that we want it to be with a

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.069 
position that we want it to be with a
180<00:03:08.299> degree<00:03:08.630> rule<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.110> we've<00:03:10.069> got<00:03:10.310> this<00:03:11.079> flat

drastic<00:03:31.489> stop<00:03:31.790> you're<00:03:32.480> going<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.690> get<00:03:32.840> slack

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
drastic stop you're going to get slack

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.330 
drastic stop you're going to get slack
on<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:33.410> water<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:33.799> it's<00:03:33.980> all<00:03:34.130> about<00:03:34.160> just

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
on the water so it's all about just

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.660 
on the water so it's all about just
being<00:03:34.790> smooth<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.590> making<00:03:36.590> one<00:03:36.920> smooth

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
being smooth and making one smooth

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.759 
being smooth and making one smooth
acceleration<00:03:38.660> it's<00:03:38.840> basically<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.410> cast

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
acceleration it's basically a cast

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.319 
acceleration it's basically a cast
you're<00:03:40.010> making<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.010> last<00:03:43.250> goal<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:44.090> this

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
you're making so the last goal and this

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.000 
you're making so the last goal and this
is<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> goal<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.049> think<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.410> lot<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.620> people

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
is a goal that I think a lot of people

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.770 
is a goal that I think a lot of people
miss<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:48.130> when<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.160> do<00:03:49.280> this<00:03:49.579> setup<00:03:50.060> with<00:03:50.630> the

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
miss is when I do this setup with the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.250 
miss is when I do this setup with the
snap<00:03:51.079> tee<00:03:52.420> you're<00:03:53.420> going<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.630> see<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> little

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
snap tee you're going to see a little

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.580 
snap tee you're going to see a little
loop<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.739> line<00:03:54.980> form<00:03:55.400> off<00:03:56.019> right<00:03:57.019> off<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.410> rod

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
loop of line form off right off the rod

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.080 
loop of line form off right off the rod
tip<00:03:57.859> and<00:03:58.040> it's<00:03:58.160> about<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.579> size<00:03:58.819> of<00:03:58.970> a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
tip and it's about the size of a

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.120 
tip and it's about the size of a
basketball<00:03:59.299> just<00:03:59.989> kind<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.260> curling<00:04:00.739> off<00:04:00.920> the

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
basketball just kind of curling off the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.610 
basketball just kind of curling off the
rod<00:04:01.310> tip<00:04:01.609> so<00:04:02.510> what<00:04:02.810> happens<00:04:03.200> in<00:04:03.349> a<00:04:03.410> lot<00:04:03.590> of

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
rod tip so what happens in a lot of

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.240 
rod tip so what happens in a lot of
people's<00:04:03.980> casts<00:04:04.579> is<00:04:04.780> they<00:04:05.780> start<00:04:06.260> moving<00:04:06.920> the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
people's casts is they start moving the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.470 
people's casts is they start moving the
rod<00:04:07.459> out<00:04:08.829> over<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:09.980> water<00:04:10.190> first<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.030> then

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
rod out over the water first and then

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.690 
rod out over the water first and then
get<00:04:11.690> everything<00:04:12.260> beyond<00:04:12.620> them<00:04:12.889> and<00:04:12.980> they

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
get everything beyond them and they

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.789 
get everything beyond them and they
never<00:04:13.940> get<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:14.480> loop<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.989> line<00:04:15.230> because<00:04:15.440> the

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
never get that loop a line because the

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.370 
never get that loop a line because the
rod<00:04:15.980> tip<00:04:16.250> moves<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:16.789> far<00:04:17.090> beyond<00:04:17.450> their<00:04:18.049> body

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
rod tip moves so far beyond their body

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.199 
rod tip moves so far beyond their body
so<00:04:19.039> a<00:04:19.070> good<00:04:19.310> way<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.519> kind<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:19.880> think<00:04:20.120> about

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
so a good way to kind of think about

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.750 
so a good way to kind of think about
this<00:04:20.599> if<00:04:20.840> we<00:04:20.989> could<00:04:21.139> just<00:04:21.200> take<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.859> imaginary

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
this if we could just take a imaginary

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.390 
this if we could just take a imaginary
piece<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.210> chalk<00:04:23.479> put<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.440> in<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.770> end<00:04:24.950> of<00:04:25.190> the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
piece of chalk put it in the end of the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.339 
piece of chalk put it in the end of the
the<00:04:25.849> rod<00:04:26.060> tip<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.539> we've<00:04:26.630> got<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.780> big<00:04:27.050> chalk

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
the rod tip and we've got a big chalk

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.440 
the rod tip and we've got a big chalk
board<00:04:27.680> here<00:04:27.950> we're<00:04:28.729> essentially<00:04:29.120> going<00:04:29.360> to

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
board here we're essentially going to

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.659 
board here we're essentially going to
draw<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.990> D<00:04:30.320> with<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.740> rod<00:04:30.919> tip<00:04:31.159> so<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.460> rods

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
draw a D with the rod tip so the rods

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:31.999 
draw a D with the rod tip so the rods
going<00:04:31.880> to

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
going to

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.850 
going to
vertical<00:04:32.669> first<00:04:33.059> and<00:04:33.360> then<00:04:33.930> around<00:04:34.499> the<00:04:34.710> edge

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
vertical first and then around the edge

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.920 
vertical first and then around the edge
of<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.129> D<00:04:35.339> and<00:04:35.520> then<00:04:35.999> right<00:04:36.240> back<00:04:36.419> to<00:04:36.629> where<00:04:36.779> we

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
of the D and then right back to where we

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.850 
of the D and then right back to where we
started<00:04:37.339> now<00:04:38.339> if<00:04:38.759> we<00:04:39.599> think<00:04:39.809> about<00:04:39.990> our<00:04:40.379> start

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
started now if we think about our start

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.829 
started now if we think about our start
position<00:04:41.069> which<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.759> straight<00:04:42.119> down<00:04:42.330> below<00:04:42.659> us

00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:42.839 
position which is straight down below us

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:45.829 
position which is straight down below us
and<00:04:43.050> our<00:04:43.800> firing<00:04:44.159> position<00:04:44.789> if<00:04:45.360> we<00:04:45.569> want<00:04:45.749> to

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:45.839 
and our firing position if we want to

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:48.079 
and our firing position if we want to
cast<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.199> way<00:04:46.559> our<00:04:46.800> D<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.610> going<00:04:47.819> to<00:04:47.879> work

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:48.089 
cast that way our D is going to work

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:50.540 
cast that way our D is going to work
within<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.539> confines<00:04:48.809> of<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:49.529> triangle<00:04:50.039> if

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
within the confines of this triangle if

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.939 
within the confines of this triangle if
we<00:04:50.610> wanted<00:04:50.969> to<00:04:51.029> cast<00:04:51.270> further<00:04:51.599> upstream<00:04:52.020> our<00:04:52.469> D

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
we wanted to cast further upstream our D

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.159 
we wanted to cast further upstream our D
would<00:04:53.129> just<00:04:53.339> become<00:04:53.669> wider<00:04:53.969> and<00:04:54.210> if<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.050> was

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
would just become wider and if I was

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.019 
would just become wider and if I was
going<00:04:55.319> to<00:04:55.349> cast<00:04:55.619> further<00:04:55.860> downstream<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.849> D

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.029 
going to cast further downstream the D

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.029 
going to cast further downstream the D
would<00:04:57.180> just<00:04:57.360> become<00:04:57.689> narrower<00:04:58.020> so<00:04:58.770> by<00:04:58.979> doing

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
would just become narrower so by doing

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.359 
would just become narrower so by doing
that<00:04:59.869> we<00:05:00.869> get<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.110> vertical<00:05:01.379> lift<00:05:01.860> that's<00:05:02.189> nice

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:02.369 
that we get a vertical lift that's nice

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.850 
that we get a vertical lift that's nice
and<00:05:02.610> smooth<00:05:02.909> I<00:05:03.210> come<00:05:04.020> right<00:05:04.259> around<00:05:04.469> that<00:05:04.680> D

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
and smooth I come right around that D

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.230 
and smooth I come right around that D
right<00:05:05.099> back<00:05:05.279> to<00:05:05.460> where<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:05.580> start<00:05:05.939> and<00:05:06.149> I'll

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
right back to where I start and I'll

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.779 
right back to where I start and I'll
form<00:05:06.569> that<00:05:06.749> loop<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.110> line<00:05:07.319> every<00:05:07.529> time<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:08.249> do

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
form that loop a line every time I do

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.839 
form that loop a line every time I do
that<00:05:09.210> if<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.259> start<00:05:10.589> too<00:05:10.830> fast<00:05:11.219> and<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.699> rod

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
that if I start too fast and the rod

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.119 
that if I start too fast and the rod
starts<00:05:12.059> moving<00:05:12.689> across<00:05:13.229> the<00:05:13.379> water<00:05:13.770> first

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:14.129 
starts moving across the water first

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:15.950 
starts moving across the water first
it's<00:05:14.550> very<00:05:14.639> hard<00:05:15.149> for<00:05:15.300> me<00:05:15.419> to<00:05:15.449> get<00:05:15.629> that<00:05:15.779> rod

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
it's very hard for me to get that rod

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.409 
it's very hard for me to get that rod
back<00:05:16.309> downstream<00:05:17.309> and<00:05:17.639> I<00:05:17.699> never<00:05:17.909> form<00:05:18.240> that

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
back downstream and I never form that

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.079

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:28.649 
about moving too fast well if you don't

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
have that loop a line you don't start

that loop a line down below you let it
settle<00:05:40.080> now<00:05:40.709> you've<00:05:40.979> got<00:05:41.189> line<00:05:41.459> that<00:05:41.669> starts
