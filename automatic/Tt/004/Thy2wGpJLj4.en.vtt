00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.849
 air battery time what is it 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.400
 such and how to put together an alternative 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.170
 energy on the food channel for assembling such 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.340
 element will need any piece 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.230
 aluminum and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.430
 a heap of coal than these components 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.060
 more components will be higher 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.599
 indicators of this element immediately want 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.230
 note its performance is very small 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.780
 compared to other elements from 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.239
 benefits can be noted that he 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.399
 works just on salt water on 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.120
 common in salt solution and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.350
 water and requires simple and and gives in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.910
 We chose the quality of these two elements 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.469
 ordinary aluminum radiator from 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.719
 computer processor 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.489
 aluminum 0 rag 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:00.270
 acting as a separator and not giving 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.320
 close up the doom electrode and usually 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.140
 charcoal 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.560
 This element works as follows 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.990
 aluminum as more active metal 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.189
 located in the elevator in the electrolyte 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.130
 interacts with accumulated in coal 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.409
 air but more precisely with oxygen which 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.770
 contains air then and interact 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.780
 two elements are rimini and oxygen if 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.479
 collect such items with a big name 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.310
 you and banks poured a can of coal then 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.470
 such an element will show 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.020
 well above 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.500
 In this case, our design in this 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.600
 the form 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.939
 as aluminum is more active metal he 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.270
 will be a minus of our items 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:45.619
 well, weâ€™ll have true love oxygen 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.619
 plus so we look at the voltage 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.030
 here you can see quite a bit even by 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:03.220
 there is no volt although initially when we 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.220
 collected item showed but 7th it 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.950
 here is a bunch of a little moved already on the street 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.140
 Of course ineffective but such or not 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.269
 can be called eternal of course if 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.850
 force oxygen to this 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.170
 a bunch of coal then the performance of this element 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.580
 many times increase in the element 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.810
 consumable us is 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.930
 aluminum 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.700
 it is well, aluminum gradually 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.190
 dissolve in aqueous solution 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.220
 very very slowly such an element 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.569
 therefore he will serve very long well 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.250
 and periodically you need to top up 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.720
 salt water brine phenomena 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.090
 galvanic cell can 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.340
 use for cleaning different metals 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.920
 but more about that in the next video 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.730

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.730
