00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 how about friends in the previous video 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.040
 we saw how to install the camera in the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.529
 motorola's gallery 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.860
 and to complete the package already we are going to 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.660
 see how to install a fm radio will not be 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.549
 in this case the motorola since 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.500
 this one handles other bookstores 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:22.859
 however spirit 2 real fm is going to be 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 a pk that will allow us to have 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.960
 FM radio without access to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.390
 internet either wifi or data plan 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.239
 this is possible thanks to our 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.360
 moto gp has inside its hardware a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.610
 chip dedicated to what is radio fm by 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.360
 what the only thing that is needed is a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 application capable of accessing the system 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.989
 to be able to communicate with the hardware 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.879
 as expected, we need to be 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.739
 root user however if we have 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.239
 done the previous procedure what 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.660
 only thing that we are going to have to do is 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.360
 pass this apec app to the internal memory 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.160
 from our phone as you can see here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.079
 I put in the download folder 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.390
 because there it is easier for me 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.950
 place them to freckles you can put it 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.049
 Wherever we like, we are going to close it 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.119
 and with our team we will hand 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.450
 go to our file explorer in 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.880
 my case of the ies file explorer we go to the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.770
 download folder or where we had it 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.119
 placed and we're going to meet with the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.420
 application what we are going to do is give it 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.679
 click install let's unlock the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.390
 installation of font applications 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.390
 unknown in configuration 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.729
 we accept back off 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.760
 and we click again to install 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.110
 next install 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.110
 let's go back to open 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 but we issue the request for 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.770
 Super user 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.730
 ok let's make two simple adjustments 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.730
 we go to menu 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.040
 tunnel 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.110
 band and we chose the one from the USA that is the one 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.490
 it does to all Latin America 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.750
 we go stereo and we choose stereo 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.750
 ready we go back 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.489
 and it would already be configured to be able 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.050
 use it without any problem capturing 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.330
 all the stations that we 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.250
 we usually have in our country 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.200
 I'm going to connect the headphones so that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.200
 can hear how the radio is going 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.770
 we give in play 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.939
 Here we see a circle for 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.890
 be able to make station changes 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.510
 however it is not in practice so 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.400
 I suggest that when they want 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.909
 choose a station to get as close 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.909
 possible 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.909
 and then as the button above go 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.180
 advancing until reaching the emitter since 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.180
 they want 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.400
 then as you see in the bottom 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.100
 we have to be able to add the favorites 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.930
 we are going to click on it and we have it 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.360
 added in this way we will be able to 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.400
 access faster and easier 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.829
 without complicating 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.569
 and smart friends that would be all I hope that 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.510
 have been useful do not forget about 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.610
 I like to share it and subscribe 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.980
 to keep having more and new 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.329
 news about our engine or motorbike 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.329
 gp until the next video
