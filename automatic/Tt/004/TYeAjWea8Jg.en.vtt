00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
a 14 14 millimeter socket wrench

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.799 
a 14 14 millimeter socket wrench
basically<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.850> using<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.210> wrench<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.539> first

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
basically I was using a wrench at first

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.410 
basically I was using a wrench at first
but<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.079> figured<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.500> would<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:47.000> more<00:00:48.000> secure

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
but I figured this would be more secure

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.940 
but I figured this would be more secure
as<00:00:48.600> far<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.930> turning<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.440> stuff<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
as far as turning it and stuff like that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.569 
as far as turning it and stuff like that
so<00:00:50.719> there's<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.750> bigger<00:00:51.989> boats<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.620> here's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so there's your bigger boats and here's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.310 
so there's your bigger boats and here's
your<00:00:53.670> smaller<00:00:53.969> pins<00:00:54.329> are<00:00:54.570> basically<00:00:54.899> holding

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
your smaller pins are basically holding

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.910 
your smaller pins are basically holding
your<00:00:55.500> pads<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:58.160> is<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.750> basically<00:01:01.350> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
your pads like this is so basically you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.969 
your pads like this is so basically you
know<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> take<00:01:02.399> off<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.699> top<00:01:02.879> bolts<00:01:03.979> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
know you take off your top bolts and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.899 
know you take off your top bolts and
then<00:01:05.400> comes<00:01:06.180> off<00:01:06.450> pads<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.590> there<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.790> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
then comes off pads be in there and you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.690 
then comes off pads be in there and you
can<00:01:09.000> start<00:01:09.240> taking<00:01:09.570> off<00:01:09.689> your<00:01:09.720> pins<00:01:10.610> for<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
can start taking off your pins for the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.469 
can start taking off your pins for the
pans<00:01:11.939> use<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> allen<00:01:12.540> wrench<00:01:12.869> 5<00:01:13.590> millimeter

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
pans use the allen wrench 5 millimeter

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.770 
pans use the allen wrench 5 millimeter
how<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.689> works<00:01:15.869> best<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.670> before<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.570> take<00:01:18.720> off

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
how it works best so before you take off

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.190 
how it works best so before you take off
the<00:01:18.930> pans<00:01:19.200> actually<00:01:19.680> also<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
the pans actually also if you have a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.780 
the pans actually also if you have a
long<00:01:22.200> flat<00:01:22.560> head<00:01:22.770> screwdriver<00:01:23.070> your<00:01:23.460> biggest

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
long flat head screwdriver your biggest

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170 
long flat head screwdriver your biggest
one<00:01:23.970> or<00:01:24.270> something<00:01:24.930> real<00:01:25.259> flat<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.970> wedge<00:01:26.970> or

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
one or something real flat a wedge or

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.230 
one or something real flat a wedge or
something<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:28.049> know<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:29.240> you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
something I don't know but up you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
something I don't know but up you
basically<00:01:30.420> when<00:01:31.170> you're<00:01:31.290> old<00:01:31.409> pads<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.860> in

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
basically when you're old pads are in

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
basically when you're old pads are in
there<00:01:33.290> before<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.650> take<00:01:34.860> them<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:35.540> you<00:01:36.540> want

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
there before you take them out you want

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.999 
there before you take them out you want
to<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:36.960> wedge<00:01:37.290> obviously<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> other

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to put that wedge obviously the other

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
to put that wedge obviously the other
won't<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.400> two<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.759> well<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.630> want

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
won't be in the two as well but you want

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.210 
won't be in the two as well but you want
to<00:01:39.840> take<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:39.960> wedge<00:01:40.290> ER<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.890> wedge<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
to take that wedge ER and just wedge it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
to take that wedge ER and just wedge it
and<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.460> between<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.180> units<00:01:42.450> between<00:01:42.930> both

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
and be between these units between both

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.649 
and be between these units between both
of<00:01:43.380> them<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:44.340> try<00:01:44.880> spread<00:01:45.149> them<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.360> as

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
of them and just try spread them out as

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.200 
of them and just try spread them out as
much<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.880> you'd<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.119> do

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
much as you can because you'd have to do

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
much as you can because you'd have to do
it<00:01:48.329> later<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> process<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.829> kind<00:01:50.070> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it later in the process and it's kind of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.100 
it later in the process and it's kind of
it's<00:01:50.820> kind<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.180> painful<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.990> later

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
it's kind of more painful to do it later

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.569 
it's kind of more painful to do it later
so<00:01:55.110> make<00:01:55.259> sure<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.860> definitely

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
so make sure you do that definitely

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
there's these little things right here

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.460 
there's these little things right here
and<00:02:22.150> each<00:02:23.150> basically<00:02:23.540> have<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.720> go<00:02:23.840> under<00:02:24.170> here

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
and each basically have to go under here
