00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.900
 born depends on what it will be 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.210
 what costs less is once

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.039
 understand something or have tried to 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.750
 treat me the origin account as I know it 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.399
 because I received an email from origin 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.079
 telling me that someone asked for mine 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.030
 password changed my password 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.440
 unfortunately for you shitty head 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.329
 which I also think I understand who he is 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.329
 because there's such a jerk to have me 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.160
 asked for my email in the comments of 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.730

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.720
 thousand digits I wrote to him that not

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.740

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.680

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.409
 milito can buy if 650 700 boys 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.909
 maximum 700 maximum in my advice is 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.399
 all offered are videos that 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.869
 found at 700 resell it around 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.950
 950 1000 more probably 950 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.899
 especially in the morning to the evening a 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.990
 new advice my beggar never 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.550
 which if you have to do it buy it there 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.810
 evening sell the car or the night 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.700
 I used the afternoon because there 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.350
 remains on the rump I gave you the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.210
 advice and then obviously guys 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.700
 choose you are free of course 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.890
 do as you like and like it 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.770
 as you know my boys players 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.740
 they are usable or better to mine 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.470
 morning prices is predominantly 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.030
 you have to buy them in the late evening many mi 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.700
 they ask what you mean late person 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.200
 I mean from 11 onwards in the evening 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.440
 you say you fear me the next morning I have to 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.480
 go to school, there is no 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.460
 problem is this not having me these 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.810
 time limits these constraints boys 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.130
 I can afford to do some 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.900
 proceeds in the evening 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.490
 I'm not talking about big numbers, but I am talking 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.140
 a little less competition a little less 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.700
 pain in the balls that there 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.800
 they allow you to buy more 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.360
 easily if you succeed of course 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.240
 exploit these oral best for you 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.160
 otherwise you will find them in the crush of 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.980
 afternoon unfortunately I can't 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.120
 help in this case I'm sorry 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.380
 however the prices are still valid 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.450
 so you simply have to be 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.970
 lucky the afternoon guys need to 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.460
 be lucky in the evening and morning 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.340
 there is also a mixture of skill in understanding 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.810
 when and how to make the offer in fact 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.790
 final banner for those of you who don't know 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.470
 what is the first race the first video 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.420
 who sees there is a banner at the end of 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.820
 video of which I give you video names 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.070
 video role the team also give you two 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.540
 numbers the first number we do review 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.690
 even for those who already know it first 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.220
 number is the minimum price at which you 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.630
 you will be able to buy this 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.570
 player what does that mean for example 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.820
 you will find written sneijder 7 thousand 8500 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.180
 it means that you will buy sneijder 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.560
 at least you will have to spend 7 thousand but 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.220
 this means that you could also have two 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.690
 years to finish buying it 7800 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.550
 no one gives you the certainty of taking it 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.320
 Weekly, you want to see the conditions 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.420
 of the market at that time when you do 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.620
 counts sales and decide the offer from 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.660
 do personally if I tell you in the morning 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.000
 make the lowest bid because so much 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.890
 there is little competition and 7200 2003 on the spot 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.190
 managed to take if the afternoon 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.110
 kids under 7700 7800 don't have it 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.650
 you will not even pray in all 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.090
 languages 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.890
 the second number is the price 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.659
 maximum to which you can sell it 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.439
 this means that in the morning you can 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.640
 sell it 8500 8800 my 7 the evening the 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.159
 you might even be able to place 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.870
 only at 8000 then also in this one 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.939
 in case you pay close attention to how much 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.049
 spend to buy because you have to 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.060
 always have a margin 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.979
 the pieces are I gave him a magic in 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.079
 which is between 7,000 and 8500 we are talking about 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.750
 of 1,500 margins so let's talk with 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:28.590
 which is a 30 percent kid not 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.720
 it is a small measure of 20 percent than not 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.770
 it is a lot but it is not even little given that 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.780
 in the end you want to buy and resell 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.150
 so you just have to waste time a 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.440
 write fast auction 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.190
 So then we both talk about 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.800
 march of small but good advice 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.509
 main comes from giving you why i'm 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.940
 finding the reason they succeed and 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.250
 others instead have a little more effort and 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.009
 only that you have to do so many 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.630
 many many offers one a boys 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.030
 I will always see amounts I am seeing on 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:01.220
 half a million that invests every 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.020
 time I take players home for 4 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.210
 450 thousand so let's talk about a good one 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.220
 margin and also the banner arrived 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.349
 so you just have to look at me prices 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.050
 I apologize in advance for the colors chosen 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.120
 I didn't have time to change them on Sunday 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.699
 you will have the banner with the new colors and 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.460
 obviously the players mobilized those 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.409
 the values ​​of the players modified those 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.699
 that I cheated guys the very latest 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.770
 precisely they are not players who do not 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.169
 you can simply use i 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.659
 prices are no longer those on state 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.270
 beaten prices are no longer those in the 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.800
 sense that I am or slightly higher is 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.720
 slightly lower but still is 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.810
 they are hard to take of 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.979
 consequence type homers veil written 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.699
 when I believe there is written one 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.940
 what of the type 13 1500 a message e 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.909
 price you will never be able to find 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.310
 a month 11 milan you will ever succeed in 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:56.409
 buy here because this I crossed if 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.080
 you succeed well but the 90 out of 100 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.179
 therefore, he cannot do what the council is 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.219
 if you need it, you want to use it 

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:05.379
 the prices are those are valid are 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.479
 I don't give you good guarantees on the 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.939
 ease of taking and on the ease of 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.379
 resale then choose you based 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:13.629

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.909
 must spend what time redone
