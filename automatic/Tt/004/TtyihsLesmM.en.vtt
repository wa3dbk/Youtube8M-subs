thing I want to mention is no one's

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.110 
thing I want to mention is no one's
really<00:03:47.139> mentioned<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.949> the<00:03:48.129> trampolines<00:03:48.819> in

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
really mentioned and the trampolines in

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.289 
really mentioned and the trampolines in
the<00:03:49.720> new<00:03:49.870> update<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.620> do<00:03:50.859> go<00:03:51.129> about<00:03:51.430> two<00:03:52.060> or

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
the new update you do go about two or

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.089 
the new update you do go about two or
three<00:03:52.569> times<00:03:52.750> as<00:03:53.019> high<00:03:53.199> as<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.379> do<00:03:53.560> originally

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
three times as high as you do originally

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.990 
three times as high as you do originally
so<00:03:54.940> this<00:03:55.329> is<00:03:55.510> actually<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:56.290> lot<00:03:57.190> higher<00:03:57.489> than<00:03:57.549> it

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
so this is actually a lot higher than it

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.140 
so this is actually a lot higher than it
