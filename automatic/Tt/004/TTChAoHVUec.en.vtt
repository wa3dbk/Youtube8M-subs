00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
angle okay different hinge mechanism

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.340 
angle okay different hinge mechanism
similar<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:43.980> n97<00:05:44.970> but<00:05:45.360> different<00:05:46.110> at<00:05:46.260> the

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
similar to the n97 but different at the

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.500 
similar to the n97 but different at the
same<00:05:46.530> time<00:05:46.710> with<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.790> hinge<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.210> hinge<00:05:48.390> is

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
same time with the hinge the hinge is

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.670 
same time with the hinge the hinge is
actually<00:05:48.780> made<00:05:48.930> of<00:05:49.050> steel<00:05:49.260> so<00:05:49.500> is<00:05:49.590> very

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
actually made of steel so is very

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.700 
actually made of steel so is very
durable<00:05:50.040> okay<00:05:50.700> and<00:05:51.000> it's<00:05:51.510> very<00:05:51.570> robust<00:05:52.560> to

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
durable okay and it's very robust to

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.700 
durable okay and it's very robust to
feel<00:05:52.860> about<00:05:53.100> it<00:05:53.370> okay<00:05:54.060> fantastic<00:05:55.050> well<00:05:55.680> I

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
feel about it okay fantastic well I

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.380 
feel about it okay fantastic well I
think<00:05:55.950> we've<00:05:56.430> got<00:05:56.910> pretty<00:05:57.180> much<00:05:57.330> everything

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390
