00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.490
 so we passed the 24 and we are 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.200
 arrived on day 25 on the day of 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.969
 Christmas par excellence 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.130
 we have completely changed colors 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.230
 from the table we made before 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.259
 so we are on much more colors 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.720
 quiet but on gold on beige and on 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.149
 white mata is definitely more delicate 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.619
 but so that has a story because 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.779
 this time for this table here 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.059
 we also tell a little story 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.890
 now my assistant will pass these 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:41.120
 branches that are dried bamboo branches that 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.810
 I sprayed that one 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.300
 silver in this case you can 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.450
 also cut and then render only 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.810
 have only a small piece instead of the 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.329
 red placemat this time we have 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:00.110
 a golden placemat 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.660
 of course in a house you don't have 8 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.239
 10 15 types of dishes as they can have 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.720
 of shops rather than restaurants 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.180
 but maybe even going around maybe 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.150
 find the special dishes maybe ne 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.030
 find only 6 or little things 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.170
 which can then render the tables of 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.420
 Christmas or no details more your own 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.760
 use of grandma's dishes that have a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.110
 golden border of which I have remained 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.940
 on the top 6 and I make a kind of 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.650
 triptych of dishes with all dishes 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.340
 several for which a delicate dish 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.540
 transparent with so on top of them 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.930
 you see is a small dish decorated by 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.770
 fruit that will serve for the non starter 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.200
 we use the deep dish in this case 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.750
 who acts as a contrast to all the others 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.320
 I will use the same for this table 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.310
 glasses we used for the other 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:10.299
 always for this reason therefore the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:17.989
 tumblr a cute printed glass 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:26.150
 in one way and in the other part in a 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:29.780
 other is my little fruit to do 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.819
 the toast instead change the cutlery 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.739
 cutlery that I will use these times are 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.720
 silver cutlery that I inherited and that 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.129
 little use but this will be the occasion 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:49.159
 right for which knife to the right 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:50.930
 fork left spoon if you have 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.829
 silver cutlery you don't feel like 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.959
 clean them all just give it a go 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:00.260
 with water and soap from sugar le good e 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.019
 even though they are almost like that 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.670
 antiqued because oxidized will go well 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:10.010
 in fact they are the reason I put the cutlery 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.980
 from fruit knife before with handle a 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.000
 right and fork to the left and to 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.609
 last the spoon that goes with col 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.790
 handle to the right the same thing I do 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.790
 for the other place at the table knife 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:35.870
 place the glasses forks to get me 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.819
 space and spoon and restore i 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.900
 glasses like before 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:45.019
 now we want to give him a bit of light understood 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.919
 this is another particular I use 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.879
 this lamp so a little strange because 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:58.519
 we have the forest of silver birches 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:59.599
 and here the forest all covered with snow this 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.329
 it lights up 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.489
 but in the same way these things are 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:08.959
 furniture items are things you can 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.180
 find in almost all major centers 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.310
 commercial also those of furnishing 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.230
 and not but if you don't have 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.880
 such a special thing is found 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.400
 I found myself 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.610
 just put a thread of light maybe a 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.680
 led therefore of cooler lights that runs 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.870
 along the table in the middle of the glasses in 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.240
 way to make sense like this 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.780
 brightness but that of the ice of the 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.710
 snow because our history is that a 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.220
 group of little birds 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.200
 colds from the cold come closer instead 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.470
 towards our table and towards the house 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.050
 that here is represented by this 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.810
 small cage with all the candles and yes 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.170
 warm up heat up warm up 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.340
 heart warms the soul and they find each other again 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:05:00.790
 at the table that's why we have i 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:05.080
 our little birds that only note of 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.180
 color I will put so next to the table 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.250
 this too is absolutely ornament 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.820
 that you can find in the big centers 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.880
 commercial stores that sell the 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:22.900
 balls like birds and on the other 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:25.840
 part we also have ours here 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.520
 little cellino we continue the 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:37.030
 decoration with me I take these cups 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:39.010
 where I put a small candle that 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.810
 I found in a flea market even the 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.640
 flea markets flea markets of used things i 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.850
 old things markets 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.770
 sometimes there are objects that 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.260
 we don't think they could do the case 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.900
 ours instead of on a table 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.850
 make their effect 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.660
 in this table we end with the 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.550
 napkin to which I put it because yes 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.710
 speaks of the heart we speak of the heart 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.580
 warmed up birds I put a 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:09.160
 glass heart as you close napkin 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:13.180
 which can be stuck over the 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:21.000
 name of the diner for example I add 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:21.000
 still so the wood 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:29.500
 with the heart because it gives warmth and for 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:34.060
 revive our birch trees one 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:41.440
 silver garland also a little 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:44.050
 intricate that we can pass on 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.300
 silver cars and even a bit in the middle 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.160
 the glasses 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.610
 I always do two at the table but you 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.680
 remember that the same things do 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:58.080
 can prepare for a table of six 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.080
 rather than 8 or 10 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.280
 and here it is our Christmas 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.820
 table made christmas ready for 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.050
 give a greater effect to all 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.570
 your guests 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.240
 turn off all the lights and leave alone 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.250
 the trees or the lights and of the table and the 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.710
 candles so that the atmosphere is 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.200
 perfect this is a beautiful table 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.930
 prepared with dishes but will be perfect 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.940
 also to make a buffet a buffet 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.050
 Christmas when guests are many 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.780
 more because then the decorations 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:37.120
 can stay in the table because the 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:40.560
 bamboo can stay in the middle of the table e 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.560
 all candles lit.
