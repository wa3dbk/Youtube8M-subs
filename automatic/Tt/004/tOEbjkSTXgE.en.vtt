00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:10.050
 how come 2000 ps tv turn of speed 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.599
 Triple lasts is the fourth I am 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.240
 now on the red bull ring organ 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.670
 actually race tracks with true 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.680
 Rectangles got a lot of speed 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.590
 then had to brake completely 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.660
 accelerate everywhere that happens 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.820
 this degressive braking so far was 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.119
 come back with right that is called there 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.950
 anchor and then to the vertex 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.930
 leave these brakes degressive and 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.090
 that worked wonderfully above all else 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.950
 because these train stages in the in 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.620
 the mine still in standard 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.170
 setup will be perfect, it's just like that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.000
 out of it as it should come out of the chest 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.860
 Vorwerk where it is hard to get excited 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.469
 Get along with it very well 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.570
 then, however, seen in the box that 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.910
 put the tire on the right side 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.680
 Of course it rips me apart 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.960
 not quite happy 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 the battery profit farmers the iranians 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.140
 treadmill builders are the ones we have 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.760
 then lowered the air pressure even further 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.439
 on 19 behind 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.420
 but now she has not improved 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.180
 I have to be worried when I have to worry 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.430
 So you do not notice that has great feedback 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.090
 gave a super hard corp that was 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.159
 perfect the only thing that was bad the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.259
 word will look gray on this uphill 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.720
 then the anchor attacked hobby that has 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.159
 this curve in him are indeed the come 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.320
 probably even in the hansa read 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.979
 right turn the formula the brakes still 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.200
 to let 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.470
 and then there was shock and tomato 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.310
 ag will slow the brakes down or 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.470
 what's going on there 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 then how about the next two three 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.710
 It has come out on top 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.780
 nice because the brakes are hot and it 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.970
 But it is that easy 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.950
 waves inside and there maybe lifts 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.909
 in short, the back wheel praise and the calculator 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.920
 says care brake open and after 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.329
 not the last shred is braking 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.439
 It has never been a problem but it is 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.659
 somehow the feeling of insecurity 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.680
 and sample did not know exactly how to do it 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.770
 to handle 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.950
 and then erwlinger makes the big one 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.349
 Austrian 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.500
 mother great hero then told me yes 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.670
 that may be but trigger this abs 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.400
 could prevent was already 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.970
 probably in the back shortly before 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.239
 brakes at the rear and quasi brakes and 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.010
 then it should trigger abs in the front and it 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.230
 that's how it really was 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.640
 is world class and I will not be the one 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.250
 fastest if you should already 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.250
 really great fun and when 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.440
 next event at the next 1000 ps 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.400
 the patin or heat is in good shape 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.330
 friends 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.330
 Thank you very much
