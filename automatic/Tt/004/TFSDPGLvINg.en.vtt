other<00:02:01.840> varieties<00:02:02.679> if<00:02:02.919> you<00:02:03.009> want<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.279> go<00:02:03.369> all

taco balls out on this I'm sticking with

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.790 
taco balls out on this I'm sticking with
the<00:02:06.549> original<00:02:06.639> corn<00:02:07.299> chips<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:08.200> can<00:02:08.380> open<00:02:08.709> the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
the original corn chips you can open the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.400 
the original corn chips you can open the
chips<00:02:09.069> one<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.489> two<00:02:09.700> ways<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.630> can<00:02:10.810> get<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.050> pair

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
chips one of two ways you can get a pair

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.120 
chips one of two ways you can get a pair
of<00:02:11.700> scissors<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.690> cut<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.590> open<00:02:14.950> on

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
of scissors that is and cut it open on

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.640 
of scissors that is and cut it open on
the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.990 
the
side<00:02:16.810> like<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.220> because<00:02:19.220> opening<00:02:19.579> it<00:02:19.700> from<00:02:19.879> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
side like so because opening it from the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.880 
side like so because opening it from the
side<00:02:20.239> compromises<00:02:21.079> the<00:02:21.200> integrity<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.709> the
