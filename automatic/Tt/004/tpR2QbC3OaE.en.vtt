00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
we've cut it off we now Forge it up to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.710 
we've cut it off we now Forge it up to
where<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.100> parallel<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> back<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.420> this

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
where it's parallel on the back and this

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.479 
where it's parallel on the back and this
is<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> way<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.350> patterns<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.010> we'll<00:00:50.250> look

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
is the way your patterns now we'll look

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.390 
is the way your patterns now we'll look
it's<00:00:51.150> go<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.170> way<00:00:52.200> up<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.130> this

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
it's go all the way up just like this

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.510 
it's go all the way up just like this
and<00:00:53.930> then<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.079> lashing<00:00:55.649> will<00:00:55.890> feather

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and then that lashing will feather

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.690 
and then that lashing will feather
itself<00:00:56.910> off<00:00:57.149> right<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.980> this<00:00:58.980> looks<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
itself off right in here this looks the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.370 
itself off right in here this looks the
best<00:00:59.880> this<00:01:00.180> means<00:01:00.450> you<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.200> you're

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
best this means you know what you're

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.660 
best this means you know what you're
doing<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:01.739> your<00:01:01.770> metal<00:01:02.130> well<00:01:02.220> you<00:01:02.340> took<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
doing with your metal well you took the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.179 
doing with your metal well you took the
time<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.120> work<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.619> we're<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
time to work it so now we're going to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.459 
time to work it so now we're going to
leave<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.320> show

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
leave from here and I'm going to show

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.630 
leave from here and I'm going to show
you<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> next<00:01:08.009> nail

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.180 

and<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.390> about<00:01:12.570> random<00:01:13.320> variate<00:01:13.770> order<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
and that's about random variate order to

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.490 
and that's about random variate order to
be<00:01:14.310> cut<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.730> half<00:01:14.760> origin<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> time<00:01:16.200> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
be cut in half origin on the time you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.950 
be cut in half origin on the time you
don't<00:01:16.620> want<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.890> course<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.340> go<00:01:17.550> I'm<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.750> try

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
don't want a course you go I'm gonna try

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.340 
don't want a course you go I'm gonna try
it<00:01:19.020> again

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
it again

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.530 
it again
take<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.430> check<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.880> temperature<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
take one check that temperature in the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.680 
take one check that temperature in the
dark<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:22.560> right<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.950> next<00:01:22.980> step<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
dark all right this next step is you

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.680 
dark all right this next step is you
remember<00:01:25.020> our<00:01:25.410> bar<00:01:25.650> ran<00:01:26.520> parallel<00:01:26.970> all<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
remember our bar ran parallel all the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.080 
remember our bar ran parallel all the
way<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.260> this<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.010> is<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.700> all<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
way so this and this is a it's all the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.040 
way so this and this is a it's all the
same<00:01:30.710> now<00:01:31.710> twist<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.970> not<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> fortunate

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
same now twist is not a fortunate

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.090 
same now twist is not a fortunate
pattern<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.160> torque<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:37.100> destroy

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
pattern because you torque and destroy

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.580 
pattern because you torque and destroy
your<00:01:38.550> pattern<00:01:38.910> that<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.229> made<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
your pattern that you have so I made a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.030 
your pattern that you have so I made a
salt<00:01:40.890> cut<00:01:41.190> right<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:42.330> where<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:43.770> wall

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
salt cut right here to where this wall

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.870 
salt cut right here to where this wall
is<00:01:44.340> what's<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.150> my<00:01:45.360> punish<00:01:45.869> crime<00:01:46.170> line

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
is what's gonna be my punish crime line

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.249 
is what's gonna be my punish crime line
and<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.600> gonna<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.960> where<00:01:49.110> my

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and right here it's gonna be where my

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.520 
and right here it's gonna be where my
tang<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.690> give<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.900> a<00:01:52.020> rough<00:01:52.320> idea

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
tang is so just to give you a rough idea

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.190 
tang is so just to give you a rough idea
I'm<00:01:53.250> gonna<00:01:53.490> dip<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.060> acid<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:54.990> look

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I'm gonna dip this in acid we can look

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.900 
I'm gonna dip this in acid we can look
it<00:01:55.350> see<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> pattern<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> look

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
it see what the pattern is going to look

let's see what we got here if I can get
this<00:02:20.459> thing<00:02:20.670> folk<00:02:21.540> focused<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:27.290> hope<00:02:28.290> you

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
can see a little bit of the pattern

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.930 
can see a little bit of the pattern
right<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.299> where<00:02:31.230> our<00:02:31.380> four<00:02:31.620> bars<00:02:31.980> they're

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
right there where our four bars they're

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.910 
right there where our four bars they're
pretty<00:02:33.330> much<00:02:33.450> even<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.230> equal<00:02:35.780> okay<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.350> so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
pretty much even and equal okay and so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.780 
pretty much even and equal okay and so
when<00:02:38.130> we<00:02:38.310> grind<00:02:39.019> all<00:02:40.019> on<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.410> bottom<00:02:41.400> cutting

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
when we grind all on this bottom cutting

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.330 
when we grind all on this bottom cutting
edge<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.450> going<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.810> change<00:02:43.170> from<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.160> back

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
edge it's going to change from the back

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.820 
edge it's going to change from the back
simply<00:02:45.090> because<00:02:45.450> you're<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:45.989> closer<00:02:46.350> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
simply because you're going closer to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.250 
simply because you're going closer to
the<00:02:46.950> center<00:02:47.220> leave<00:02:47.400> your<00:02:47.580> grind<00:02:47.850> okay<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.720> you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
the center leave your grind okay and you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.070 
the center leave your grind okay and you
can<00:02:49.440> see<00:02:49.650> where<00:02:50.010> our<00:02:50.190> four<00:02:50.489> bars<00:02:50.810> roll<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.959> all

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
can see where our four bars roll it all

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.330 
can see where our four bars roll it all
the<00:02:52.110> way<00:02:52.290> up<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.830> looks<00:02:53.070> good<00:02:54.920> yeah<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.130> looks
