00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.290
 very special we are at home with the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.690
 lifelong friends 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.360
 toñín and angel that are going to make us a 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.970
 exquisite dish we have moved to 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.770
 your house because they are very close friends and there I 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 It is very exciting that you make a dish 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:38.100
 which is very good 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.700
 and we crumbs of fantastic shepherd the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.700
 exposition 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.890
 and let's put these succulent crumbs 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.890
 main are 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.420
 good product 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.420
 some little eyes that we will add to the bread 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.830
 and then accompany while you are eating 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.830
 the crumbs with grapes 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:40.470
 sharing by preparing first as 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.470
 be from the previous day 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.690
 You will see that we have put the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.820
 slices already and a few pieces 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.820
 counted let's now make an example 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 here 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.020
 we pick up the bread all this is necessary 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.210
 do it the previous day by mass of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.210
 moisten all night then 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.430
 we cut it into slices 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.130
 then chiquititos first pieces 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.229
 then with the scissors is very practical and 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.650
 making small pieces because then 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.080
 when it is combined with the ham 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.819
 so that I do not want to be fat for 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.750
 put it to be like that and we 've already left 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.250
 contribute 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.200
 and another thing that needs to be done is 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.180
 then the bread cut as it does 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.630
 before it has been cut we put it here in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.660
 this wetland trying to present something 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.840
 so that it transpires well and then 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.590
 in the case we look a little the others 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.590
 they put him 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.300
 so that the wet park that 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.600
 It is very important because in this way 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.440
 that is, about the taste purely of 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.440
 I work a lot of what we do is 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.440
 moisten 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:10.000
 and this we wrap and we turn soft 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.430
 and we leave them 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.430
 well, a few days before doing 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:24.590
 the corresponding lime 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:36.150
 and we hope for the French what 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.150
 we had chosen 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.620
 that the bacon is loosen all the fat 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.440
 which it is the clearest feature Ursa have 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.220
 the option because the ham and the chorizo 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.220
 it's time to throw the bread and 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.220
 entertain us 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.150
 points and now 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.110
 do not 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.819
 we are back and 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.819
 so that there is less 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:53.360
 with three minutes 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.170
 unfortunately all of this is reopened 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.170
 detach a little gauze 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.590
 here I have mixed for what conditions the 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.720
 bread 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.440
 everything from the ground 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.440
 now 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.780
 and then we put the bread and what 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.180
 what we have 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.180
 the most important ingredients 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.039
 well scrambled do not know 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.340
 Now it requires a bit of tranquility 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:34.970
 because this 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.970
 it is a process of well half an hour 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.169
 we have to constantly spin 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:45.029
 to give them because it does not get stained 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.389
 also had formerly been done 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:50.090
 pretty with the classic mud zone what 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.460
 What happens is that every day is more difficult 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.889
 and we have advanced some 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.650
 systems and this one works them so 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:03.699
 so much we followed in it 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.740
 as well as we have finally given 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.889
 turns 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.449
 all the little girls this smells like glory and 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.249
 it really is understood is that of 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.659
 championship 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:21.389
 let's hope it turns out well and if I go to 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.389
 Judging from the smell is very sold 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:28.770
 that more exit lamas of glory and 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.770
 really just back 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.100
 good 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.300
 when they are served on the plate at the table 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.580
 we have to put the grapes and a little bit of 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:53.770
 melon and it is taking spoonful of 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.770
 crumbs grape and melon each 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:03.340
 good friends very good how are you
