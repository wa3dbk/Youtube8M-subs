00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
deep game and it might even be I

if you've seen those pretty famous
web-based<00:01:57.509> games<00:01:58.130> but<00:01:59.130> his<00:01:59.340> version<00:01:59.610> is

mechanically<00:02:00.659> quite<00:02:01.290> different<00:02:01.680> doesn't<00:02:01.920> not

really as deep as the original game
plays<00:02:05.040> very<00:02:05.310> differently<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.990> see

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
plays very differently so you can see

all<00:02:24.230> right<00:02:24.379> so<00:02:24.500> let's<00:02:24.680> talk<00:02:24.799> about<00:02:24.859> why<00:02:25.189> I

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
all right so let's talk about why I

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.699 
all right so let's talk about why I
think<00:02:25.370> this<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.969> a<00:02:26.090> brilliant<00:02:26.540> game<00:02:26.689> and<00:02:27.049> one

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
think this is a brilliant game and one

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.110 
think this is a brilliant game and one
of<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.859> most<00:02:28.010> realistic<00:02:28.340> fighting<00:02:28.879> games

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
of the most realistic fighting games

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.720 
of the most realistic fighting games
I've<00:02:29.390> played<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:30.079> think<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.189> a<00:02:31.310> great<00:02:31.549> example

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
I've played I think it's a great example

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.399 
I've played I think it's a great example
of<00:02:32.239> emergence<00:02:33.400> emergence<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.640> game

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
of emergence emergence in the game

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.209 
of emergence emergence in the game
trying<00:02:36.409> to<00:02:36.530> think<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.829> simple<00:02:37.099> way<00:02:37.189> to

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:37.219 
trying to think of a simple way to

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.899 
trying to think of a simple way to
explain<00:02:37.400> emergence<00:02:38.799> basically<00:02:39.909> complex

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
explain emergence basically complex

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.839 
explain emergence basically complex
things<00:02:41.469> arising<00:02:42.469> out<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:43.099> few<00:02:43.519> simple

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
things a few simple elements if you

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.910 
things a few simple elements if you
think<00:02:46.579> of<00:02:46.670> something<00:02:46.909> like<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.180> fractal<00:02:47.719> with

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
think of something like a fractal with

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.819 
think of something like a fractal with
fractals<00:02:48.920> really<00:02:49.819> complex<00:02:50.239> patterns<00:02:50.829> arise

fractals really complex patterns arise
out<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.310> extremely<00:02:53.239> simple<00:02:53.840> formulas<00:02:54.620> if<00:02:55.310> you

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
out of extremely simple formulas if you

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.890 
out of extremely simple formulas if you
look<00:02:55.669> at<00:02:55.760> something<00:02:56.060> like<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.359> Mandelbrot

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
look at something like the Mandelbrot

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.670 
look at something like the Mandelbrot
set<00:02:57.849> I'll<00:02:58.849> I'll<00:02:59.180> put<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.780> formula<00:03:00.349> up<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:00.590> the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
screen you can't look at the formula and

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.640 
screen you can't look at the formula and
say<00:03:04.099> okay<00:03:04.519> there's<00:03:04.669> going<00:03:04.849> to<00:03:04.909> be<00:03:05.000> this<00:03:05.209> blobby

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
say okay there's going to be this blobby

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.110 
say okay there's going to be this blobby
shape<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.040> know<00:03:07.159> you<00:03:07.519> could<00:03:07.669> never<00:03:07.819> you

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
shape in it you know you could never you

can't imagine it you can't draw it it
can't<00:03:10.310> be<00:03:10.430> predicted<00:03:10.819> it's<00:03:11.150> too<00:03:11.299> complicated

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
can't be predicted it's too complicated

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.229 
can't be predicted it's too complicated
you<00:03:12.500> just<00:03:12.739> have<00:03:12.919> to<00:03:13.099> run<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.549> equation<00:03:14.120> in<00:03:14.180> the

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
you just have to run the equation in the

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.420 
you just have to run the equation in the
computer<00:03:14.689> and<00:03:14.900> see<00:03:15.200> where<00:03:15.349> it<00:03:15.439> goes<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.219> how

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
computer and see where it goes so how

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.459 
computer and see where it goes so how
does<00:03:16.489> this<00:03:16.700> apply<00:03:16.939> to<00:03:17.030> martial<00:03:17.900> arts<00:03:18.169> and<00:03:18.319> the

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:18.469 
does this apply to martial arts and the

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:20.229 
does this apply to martial arts and the
fight<00:03:18.650> of<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.829> sumo<00:03:19.129> Hopper's<00:03:19.459> well<00:03:20.060> much

fight of the sumo Hopper's well much

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.409 
fight of the sumo Hopper's well much
like<00:03:20.560> when<00:03:21.560> we<00:03:21.650> look<00:03:21.799> at<00:03:21.980> an<00:03:22.129> equation<00:03:22.669> we

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
like when we look at an equation we

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.869 
like when we look at an equation we
can't<00:03:23.659> predict<00:03:23.989> how<00:03:24.169> the<00:03:24.769> fractal<00:03:25.549> is<00:03:25.639> going

without<00:03:30.139> testing<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.190> there<00:03:31.639> are<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:31.940> many

without testing it there are so many

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.390 
without testing it there are so many
elements<00:03:32.269> it's<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.079> physically<00:03:33.650> complicated

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
elements it's so physically complicated

that you can win and this is why I think

that you can win and this is why I think
in<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:40.590> really<00:05:41.160> abstract<00:05:41.520> way<00:05:41.970> an<00:05:42.300> abstract

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
in a really abstract way an abstract

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
realistic fighting game that I that I

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.030 
realistic fighting game that I that I
can<00:05:51.240> that<00:05:51.570> I<00:05:51.600> know<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.200> only<00:05:52.800> for<00:05:52.950> those

practically non-existent and the reason

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.780 
practically non-existent and the reason
other<00:05:58.410> people<00:05:58.890> haven't<00:05:59.220> really<00:05:59.460> tried<00:05:59.700> to

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
other people haven't really tried to

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.210 
other people haven't really tried to
make<00:05:59.910> a<00:06:00.060> game<00:06:00.330> in<00:06:00.630> this<00:06:00.900> fashion<00:06:01.410> is<00:06:01.590> because

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
make a game in this fashion is because

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.120 
make a game in this fashion is because
this<00:06:02.400> game<00:06:02.580> is<00:06:02.610> so<00:06:02.910> simple<00:06:03.210> that<00:06:03.710> it<00:06:04.710> works

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
this game is so simple that it works

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.510 
this game is so simple that it works
this<00:06:05.730> kind<00:06:06.090> of<00:06:06.210> emergent<00:06:07.110> gameplay<00:06:07.260> works<00:06:07.830> I'm

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
this kind of emergent gameplay works I'm

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.340 
this kind of emergent gameplay works I'm
really<00:06:08.910> not<00:06:09.000> sure<00:06:09.060> how<00:06:09.540> well<00:06:09.870> this<00:06:10.020> would<00:06:10.200> work

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
really not sure how well this would work

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.700 
really not sure how well this would work
as<00:06:10.650> a<00:06:10.680> modern<00:06:11.490> fully<00:06:12.000> fledged<00:06:12.410> fighting<00:06:13.410> sim

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
as a modern fully fledged fighting sim

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.400 
as a modern fully fledged fighting sim
if<00:06:14.280> someone<00:06:14.640> tried<00:06:14.820> to<00:06:14.910> make<00:06:15.090> this<00:06:15.240> in<00:06:15.750> a<00:06:16.260> way

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
if someone tried to make this in a way

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.380 
if someone tried to make this in a way
that<00:06:16.440> was<00:06:16.770> a<00:06:16.980> lot<00:06:17.520> more<00:06:17.550> realistic<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:18.270> you

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
that was a lot more realistic and you

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.180 
that was a lot more realistic and you
could<00:06:18.540> control<00:06:19.020> all<00:06:19.230> the<00:06:19.350> limbs<00:06:19.590> or<00:06:19.830> something

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
could control all the limbs or something

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.060 
could control all the limbs or something
like<00:06:20.310> that<00:06:20.580> I<00:06:21.260> don't<00:06:22.260> really<00:06:22.560> know<00:06:22.680> how<00:06:22.890> that

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
like that I don't really know how that

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.970 
like that I don't really know how that
would<00:06:23.160> work<00:06:23.220> but<00:06:24.210> still<00:06:24.510> this<00:06:25.440> game<00:06:25.650> is<00:06:25.800> out

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
would work but still this game is out

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.220 
would work but still this game is out
there<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:26.820> can<00:06:27.030> you<00:06:27.390> can<00:06:27.540> download<00:06:27.780> it<00:06:28.110> I

there you can you can download it I

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.090 
there you can you can download it I
might<00:06:28.380> put<00:06:28.590> a<00:06:28.620> link<00:06:28.800> in<00:06:28.920> the<00:06:28.980> description
