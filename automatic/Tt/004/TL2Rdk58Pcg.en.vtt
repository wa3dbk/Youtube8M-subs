00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
happen we've been trying to so we've

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.359 
happen we've been trying to so we've
been<00:01:43.530> trying<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> last

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
been trying to do that for the last

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.330 
been trying to do that for the last
couple<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.790> weeks<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:46.250> unfortunately<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
couple of weeks and unfortunately the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.950 
couple of weeks and unfortunately the
stuff<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.759> worked<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.180> during<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> week<00:01:48.689> paid

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
stuff we worked on during the week paid

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.830 
stuff we worked on during the week paid
off<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.850> think<00:01:50.850> their<00:01:51.030> backs<00:01:51.270> are<00:01:51.509> about<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
off I think their backs are about the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.270 
off I think their backs are about the
same<00:01:51.960> size<00:01:52.020> as<00:01:52.380> their<00:01:52.500> forwards<00:01:52.890> anyway<00:01:53.220> so

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
same size as their forwards anyway so

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490 
same size as their forwards anyway so
it's<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.630> much<00:01:54.810> choice<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> run

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
it's kind of not much choice but to run

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.770 
it's kind of not much choice but to run
into<00:01:55.770> big<00:01:56.009> units<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.210> pleasing<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
