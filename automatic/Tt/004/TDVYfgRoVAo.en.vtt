but<00:00:02.580> there<00:00:02.790> are<00:00:02.909> some<00:00:03.090> problems<00:00:03.629> with<00:00:03.840> this

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
but there are some problems with this

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.869 
but there are some problems with this
there<00:00:04.290> are<00:00:04.410> some<00:00:04.589> fatal<00:00:04.980> flaws<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:05.790> this

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
there are some fatal flaws in this

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.480 
there are some fatal flaws in this
approach<00:00:06.529> with<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.649> flat<00:00:07.919> screen<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
approach with the flat screen in the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.490 
approach with the flat screen in the
front<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:09.450> notice<00:00:09.719> it's<00:00:09.870> not<00:00:09.929> very<00:00:10.230> flat

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
front you notice it's not very flat

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.200 
front you notice it's not very flat
anymore<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.070> because<00:00:11.370> we've<00:00:11.519> glommed<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
anymore is it because we've glommed the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.789 
anymore is it because we've glommed the
back<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:12.960> all<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> rest<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.590> stuff

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
back on with all the rest of the stuff

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.700 
back on with all the rest of the stuff
there's<00:00:14.009> nothing<00:00:14.340> flat<00:00:14.610> about<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:15.030> computer

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
there's nothing flat about this computer

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.620 
there's nothing flat about this computer
but<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> other<00:00:16.949> problems<00:00:17.310> go<00:00:17.400> deeper<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:18.480> have

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
but the other problems go deeper we have

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.570 
but the other problems go deeper we have
to<00:00:18.750> put<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> logic<00:00:19.439> board<00:00:19.650> parallel<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
to put the logic board parallel to the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.189 
to put the logic board parallel to the
display<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.210> back<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.660> which<00:00:21.930> means<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
display and back of it which means the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.769 
display and back of it which means the
connectors<00:00:22.710> come<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.880> side<00:00:24.119> making

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
connectors come out on the side making

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.420 
connectors come out on the side making
the<00:00:24.990> worst<00:00:25.170> kind<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.560> cable<00:00:25.890> mess<00:00:26.070> right<00:00:26.310> in

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the worst kind of cable mess right in

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.240 
the worst kind of cable mess right in
front<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.670> your<00:00:26.760> eyes<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.560> even<00:00:28.560> worse<00:00:28.769> we

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
front of your eyes and even worse we

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.370 
front of your eyes and even worse we
have<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.670> turn<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.090> drives<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> side<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
have to turn the drives on the side and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.560 
have to turn the drives on the side and
in<00:00:32.009> particular<00:00:32.610> with<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.790> optical<00:00:33.329> drives

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
in particular with the optical drives

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.180 
in particular with the optical drives
they<00:00:33.780> can't<00:00:34.050> run<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.380> full<00:00:34.530> speed<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> side

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
they can't run at full speed on the side

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.860 
they can't run at full speed on the side
we<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> slow<00:00:35.760> them<00:00:35.940> way<00:00:36.210> down<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
we have to slow them way down the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.630 
we have to slow them way down the
performance<00:00:37.380> goes<00:00:37.559> way<00:00:37.980> down<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> turn

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
performance goes way down when you turn

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.340 
performance goes way down when you turn
them<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.820> their<00:00:38.969> sides<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.960> could<00:00:40.110> never

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
them on their sides and you could never

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.369 
them on their sides and you could never
fit<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> SuperDrive<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:42.780> this

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
fit a SuperDrive in here so this

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.369 
fit a SuperDrive in here so this
approach<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.219> far<00:00:45.000> less<00:00:45.390> than<00:00:45.690> great<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.140> we

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
approach is far less than great and we

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.420 
approach is far less than great and we
rejected<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.539> then<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.719> had<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.350> big<00:00:50.250> idea

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
rejected it and then we had a big idea

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.590 
rejected it and then we had a big idea
and<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:52.230> big<00:00:52.469> idea<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.699> rather<00:00:54.329> than

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and the big idea was that rather than

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.650 
and the big idea was that rather than
glom<00:00:54.989> these<00:00:55.320> things<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:55.829> together<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.699> ruin

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
glom these things all together and ruin

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.290 
glom these things all together and ruin
them<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.559> lower<00:00:59.100> performance<00:00:59.730> computer

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
them all a lower performance computer

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.150 
them all a lower performance computer
and<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:01.020> flat<00:01:01.289> screen<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.710> isn't<00:01:01.949> flat

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and a flat screen that isn't flat

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.119 
and a flat screen that isn't flat
anymore<00:01:02.750> why<00:01:03.750> don't<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.019> let<00:01:04.170> each<00:01:04.439> element<00:01:05.010> be

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
anymore why don't we let each element be

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.990 
anymore why don't we let each element be
true<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.790> itself<00:01:06.740> if<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> screen<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.310> flat<00:01:08.700> let

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
true to itself if the screen is flat let

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.670 
true to itself if the screen is flat let
it<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.270> flat<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> computer<00:01:10.229> wants<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.590> be

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it be flat if the computer wants to be

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.100 
it be flat if the computer wants to be
horizontal<00:01:10.950> let<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.760> horizontal<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> we

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
horizontal let it be horizontal and we

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.070 
horizontal let it be horizontal and we
came<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.619> radically<00:01:14.220> new<00:01:14.250> design<00:01:15.080> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
came up with a radically new design it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.340 
came up with a radically new design it
is<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> technical<00:01:17.100> tour<00:01:17.640> de<00:01:17.880> force

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350

have<00:01:20.909> outdone<00:01:21.270> themselves<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.909> it's

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
have outdone themselves this time it's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090 
have outdone themselves this time it's

we've ever built and I would dare say

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.710

thing<00:02:38.760> take<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> look<00:02:39.970> at<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.090> screen<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.510> I

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
thing take a look at the screen and I

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.990 
thing take a look at the screen and I
can<00:02:40.720> move<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.290> screen<00:02:41.620> with<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.760> touch

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
can move the screen with just a touch

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.590 
can move the screen with just a touch
and<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:47.410> incredible<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.220> notice<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.450> the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
and that incredible and notice that the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.680 
and that incredible and notice that the
display<00:02:49.840> stays<00:02:50.320> parallel<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.330> could

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
display stays parallel but I could

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.900 
display stays parallel but I could
change<00:02:52.900> its<00:02:53.110> angle<00:02:53.319> of<00:02:53.590> course<00:02:53.770> as<00:02:54.040> well<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.880> I

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
change its angle of course as well so I

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.270 
change its angle of course as well so I
can<00:02:55.180> move<00:02:55.360> this<00:02:55.570> with<00:02:55.780> just<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.110> touch<00:02:56.350> anywhere

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280

the base and to give you a feeling for

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.530 
the base and to give you a feeling for
how<00:03:46.989> small<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.010> yeah<00:03:48.940> I've<00:03:49.060> got<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.209> jewel

[Applause]

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.550 

so<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.240> new<00:04:08.390> iMac<00:04:08.860> again

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:25.010 

it's<00:04:14.560> really<00:04:14.890> wonderful<00:04:15.840> okay

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.920 

so<00:04:26.240> our<00:04:27.319> big<00:04:28.319> idea<00:04:28.849> let<00:04:29.849> each<00:04:30.090> element<00:04:30.630> be<00:04:30.720> true

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
so our big idea let each element be true

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.650 
so our big idea let each element be true
to<00:04:31.050> itself<00:04:31.349> so<00:04:31.710> let's<00:04:32.370> take<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.699> base<00:04:32.910> the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
to itself so let's take the base the

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.050 
to itself so let's take the base the
base<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:33.960> only<00:04:34.410> ten<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:35.190> half<00:04:35.400> inches<00:04:35.849> in

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
base is only ten and a half inches in

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.140 
base is only ten and a half inches in
diameter<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.870> yet<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.979> that<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.819> entire

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
diameter and yet in that is the entire

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.839 
diameter and yet in that is the entire
computer<00:04:39.630> both<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.740> drives<00:04:41.069> including<00:04:41.460> a

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
computer both the drives including a

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.170 
computer both the drives including a
full-size<00:04:42.180> super<00:04:43.110> drive<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.970> power

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
full-size super drive and the power

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.320 
full-size super drive and the power
supply<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:47.160> drives<00:04:47.490> come<00:04:47.759> out<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.060> tray<00:04:48.270> in

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
supply the drives come out the tray in

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.490 
supply the drives come out the tray in
the<00:04:48.449> front<00:04:49.430> like<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:50.639> and<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:52.080> connectors

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
the front like that and the connectors

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.170 
the front like that and the connectors
again<00:04:52.770> are<00:04:52.889> all<00:04:52.919> in<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.250> back<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:53.669> your<00:04:53.789> cables

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
again are all in the back so your cables

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.430 
again are all in the back so your cables
are<00:04:54.300> routed<00:04:54.419> off<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.810> back<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.020> your<00:04:55.199> desk

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
are routed off the back of your desk

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.189 
are routed off the back of your desk
making<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.250> as<00:04:56.340> neat<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:56.699> clean<00:04:56.849> as<00:04:57.090> possible

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
your iMac we thought of that too you

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.409 
your iMac we thought of that too you
just<00:05:01.500> flip<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:01.919> up<00:05:02.039> there's<00:05:02.729> four<00:05:02.940> screws<00:05:03.090> to

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
just flip it up there's four screws to

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.490 
just flip it up there's four screws to
pop<00:05:03.599> off<00:05:03.810> isn't<00:05:04.139> that<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.319> most<00:05:04.409> beautiful
