00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
so we're rolling in this port which is

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.509 
so we're rolling in this port which is
just<00:03:25.260> one<00:03:25.470> port<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:26.329> very<00:03:27.329> nice<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:32.370> yeah

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
just one port is very nice and so yeah

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.240 
just one port is very nice and so yeah
there's<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.940> hard<00:03:33.150> drive<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.739> can<00:03:34.739> compare<00:03:35.099> it

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
there's the hard drive I can compare it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.500 
there's the hard drive I can compare it
to<00:03:35.370> my<00:03:35.489> phone<00:03:35.760> actually<00:03:35.940> if<00:03:36.239> you'll<00:03:36.410> get<00:03:37.410> Scott

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.059 

if<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.660> knew<00:03:42.810> where<00:03:42.959> my<00:03:42.989> phone<00:03:43.230> was<00:03:43.410> right<00:03:43.829> there

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
if I knew where my phone was right there

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.199 
if I knew where my phone was right there
is<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.269> Nokia<00:03:45.750> Lumia<00:03:45.959> 720<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.489> as<00:03:48.060> you

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
is this is a Nokia Lumia 720 and as you

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.670 
is this is a Nokia Lumia 720 and as you
can<00:03:48.359> see<00:03:48.829> it's<00:03:50.599> not<00:03:51.599> much<00:03:52.079> bigger<00:03:52.349> than<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
can see it's not much bigger than that

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.080 
can see it's not much bigger than that
to<00:03:53.069> be<00:03:53.160> honest<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.599> is<00:03:54.599> pretty<00:03:55.760> I'd<00:03:56.760> say<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
to be honest it is pretty I'd say the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.819 
to be honest it is pretty I'd say the
hard<00:03:57.299> drives<00:03:57.510> heavier<00:03:57.870> they're<00:03:58.049> not<00:03:58.260> hot<00:03:58.440> hot

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
hard drives heavier they're not hot hot

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.660 
hard drives heavier they're not hot hot
phone<00:03:59.180> but<00:04:00.180> it's<00:04:00.450> not<00:04:00.599> very<00:04:00.810> much<00:04:01.019> heavier<00:04:01.670> so

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
phone but it's not very much heavier so

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.229 
phone but it's not very much heavier so
yeah<00:04:02.790> then<00:04:03.450> we<00:04:03.599> come<00:04:03.870> with<00:04:04.169> a<00:04:05.900> USB<00:04:06.900> 3<00:04:07.560> cable

is same size in like height and their

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.550 
is same size in like height and their
exact<00:05:58.990> same<00:05:59.290> in<00:05:59.500> width<00:05:59.770> as<00:06:00.070> well<00:06:01.380> well<00:06:02.380> not

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
exact same in width as well well not

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.870 
exact same in width as well well not
width<00:06:02.800> but<00:06:03.040> um<00:06:04.410> yeah<00:06:05.410> but<00:06:06.220> not<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.550> actual
