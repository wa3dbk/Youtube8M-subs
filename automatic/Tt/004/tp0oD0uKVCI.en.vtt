00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
and the the Hope has always been that we

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.690 
and the the Hope has always been that we
could<00:00:12.269> find<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.660> way<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.900> do<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.429> less

invasive way and what's always been
difficult<00:00:18.199> about<00:00:19.730> laparoscopy<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:21.300> fibroid

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
difficult about laparoscopy for fibroid

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.620 
difficult about laparoscopy for fibroid
removal<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.400> requires<00:00:23.850> lots<00:00:24.359> of

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
removal is that it requires lots of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.230 
removal is that it requires lots of
stitches<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.830> placed<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> uterus<00:00:26.939> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
stitches to be placed in the uterus and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.500 
stitches to be placed in the uterus and
stitches<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:27.990> hard<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:29.510> laparoscopy

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
stitches are hard to do with laparoscopy

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.780 
stitches are hard to do with laparoscopy
but<00:00:31.439> there's<00:00:31.679> an<00:00:31.859> amazing<00:00:32.460> piece<00:00:32.759> of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.639 
is used in a number of specialties
including<00:00:40.170> gynecology<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.200> a

means of performing laparoscopy as

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.590 
means of performing laparoscopy as
though<00:00:48.000> your<00:00:48.770> hands<00:00:49.770> were<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.000> end<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
though your hands were at the end of the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.049 
though your hands were at the end of the
instruments<00:00:52.350> rather<00:00:52.590> than<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
instruments rather than just the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.270 
instruments rather than just the
straight<00:00:54.780> instruments<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.829> usually<00:00:56.039> use

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
straight instruments that we usually use

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.270 
straight instruments that we usually use
for<00:00:58.039> laparoscopy<00:00:59.039> so<00:01:00.079> like<00:01:01.079> laparoscopy<00:01:02.039> we

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
for laparoscopy so like laparoscopy we

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
for laparoscopy so like laparoscopy we
make<00:01:02.489> small<00:01:02.820> incisions<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> abdomen<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
make small incisions in the abdomen and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.100 
make small incisions in the abdomen and
put<00:01:05.100> instruments<00:01:05.460> through<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:06.930> we

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
put instruments through but then we

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.460 
put instruments through but then we
attach<00:01:07.470> those<00:01:07.770> instrument<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.880> robotic<00:01:09.810> arms

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
attach those instrument to robotic arms

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.950 
attach those instrument to robotic arms

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
attaches to these instruments and then I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.760 
attaches to these instruments and then I
break<00:01:17.220> scrub<00:01:17.700> I'm<00:01:18.479> no<00:01:18.780> longer<00:01:18.810> scrubbed<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.619> I

break scrub I'm no longer scrubbed in I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.310 
break scrub I'm no longer scrubbed in I
go<00:01:19.950> over<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> console<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.659> corner<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
go over to a console in the corner of a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
room corner of the operating room and I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
room corner of the operating room and I
look<00:01:25.259> into<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:26.119> 3d<00:01:27.119> video<00:01:27.900> console<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.369> put

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
look into a 3d video console and I put

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.780 
look into a 3d video console and I put
little<00:01:29.820> velcro<00:01:30.290> clips<00:01:31.290> around<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:32.159> fingers

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
little velcro clips around my fingers

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
little velcro clips around my fingers
and<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:34.280> begin<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.490> move<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:36.090> hands<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.920> was

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
and I begin to move my hands like I was

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700 
and I begin to move my hands like I was
operating<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.210> instruments<00:01:39.990> inside<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
operating and the instruments inside the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
operating and the instruments inside the
patient's<00:01:41.189> body<00:01:41.340> moves<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.720> my<00:01:42.960> hands<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
patient's body moves like my hands and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.179 
patient's body moves like my hands and
so<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.729> instruments<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:46.110> work<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.950> my

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
so the instruments can work just like my

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.460 
so the instruments can work just like my
hands<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.180> wrists<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.310> pick<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
hands and wrists so that I can pick up a

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.770 
hands and wrists so that I can pick up a
needle<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.740> turn<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.729> put<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.149> stitches

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
needle and turn it and put the stitches

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.450 
needle and turn it and put the stitches
in<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:55.680> using<00:01:55.829> an<00:01:56.250> instrument

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
in just like I was using an instrument

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.910 
in just like I was using an instrument
in<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:57.030> hand<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.719> that's<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.710> been

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
in my hand and that's really been

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.550 
in my hand and that's really been
revolutionary<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.570> laparoscopic

it's still very time-consuming and so if

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.899 
it's still very time-consuming and so if
she<00:02:31.250> has<00:02:31.719> five<00:02:32.719> or<00:02:33.230> ten<00:02:33.620> fibroids<00:02:34.189> it's<00:02:34.459> it's

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
she has five or ten fibroids it's it's

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.869 
she has five or ten fibroids it's it's
not<00:02:35.239> going<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.659> be<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.920> right<00:02:37.069> procedure<00:02:37.549> for

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
not going to be the right procedure for

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.539 
not going to be the right procedure for
her<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.719> for<00:02:38.750> some<00:02:39.139> women<00:02:39.439> who<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:39.829> just<00:02:40.129> one

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
her but for some women who have just one

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.300 
her but for some women who have just one
big<00:02:40.849> fibroid<00:02:41.480> or<00:02:41.840> two<00:02:42.200> or<00:02:42.349> three<00:02:42.379> fibroids<00:02:43.069> it

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
big fibroid or two or three fibroids it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.500 
big fibroid or two or three fibroids it
can<00:02:43.549> it<00:02:43.849> can<00:02:43.909> really<00:02:44.269> be<00:02:44.389> a<00:02:45.819> great<00:02:46.819> advancement

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
can it can really be a great advancement

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.649 
can it can really be a great advancement
for<00:02:47.540> her<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.129> started<00:02:49.129> using<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.700> about<00:02:50.209> two

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
for her I started using it about two

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.520 
for her I started using it about two
years<00:02:50.689> ago<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:53.060> da<00:02:53.239> Vinci<00:02:53.569> robot<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.260> used

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
years ago and the da Vinci robot is used

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.349 
years ago and the da Vinci robot is used
extensively<00:02:55.010> in<00:02:56.200> certain<00:02:57.200> specialties<00:02:58.359> most

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
extensively in certain specialties most

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.129 
extensively in certain specialties most
specifically<00:02:59.870> for<00:03:00.469> urology<00:03:01.569> for<00:03:02.569> prostate

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
specifically for urology for prostate

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.629 
specifically for urology for prostate
cancer<00:03:03.169> and<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:05.120> could<00:03:05.959> see<00:03:06.290> an<00:03:06.650> application

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
cancer and I could see an application

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.750 
cancer and I could see an application
for<00:03:08.150> fibroid<00:03:08.810> treatment<00:03:09.409> and<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:10.219> I<00:03:10.250> went<00:03:10.519> and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
for fibroid treatment and so I went and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.959 
for fibroid treatment and so I went and
learned<00:03:11.180> how<00:03:11.389> to<00:03:11.540> use<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.169> and<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.969> was

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
learned how to use it and and was

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.449 
learned how to use it and and was
mentored<00:03:14.569> and<00:03:15.019> doing<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.409> operation<00:03:15.739> and

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
mentored and doing the operation and

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.319 
mentored and doing the operation and
started<00:03:17.359> doing<00:03:17.629> it<00:03:17.750> about<00:03:17.959> two<00:03:18.229> years<00:03:18.440> ago<00:03:18.560> on

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
started doing it about two years ago on

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.390 
started doing it about two years ago on
it<00:03:20.329> can<00:03:20.750> be<00:03:21.079> used<00:03:21.379> as<00:03:21.709> well<00:03:22.129> for<00:03:22.609> hysterectomy

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
it can be used as well for hysterectomy

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.610 
it can be used as well for hysterectomy
but<00:03:25.400> we<00:03:25.879> can<00:03:26.120> do<00:03:26.329> laparoscopic<00:03:27.290> hysterectomy

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
but we can do laparoscopic hysterectomy

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.969 
but we can do laparoscopic hysterectomy
without<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:28.819> great<00:03:29.120> big<00:03:29.359> machine<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.799> it

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:30.979 
without this great big machine so it

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.520 
without this great big machine so it
really<00:03:31.280> in<00:03:31.669> terms<00:03:32.419> of<00:03:32.659> a<00:03:32.930> big<00:03:33.260> piece<00:03:33.500> of

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
really in terms of a big piece of

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.460 
really in terms of a big piece of
equipment<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.669> technology<00:03:35.359> I<00:03:35.599> use<00:03:35.689> it<00:03:36.109> just

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
equipment and technology I use it just

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.610 
equipment and technology I use it just
for<00:03:36.650> laparoscopic<00:03:37.549> myomectomy<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:39.409> would

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
for laparoscopic myomectomy and I would

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.949 
for laparoscopic myomectomy and I would
say<00:03:39.829> it's<00:03:40.010> just<00:03:40.310> used<00:03:40.549> sporadically<00:03:40.959> across

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
say it's just used sporadically across

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.869 
say it's just used sporadically across
the<00:03:42.229> country<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.680> there<00:03:43.069> aren't<00:03:43.340> more<00:03:43.639> than

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
the country that there aren't more than

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.499 
the country that there aren't more than
maybe<00:03:44.150> 10<00:03:45.019> or<00:03:45.049> 20<00:03:45.470> centers<00:03:45.979> or<00:03:46.370> 10<00:03:47.090> or<00:03:47.239> 20

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:47.509 
maybe 10 or 20 centers or 10 or 20

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.390 
maybe 10 or 20 centers or 10 or 20
