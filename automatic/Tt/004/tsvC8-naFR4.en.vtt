now being that this is all it will not
blow<00:02:43.070> up<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.970> now<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.390> place<00:02:44.510> your<00:02:44.750> TNT

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
dish in there I should actually blow up

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.920 
dish in there I should actually blow up
and<00:02:49.220> basically<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:49.940> wrap<00:02:50.210> this<00:02:50.420> around<00:02:50.480> now

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
and basically just wrap this around now

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.050 
and basically just wrap this around now
again<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.740> should<00:02:52.010> be<00:02:52.160> hidden<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.700> under

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
again this should be hidden like under

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.120 
again this should be hidden like under
the<00:02:53.180> map<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.290> that's<00:02:54.530> something<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:54.920> want<00:02:54.980> to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
the map so that's something you want to

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.950 
the map so that's something you want to
take<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.400> consideration<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:56.510> can<00:02:56.660> dig<00:02:56.780> under

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
take in consideration you can dig under

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.510 
take in consideration you can dig under
the<00:02:56.990> map<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:57.440> hide<00:02:57.680> all<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.220> TNT

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
the map and just hide all this TNT

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.510 
the map and just hide all this TNT
that's<00:02:59.480> behind<00:02:59.870> this<00:03:00.230> but<00:03:00.950> again<00:03:01.040> if<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.370> want

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.410 
let's just cover this up Booya
and<00:03:17.900> now<00:03:18.710> let's<00:03:18.920> cover<00:03:19.160> this<00:03:19.730> up<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.210> would've

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
and now let's cover this up I would've

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.970 
and now let's cover this up I would've
like<00:03:20.630> actually<00:03:20.990> build<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.320> across<00:03:21.620> there<00:03:21.920> I

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
like actually build that across there I

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.560 
like actually build that across there I
like<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.340> do<00:03:22.460> that<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.910> now<00:03:23.240> you<00:03:23.300> want<00:03:23.510> to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
like to do that and now you want to

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.260 
like to do that and now you want to
break<00:03:23.780> these<00:03:23.990> two<00:03:24.290> one<00:03:24.800> two<00:03:25.490> so<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.030> water

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
break these two one two so the water

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.630 
break these two one two so the water
should<00:03:26.510> not<00:03:26.570> flow<00:03:27.140> down<00:03:27.380> so<00:03:28.190> let's<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:28.490> build

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
should not flow down so let's just build

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.980 
should not flow down so let's just build
across<00:03:29.000> here<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:31.090> there<00:03:32.090> we<00:03:32.210> have<00:03:32.360> it<00:03:32.390> so

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
across here and there we have it so

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.140 
across here and there we have it so
that's<00:03:33.350> exactly<00:03:33.710> what<00:03:33.890> we<00:03:34.100> have<00:03:34.250> now<00:03:34.550> again

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
that's exactly what we have now again

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.330 
that's exactly what we have now again
this<00:03:35.300> tnt<00:03:35.690> should<00:03:35.930> be<00:03:36.020> under<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.260> map<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:37.220> now

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
this tnt should be under the map so now

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.710 
this tnt should be under the map so now
we<00:03:37.400> have<00:03:37.640> our<00:03:37.730> music<00:03:38.060> disc<00:03:38.240> so<00:03:38.420> once<00:03:38.600> we<00:03:38.690> put

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
we have our music disc so once we put

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.570 
we have our music disc so once we put
that<00:03:38.900> in<00:03:39.200> there<00:03:39.440> boo-yeah

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
that in there boo-yeah

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.880 
that in there boo-yeah
and<00:03:40.820> we<00:03:41.270> started<00:03:41.540> jamming<00:03:42.050> we<00:03:42.500> hear<00:03:42.740> a<00:03:42.770> little

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890
