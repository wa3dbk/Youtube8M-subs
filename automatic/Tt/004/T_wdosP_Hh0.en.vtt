00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
how we get started and when most people

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.240 
how we get started and when most people
think<00:00:15.839> about<00:00:15.960> building<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.410> crash<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
think about building a crash this is the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.680 
think about building a crash this is the
part<00:00:17.460> they<00:00:17.670> think<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:18.000> they<00:00:18.270> miss<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
part they think about they miss the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.540 
part they think about they miss the
whole<00:00:18.869> foundation<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.189> kind<00:00:20.460> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
whole foundation and all that kind of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.609 
whole foundation and all that kind of
stuff<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.060> prep<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.260> think<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
stuff and prep so we think the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.070 
stuff and prep so we think the
foundation<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> prep<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.080> important

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
foundation and the prep is as important

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.420 
foundation and the prep is as important
if<00:00:25.170> not<00:00:25.199> more<00:00:25.350> important<00:00:25.859> than<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.070> framing

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
if not more important than the framing

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.400 
if not more important than the framing
this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> framing<00:00:27.869> part<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.320> we'll

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
this is the framing part of it we'll

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.390 
this is the framing part of it we'll
show<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.560> how<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.800> start

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
so we've landed our lumber we've

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.440 
so we've landed our lumber we've
actually<00:00:31.980> split<00:00:32.579> where<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.030> landed<00:00:33.329> our

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
actually split where we landed our

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.080 
actually split where we landed our
lumber<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.500> make<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> easier<00:00:35.130> for<00:00:35.460> our<00:00:35.579> guys<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
lumber to make it easier for our guys to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.970 
lumber to make it easier for our guys to
pull<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> lumber<00:00:36.809> off<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.350> actually<00:00:37.800> try<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
pull the lumber off we actually try and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.920 
pull the lumber off we actually try and
order<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.670> lobia<00:00:39.120> order<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.780> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
and that is the inside of our wall we'll

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.010 
and that is the inside of our wall we'll
be<00:01:08.790> using<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.450> make<00:01:09.600> sure<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
wall when it goes in at Wiggles and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.100 
wall when it goes in at Wiggles and
moves<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.270> bit<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.659> we'll<00:01:12.750> make<00:01:12.930> sure

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
moves a little bit but we'll make sure

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.480 
moves a little bit but we'll make sure
that<00:01:13.229> our<00:01:13.380> wall<00:01:13.560> goes<00:01:13.740> straight<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.159> line

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that our wall goes straight to that line

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.060 
that our wall goes straight to that line
and<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.299> bolt<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.659> down<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.110> those<00:01:16.259> hold

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and we will bolt it down to those hold

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.039 
and we will bolt it down to those hold
downs<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> got<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.970> got<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> nuts

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
in there we'll go right on those bolts

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.149 
in there we'll go right on those bolts
and<00:01:22.080> we're<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> races<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.890> we'll

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490 
show you as we get going so when we
start<00:01:26.970> framing<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.630> first<00:01:27.869> thing<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.290> do

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
start framing the first thing that we do

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.890 
start framing the first thing that we do
is<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.250> start<00:01:29.430> with<00:01:29.520> our<00:01:29.729> plates<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> bottom

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
is we start with our plates are a bottom

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.480 
is we start with our plates are a bottom
plate<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.110> our<00:01:31.380> top<00:01:31.619> plate<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.070> basically<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
plate and our top plate so basically the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.249 
plate and our top plate so basically the
bottom<00:01:32.880> board<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> wall<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.049> top

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
bottom board of the wall and the top

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.380 
bottom board of the wall and the top
board<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> wall<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:36.000> those<00:01:36.119> together

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
board of the wall we put those together

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.810 
board of the wall we put those together
we<00:01:37.259> mark<00:01:37.560> where<00:01:37.829> our<00:01:37.950> studs<00:01:38.280> are<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> go

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
we mark where our studs are going to go

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
we mark where our studs are going to go
taking<00:01:39.450> into<00:01:39.810> account<00:01:39.840> where<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> windows

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
taking into account where the windows

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.620 
taking into account where the windows
and<00:01:41.220> doors<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.640> go<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.000> wall<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.420> mark

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and doors will go in that wall we mark

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.539 
and doors will go in that wall we mark
them<00:01:42.689> with<00:01:42.840> X's<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.070> when<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.430> them

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
them with X's so when we have them

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.590 
them with X's so when we have them
together<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.090> they're<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.360> exact

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
together we know they're in the exact

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
together we know they're in the exact
same<00:01:45.780> spot<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.320> split<00:01:46.560> them<00:01:46.740> apart<00:01:46.799> show

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
same spot then we split them apart show

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:56.880 
same spot then we split them apart show
you<00:01:47.670> how<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.850> looks<00:01:47.880> marked<00:01:48.299> together

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.630 

you<00:01:57.890> can<00:01:58.070> see<00:01:58.280> here<00:01:58.520> we've<00:01:58.640> marked<00:01:58.909> this<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:01.430> X

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
you can see here we've marked this the X

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.640 
you can see here we've marked this the X
is<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.030> size<00:02:02.210> of<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.450> stud<00:02:02.659> goes<00:02:02.870> on<00:02:03.050> then<00:02:03.530> we

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
is the size of the stud goes on then we

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.609 
is the size of the stud goes on then we
split<00:02:03.920> those<00:02:04.040> apart<00:02:04.430> like<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:05.630> one<00:02:06.409> there

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
split those apart like this one there

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.300 
split those apart like this one there
one<00:02:07.340> here<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:08.270> same<00:02:08.479> X's<00:02:09.009> let<00:02:10.009> me<00:02:10.100> start

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
one here the same X's let me start

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.930 
one here the same X's let me start
building<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.610> wall<00:02:15.520> are<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.640> going<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.820> use

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
building the wall are you going to use

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.790 
building the wall are you going to use
2x6<00:02:17.570> construction<00:02:17.630> here<00:02:18.290> because<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:18.650> is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
2x6 construction here because this is

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.860 
2x6 construction here because this is
going<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.010> be<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.130> workshop<00:02:19.610> at<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.850> garage<00:02:20.150> we

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
going to be a workshop at the garage we

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.060 
going to be a workshop at the garage we
want<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.080> make<00:02:21.200> sure<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:21.440> nice<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.620> warm<00:02:21.950> and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
want to make sure it's nice and warm and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.729 
want to make sure it's nice and warm and
insulate<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.520> inside<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.660> that's<00:02:24.500> how<00:02:24.680> we

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
insulate it inside so that's how we

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.390 
insulate it inside so that's how we
start<00:02:27.010> next<00:02:28.010> step<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.880> stand<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.209> walls
