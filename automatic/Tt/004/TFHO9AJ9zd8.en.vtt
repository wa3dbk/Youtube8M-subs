I have some similar fabric so this is

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.910 
I have some similar fabric so this is
probably<00:00:41.269> close<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.019> three<00:00:42.470> and<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:42.589> half<00:00:42.769> and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
probably close to three and a half and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.479 
probably close to three and a half and
three<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:44.059> half<00:00:44.269> yards<00:00:44.979> so<00:00:45.979> if<00:00:46.129> you<00:00:46.280> were<00:00:46.370> to

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
three and a half yards so if you were to

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.860 
three and a half yards so if you were to
use<00:00:46.670> something<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:47.180> long<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.629> would<00:00:47.750> have

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
use something this long you would have

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.700 
use something this long you would have
to<00:00:48.019> cut<00:00:48.229> it<00:00:48.379> so<00:00:48.829> here<00:00:49.040> I'll<00:00:49.190> show<00:00:49.399> you<00:00:49.540> reaching

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
to cut it so here I'll show you reaching

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.780 
to cut it so here I'll show you reaching
around<00:00:51.710> tying<00:00:53.619> the<00:00:54.619> shoulder<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:55.369> can<00:00:55.640> do

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
around tying the shoulder and you can do

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.549 
around tying the shoulder and you can do
either<00:00:56.030> shoulder<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.629> just<00:00:56.930> wound<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.290> on<00:00:57.439> the

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
either shoulder I just wound it on the

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.280 
either shoulder I just wound it on the
left<00:00:57.769> hand<00:00:58.369> side<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.360> then<00:00:59.720> I<00:00:59.809> just<00:01:00.049> tied<00:01:00.259> it

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
left hand side and then I just tied it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.010 
left hand side and then I just tied it
in<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.619> tie<00:01:03.280> it's<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:04.519> long<00:01:04.820> I<00:01:05.239> would<00:01:05.750> have<00:01:05.900> to

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
in a tie it's so long I would have to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.530 
in a tie it's so long I would have to
cut<00:01:06.259> this<00:01:06.470> piece<00:01:06.829> to<00:01:07.729> use<00:01:07.939> it<00:01:08.180> okay<00:01:10.119> this<00:01:11.119> part

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
cut this piece to use it okay this part

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.609 
cut this piece to use it okay this part
is<00:01:11.930> where<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.680> need<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:13.040> sew<00:01:13.369> down<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:15.259> side

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
is where you need to sew down the side

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.210 
is where you need to sew down the side
seam<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:20.290> whatever<00:01:21.290> side<00:01:21.619> would<00:01:22.100> be

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
seam so whatever side would be

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.050 
seam so whatever side would be
considered<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.840> inside<00:01:23.840> of<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.259> material

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
considered the inside of the material

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.910 
considered the inside of the material
you<00:01:26.060> would<00:01:26.150> have<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.600> flip<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.140> over<00:01:27.260> so<00:01:27.440> the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
you would have to flip it over so the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.830 
you would have to flip it over so the
right<00:01:28.130> size<00:01:28.400> will<00:01:28.670> be<00:01:28.700> together<00:01:29.030> if<00:01:29.630> you're

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
right size will be together if you're

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.560 
right size will be together if you're
familiar<00:01:29.990> with<00:01:30.260> sewing<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:31.220> sew<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:32.330> side

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
familiar with sewing to sew the side

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.960 
familiar with sewing to sew the side
seam<00:01:33.020> down<00:01:33.740> as<00:01:34.040> far<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.460> then<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.790> would

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
seam down as far and then you would

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.500 
seam down as far and then you would
install<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.990> him<00:01:36.290> well<00:01:36.920> cut<00:01:37.700> this<00:01:37.940> piece<00:01:38.240> if

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
install the him well cut this piece if

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.030 
install the him well cut this piece if
we<00:01:38.630> were<00:01:38.750> using<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.200> piece<00:01:39.470> I<00:01:39.650> don't<00:01:39.830> have<00:01:39.920> to
