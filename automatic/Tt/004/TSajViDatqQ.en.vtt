here<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:27.220> MacBook<00:03:28.220> Pro<00:03:30.040> let's<00:03:31.040> take<00:03:31.370> this

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
here it is MacBook Pro let's take this

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:51.009 
here it is MacBook Pro let's take this
off<00:03:33.010> see<00:03:34.010> where<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.310> starts<00:03:34.730> here<00:03:35.000> we<00:03:35.120> go<00:03:50.019> there

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
off see where it starts here we go there

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:59.009 
off see where it starts here we go there
we<00:03:51.170> go<00:03:51.230> there<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:53.570> is<00:03:56.980> there's<00:03:57.980> all<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.280> ports

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
we go there it is there's all the ports

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.949 
we go there it is there's all the ports
MagSafe<00:04:01.570> Ethernet<00:04:04.060> I'm<00:04:05.060> not<00:04:05.239> sure<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.810> guess

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
MagSafe Ethernet I'm not sure I guess

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.229 
MagSafe Ethernet I'm not sure I guess
that's<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.230> firewire<00:04:06.739> right<00:04:07.010> there<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.430> then

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
that's a firewire right there and then

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.970 
that's a firewire right there and then
mini<00:04:08.510> DisplayPort<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.860> two<00:04:10.070> USBs<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:11.329> that

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
mini DisplayPort the two USBs and that

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.160 
mini DisplayPort the two USBs and that
the<00:04:12.980> camera<00:04:13.489> card<00:04:13.790> reader<00:04:14.090> or<00:04:14.180> SD<00:04:14.720> card<00:04:14.989> reader
