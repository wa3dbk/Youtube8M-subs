00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.340
 as well as mexico is many mexico 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.930
 warrior is many warriors starting 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.270
 for gastronomy because they do not eat what 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.550
 same as on tic's side that 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.770
 in acapulco to know what they eat 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.730
 guerrerenses without leaving the df you can 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.730
 come to the chaneques 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:42.850
 we have this looks like a shepherd's spin 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.089
 but since we're going about that not that 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.940
 the shape is inverted is a pine and the 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.690
 preparation of the meat is completely 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.269
 different 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.619
 also the tacos are served with pips and 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.149
 that gives them a unique flavor and texture 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:01.239
 the jokes that the chaneques almost 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.129
 all the dishes are smooth but 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.560
 the enchiladas that normally we 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.180
 we eat bathed in sauce here they serve 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.430
 dry 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.810
 before there were the chaneques of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.150
 that we were missing the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.790
 chilangos then of several things 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.080
 mainly of style tacos 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.810
 equals of the center region we have this 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.850
 the green pozole in the golden tacos and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.130
 drowned and that version we have it 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.470
 also for cottage cheese quesadillas that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.360
 here we go see quesadillas that is 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.360
 practically the same but with cottage cheese 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.369
 and epazote and dipped in a sauce of the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.320
 sauce 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.600
 of these kinds of flavors that are like very 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.180
 particular to issue reason as very 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.320
 flavored very special and there are all 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.090
 contrasts between the peaks or the sweet what 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.009
 that you really eat in the streets of 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.960
 warrior exactly the carat by 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.720
 example on the shores of warrior is very 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.610
 very common to find in the markets 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.319
 the ladies is not very unusual that it is born 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.289
 carat in your home is more for 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.450
 go out to get it hey you have options 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.789
 vegetarian enchiladas de guajillo 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.170
 for example that can be prepared to 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.620
 part of chicken that is the only option 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.840
 let's say this with meat and cheese 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.519
 cottage cheese or jamaica flower that puts 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.050
 adequacy that we already did here in the df 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.300
 for this 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.520
 the decor of the place revolves around 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.950
 one of the most symbolic guerrerenses 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.950
 strong and dear the jaguar 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.100
 pavel's passion for food from his 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.800
 earth is reflected in the service he 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.320
 he always walks around and is willing to 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.480
 explain what each dish is about 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.690
 where does the name of the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.940
 Because it is a name 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.630
 that we liked because of the personality that 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.030
 I gave no to the place 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.610
 Actually, this is a tradition 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.240
 ancestral let's say all of the southeast 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.340
 Mexican Veracruz and Puebla to 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.010
 down without accepting let's say the zones 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.300
 Mayans did not make a lights but this 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.850
 but everything else is the chaneques 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.040
 these as it is it is goblins spirits 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.930
 children who are bullies 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.300
 Diego Milito pranks where you are 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.130
 from chilpancingo guerrero lives here not 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.830
 that you partly opened this place because 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.830
 I missed the food of your homeland 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.470
 girl but let's say it was for 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.210
 share it with everyone else 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.680
 and we thank you all three from 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.020
 those places where you would like to 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.350
 have two stomachs to be able to try 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.380
 more things but good, everything calmly 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.090
 there will be an opportunity to return the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.560
 pozole nothing more on Tuesdays and Thursdays 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.300
 Saturdays but the rest of the 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.850
 you find all the dishes 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.130
 days and when you try them you're going to 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.260
 discover and understand why pavel 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.090
 I missed so much the food of his land 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.090
 that he had to open a restaurant
