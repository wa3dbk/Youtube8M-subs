00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.130
 we have to live more sustainably 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.660
 fossil fuels are not there 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.820
 forever 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.950
 all ingredients are knowledge there 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.510
 skills and there are possibilities 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.910
 enough 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.480
 but there must be people who process 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.499
 he will speed up his solar team 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.329
 eindhoven 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.429
 a team of 22 students from the 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.679
 technical university and we within the 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.570
 make the world a bit more sustainable and in 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.669
 the already show that he is the list 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.399
 and see is possible by family car on 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.199
 to fold solar energy 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.530
 this is where it all happens 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.449
 we make the car together this morning and yes 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.289
 together we are the people of electro 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.750
 nering 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.269
 mechanical engineering computer science and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.370
 will still design and the organization 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.929
 together we work very hard to make sure 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.559
 ensure that we will soon be fantastic 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.559
 betting product 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.510
 2013 we with so sweet in Eindhoven 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.330
 stella put down the world's first 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.680
 family car on solar energy and with that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 participated in the world solar challenge 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.910
 in australia you not only participated 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.910
 but also won 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.240
 we have been super proud of couples since the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.600
 first step in the car of the future 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.790
 the cars generate energy in the future 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.649
 place of energy costs and with the 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.409
 new team go a next step 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.909
 and put this car car 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.909
 end up in your driveway 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.009
 we designed the car so that it 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.340
 even more efficient 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.530
 lighter and more comfortable 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.810
 The car is so efficient that it has more 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.710
 generate energy because it consumes it 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.289
 even with dutch 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.650
 weather conditions also thinks car 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.880
 with you 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.400
 so then make his suggestion for the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.050
 optimal route and then from your agenda and 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.820
 the weather forecast 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.250
 The design is there that have yet to 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.140
 make it stood together for one step 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.690
 by investing in the future 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.950
 in green energy help with our weather 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.950
 to make it a bit more sustainable
