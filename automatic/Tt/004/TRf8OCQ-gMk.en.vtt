quit<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.240> area<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.170> farm<00:01:40.409> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
quit out of this area you can farm this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.649 
quit out of this area you can farm this
chest<00:01:41.189> room<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.700> many<00:01:41.939> times<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.509> want

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
that and there yet like I said a nice

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.320 
that and there yet like I said a nice
little<00:03:09.040> exploit<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.880> don't<00:03:10.090> know<00:03:10.180> why<00:03:10.300> I

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
little exploit so I don't know why I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.630 
little exploit so I don't know why I
never<00:03:10.540> did<00:03:10.870> this<00:03:11.050> as<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> video<00:03:11.440> but<00:03:12.160> like<00:03:12.610> I

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
never did this as a video but like I

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.420 
never did this as a video but like I
said<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.209> my<00:03:13.660> legendary<00:03:14.080> run<00:03:14.350> series<00:03:15.280> I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430
