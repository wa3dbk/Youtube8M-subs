00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
minute things with I mean by other bands

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.360 
minute things with I mean by other bands
and<00:02:48.930> kind<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.500> looked<00:02:49.650> down<00:02:49.860> upon<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
and kind of looked down upon in the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.070 
and kind of looked down upon in the
music<00:02:50.640> industry<00:02:50.700> by<00:02:51.150> labels<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.720> things<00:02:51.870> are

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
music industry by labels and things are

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.259 
music industry by labels and things are
not<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.319> coolest<00:02:52.709> things<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.250> world<00:02:53.400> but

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
not the coolest things in the world but

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.059 
not the coolest things in the world but
I<00:02:54.599> think<00:02:54.989> when<00:02:55.080> we<00:02:55.200> realized<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.769> sort<00:02:55.980> of

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
I think when we realized this sort of

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.979 
I think when we realized this sort of
magnitude<00:02:56.879> without<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.390> right<00:02:57.569> way<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
magnitude without a right way to the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.619 
magnitude without a right way to the
money<00:02:58.170> than<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.920> money<00:02:59.120> the<00:03:00.120> present<00:03:00.510> age

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
money than the money the present age

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.479 
money than the money the present age
yeah<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.379> mean<00:03:01.590> it's<00:03:01.709> such<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.980> such<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> big<00:03:02.400> event

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
yeah I mean it's such a such a big event

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.920 
yeah I mean it's such a such a big event
we<00:03:02.760> thought<00:03:02.940> we'd<00:03:03.060> be<00:03:03.120> stupid<00:03:03.330> not<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.629> do<00:03:03.810> it

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
we thought we'd be stupid not to do it

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.530 
we thought we'd be stupid not to do it
so<00:03:04.590> yeah<00:03:04.709> went<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.640> their<00:03:05.790> final<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.390> Welsh
