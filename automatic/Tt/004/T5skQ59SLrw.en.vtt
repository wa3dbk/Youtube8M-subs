00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.420 
plug in the hill just there it touches
back<00:02:46.730> like<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:48.340> recreate<00:02:49.340> that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
back like so so you can recreate that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.880 
back like so so you can recreate that
scene<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.030> Phantom<00:02:50.390> Menace<00:02:50.420> where<00:02:50.960> it

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.380 
will be one chops Maul's lightsaber in
half<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.810> that's<00:02:56.870> pretty<00:02:57.110> cool<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:58.240> he<00:02:59.240> also

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
half so that's pretty cool and he also

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.700 
half so that's pretty cool and he also
comes<00:02:59.690> with<00:02:59.870> a<00:03:00.310> unlit<00:03:01.310> lightsaber<00:03:02.270> he'll

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
it has to be attached at an angle if

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.430 
it has to be attached at an angle if
anyone's<00:03:13.520> feet<00:03:13.730> out<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> problem<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.540> problem

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
but if anyone's figured out a way in

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.690 
but if anyone's figured out a way in
which<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:18.050> get<00:03:18.140> this<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.530> just<00:03:18.710> hang<00:03:18.890> down<00:03:19.550> the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
which to get this to just hang down the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.120 
which to get this to just hang down the
side<00:03:19.940> without<00:03:20.720> looking<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.230> little<00:03:21.350> bit<00:03:21.530> stupid

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
side without looking a little bit stupid

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.660 
side without looking a little bit stupid
then<00:03:22.370> do<00:03:22.940> let<00:03:23.090> me<00:03:23.240> know<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:27.280> just<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.370> quick<00:03:28.580> bit

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
then do let me know and just a quick bit

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.830 
then do let me know and just a quick bit
of<00:03:28.730> trivia<00:03:28.940> for<00:03:29.210> you<00:03:29.270> if<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.540> do<00:03:29.630> buy<00:03:29.780> this

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
of trivia for you if you do buy this

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.410 
of trivia for you if you do buy this
figure<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.770> bell<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.220> assembled<00:03:31.940> backwards

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
figure the bell is assembled backwards

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.330 
figure the bell is assembled backwards
so<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.840> can<00:03:33.350> just<00:03:33.530> hold<00:03:33.680> on<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.190> just

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
so you can just hold on to that and just

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.430 
so you can just hold on to that and just
swivel<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:34.730> around<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.210> get<00:03:35.990> it<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.200> point<00:03:36.350> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
swivel it around and get it to point the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.060 
swivel it around and get it to point the
right<00:03:36.560> direction<00:03:36.740> as<00:03:37.310> I've<00:03:37.550> done<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:39.890> as<00:03:39.950> I

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
right direction as I've done so as I

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.100 
right direction as I've done so as I
said<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.580> hood<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.030> ribs<00:03:41.270> are<00:03:41.510> removable<00:03:41.840> so

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
said the hood and ribs are removable so

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.390 
said the hood and ribs are removable so
let's<00:03:42.650> do<00:03:42.830> that<00:03:42.980> now<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:46.040> hood<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.250> a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
let's do that now and the hood is a

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.640 
let's do that now and the hood is a
little<00:03:46.640> bit<00:03:46.730> oversized<00:03:47.150> but<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.260> doesn't<00:03:48.560> look

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
little bit oversized but it doesn't look

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.350 
little bit oversized but it doesn't look
too<00:03:48.830> bad<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.040> my<00:03:49.220> opinion<00:03:49.310> should<00:03:50.120> give<00:03:50.240> you<00:03:50.330> a

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
too bad in my opinion should give you a

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.310 
too bad in my opinion should give you a
better<00:03:50.510> look<00:03:50.720> at<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:50.930> there<00:03:51.700> not<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.760> bad<00:03:53.200> put<00:03:54.200> it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
better look at it there not a bad put it

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.250 
better look at it there not a bad put it
all<00:03:54.440> really<00:03:55.330> again<00:03:56.330> it<00:03:56.450> creates<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:56.780> shadowy

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
all really again it creates that shadowy

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.960 
all really again it creates that shadowy

removed and the made out of a very sort
of<00:05:26.980> tatty<00:05:27.910> material<00:05:28.630> very<00:05:28.960> similar<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.620> what

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
of tatty material very similar to what

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.020 
of tatty material very similar to what
we<00:05:30.580> saw<00:05:30.880> on<00:05:31.290> believe<00:05:32.290> it<00:05:32.380> was<00:05:32.470> VX<00:05:32.830> search<00:05:33.160> and

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
we saw on believe it was VX search and

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.000 
we saw on believe it was VX search and
also<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.570> peasant<00:05:35.290> disguise<00:05:35.560> Anakin

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
although it's a little bit lighter so it

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.420 
although it's a little bit lighter so it
does<00:05:37.660> tend<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:38.110> flow<00:05:38.680> a<00:05:38.710> little<00:05:38.889> bit<00:05:39.040> better<00:05:39.190> as

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
does tend to flow a little bit better as

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.510 
does tend to flow a little bit better as
well<00:05:39.580> which<00:05:39.760> is<00:05:39.880> quite<00:05:40.090> cool<00:05:40.560> and<00:05:41.560> onto<00:05:42.430> the
