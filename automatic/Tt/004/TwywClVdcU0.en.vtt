which<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.490> why<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.030> lot<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.509> people<00:01:18.570> kind<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
which is why a lot of people kind of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.380 
which is why a lot of people kind of
hated<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.580> basically<00:01:20.850> wasn't<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
hated it and it basically wasn't a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.390 
hated it and it basically wasn't a
massive<00:01:21.780> jump<00:01:22.020> between<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.799> two<00:01:22.979> different

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
massive jump between the two different

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.310 
massive jump between the two different
games<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.180> theorem<00:01:24.570> why<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> called<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
games now my theorem why I called you to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.020 
games now my theorem why I called you to
ghost<00:01:25.560> didn't<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.220> ahead<00:01:26.340> while<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.820> didn't

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
ghost didn't go ahead while they didn't

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.670 
ghost didn't go ahead while they didn't
go<00:01:27.090> ahead<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.420> making<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.080> basically

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
go ahead with making it is basically

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.140 
go ahead with making it is basically
because<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.040> think<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.579> got<00:01:29.759> some<00:01:29.970> kind<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
because I think they got some kind of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.700 
because I think they got some kind of
information<00:01:30.390> from<00:01:30.900> Sony<00:01:31.229> about<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
information from Sony about the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.010

the new xbox 720 or infinity whatever

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
the new xbox 720 or infinity whatever
that's<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> called<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.170> basically

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that's going to called and basically

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.469 
that's going to called and basically
saying<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.520> probably<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.030> make<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> new

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
saying you probably want to make a new

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
saying you probably want to make a new
game<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.049> next<00:01:40.290> gen<00:01:40.439> consoles<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
game for the next gen consoles and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.289 
game for the next gen consoles and
they're<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.610> release<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
they're going to be release in at the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.749 
they're going to be release in at the
end<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> 2013<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.130> had<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.460> year

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
end of 2013 so then they had that year

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
end of 2013 so then they had that year
where<00:01:44.939> modern<00:01:45.180> warfare<00:01:45.420> 3<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.990> made<00:01:46.200> where

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
where modern warfare 3 was made where

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.530 
where modern warfare 3 was made where
they<00:01:47.070> needed<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> game<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.390> they

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
they needed to make a game but they

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.450 
they needed to make a game but they
wanted<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> start<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.290> brand<00:01:49.619> new<00:01:49.799> brand<00:01:50.220> which

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
wanted to start a brand new brand which

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.280 
wanted to start a brand new brand which
is<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.759> call<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.030> duty<00:01:51.270> ghosts<00:01:51.509> brand<00:01:51.840> for

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
is this call of duty ghosts brand for

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.450 
is this call of duty ghosts brand for
the<00:01:52.350> next<00:01:52.649> gen<00:01:52.799> consoles<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:53.369> they

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the next gen consoles because they

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.800 
the next gen consoles because they
didn't<00:01:53.670> want<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.970> bridging<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.509> gap

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
didn't want to be bridging that gap

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.020 
didn't want to be bridging that gap
between<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.500> two<00:01:55.680> different<00:01:55.979> next<00:01:56.790> gen

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
between the two different next gen

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.120 
between the two different next gen
consoles<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> previous<00:01:58.140> consoles<00:01:58.770> with

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
consoles and the previous consoles with

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.679 
consoles and the previous consoles with
the<00:01:59.310> same<00:01:59.490> brand<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.240> kind<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the same brand because you kind of get a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.240 
the same brand because you kind of get a
different<00:02:01.049> feel<00:02:01.320> because<00:02:01.560> they're<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.040> got<00:02:02.219> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
different feel because they're now got a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.100 
different feel because they're now got a
new<00:02:02.460> engine<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.060> everything<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.570> new<00:02:03.750> engines

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
new engine and everything so new engines

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.149 
new engine and everything so new engines
new<00:02:04.320> consult<00:02:04.710> you're<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> get<00:02:05.100> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
new consult you're going to get a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.130 
new consult you're going to get a
totally<00:02:05.490> different<00:02:05.790> feel<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.180> so

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
totally different feel and so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.779 
totally different feel and so
conveniently<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:07.979> they've<00:02:08.190> got<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> next

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
conveniently now they've got the next

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.850 
conveniently now they've got the next
gen<00:02:08.940> consoles<00:02:09.420> with<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> new<00:02:10.259> engine<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
gen consoles with the new engine and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.530 
gen consoles with the new engine and
they've<00:02:11.220> started<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.550> brand<00:02:11.790> new<00:02:11.940> brand<00:02:12.270> and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
they've started a brand new brand and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.730 
they've started a brand new brand and
that's<00:02:12.690> also<00:02:13.020> why<00:02:13.200> modern<00:02:13.530> war

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
that's also why modern war

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.590 
that's also why modern war
through<00:02:14.100> was<00:02:14.220> basically<00:02:14.580> just<00:02:14.850> an<00:02:15.000> expensive

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
through was basically just an expensive

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.360 
through was basically just an expensive
reskin<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> modern<00:02:16.620> warfare<00:02:16.770> 2<00:02:17.160> there's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
reskin of modern warfare 2 there's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.520 
reskin of modern warfare 2 there's
nothing<00:02:17.760> really<00:02:18.120> new<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.990> game<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.500> way

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
nothing really new to the game the way

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.140 
nothing really new to the game the way
it<00:02:19.740> played<00:02:19.950> or<00:02:20.100> anything<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.550> was<00:02:20.910> just

characters things like that and that was

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.360 
characters things like that and that was
it<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.200> that's<00:02:25.350> why<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> love<00:02:25.800> people<00:02:26.010> kind<00:02:26.310> of

it's been in the pipeline for a damn
long<00:02:33.570> time<00:02:33.870> possibly<00:02:34.350> up<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.560> three<00:02:34.980> years<00:02:35.280> now

that they've had time to think about the

at the making for it get everything
perfectly<00:02:47.550> right<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.030> that's<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.510> lot<00:02:48.690> longer

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
perfectly right and that's a lot longer

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.390 
perfectly right and that's a lot longer
they've<00:02:49.020> actually<00:02:49.170> had<00:02:49.380> for<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.070> modern

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
they've actually had for like modern

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.060 
they've actually had for like modern

for both the black ops game because

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.670 
for both the black ops game because
normally<00:02:54.780> they<00:02:54.840> only<00:02:54.960> have<00:02:55.140> two<00:02:55.410> years

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
normally they only have two years

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.590 
normally they only have two years
between<00:02:56.090> releasing<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.150> game<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.510> then

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
between releasing the game and then

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.240 
between releasing the game and then
releasing<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:58.050> new<00:02:58.080> game<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.620> develop<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.130> and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
releasing a new game to develop it and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.580 
releasing a new game to develop it and
this<00:02:59.400> ecology<00:02:59.970> ghost<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.360> probably<00:03:00.750> possibly

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
this ecology ghost is probably possibly

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.320 
this ecology ghost is probably possibly
already<00:03:01.980> had<00:03:02.130> three<00:03:02.430> years<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:02.940> that's<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.180> lot

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
already had three years so that's a lot

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.850 
already had three years so that's a lot
longer<00:03:03.480> than<00:03:03.690> normal<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:04.350> going<00:03:04.590> back<00:03:04.770> to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
longer than normal and going back to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.530 
longer than normal and going back to
that<00:03:04.890> thing<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.490> media<00:03:05.850> said<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
that thing that the media said that the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.030 
that thing that the media said that the
journalists<00:03:07.050> have<00:03:07.170> said<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:07.770> game

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
journalists have said that this game

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.560 
journalists have said that this game
feels<00:03:08.400> revolutionary<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.390> looks

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
feels revolutionary it looks

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.630 
feels revolutionary it looks
revolutionary<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.320> looks<00:03:10.500> new<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:11.040> think<00:03:11.490> that

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
revolutionary it looks new I think that

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.250 
revolutionary it looks new I think that
is<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.970> reason<00:03:12.150> why<00:03:12.600> with<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.990> combination

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
is the reason why with the combination

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.470 
is the reason why with the combination
of<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.130> next-gen<00:03:14.520> consoles<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.360> new

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
of the next-gen consoles and the new

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.480 
of the next-gen consoles and the new
engine<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.990> going<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.320> feel<00:03:16.500> totally<00:03:16.770> new<00:03:17.250> and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
engine is going to feel totally new and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.860 
engine is going to feel totally new and
if<00:03:17.700> there's<00:03:17.910> one<00:03:18.060> thing<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.360> can<00:03:18.510> back<00:03:18.630> from

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
if there's one thing you can back from

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.630 
if there's one thing you can back from
Finny<00:03:19.170> toward<00:03:19.470> making<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.890> game<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.220> know<00:03:20.460> is

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
Finny toward making a game you know is

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.370 
Finny toward making a game you know is
going<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.910> be<00:03:21.000> controversial<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.290> be

like<00:03:46.710> taking<00:03:47.100> risks<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.520> it's<00:03:47.910> something

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
like taking risks and it's something

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.700 
like taking risks and it's something
that<00:03:48.270> they<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:48.750> do<00:03:48.990> with<00:03:49.170> their<00:03:49.320> games<00:03:49.530> it's

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
that they just do with their games it's

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.140 
that they just do with their games it's
a<00:03:49.770> lot<00:03:49.950> more<00:03:49.980> than<00:03:50.250> can<00:03:50.370> be<00:03:50.400> said<00:03:50.490> with<00:03:50.820> track

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
a lot more than can be said with track

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.390 
a lot more than can be said with track
and<00:03:51.390> their<00:03:51.540> games<00:03:51.750> which<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.590> feel<00:03:52.800> they<00:03:53.190> play

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
and their games which I feel they play

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.340 
and their games which I feel they play
very<00:03:53.430> safe<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:54.270> them<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.690> expect<00:03:55.260> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
very safe with them so expect the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.960 
very safe with them so expect the
unexpected<00:03:55.530> when<00:03:56.160> these<00:03:56.310> journalists<00:03:56.790> say

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
unexpected when these journalists say

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.090 
unexpected when these journalists say
that<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.330> does<00:03:57.660> feel<00:03:57.960> different<00:03:57.990> it<00:03:58.560> feels<00:03:58.590> new

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
that it does feel different it feels new

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.280 
that it does feel different it feels new
it<00:03:59.310> feels<00:03:59.490> fresh<00:03:59.850> it<00:04:00.090> feels<00:04:00.270> good<00:04:00.570> they

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
it feels fresh it feels good they

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.080 
it feels fresh it feels good they
probably<00:04:01.590> aren't<00:04:01.890> line<00:04:02.250> an<00:04:02.490> infinite<00:04:02.910> would

probably aren't line an infinite would

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.310 
probably aren't line an infinite would
probably<00:04:03.450> have<00:04:03.600> done<00:04:03.930> something<00:04:04.290> pretty

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
probably have done something pretty

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.260 
probably have done something pretty
radical<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.190> change<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.670> feel<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.240> game

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
radical to change the feel of the game

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.420 
radical to change the feel of the game
from<00:04:06.930> modern<00:04:07.290> warfare<00:04:07.470> 2<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.160> I'm<00:04:08.220> not

from modern warfare 2 so I'm not

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.100 
from modern warfare 2 so I'm not
expecting<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.150> feel<00:04:09.330> at<00:04:09.480> all<00:04:09.600> like<00:04:09.660> modern

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
expecting it to feel at all like modern

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.590 
expecting it to feel at all like modern
warfare<00:04:10.290> two<00:04:10.680> or<00:04:11.010> maybe<00:04:11.400> cod4<00:04:11.970> I'm<00:04:12.150> expecting

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
warfare two or maybe cod4 I'm expecting

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.820 
warfare two or maybe cod4 I'm expecting
it<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.780> feel<00:04:12.900> like<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.080> bit<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.410> hybrid

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
it to feel like a bit of a hybrid

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.160 
it to feel like a bit of a hybrid
between<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.400> two<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.790> those<00:04:14.940> games<00:04:15.209> but<00:04:15.840> not

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
between the two of those games but not

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.160 
between the two of those games but not
at<00:04:16.560> all<00:04:16.799> similarly<00:04:17.700> linked<00:04:18.120> if<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.930> makes

at all similarly linked if that makes

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.990 
at all similarly linked if that makes
sense<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.890> if<00:04:20.070> we're<00:04:20.220> go<00:04:20.310> for<00:04:20.520> how<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.730> game

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
sense and if we're go for how the game

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.430 
sense and if we're go for how the game
might<00:04:21.180> actually<00:04:21.330> feel<00:04:21.750> then<00:04:21.960> I'm<00:04:22.080> slightly

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
might actually feel then I'm slightly

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.610 
might actually feel then I'm slightly
pushing<00:04:22.830> towards<00:04:23.510> cod4<00:04:24.510> because<00:04:24.870> something

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
pushing towards cod4 because something

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.080 
pushing towards cod4 because something
that<00:04:25.710> I've<00:04:25.770> emphasized<00:04:26.250> in<00:04:26.610> there

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
that I've emphasized in there

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.210 
that I've emphasized in there
official<00:04:27.480> like<00:04:27.660> statement<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.680> summer<00:04:29.130> of

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
official like statement to the summer of

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.189 
official like statement to the summer of
their<00:04:29.490> game<00:04:29.699> basically<00:04:30.000> says<00:04:30.300> delivering<00:04:31.110> a

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
their game basically says delivering a

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.740 
their game basically says delivering a
riveting<00:04:31.620> all<00:04:31.889> new<00:04:32.130> gameplay<00:04:32.669> experience<00:04:33.419> and

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
riveting all new gameplay experience and

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.060 
riveting all new gameplay experience and
you<00:04:33.960> know<00:04:34.080> from<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.380> journalists<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:34.949> we've

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
you know from the journalists that we've

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.320 
you know from the journalists that we've
heard<00:04:35.310> they've<00:04:35.520> said<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:35.820> it's<00:04:36.090> something

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
heard they've said that it's something

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.390 
heard they've said that it's something
new<00:04:36.690> something<00:04:37.199> fresh<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.889> so<00:04:38.220> that

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
new something fresh and so that

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.100 
new something fresh and so that
definitely<00:04:38.639> rules<00:04:39.060> out<00:04:39.210> modern<00:04:39.510> warfare<00:04:39.690> 2

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
definitely rules out modern warfare 2

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.659 
definitely rules out modern warfare 2
and<00:04:40.320> therefore<00:04:40.500> modern<00:04:40.949> warfare<00:04:41.070> 3<00:04:41.250> because

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
and therefore modern warfare 3 because

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:42.950 
and therefore modern warfare 3 because
that<00:04:41.820> was<00:04:41.910> basically<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.449> reskin<00:04:42.900> of

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
that was basically just a reskin of

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.750 
that was basically just a reskin of
modern<00:04:43.290> warfare<00:04:43.440> 2<00:04:43.800> so<00:04:44.310> i'm<00:04:44.400> pretty<00:04:44.520> sure<00:04:44.729> that

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
modern warfare 2 so i'm pretty sure that

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.460 
modern warfare 2 so i'm pretty sure that
rules<00:04:45.060> out<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.300> kind<00:04:45.780> of<00:04:45.900> feel<00:04:46.080> from<00:04:46.260> those

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
rules out the kind of feel from those

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.600 
rules out the kind of feel from those
games<00:04:46.740> even<00:04:46.979> though<00:04:47.100> they<00:04:47.280> might<00:04:47.400> take

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
games even though they might take

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.790 
games even though they might take
elements<00:04:47.850> from<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.419> if<00:04:49.380> they're<00:04:49.590> going<00:04:49.680> to

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
elements from it and if they're going to

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.320 
elements from it and if they're going to
go<00:04:49.919> for<00:04:50.100> anything<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:50.610> probably<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.060> cod4

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
go for anything it's probably the cod4

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.300 
go for anything it's probably the cod4
feel<00:04:51.990> but<00:04:52.350> I<00:04:52.380> don't<00:04:52.590> know<00:04:52.680> I'm<00:04:52.770> just<00:04:52.919> bouncing

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
feel but I don't know I'm just bouncing

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.159 
feel but I don't know I'm just bouncing
ideas<00:04:53.370> around<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:54.300> I'd<00:04:54.690> love<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.900> hear<00:04:55.050> what
