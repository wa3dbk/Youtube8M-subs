00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.490 
was talking about in my reptile up the
reptile<00:00:29.460> show<00:00:29.670> video<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:31.140> kind<00:00:31.410> of

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
reptile show video that I was kind of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.950

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.389 
one more thing but I think it looks okay
for<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:39.030> now<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.600> guess<00:00:41.899> here<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.890> is

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399
