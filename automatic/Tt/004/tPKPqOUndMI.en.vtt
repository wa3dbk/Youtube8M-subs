00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.219
 greetings are areas is in this video vi 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.840
 I will make the dialogue between maxis eric heard 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.580
 tofan that we will keep at the end of 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.410
 rick tofu strike so this time 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.060
 it will be the dialogue you feel when 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.740
 all the players of the match will have 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.750
 completed all the steroids right 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.070
 sell all the maps you will not advance 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.060
 nothing but I leave you directly 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.060
 listen to the dialogues 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:01:15.990
 only in the world what did you become a saint 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.630
 so my son's soul is doomed 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.030
 or eternal damnation 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.380
 even if you don't care that she's 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.700
 sure you care about your stage not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.710
 I'd say 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:54.920
 I'm already able to leave this 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:02:00.530
 physical dimension or the asiled samuel 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.530
 this we can even closer 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:21.430
 finally they say blow no I have 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:21.430
 bought me not me 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:54.500
 no complete control of the movements 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:58.490
 instantly different from before 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.270
 we can talk play and have fun 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:08.630
 together it is quite exciting to travel 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:11.330
 in salted japan I understand behaved 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.630
 as always I will try to left whose 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.630
 spaces 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.340
 you know if I fall marked 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.530
 I forgot how she was alive from under the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.519
 constant threat to be eaten by 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.340
 blocks 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.340
 I was hoping that exactly how we know 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.030
 these were the dialogues that took place 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.780
 feel at the end of the ritual spreads 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.420
 fan 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.730
 then it is clear that he was irritated 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.450
 funk kills maxis and takes possession of 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.320
 stu leading body however does not seem that 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.730
 body control is complete indeed 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.620
 he even seems to repent for that 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.400
 which he probably found out 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.570
 more in the next dlc in my opinion 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.030
 the abdomen vest so that's all for now 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.489
 leave a nice like comment with 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.489
