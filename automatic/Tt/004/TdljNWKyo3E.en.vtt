00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.070
 and this transfer 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.620
 about games from the past today's topic in 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.230
 the race to the destruction of all these games 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.170
 combines one desire to destroy 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.110
 everything in its path and most importantly destroy 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.990
 all rivals in third place with us 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.619
 the madness itself housed and the game 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.140
 insane 2002 in the game is present 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.320
 a huge amount of technology from the passenger 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.320
 to jeeps from quads to trucks 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.469
 as well as madness for glider 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.469
 space bike and wildebeest 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:48.070
 the tracks in this game are completely endless 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:51.430
 they are small only a kilometer per kilometer 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.600
 or the infinite is also represented 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.629
 many regions 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.710
 mountain and snowy places 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.739
 desert as well as for each 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.259
 cards, you can choose three times of day 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.469
 day-night twilight and on each map 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.289
 you can use any of the game types 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:15.759
 such as the passage of the gate the pursuit 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.560
 flag king of the hill and even the usual race of 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.670
 disadvantages perhaps worth noting 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.869
 weak graphics 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.959
 even by the standards of 2002 but plus it 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.039
 use of soft body physics 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.920
 cars crumple from strong 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.409
 collisions but they can be repaired by her 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.169
 1 they can also be put on wheels in 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.630
 the whole ride on such cars seems 

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:38.169
 on the behavior of plasticine on the air 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.840
 cushions 

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:43.599
 but if you drop all the disadvantages then the game 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.869
 came out insane interesting and if you turn on 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.179
 codes big foot to all cars 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.049
 become big wheels what does 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.669
 the dynamics of the game is even more interesting in 2011 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.270
 the second part came out 

00:01:54.669 --> 00:02:01.569
 improved graphics but the machines are no longer 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.179
 crumpled and only scratched and most importantly 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.590
 there is a feeling how you play it 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.590
 radio-controlled cars 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.280
 in second place is a series of flatout games 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.470
 the first part came out in 2004 and immediately 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.620
 set new rules for racing 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.470
 survival and destruction of this game for the first time 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.710
 an opportunity for drivers to leave 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.100
 cars right during the race the second part 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.700
 was released in 2006 she improved all that 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.500
 was in the first part more cars 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.010
 divided into three classes derby rally 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.959
 street they are all prototypes 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.750
 American cars from the original 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.500
 almost all of them can fall off 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.750
 and doors and hood and trunk, and even the wheel 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.170
 you really can not get to the finish line 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.630
 or vice versa kill all rivals and 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.350
 leisurely drive alone in a few game 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.170
 zones forest village town sports track 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.239
 three roads each on the way you 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.420
 you can shift almost everything 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.790
 pleasing for this acceleration and play 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.280
 become more dynamic main 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.040
 feature of the game has become 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.160
 subscriber identity three leaders by 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.130
 one for each type of car 2 neutral 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.610
 barely an outsider other than survival race 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.970
 there is an arena where only one remains 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.239
 collision racing and crash test with 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.239
 circus numbers type hit drivers 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.120
 Like a dart Throw it further above 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.840
 more precisely two years later updated 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.260
 version 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.820
 even better graphics 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.700
 additional elements such as 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.400
 grass water and also increased 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.390
 the number of riders crash tests replaced 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.060
 time trial 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.570
 but the acceleration of the production that has become more difficult 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.690
 reduced the overall dynamics of the game in 2011 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.870
 3 part of the game was released which is also 2 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.260
 madness became arcade bright colors shine 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.940
 fog arcade behavior even new types 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.250
 no games added 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.340
 Drive such which was in the second 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.919
 parts of years zombies ride on 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.820
 radio controlled big feet as well 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.460
 not well 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:32.240
 street racing in colors similar 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:37.070
 on nfs carbon is in first place 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.770
 2008 burnout paradise city in our 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.390
 there is a whole city in which there is no 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.510
 no rules 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.150
 only speed is a huge amount 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.700
 cars in addition there is even 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.760
 motorcycle in the city a lot of springboards for 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.340
 tricks of posters and fences for destruction 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.680
 also in addition to the participants have 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 neutral cars in the game is very 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.250
 colorful crash 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.350
 they look so realistic then 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.720
 willy-nilly you think about how 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.690
 behave on a real road in this 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.480
 the game has only a city and cars and 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.270
 one person unlike fade out 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.130
 the machine is immortal even after serious 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.840
 crashes they are restored again 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.660
 exception hunting 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.880
 all rushing at breakneck speed 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.730
 destroying everything in its path and where 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.090
 would you not have turned you will always be on 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.710
 the right way of the shortcomings is 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.680
 console past is especially fun 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.100
 default control value gas 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.290
 brake this a and z Aliyev right to 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.560
 Arrow keys to change 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.660
 control press escape and f2 twice 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.330
 for the selection of tests we need 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.790
 drive to any intersection and weird 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.580
 combinations ha storm of start him in 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.150
 Overall, this is almost an ideal minimum race. 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.240
 plot 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.260
 videos of strange upgrades only drive 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.260
 only race 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.580
 Of course this is not all games on this 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:11.240
 subjects but these were better desire was 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.240
 player
