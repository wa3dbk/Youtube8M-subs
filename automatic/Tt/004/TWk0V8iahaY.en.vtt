difference<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.820> way<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.119> buttons

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
difference in the the way the buttons

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.149 
difference in the the way the buttons
are<00:01:42.509> laid<00:01:42.720> out<00:01:42.750> basically<00:01:43.320> they're<00:01:43.590> actually

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
are laid out basically they're actually

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.950 
are laid out basically they're actually
or<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.880> actually<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.240> believe<00:01:45.479> these<00:01:45.630> are<00:01:45.689> just

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
or I actually I believe these are just

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.670 
or I actually I believe these are just
stickers<00:01:46.200> me

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
stickers me

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.020 
stickers me
they<00:01:46.799> look<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.640> look<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.880> they're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
they look really they look like they're

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330 
they look really they look like they're
printed<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:49.770> guessing<00:01:50.040> they're

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
printed on here but I'm guessing they're

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.039 
printed on here but I'm guessing they're
just<00:01:50.579> little<00:01:50.790> stickers<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.360> there<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.659> go

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
just little stickers and there we go

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.350 
just little stickers and there we go
so<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:53.369> fault<00:01:53.610> there<00:01:53.759> there's<00:01:53.970> not

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so that was my fault there there's not

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.880 
so that was my fault there there's not
anything<00:01:54.869> different<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> buttons<00:01:55.799> just

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
anything different with the buttons just

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.429 
anything different with the buttons just
the<00:01:56.399> way<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.060> these<00:01:57.360> things<00:01:57.659> labeled

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
