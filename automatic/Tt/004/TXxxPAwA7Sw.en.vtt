these shapes what did is the best way to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.740 
these shapes what did is the best way to
start<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.750> draw<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.559> kind<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.329> this<00:00:54.329> look

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
start is just draw a kind of this look

can<00:01:51.680> do<00:01:51.920> if<00:01:52.010> you<00:01:52.100> want<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.340> have<00:01:52.460> them<00:01:52.610> come<00:01:52.880> in

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
can do if you want to have them come in

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.270 
can do if you want to have them come in
up<00:01:53.270> above<00:01:54.170> both<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.710> wings<00:01:54.830> coming<00:01:55.100> up

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
up above both of the wings coming up

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.380 
up above both of the wings coming up
then<00:01:55.970> take<00:01:56.870> this<00:01:57.020> line<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.090> just<00:01:59.090> bring<00:01:59.300> a

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
then take this line and just bring a

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.750 
then take this line and just bring a
line<00:01:59.540> up<00:01:59.750> like<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.650> that<00:02:01.190> starts<00:02:01.580> off

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
line up like this and that starts off

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.930 
line up like this and that starts off
the<00:02:02.350> nearside<00:02:03.350> wing<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:04.430> then<00:02:04.580> maybe<00:02:04.790> just

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
the nearside wing and then maybe just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.700 
the nearside wing and then maybe just
bring<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.390> up<00:02:05.420> like<00:02:05.690> this<00:02:05.870> and<00:02:07.210> that's<00:02:08.210> a<00:02:08.710> kind

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
bring it up like this and that's a kind

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.170 
bring it up like this and that's a kind
of<00:02:09.740> wing<00:02:09.950> shape<00:02:10.160> maybe<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.430> little<00:02:10.550> bit<00:02:10.700> longer

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
of wing shape maybe a little bit longer

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.860 
of wing shape maybe a little bit longer
but<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.990> can<00:02:12.140> play<00:02:12.320> about<00:02:12.500> with<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
but you can play about with that and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.420 
but you can play about with that and
then<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.020> next<00:02:15.050> wing<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.680> can<00:02:15.710> we<00:02:15.950> bring<00:02:16.280> out

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
then the next wing you can we bring out

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.820 
then the next wing you can we bring out
of<00:02:16.460> here<00:02:16.730> we<00:02:17.030> bring<00:02:17.390> out<00:02:17.540> here<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.620> one<00:02:18.800> I

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
of here we bring out here this one I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.470 
of here we bring out here this one I
think<00:02:19.040> I'll<00:02:19.130> bring<00:02:19.280> out<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.550> here<00:02:21.820> or<00:02:22.820> if<00:02:23.240> you

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
think I'll bring out of here or if you

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.160 
think I'll bring out of here or if you
want<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:24.070> have<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.190> wing<00:02:25.340> coming<00:02:25.640> down

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
want it to have the wing coming down

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.310 
want it to have the wing coming down
strong<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.320> one<00:02:27.500> quickly<00:02:32.020> if<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.110> want<00:02:33.260> to

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
strong of one quickly if you want to

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.830 
strong of one quickly if you want to
have<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.500> wing<00:02:33.650> coming<00:02:33.920> down<00:02:34.130> then<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.730> can

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
have the wing coming down then you can

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:43.150 
have the wing coming down then you can
bring<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.050> line<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:42.709> this<00:02:42.860> with<00:02:43.070> it

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
bring this line and just do this with it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.729 
bring this line and just do this with it
so<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.030> kind<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.270> has<00:02:44.390> another<00:02:44.630> little<00:02:44.780> bump<00:02:45.650> in

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
so it kind of has another little bump in

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.240 
so it kind of has another little bump in
it<00:02:46.570> like<00:02:47.570> that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
it like that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.199 
it like that
bring<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.340> around<00:02:49.370> like<00:02:49.640> this

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
bring it around like this

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.410 
bring it around like this
and<00:02:51.299> your<00:02:51.870> wings<00:02:52.049> then<00:02:52.379> going<00:02:52.620> down<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.730> it's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
and your wings then going down so it's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.179 
and your wings then going down so it's
pretty<00:02:54.629> pretty<00:02:55.620> simple<00:02:55.920> we're<00:02:56.040> drawing

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
pretty pretty simple we're drawing

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.699 
pretty pretty simple we're drawing
swallows<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:57.480> also<00:02:57.959> what<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.290> do<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.560> with

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
swallows and what also what I do is with

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.149 
swallows and what also what I do is with
the<00:02:58.769> tail<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.489> well<00:02:59.730> do<00:03:00.359> is<00:03:00.480> I'll<00:03:00.569> bring<00:03:00.719> a<00:03:01.159> line

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
the tail is well do is I'll bring a line

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.490 
the tail is well do is I'll bring a line
coming<00:03:02.790> across<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.299> body<00:03:03.480> like<00:03:03.689> this<00:03:03.930> from

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
coming across the body like this from

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.809 
coming across the body like this from
the<00:03:04.650> wing<00:03:04.829> so<00:03:05.099> it's<00:03:05.219> connecting<00:03:05.549> up<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
the wing so it's connecting up to the

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.449 
the wing so it's connecting up to the
wing<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.500> one<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.799> kind<00:03:08.159> of<00:03:08.280> looked

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
wing so on this one it kind of looked

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.309 
wing so on this one it kind of looked
more<00:03:08.670> like<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.750> you've<00:03:09.870> got<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.079> little

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
more like that so you've got a little

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.190 
more like that so you've got a little
bit<00:03:10.439> of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.420> underbelly<00:03:12.420> sort<00:03:12.719> shown<00:03:12.930> through

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
bit of the underbelly sort shown through

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.990 
bit of the underbelly sort shown through
here<00:03:13.409> it<00:03:13.889> just<00:03:14.010> gives<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.280> an<00:03:14.400> idea<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.730> where

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
here it just gives you an idea of where

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.660 
here it just gives you an idea of where
to<00:03:15.090> put<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.269> tail<00:03:15.480> better<00:03:15.750> say<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.950> then<00:03:17.549> I'll

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
to put the tail better say and then I'll

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.429 
to put the tail better say and then I'll
just<00:03:17.819> bring<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> tail<00:03:18.420> cut<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.349> have

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
just bring the tail cut I like to have

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.509 
just bring the tail cut I like to have
them<00:03:19.530> kind<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.799> quite<00:03:20.159> angular<00:03:20.959> pointed<00:03:21.959> out

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
them kind of quite angular pointed out

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.839 
them kind of quite angular pointed out
bring<00:03:23.519> it<00:03:23.609> back<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:23.970> like<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:28.700> say<00:03:29.700> on

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
bring it back in like this and say on

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.410 
bring it back in like this and say on
this<00:03:29.970> one

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.720 

to<00:03:36.020> put<00:03:36.200> weighing<00:03:36.410> on<00:03:36.500> him<00:03:36.590> as<00:03:36.709> well<00:03:36.860> just<00:03:37.430> give

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
to put weighing on him as well just give

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.100 
to put weighing on him as well just give
you<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.819> barrow<00:03:38.000> there<00:03:38.300> void<00:03:38.510> look<00:03:38.810> like<00:03:38.959> when

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
you a barrow there void look like when

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.800 
you a barrow there void look like when
he's<00:03:39.200> done<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:42.970> I'm<00:03:43.970> on<00:03:44.120> I'm<00:03:44.209> shade<00:03:44.450> in<00:03:44.660> air

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
he's done and I'm on I'm shade in air

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.479 
he's done and I'm on I'm shade in air
I'll<00:03:45.020> probably<00:03:45.319> just<00:03:45.680> join<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.099> body<00:03:46.280> up<00:03:46.459> with

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
I'll probably just join the body up with

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.580 
I'll probably just join the body up with
a<00:03:46.670> tail<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.150> then<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:48.110> will<00:03:48.260> know<00:03:48.349> where<00:03:48.470> this

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
a tail and then I will know where this

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.500 
a tail and then I will know where this
little<00:03:48.739> bit<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.099> underbody<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:49.640> color<00:03:50.030> while

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
little bit of underbody is color while

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.170 
little bit of underbody is color while
usually<00:03:50.690> color<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.140> underbelly<00:03:51.709> red<00:03:52.180> so

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
usually color the underbelly red so

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.300 
usually color the underbelly red so
cover<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.690> bit<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:53.989> right<00:03:54.170> there<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.650> uh

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
cover that bit and right there and uh

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.020 
cover that bit and right there and uh
nose<00:03:56.300> cut<00:03:56.569> off<00:03:56.690> here<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.880> continue<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.000> here

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
nose cut off here and continue it here

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.940 
nose cut off here and continue it here
you<00:03:59.209> see<00:03:59.420> what<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.540> mean

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
you see what I mean

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.290 
you see what I mean
see<00:04:00.950> that's<00:04:01.130> just<00:04:01.190> pretty<00:04:01.550> simple<00:04:01.670> easy<00:04:02.180> we're

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
see that's just pretty simple easy we're

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.400 
see that's just pretty simple easy we're
drawing<00:04:02.450> solid<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:02.989> you've<00:04:03.110> got<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.319> know

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
drawing solid so you've got you know

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.540 
drawing solid so you've got you know
obviously<00:04:03.800> your<00:04:03.980> heart<00:04:04.130> shape<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.430> draw

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
obviously your heart shape you draw

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.009 
obviously your heart shape you draw
first<00:04:04.819> and<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.269> bring<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.780> wing<00:04:05.900> off

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
first and you bring the wing off

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.210 
first and you bring the wing off
whichever<00:04:06.319> way<00:04:06.500> one<00:04:06.709> I<00:04:06.769> mean<00:04:06.980> they<00:04:07.040> take<00:04:07.190> a

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
whichever way one I mean they take a

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.530 
whichever way one I mean they take a
little<00:04:07.400> bit<00:04:07.550> of<00:04:07.610> practice<00:04:07.790> but<00:04:08.180> once<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.420> get

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
little bit of practice but once you get

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.300 
little bit of practice but once you get
used<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.810> them<00:04:08.959> they're<00:04:09.410> really<00:04:09.650> easy<00:04:09.860> to<00:04:10.010> draw

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
used to them they're really easy to draw

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.270 
used to them they're really easy to draw
so<00:04:10.970> I'm<00:04:11.150> like<00:04:11.420> say<00:04:11.690> what<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:12.380> do<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:12.950> just<00:04:12.980> get

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
so I'm like say what I do is I just get

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.270 
so I'm like say what I do is I just get
a<00:04:13.310> sheet<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.790> those<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:15.709> picked<00:04:16.100> my

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
a sheet of those and I picked my

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.740 
a sheet of those and I picked my
favorite<00:04:16.310> ones<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.090> me<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.239> saw<00:04:17.389> probably<00:04:17.570> do

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
favorite ones to me I saw probably do

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.729 
favorite ones to me I saw probably do
pretty<00:04:17.930> much<00:04:18.019> all<00:04:18.229> of<00:04:18.380> these<00:04:18.470> because<00:04:18.709> I

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
pretty much all of these because I

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.210 
pretty much all of these because I
wanted<00:04:19.450> one<00:04:20.450> two<00:04:20.600> three<00:04:20.810> four<00:04:21.079> five<00:04:21.229> six<00:04:21.380> seven

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
wanted one two three four five six seven

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.440 
wanted one two three four five six seven
I<00:04:22.250> wanted<00:04:22.550> seven<00:04:22.880> on<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.060> sheet<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:23.389> I'll

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
I wanted seven on the sheet so I'll

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.900 
I wanted seven on the sheet so I'll
probably<00:04:23.540> use<00:04:23.720> all<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.080> these<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.850> try<00:04:25.850> to

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
probably use all of these and try to

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.610 
probably use all of these and try to
draw<00:04:26.150> them<00:04:26.240> all<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.450> similar<00:04:26.750> size<00:04:26.960> just<00:04:27.380> play

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
draw them all the similar size just play

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.930 
draw them all the similar size just play
about<00:04:27.800> with<00:04:27.860> different<00:04:28.250> wing<00:04:28.400> positions<00:04:29.200> and

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
about with different wing positions and

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.310 
about with different wing positions and
yeah<00:04:31.940> what<00:04:32.120> I'll<00:04:32.210> do<00:04:32.360> next<00:04:32.600> is<00:04:32.930> I'll<00:04:33.050> just<00:04:33.169> get

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
yeah what I'll do next is I'll just get

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.240 
yeah what I'll do next is I'll just get
enough<00:04:33.500> she<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:35.000> lay<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.210> on<00:04:35.360> top<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:36.250> trace

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
enough she just lay it on top and trace

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.880 
enough she just lay it on top and trace
them<00:04:37.430> for<00:04:37.639> a<00:04:37.700> bit<00:04:37.880> neater<00:04:38.090> I<00:04:41.350> mean<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:42.500> did<00:04:42.680> I

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
them for a bit neater I mean you did I

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.420 
them for a bit neater I mean you did I
usually<00:04:43.460> actually<00:04:43.760> draw<00:04:44.090> straight<00:04:44.390> onto<00:04:44.539> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
usually actually draw straight onto the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.460 
usually actually draw straight onto the
watercolor<00:04:46.430> paper<00:04:46.640> and<00:04:46.970> usually<00:04:47.479> bother<00:04:47.720> and

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.780 

double<00:04:54.470> tracing<00:04:54.830> them<00:04:54.950> like<00:04:55.100> this<00:04:55.280> but<00:04:55.580> just

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
double tracing them like this but just

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.379 
double tracing them like this but just
to<00:04:56.389> show<00:04:56.540> you<00:04:56.600> how<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:56.870> do<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.139> and<00:04:57.700> then<00:04:58.700> when<00:04:59.360> I

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
to show you how I do it and then when I

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.950 
to show you how I do it and then when I
come<00:04:59.570> in<00:04:59.660> with<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.840> pan<00:05:00.050> I<00:05:00.320> can<00:05:01.780> refine<00:05:02.780> them

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
come in with a pan I can refine them

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.140 
come in with a pan I can refine them
even<00:05:03.169> more<00:05:03.380> maybe<00:05:04.070> add<00:05:04.250> something<00:05:04.550> like<00:05:04.910> maybe

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
even more maybe add something like maybe

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.180 
even more maybe add something like maybe
a<00:05:05.240> little<00:05:05.510> flower<00:05:05.810> in<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.830> some<00:05:09.100> coming<00:05:10.100> up

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
a little flower in it some coming up

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.780 
a little flower in it some coming up
beak<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:11.889> you<00:05:12.889> don't<00:05:13.070> add<00:05:13.220> little<00:05:13.460> bits<00:05:13.669> to

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
beak and you don't add little bits to

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.550 
beak and you don't add little bits to
them<00:05:13.910> like<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:16.490> then<00:05:17.210> yeah<00:05:17.389> draw<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:17.990> go

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
them like that and then yeah draw a go

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.070 
them like that and then yeah draw a go
over<00:05:18.710> with<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:18.919> pen<00:05:19.100> get<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.490> proper<00:05:19.790> knee<00:05:20.080> add

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
over with a pen get a proper knee add

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.570 
over with a pen get a proper knee add
these<00:05:21.350> little<00:05:21.650> bits<00:05:21.770> on<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:21.950> wings<00:05:22.160> here<00:05:22.460> as

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
these little bits on the wings here as

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.400 
these little bits on the wings here as
well<00:05:22.760> and<00:05:23.360> we<00:05:23.450> can<00:05:23.600> see<00:05:23.780> that<00:05:23.930> but<00:05:24.140> you<00:05:24.169> know

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
well and we can see that but you know

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.870 
well and we can see that but you know
just<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.710> little<00:05:24.950> just<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.490> break<00:05:25.640> up<00:05:25.790> the

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
just a little just to break up the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.790 
just a little just to break up the
shading<00:05:26.270> I'll<00:05:26.930> show<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.140> why<00:05:27.260> that<00:05:27.440> is<00:05:27.470> want

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
shading I'll show you why that is want

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.800 
shading I'll show you why that is want
to<00:05:27.830> do<00:05:27.950> the<00:05:28.040> shade<00:05:28.220> and<00:05:28.340> video<00:05:28.580> be<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.150> simple

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
to do the shade and video be a simple

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.920 
to do the shade and video be a simple
we're<00:05:29.930> drawing<00:05:30.080> swallows<00:05:31.480> you<00:05:32.480> know<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.840> can

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
we're drawing swallows you know you can

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.900 
we're drawing swallows you know you can
follow<00:05:33.050> along<00:05:33.320> this<00:05:33.500> video<00:05:33.860> as<00:05:34.580> long<00:05:34.669> as<00:05:34.820> you

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
follow along this video as long as you

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.700 
follow along this video as long as you
get<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.330> basic<00:05:35.810> shape<00:05:35.840> right<00:05:36.290> in<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:36.500> first

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
get the basic shape right in the first

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.620 
get the basic shape right in the first
place<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.130> rest<00:05:37.310> of<00:05:37.430> its<00:05:37.550> pretty<00:05:37.760> easy<00:05:37.850> so<00:05:38.600> I

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
place the rest of its pretty easy so I

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.360 
place the rest of its pretty easy so I
hope<00:05:39.020> that<00:05:39.200> helps<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:39.740> if<00:05:40.040> you<00:05:40.130> want<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.310> see
