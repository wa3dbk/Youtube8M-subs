that all the time would know those
things<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.390> very<00:01:54.659> important<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
things are very very important to you I

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
things are very very important to you I
think<00:01:55.950> today<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.850> good<00:01:57.030> idea<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
think today it's a good idea to have a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.920 
think today it's a good idea to have a
rangefinder<00:01:58.170> most<00:01:59.070> courses<00:01:59.659> people<00:02:00.659> carry

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
rangefinder most courses people carry

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.810 
rangefinder most courses people carry
range<00:02:01.259> finders<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.460> instantly

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
range finders so that you can instantly

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
range finders so that you can instantly
tell<00:02:03.240> him<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.840> far<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.500> certain

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
tell him how far it is to certain

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.119 
tell him how far it is to certain
distances<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.390> tell<00:02:06.649> yardage<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.920> one

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
distances as you can tell yardage is one

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.800 
distances as you can tell yardage is one
of<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.310> big<00:02:08.520> important<00:02:09.060> things<00:02:09.300> probably<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
of the big important things probably the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.300 
of the big important things probably the
most<00:02:10.020> important<00:02:10.560> thing<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.890> being<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.190> good

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
most important thing to being a good

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.690 
most important thing to being a good
caddie

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
caddie

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400 
caddie
the<00:02:12.120> other<00:02:12.300> good<00:02:12.540> thing<00:02:12.599> is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the other good thing is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.040 
the other good thing is
is<00:02:13.470> support<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:15.210> your<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.570> support

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
is support is that your the support

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.890 
is support is that your the support
mechanism<00:02:16.800> you're<00:02:16.980> not<00:02:17.130> you're<00:02:17.670> not

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
mechanism you're not you're not

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.110 
mechanism you're not you're not
downgrading<00:02:18.900> or<00:02:19.140> or<00:02:19.350> or<00:02:19.980> putting<00:02:20.400> down<00:02:20.520> shots

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
downgrading or or or putting down shots

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.630 
downgrading or or or putting down shots
but<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.930> fact<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.740> you're<00:02:23.310> giving

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
but the fact that that you're giving

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.430 
but the fact that that you're giving
distance<00:02:24.180> letting<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.660> player<00:02:24.900> make<00:02:25.230> his

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
distance letting a player make his

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.320 
distance letting a player make his
decisions<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.280> then<00:02:26.370> you're<00:02:26.580> you're<00:02:27.060> being

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
decisions and then you're you're being

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.710 
decisions and then you're you're being
supportive<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.440> player<00:02:29.450> another<00:02:30.450> good

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
supportive of that player another good

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
supportive of that player another good
thing<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.990> where<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.470> stand<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.250> very<00:02:32.730> very

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
thing is where you stand is very very

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.830 
thing is where you stand is very very
important<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.140> if<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.860> was<00:02:35.540> going<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.630> help

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
important and so if I was going to help

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.380 
important and so if I was going to help
a<00:02:36.990> player<00:02:37.260> coming<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.850> would<00:02:38.970> say<00:02:39.180> we're

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
a player coming in that would say we're

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.180 
a player coming in that would say we're
on<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.630> first<00:02:39.870> tee<00:02:40.260> here<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.650> we're<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:41.070> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
on the first tee here and we're going to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.460 
on the first tee here and we're going to
hit<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.490> probably<00:02:42.180> hit<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> driver<00:02:42.780> off<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.350> this

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
hit it probably hit a driver off of this

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.400 
hit it probably hit a driver off of this
T<00:02:43.770> so<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:45.060> we'll<00:02:45.270> do<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.660> we'll<00:02:45.810> come<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.260> and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
T so what we'll do is we'll come in and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.030 
T so what we'll do is we'll come in and
and<00:02:46.820> you'll<00:02:47.820> see<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.990> bag<00:02:49.200> sets<00:02:49.620> down

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
and you'll see that the bag sets down

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.510 
and you'll see that the bag sets down
the<00:02:51.000> player<00:02:51.300> can<00:02:51.660> choose<00:02:51.690> his<00:02:52.200> club<00:02:52.590> which

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
the player can choose his club which

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.630 
the player can choose his club which
would<00:02:53.820> probably<00:02:54.390> be<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.840> driver<00:02:55.290> I'll<00:02:56.160> take<00:02:56.490> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
would probably be a driver I'll take the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.880 
would probably be a driver I'll take the
head<00:02:56.850> cover<00:02:57.150> off<00:02:57.420> that's<00:02:57.720> not<00:02:57.840> his<00:02:58.320> job<00:02:58.650> that's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
head cover off that's not his job that's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.350 
head cover off that's not his job that's
my<00:02:59.220> job<00:03:00.020> once<00:03:01.020> he<00:03:01.230> decides<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.940> tell<00:03:03.180> him

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
my job once he decides and you tell him

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.900 
my job once he decides and you tell him
what<00:03:03.630> your<00:03:04.110> target<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.830> big<00:03:05.280> tree<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.610> the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
what your target is that big tree to the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.830 
what your target is that big tree to the
middle<00:03:06.210> of<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.330> fairway

middle of the fairway

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.690 
middle of the fairway
from<00:03:07.350> then<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.710> I<00:03:07.740> would<00:03:08.130> want<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.430> step<00:03:08.670> back

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
from then on I would want to step back
