 m 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.060
 that's all that's happening there is a virtue that the occupier as 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.310
 garneau something else appreciable with the nexus one whether at speed 

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:24.619
 of its processor of its splendid case or the fact that it turns under 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.079
 the latest version in a noise of points quite the contrary what the 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.720
 nexus one does not have a keyboard 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.160
 while in return we do not have a touch keyboard that works very 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.449
 well and above all we have a new feature that will forget our 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:41.600
 keyboard scope 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.490
 he knows very special moment so the nexus one is the first phone that 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.490
 come out with the new version of android the points this new 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.320
 Android version has a voice dictation system 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.210
 voice dictation if you're not familiar with that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.720
 it's just you'll be able to talk on the phone and he'll 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.340
 recognize what you are telling him and quite surprisingly the nexus one 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.230
 does it very well I remember a few years ago having tested a pattern 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.260
 like giannone naturally speaking on my computer and I can tell you that 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
 it did not work as well as that 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.920
 it can be used in more than one portrait the text field that is to say 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.290
 sms emails his margin increases everywhere I go I can message 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.370
 I pay again to write and there on the keyboard we see an icon with 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.930
 a screen and as soon as he presses on it I'll be able to start dictating by 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.140
 against the closer a little bit of the left it works better than when it is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.210
 landed on a lot like that we left for a text you see what 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.210
 it looks like I'm leaning on the bodies 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.310
 recipes we are under indictment with the bo this month 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.600
 while you see it's a no-fault he's well known he even recognized the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.410
 comma we can visit any element of complications there 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.090
 will recognize then we may not take the trouble for sms to speak 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.310
 to articulate like that but we'll see what happens right away with the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.710
 week ap i continue space so i'm going to say this hurting earlier yes you 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.710
 Question mark this jersey 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.889
 road 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.949
 no 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.749
 it's a bit odd to talk like that but it's a little bit like saying that 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.090
 how people communicate best 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.999
 % afp writing really does a good job the 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.109
 this is my oath a word that is great if you are used to 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.369
 keyboard and you write long melchior certainly sometimes it will take 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:42.499
 come back a little correct some passages but overall it's really 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.920
 accurate a quick is super simple to use personally me who in 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.500
 has tons and tons of messages 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.280
 I think to do without the tactile keyboard of the nexus one which in the process runs 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.410
 very well ap it can rock like a landscape but for long mail it's a 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.450
 excellent very practical one last little thing go on technology 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.790
 to grant as you have the ability to create a whole blog 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.919
 paid and so make some money 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.109

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.469
