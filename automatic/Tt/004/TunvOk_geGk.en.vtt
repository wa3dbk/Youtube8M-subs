because what worked for you when your

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.620 
because what worked for you when your
hair<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.780> relaxed<00:01:22.500> may<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.130> necessarily<00:01:23.759> be

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
hair is relaxed may not necessarily be

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.469 
hair is relaxed may not necessarily be
working<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.890> when<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:26.759> natural

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
working for you when you are now natural

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.200 
working for you when you are now natural
and<00:01:28.610> for<00:01:29.610> me<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.150> lot<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.049> those<00:01:31.170> products<00:01:31.680> were

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
and for me a lot of those products were

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.429 
and for me a lot of those products were
petroleum-based<00:01:33.210> products<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
petroleum-based products that I have to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.499 
petroleum-based products that I have to
cut<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.079> did<00:01:37.079> big<00:01:37.500> chop<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.270> would

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
cut out when I did big chop so I would

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
cut out when I did big chop so I would
say<00:01:39.659> that's<00:01:39.869> something<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.409> definitely<00:01:40.979> give

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
say that's something to definitely give

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.420 
say that's something to definitely give
some<00:01:41.670> thought<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.079> research<00:01:44.009> and

some thought to you have to research and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.030 
some thought to you have to research and
kind<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.479> play<00:01:45.630> around<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:46.200> products<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
kind of play around with products in the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.969 
kind of play around with products in the
first<00:01:47.280> year<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.119> first<00:01:48.479> two<00:01:48.689> years<00:01:48.979> find

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
first year or so first two years find

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.710 
first year or so first two years find
out<00:01:50.130> what<00:01:50.310> works<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.909> could<00:01:51.119> that's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
out what works for you could that's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
out what works for you could that's
basically<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> had<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> couldn't<00:01:53.970> go

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
basically what I had to do I couldn't go

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
basically what I had to do I couldn't go
about<00:01:54.299> anybody<00:01:54.810> else's<00:01:55.229> regimen<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.979> didn't

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
about anybody else's regimen I didn't

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.260 
about anybody else's regimen I didn't
necessarily<00:01:56.939> go<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.869> black<00:01:58.170> products<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.270> kept

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
necessarily go for black products I kept

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.510 
necessarily go for black products I kept
an<00:02:00.420> open<00:02:00.540> mind<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:02.939> look

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
an open mind and you know look

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.459 
an open mind and you know look
two<00:02:03.640> different<00:02:04.149> products<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.719> are<00:02:04.990> marketed

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
two different products that are marketed

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.109 
two different products that are marketed
towards<00:02:06.189> from<00:02:06.579> Indian<00:02:06.969> two<00:02:07.149> Caucasian<00:02:07.810> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
towards from Indian two Caucasian so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.610 
towards from Indian two Caucasian so
that's<00:02:10.119> something<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.720> really<00:02:11.140> think<00:02:11.470> about

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
that's something to really think about

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.860 
that's something to really think about
because<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.459> just<00:02:12.730> can't<00:02:12.849> limit<00:02:13.269> yourself

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
because you just can't limit yourself

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.250 
because you just can't limit yourself
being<00:02:14.290> natural<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.250> journey<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.989> really

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
being natural is a journey and it really

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.670 
being natural is a journey and it really

factors<00:05:02.160> do<00:05:02.669> come<00:05:02.910> into<00:05:03.180> play<00:05:03.419> so<00:05:04.409> I<00:05:04.919> would<00:05:05.280> say

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
factors do come into play so I would say

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.140
