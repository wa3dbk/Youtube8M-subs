00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
hello guys this is Jamie from

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.250 
hello guys this is Jamie from
repetitions<00:00:11.180> and<00:00:11.420> today<00:00:11.630> I<00:00:11.660> was<00:00:11.870> playing<00:00:11.930> on

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
repetitions and today I was playing on

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.730 
repetitions and today I was playing on
the<00:00:12.290> joy<00:00:12.559> o<00:00:12.590> DC<00:00:13.300> delay<00:00:14.300> pedal<00:00:14.630> it's<00:00:15.440> a<00:00:15.500> little

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
the joy o DC delay pedal it's a little

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.179 
the joy o DC delay pedal it's a little
box<00:00:16.340> with<00:00:16.550> four<00:00:16.850> different<00:00:17.710> delay<00:00:18.710> modes

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
box with four different delay modes

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.550 
box with four different delay modes
which<00:00:19.670> I'll<00:00:19.820> go<00:00:19.970> through<00:00:20.000> in<00:00:20.210> a<00:00:20.330> minute

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.189 

fairly<00:00:24.560> standard<00:00:24.920> functions<00:00:25.310> mix<00:00:25.670> mode<00:00:26.449> time

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
fairly standard functions mix mode time

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.040 
fairly standard functions mix mode time
and<00:00:27.650> feedback<00:00:28.430> and<00:00:28.970> you've<00:00:29.119> got<00:00:29.270> a<00:00:29.300> bypass<00:00:29.779> and

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
and feedback and you've got a bypass and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.140 
and feedback and you've got a bypass and
a<00:00:30.140> channel<00:00:30.350> select<00:00:30.740> it<00:00:31.279> can<00:00:31.430> also<00:00:31.550> tap<00:00:31.910> tempo

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
a channel select it can also tap tempo

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.770 
a channel select it can also tap tempo
and<00:00:32.629> save<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.500> setting<00:00:34.330> so<00:00:35.330> you<00:00:35.360> can<00:00:35.600> come<00:00:35.750> back

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
and save a setting so you can come back

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.869 
and save a setting so you can come back
to<00:00:36.110> it

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
to it

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.979 
to it
also<00:00:38.539> has<00:00:38.719> a<00:00:38.750> DC<00:00:39.649> input<00:00:39.920> power<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.149> port<00:00:41.809> for

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
also has a DC input power and a port for

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:52.349 
also has a DC input power and a port for
a<00:00:42.250> church<00:00:43.250> as<00:00:44.059> well

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.079 

the<00:00:53.359> cult<00:00:53.570> function<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.079> fairly<00:00:54.260> standard<00:00:55.089> it

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
the cult function is fairly standard it

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.240 
the cult function is fairly standard it
sounds<00:00:56.420> really<00:00:56.629> good<00:00:56.839> on<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:57.260> on<00:00:57.589> a<00:00:57.680> driven<00:00:58.010> or

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
sounds really good on it on a driven or

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.020 
sounds really good on it on a driven or
a<00:00:58.280> clean<00:00:58.519> sound

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
a clean sound

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:23.050 
a clean sound
I<00:00:59.089> mean<00:00:59.719> enjoyed<00:01:00.019> filling<00:01:00.379> around<00:01:00.620> with<00:01:00.710> that

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:02:01.130 

mmm

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:11.660 

I<00:02:08.660> really<00:02:09.660> really<00:02:09.960> like<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.380> modulation<00:02:10.830> at<00:02:11.490> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
I really really like the modulation at a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.240 
I really really like the modulation at a
nice<00:02:12.000> pink<00:02:12.270> floyd--<00:02:12.570> sound<00:02:13.320> almost<00:02:13.920> sound

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
nice pink floyd-- sound almost sound

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.460 
nice pink floyd-- sound almost sound
like<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> chorus<00:02:15.240> with<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.750> delay<00:02:16.050> on<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.260> I

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
like a chorus with the delay on it I

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.810 
like a chorus with the delay on it I
guess<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.860> kind<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.220> course<00:02:17.520> with<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
guess it is kind of course with the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:48.300 
guess it is kind of course with the
delay<00:02:18.030> honor<00:02:18.210> very<00:02:18.930> very<00:02:19.260> fun

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.240 

the<00:02:48.850> reverse<00:02:49.150> one<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.600> kind<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.170> funky<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:51.130> can

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
the reverse one is kind of funky you can

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.740 
the reverse one is kind of funky you can
get<00:02:51.370> some<00:02:51.520> really<00:02:51.670> interesting<00:02:52.060> sounds<00:02:52.600> out

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
get some really interesting sounds out

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.510 
get some really interesting sounds out
of<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.990> if<00:02:53.440> that's<00:02:53.560> what<00:02:53.709> you're<00:02:53.980> interested

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
of that if that's what you're interested

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:18.070 
of that if that's what you're interested
in

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.400 

alright<00:03:19.080> guys<00:03:19.230> that's<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.950> joy<00:03:20.520> of<00:03:20.690> DC<00:03:21.690> delay

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
alright guys that's the joy of DC delay

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.910 
alright guys that's the joy of DC delay
pedal<00:03:22.770> it's<00:03:22.920> pre<00:03:23.610> danchi<00:03:24.030> and

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
pedal it's pre danchi and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:35.980 
pedal it's pre danchi and
Oh

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.540 

we<00:03:36.990> just<00:03:37.140> got<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.350> delay<00:03:37.560> goes<00:03:37.620> up<00:03:38.070> through

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
we just got the delay goes up through

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.670 
we just got the delay goes up through
the<00:03:38.730> FX<00:03:39.000> loop<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.540> effector<00:03:39.990> expects<00:03:40.500> to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
the FX loop of the effector expects to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.020 
the FX loop of the effector expects to
I'll<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.310> be<00:03:41.490> playing<00:03:41.730> with<00:03:41.850> something

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
I'll just be playing with something
