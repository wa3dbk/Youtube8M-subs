00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
pretty good so I'll go ahead and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.149 
pretty good so I'll go ahead and
minimize<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.799> I'm<00:01:47.009> ready<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:49.009> do<00:01:50.009> my

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
minimize this and now I'm ready to do my

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.290 
minimize this and now I'm ready to do my
brush<00:01:50.460> stroke

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.090 

if<00:01:54.300> I<00:01:54.480> don't<00:01:54.660> push<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.140> shift<00:01:55.410> button<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:55.950> if

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
if I don't push the shift button and if

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.720 
if I don't push the shift button and if
you<00:01:56.220> don't<00:01:56.400> have<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.580> steady<00:01:56.940> hand<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.870> can<00:01:58.110> get

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
you don't have a steady hand you can get

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.090 
you don't have a steady hand you can get
a<00:01:59.730> nice<00:02:00.180> straight<00:02:00.600> line<00:02:00.900> so<00:02:01.710> it'll<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
a nice straight line so it'll be a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.120 
a nice straight line so it'll be a
little<00:02:02.130> curvy<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.970> this<00:02:03.330> I'm<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.680> undo

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
little curvy like this I'm going to undo

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.670 
little curvy like this I'm going to undo
this<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.729> I'll<00:02:06.090> push<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.600> shift<00:02:06.990> button<00:02:07.410> and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
this and I'll push my shift button and

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.219 
this and I'll push my shift button and
this<00:02:08.039> will<00:02:08.100> force<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.060> brush<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.660> go<00:02:09.840> straight

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
this will force the brush to go straight

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.110 
this will force the brush to go straight
no<00:02:10.500> matter<00:02:10.740> what<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> here<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.760> next

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
eyeballing this and doing that selecting

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.110 
eyeballing this and doing that selecting
half<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.720> area<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:36.100> can<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.670> click<00:03:37.090> on

here<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.300> bottom<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:42.370> have<00:03:42.640> that

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
here in the bottom and I have that

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.900 
here in the bottom and I have that
portion<00:03:44.050> there<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:45.070> can<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.460> hang<00:03:45.700> this

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
portion there and I can just hang this

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.820 
portion there and I can just hang this
wherever<00:03:46.240> I<00:03:47.100> can<00:03:48.100> then<00:03:48.610> add<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:52.500> piece<00:03:53.500> on<00:03:53.770> top

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
wherever I can then add a piece on top

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.080 
wherever I can then add a piece on top
of<00:03:54.250> that

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.330 

let<00:04:00.599> me<00:04:00.720> do<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.019> again

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.810 

let's<00:04:08.340> change<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:09.060> color<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.480> red<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.820> there

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
let's change the color to red and there

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.590 
let's change the color to red and there
it<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.500> so<00:04:13.500> that's<00:04:13.680> how<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:13.920> create<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.640> scallop

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
it is so that's how you create a scallop

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.720 
it is so that's how you create a scallop
