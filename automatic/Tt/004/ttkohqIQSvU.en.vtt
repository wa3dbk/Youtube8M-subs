00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
the sound clearer and is what could be

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.270 
the sound clearer and is what could be
referred<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.490> as<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.820> phase<00:01:34.119> plug<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.159> can

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
referred to as a phase plug as you can

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.680 
referred to as a phase plug as you can
tell<00:01:36.430> they're<00:01:36.610> purple<00:01:36.970> that's<00:01:37.150> just<00:01:37.390> because

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
tell they're purple that's just because

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.940 
tell they're purple that's just because
we<00:01:37.960> like<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.229> kind<00:01:38.409> of<00:01:38.470> purple<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:38.830> that's

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
we like the kind of purple and that's

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.640 
we like the kind of purple and that's
