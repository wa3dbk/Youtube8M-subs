 good 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.830
 minions what woman does not like these 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.110
 little things will be because of its hidden 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.660
 maternal instinct since these are very 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.830
 like babies I do not know and I do not know 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.660
 import 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.000
 by the way if some male is watching 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 this thinks the following if you give to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.619
 your girl something of the minions could you 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.900
 Earn many points and do not worry 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.010
 where to find the merchandise is 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.680
 all over 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.020
 for example sandra shoes 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.940
 bullock the actress who puts voice to the 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.129
 villain the movie went to the carpet 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.739
 red with some unique shoes inspired 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.479
 in the minions by the way is the first 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 Once Sandra does it as a villain 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.829
 his whole career following with the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.010
 merchandise are also in many other 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.010
 things 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.679
 in my favorite villain it is explained that 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.649
 The minions is a doctor's creation 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.839
 nefario that mixes DNA mutant acids 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.330
 fatty and two and a half cups of bananas 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.369
 crushed however in his movie 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.409
 we see that they have been on earth since 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.869
 the origin of the times 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.509
 the minions would be the result between 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.640
 a mixture of the hawas of star wars and 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.399
 the one pair umpa of charlie and the factory 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.380
 of chocolate 'to the directors of my 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.360
 favorite villain commented that the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.729
 subordinates were written in the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.470
 script to make gru more enjoyable and 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.159
 they found the easiest way to 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.229
 do it by making them incompetent 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.299
 the minions were supposed to initially 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.369
 they were going to be great and similar to an orc 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.289
 but through development they were made 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.110
 getting smaller 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.490
 in the favorite villain ' 2 on the scene 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.619
 in which the three min yoon are 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.330
 auditioning for his own film he 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.399
 considers the initial material of 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.700
 project that by the time was already 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.070
 approved 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.110
 to make them more adorable we had the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.049
 idea of ​​calling them by first name 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.539
 even if there were hundreds like that, it was possible to do 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.820
 to the nearest group then we put them 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.250
 the glasses and the cowboy jumpsuits giving them 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.530
 an appearance of underground moles 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.050
 then the yellow color came and so 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.759
 they became the minions counted the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.730
 director pierre coffin 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.920
 you do not know the sex of the minions if you do not 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.080
 they are sexed, they are most likely to be 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.269
 males since of the hundreds of minions 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.310
 we know the name of a few that 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.970
 are mentioned in different scenes 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.900
 all male kevin stuart hayes 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.420
 jerry jorge jean marc film jon and karl 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.760
 having received a green light prior to 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.920
 development of my favorite villain 2 the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.829
 animators took care of that stuart 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.690
 kevin and bob resemble each other in daughters 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.730
 Group to achieve and more 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.720
 admiration and identification with the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.209
 public 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.489
 in the movie dialog the minions 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.660
 there are references to the magic flute 'of 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.480
 mozart 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.270
 there are hundreds of minions but there is nothing 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.060
 more than five types of hairstyles and all 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.370
 They only have three fingers for their meals 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.160
 favorites are bananas and ice cream 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.800
 that they call banana gelato and 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.470
 they speak a mixture of English Spanish 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.050
 French and Italian with elements 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.390
 Additional Russian and Korean cuisine 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.460
 sure it's a mixture of 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.100
 all the languages of the world with the 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.780
 intention to find a magical rhythm and 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.750
 a melody that makes nonsense 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.270
 make sense and that's why they are never 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.980
 bent to no language 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.320
 there were numerous castings in 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.000
 different cities but none seemed 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.240
 the right one to interpret the language 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.340
 of the minions then own 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.950
 directors pierre coffin and chris renaud 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.260
 they took the drastic decision to record 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.390
 themselves to create a voice and to the 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.270
 that they finally chose upon realizing 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.250
 how was it adapted to the dialogue 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.170
 in the movie the minions pierre coffin 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.710
 has been in charge of making the voices of 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.960
 all the more than 900 minions 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.480
 the purple and evil version of the 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.640
 minions the idea of ​​transforming a 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.680
 good character in a bad one was 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.570
 inspired by a chapter in which 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.670
 violin drinks a secret potion that 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.280
 turns into a giant monster that 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.200
 scares wild and purple 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.900
 because it 's just the opposite of yellow 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.840
 in the color spectrum at the minions 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.220
 they represent a tribute to the silent cinema 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.290
 when you review the history of 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.290
 movies you see they start being 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.240
 completely silent everything had a rhythm and 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.700
 it was well executed without any 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.160
 language the minions are the same the 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.430
 legacy of those movies except that 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.960
 we gave them ridiculous words 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.520
 explains one of the directors pierre 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.440
 coffin 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.690
 the little bot has a colored eye 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.190
 green and another brown color this 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.080
 syndrome that the directors of the 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.060
 film have reflected in one of the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.760
 yellow beings receives the name of ether 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.500
 another mine is an anomaly of the eyes in 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.690
 those that the irises are of different color 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.920
 but it can also affect the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.710
 skin or hair 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.870
 in my favorite villain the teeth of 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.580
 the minions are slightly crooked 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.389
 while in my favorite villain 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.400
 all are aligned despite the number 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.460
 limited to different varieties of 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.620
 minions more than 10,400 have been seen 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.500
 the time in the ads and on the screen 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.050
 in the bibs they carry the letter g if they have 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.150
 been sired by the villain group m 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.849
 if they have been for the Mexican villain 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.830
 called the male to the minions of the 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.990
 first movie they had the pallets 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.379
 slightly separated as was the fashion 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.629
 resurfaced by then to the decade in the 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:34.150
 that the movie passes the minions to 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.590
 the late 60's was established from this 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.770
 way by the admiration of the 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.360
 creators to the music of this decade like this 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.639
 explained the producer chris 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.159
 meledandri when we decided that the 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.990
 story would be a prequel we start to 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.659
 talk about the decade that would elapse 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.960
 and we were all attracted to the 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.919
 60's was a wonderful time to 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.110
 music 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.610
 the minions have become the 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.580
 official illumination mascot 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.860
 entertainment have been acquired by 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.350
 numerous companies like mcdonald's as 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.330
 bro and general mills among others 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.060
 kevin in my first movie 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.820
 favorite villain has an eye on the 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.940
 second movie appears with two at 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.490
 just like in the movie the minions in 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.970
 the movie the thorax of 2012 appears a 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.330
 minion to me favorite villain '3 already has 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.270
 date set for its release in 2017 the 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.770
 first part raised about 543 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.500
 millions of dollars around the world 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:37.890

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.890
 million I am that one until the next
