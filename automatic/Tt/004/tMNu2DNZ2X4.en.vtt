00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
bit testing last week then it was a half

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.269 
bit testing last week then it was a half
past<00:00:21.510> seven<00:00:21.660> start<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.230> runs<00:00:22.439> she<00:00:23.189> were

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
past seven start for the runs she were

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.099 
past seven start for the runs she were
already<00:00:23.430> done<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.539> yeah

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
already done what was that like yeah

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.779 
already done what was that like yeah
it's<00:00:25.650> an<00:00:25.740> early<00:00:25.859> start<00:00:26.310> i<00:00:26.369> think<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
it's an early start i think that the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.089 
it's an early start i think that the
gaffer's<00:00:27.060> keen<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.480> getting<00:00:28.260> an<00:00:28.470> early<00:00:28.710> he

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
gaffer's keen on getting an early he

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.349 
gaffer's keen on getting an early he
calls<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.400> conditioning<00:00:29.880> running<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.179> think

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
calls it conditioning running I think

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.930 
calls it conditioning running I think
it's<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> bit<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> little<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.810> harder<00:00:31.109> than<00:00:31.260> that

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
it's a bit a little bit harder than that

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
it's a bit a little bit harder than that
you<00:00:32.940> know<00:00:33.059> 45<00:00:33.480> minutes<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> think<00:00:34.350> five<00:00:34.829> just

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
you know 45 minutes is I think five just

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.040 
you know 45 minutes is I think five just
over<00:00:35.370> five<00:00:35.550> miles<00:00:35.760> or<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> good

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
over five miles or so so it's a good

as what we did and then also as a season

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850
