00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
a really thin case it's lightweight case

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.999 
a really thin case it's lightweight case

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
it's just fine so that's it going with

it's just fine so that's it going with
the<00:02:16.230> volume<00:02:16.590> rockers<00:02:17.069> first<00:02:17.340> as<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.569> see

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780

the volume rockers first as you can see
and<00:02:19.500> then<00:02:19.709> just<00:02:19.950> snap<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.819> into<00:02:21.090> place<00:02:21.150> and

and then just snap it into place and
that<00:02:22.800> fits<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.280> fine<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.269> let's<00:02:24.959> take<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.200> look

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
that fits just fine so let's take a look

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
that fits just fine so let's take a look
at<00:02:25.500> all<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> cutouts<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.250> all<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.519> inputs<00:02:27.239> so

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
at all the cutouts and all the inputs so

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690 
at all the cutouts and all the inputs so
first<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.319> all<00:02:28.379> right<00:02:28.560> at<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.769> bottom<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.670> can

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
first of all right at the bottom you can

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.970 
first of all right at the bottom you can
see<00:02:29.879> that<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:30.599> have<00:02:30.780> nice<00:02:31.110> large<00:02:31.470> opening

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
see that you do have nice large opening

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.300 
see that you do have nice large opening
for<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.970> charging<00:02:33.660> port<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.310> 3.5

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
for the charging port and the 3.5

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.490 
for the charging port and the 3.5
millimeter<00:02:35.580> headphone<00:02:36.000> jack<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.260> works

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
millimeter headphone jack and that works

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.339 
millimeter headphone jack and that works
just<00:02:37.709> fine<00:02:37.950> now<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.569> said<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:39.930> case<00:02:40.140> one

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
just fine now like I said this case one

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.900 
just fine now like I said this case one
offer<00:02:40.620> much<00:02:40.890> protection<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.549> if<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.760> were<00:02:41.849> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
offer much protection so if you were to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.789 
offer much protection so if you were to
drop<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.569> area<00:02:42.930> then<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.379> might<00:02:43.530> risk

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
drop it in this area then you might risk

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.920 
drop it in this area then you might risk
damaging<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.790> bezel<00:02:45.360> thing<00:02:45.510> right<00:02:45.690> around

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
damaging the bezel thing right around

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.740 
damaging the bezel thing right around
here<00:02:46.579> on<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.700> left<00:02:47.849> hand<00:02:48.000> side<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.450> do<00:02:48.599> have

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
are using it like this you can access

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.530 
are using it like this you can access
that<00:03:00.049> really<00:03:01.049> easily<00:03:01.319> which<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.280> real<00:03:02.430> nice<00:03:02.579> so

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
that really easily which is real nice so

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.300 
that really easily which is real nice so
then<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.900> right-hand<00:03:04.079> side<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:05.010> do<00:03:05.160> have

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
then on the right-hand side you do have

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
then on the right-hand side you do have
the<00:03:05.549> power<00:03:05.579> button<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.269> they<00:03:06.450> did<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:06.989> same

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
the power button and they did that same

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.449 
the power button and they did that same
thing<00:03:07.500> where<00:03:07.650> they<00:03:07.739> cut<00:03:07.950> out<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.099> little<00:03:08.310> bit

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
thing where they cut out a little bit

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.130 
thing where they cut out a little bit
extra<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.420> if<00:03:09.540> you're<00:03:09.690> just<00:03:09.780> using<00:03:09.900> you

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
extra so if you're just using you

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.140 
extra so if you're just using you
normally<00:03:10.560> your<00:03:10.799> finger<00:03:11.099> will<00:03:11.250> rest<00:03:11.790> right<00:03:12.000> in

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
normally your finger will rest right in

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.470 
normally your finger will rest right in
that<00:03:12.269> little<00:03:12.540> gap<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.989> it'll<00:03:13.140> fit<00:03:13.319> just<00:03:13.560> fine

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
that little gap and it'll fit just fine

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.750 
that little gap and it'll fit just fine
so<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.720> back<00:03:15.870> p<00:03:16.079> do<00:03:16.260> have<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.680> cut<00:03:16.860> outs<00:03:17.010> one

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
so on the back p do have to cut outs one

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.670 
so on the back p do have to cut outs one
cut<00:03:18.000> out<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.299> for<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.720> camera<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.380> LED

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.030 
second one is for the speaker and once
again<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.780> works<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.019> fine<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.560> muffle<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
again that works just fine to muffle the

again that works just fine to muffle the
sound<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.489> all<00:03:32.630> at<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.780> top<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.590> do<00:03:34.709> have<00:03:34.829> that

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
sound at all at the top you do have that

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.339 
sound at all at the top you do have that
exposed<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:36.180> really<00:03:36.389> don't<00:03:36.540> need<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.780> be

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
exposed you really don't need to be

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.970 
exposed you really don't need to be
exposed<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.849> there<00:03:39.209> if<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.450> want<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.750> to

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
exposed but it's there if you want it to

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.770 
exposed but it's there if you want it to
then<00:03:40.980> at<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.310> front<00:03:41.609> you<00:03:42.030> can<00:03:42.180> see<00:03:42.389> that<00:03:42.419> the

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
then at the front you can see that the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.920 
then at the front you can see that the
screen<00:03:43.169> is<00:03:43.230> left<00:03:43.790> clean<00:03:44.790> has<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.299> nice<00:03:45.510> design

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
screen is left clean has a nice design

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.220 
screen is left clean has a nice design
where<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.709> just<00:03:46.859> has<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.810> material<00:03:48.810> coming<00:03:49.019> up

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
where it just has the material coming up

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.960 
where it just has the material coming up
right<00:03:49.560> through<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.919> sides<00:03:50.160> now<00:03:50.790> one<00:03:50.940> thing

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
right through the sides now one thing

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.280 
right through the sides now one thing
that's<00:03:51.209> nice<00:03:51.389> is<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:51.959> does<00:03:52.079> have<00:03:52.260> a

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
that's nice is that it does have a

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.930 
that's nice is that it does have a
slight<00:03:52.560> lay<00:03:52.919> on<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.130> table<00:03:53.160> designs<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.910> can

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
slight lay on the table designs you can

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.030 
slight lay on the table designs you can
see<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.269> red<00:03:54.599> so<00:03:55.380> if<00:03:55.440> you're<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.709> place<00:03:55.889> is

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
see that red so if you're the place is

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.949 
see that red so if you're the place is
down<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.790> actually<00:03:57.000> lifts<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.480> screen<00:03:57.780> up

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
down this actually lifts the screen up

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.080 
down this actually lifts the screen up
off<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.739> surface<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.459> can<00:03:59.669> actually<00:03:59.700> move

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
off the surface so you can actually move

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.699 
off the surface so you can actually move
it<00:04:00.239> around<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:00.599> they<00:04:00.660> won't<00:04:00.870> scratch<00:04:01.200> up<00:04:01.470> or

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
it around and they won't scratch up or

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.099 
it around and they won't scratch up or
none<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.639> materials<00:04:03.209> from<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.510> table<00:04:03.750> or

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
none of the materials from that table or

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.659 
none of the materials from that table or
that<00:04:04.470> surface<00:04:04.859> will<00:04:05.069> actually<00:04:05.430> touch<00:04:05.639> the

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
that surface will actually touch the

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.390 
that surface will actually touch the
screen<00:04:06.060> itself<00:04:06.530> now<00:04:07.530> usability<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.220> case

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
screen itself now usability of the case

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.670 
screen itself now usability of the case
is<00:04:08.579> great<00:04:08.880> I've<00:04:09.540> only<00:04:09.750> had<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.109> for<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.349> day<00:04:10.500> or

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
is great I've only had it for a day or

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.309 
is great I've only had it for a day or
so<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.549> works<00:04:11.730> just<00:04:11.849> fine<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.989> screen<00:04:13.290> is

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
so and it works just fine the screen is

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.219 
so and it works just fine the screen is
left<00:04:13.620> intact<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:14.609> back<00:04:14.849> is<00:04:15.060> great<00:04:15.359> and<00:04:15.599> like<00:04:16.079> I

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
left intact the back is great and like I

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.110 
left intact the back is great and like I
said<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.500> does<00:04:16.620> not<00:04:16.829> add<00:04:17.039> much<00:04:17.280> bulk<00:04:17.639> at<00:04:17.880> all

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
said it does not add much bulk at all

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.779 
said it does not add much bulk at all
which<00:04:18.539> is<00:04:18.690> good<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.799> idea<00:04:19.829> user<00:04:20.370> for<00:04:20.669> this

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
which is good so the idea user for this

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.990 
which is good so the idea user for this
case<00:04:21.030> is<00:04:21.329> someone<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.840> be<00:04:22.079> looking<00:04:22.500> for<00:04:23.280> a
