guess<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.560> key<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:34.950> than<00:01:35.040> anything<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.430> just

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
guess the key more than anything is just

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280 
guess the key more than anything is just
play<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.090> way<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> play<00:01:36.540> during<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> regular

play the way you play during the regular

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.020 
play the way you play during the regular
