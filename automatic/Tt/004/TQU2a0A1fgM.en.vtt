it's like a face and I'm going to be

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.909 
it's like a face and I'm going to be
putting<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.440> into<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:18.389> play<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.680> I'll<00:04:19.769> put

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
putting this into the play so I'll put

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.440 
putting this into the play so I'll put
the<00:04:20.010> clay<00:04:20.220> in<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.459> background<00:04:20.909> take<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> mold

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
the clay in the background take a mold

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.420 
the clay in the background take a mold
of<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.630> while<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> can<00:04:22.139> and<00:04:22.320> I'm<00:04:23.130> gonna<00:04:23.250> probably

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
of it while I can and I'm gonna probably

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.320 
of it while I can and I'm gonna probably
thin<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.090> flexible<00:04:24.240> but<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.690> will<00:04:24.840> work<00:04:25.520> so

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
thin and flexible but it will work so

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.200 
thin and flexible but it will work so
