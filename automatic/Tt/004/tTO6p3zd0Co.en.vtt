00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
on average but sometimes that's not the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.070 
on average but sometimes that's not the
case<00:02:08.149> but<00:02:09.640> Alfonso<00:02:10.640> we<00:02:10.940> do<00:02:11.090> but<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:11.989> a

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
case but Alfonso we do but it's a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.170 
case but Alfonso we do but it's a
retired<00:02:12.530> player<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> flag<00:02:13.580> patch<00:02:13.819> then
