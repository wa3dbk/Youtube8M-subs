systems<00:00:20.070> would<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.369> perfect<00:00:20.789> even<00:00:21.270> once

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
systems would be perfect even once

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.689 
systems would be perfect even once
developed<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.500> multiple<00:00:23.070> approaches<00:00:23.310> are

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
developed so multiple approaches are

researchers have suggested using urine

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.609 
researchers have suggested using urine
to<00:00:29.039> capture<00:00:29.369> carbon<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.840> most<00:00:31.080> surprising

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to capture carbon the most surprising

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.010 
to capture carbon the most surprising
thing<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.579> isn't<00:00:32.910> crazy<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.420> major

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
thing is that this isn't crazy a major

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
thing is that this isn't crazy a major
component<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.680> urine<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.610> organic

form more ammonium bicarbonate don't
worry<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.289> gets<00:00:49.320> better<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.520> ammonium

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
worry it gets better this ammonium

worry it gets better this ammonium
bicarbonate<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.020> used<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.379> fertilizer

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
bicarbonate can be used as fertilizer

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.910

formed calcium carbonate and absorb even
more<00:00:58.890> co2<00:00:59.660> now<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:01.050> actually<00:01:01.620> possible<00:01:01.829> for

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
more co2 now it's actually possible for

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.570 
more co2 now it's actually possible for
the<00:01:02.460> urine<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.969> go<00:01:03.149> bad<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> preservative<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the urine to go bad so a preservative is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.330 
the urine to go bad so a preservative is
needed<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.900> case<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.409> small<00:01:07.979> amount<00:01:08.250> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
needed in this case a small amount of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
needed in this case a small amount of
waste<00:01:08.610> water<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> byproduct<00:01:09.810> of

waste water that is a byproduct of
crushing<00:01:10.650> olives<00:01:11.360> study<00:01:12.360> shows<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.689> this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
crushing olives study shows that this

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.950 
crushing olives study shows that this
urine<00:01:13.530> olive<00:01:13.950> mixture<00:01:14.430> could<00:01:15.090> last<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.630> six

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
urine olive mixture could last about six

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.560 
urine olive mixture could last about six
months<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.619> potentially<00:01:17.610> reduce<00:01:17.909> emissions

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
months and potentially reduce emissions

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.310 
months and potentially reduce emissions
by<00:01:18.780> 1%<00:01:19.610> which<00:01:20.610> isn't<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> lot<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> major

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
by 1% which isn't a lot but the major

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.050 
by 1% which isn't a lot but the major
point<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.130> something<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.640> usually

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
point is that something that usually

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.960 
point is that something that usually
gets<00:01:24.479> thrown<00:01:24.810> away<00:01:25.100> could<00:01:26.100> become<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> resource

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
gets thrown away could become a resource

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.260 
gets thrown away could become a resource
for<00:01:27.180> helping<00:01:27.689> reduce<00:01:27.840> pollution<00:01:29.270> industrial

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
for helping reduce pollution industrial

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.569 
for helping reduce pollution industrial
and<00:01:30.509> domestic<00:01:30.540> chimneys<00:01:31.170> could<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.130> converted

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and domestic chimneys could be converted

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.560 
and domestic chimneys could be converted
into<00:01:32.759> containers<00:01:33.479> full<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.229> urea<00:01:34.560> mixture

into containers full of the urea mixture

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.850 
into containers full of the urea mixture
creating<00:01:36.570> higher<00:01:36.780> pressures<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> gas

or gross as this may seem the fact is we

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.920
