00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello everyone hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.730
 Well, many of you will have heard about the 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.210
 great majority, not to mention all of 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.939
 milking cows sheep goats and so on 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.939
 but and order milking cabbages 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.519
 who has heard about milking cabbages 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.619
 Well, let's learn something new 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.670
 how the cabbages are ordered, those already 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.030
 I have ordered 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.660
 and I go here 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.160
 how the cabbages are ordered very easy 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.680
 very easy to see if I put it so that 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.530
 I can see me 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 you put the cabbage side 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.269
 and you're looking leaf by leaf 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.269
 those below 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.240
 we are removing the ones that are like this more 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.150
 snail and slug meals and such 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.510
 Well, here we start as we see 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.220
 the little snails because it's those 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.540
 we are worth that is the milking 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.540
 remove the cabbage 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.640
 they removed the cabbage everything that has 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.440
 we have the little snails because 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.070
 we are going to save them to raise 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.870
 course we see it we can not face it with 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.870
 so to save 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.000
 we go looking leaf by leaf this seems 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.000
 not having many 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.040
 then nothing to another we're going 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.650
 to this 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.810
 and we are doing exactly the same 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.120
 leaf by leaf these leaves are still worth 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.580
 backwards after food they do not 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.580
 discarded I leave them out there 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.610
 it has nothing 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.710
 does not have anything out 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.100
 outside 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.370
 they have nothing 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.370
 Well, nothing to others 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.550
 these are like cows that are young 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.440
 still they do not give good or ordered 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.520
 Obviously it will not give you more 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.480
 nothing happened to another 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.590
 let's see if he has or has not 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.590
 this is the take away 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.230
 we remove does not have 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.870
 we took it all of famous 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.280
 so that they continue raising we see how 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.450
 yes they have or are going out of there 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.450
 in here in and more 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.370
 and we 're going 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.430
 we are going to change it 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.450
 that's the milking of cabbage come on 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.450
 taking out all 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.180
 one by one 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.180
 some fall but will not go very 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.840
 we do not see how it has inside the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.340
 leaves 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.340
 we're taking it all out 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.230
 They are very small and elusive but 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.190
 they go out 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.620
 we see how they have 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.280
 a natural way also 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.130
 to remove pests 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.130
 without pesticides or daycares 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.410
 creating all the cabbage 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.430
 has more 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:24.849
 Well nothing to the next good I'm not going to 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.330
 put all the roll logically not if it 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.330
 is watching 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.540
 and now I'm going to put all the roll 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.690
 logically but you have already seen in what 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:41.490
 consists of milking cabbages I hope 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.490
 that someone serves them as a curiosity 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:50.579
 and entertainment and learning 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.579
 come nothing more than that see you later
