00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.189
 very well we receive in your channel more 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.830
 favorite still practice mx dentistry 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:15.760
 aesthetic and let's talk now about a 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.760
 child theme and many many dads 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:23.500
 in the childhood 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:28.330
 our little girl really is not the name 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.970
 adequate is a photo of me and my pulpit 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.529
 those names sound maritime but 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.710
 how it is explained 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.050
 and what is each one of them for 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.140
 understand their children and their 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.720
 small why is it done 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.040
 the nerve piece at a certain level because 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.140
 to others 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.360
 so they are calm they are 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.960
 very simple procedures is a 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.960
 little bit more complicated my reading 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.670
 personally if everything is done on time 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.400
 attend to the call of your children too 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.630
 for grass that arrive with the others there 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.910
 doctor 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.160
 then the bad milk bites but 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.820
 those that are not checked are going to fall 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.360
 then yes yes but existing milk 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.770
 are programmed to exfoliate whether to fall 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.810
 your child up to 11 or 12 years , or 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.050
 are not so childish then you have to 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.909
 take good care of those customers 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.580
 temporary milk teeth in their years 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.490
 and we're going to start talking about when 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.400
 that tooth is very destroyed very 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.890
 affected the cleaning of the powder nerve 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.170
 take there for your story 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.810
 What is the octopus is also by 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.710
 berto while both are like the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 endodontics in milk teeth but the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.010
 Pulpotomies is the elimination of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.320
 pulp chamber contribute your camera 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.580
 you think let's say it's like the trunk 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.580
 main nerve and my pulp is 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.130
 Removing the pulp chamber up 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.420
 two millimeters before the end of the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.240
 root 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.300
 what is this is the trunk and the branches of 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.330
 the base 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.420
 a little more explicit we are going to 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.720
 stop them a little better in the camera 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.810
 guilt in this very pretty is up here 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.380
 even before the division of the roots 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.080
 this is pulp chamber 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.690
 and what is the root canal where 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.840
 enter the back he ate 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.590
 Root conductor of the roots is 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.830
 this 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.590
 then until pulpotomies we stay 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.290
 here are certain considerations that 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.989
 we have to guarantee that they are in the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.050
 tooth of the little one to stay up 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.480
 this level if at this level we see 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.980
 the ideal conditions we have to 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.870
 go down to this level 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.129
 The goal is that your children do not lose 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.590
 that tooth 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.410
 the ideal is the most natural thing always 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.910
 let's insist a lot here on the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.810
 information that we give to you 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.540
 so if we can guarantee that it 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.090
 he understands he's going to stay in the mouth better 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.069
 that although it must be removed carry 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.030
 your things or take your care but what 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.030
 best of the most natural 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.930
 then what is the benefit? 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.360
 watching avoids the extraction of that tooth 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.510
 of milk so that the child can continue 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.670
 working to continue chewing the in 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.410
 the case of teeth front teeth 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.400
 previous so that the child does not 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.980
 lose the aesthetics and after the appearance 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.060
 mine 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.489
 or pulpotomies is generally advised or 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.700
 it was advised depends on the valuation 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.599
 a placement of a mental crown to 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.790
 zero 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.280
 this also changes and starts to change 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.560
 a little bit with what we mentioned in 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.400
 our videos because it 's dentistry 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.310
 minimally invasive the idea is to guarantee 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.720
 that rising to boil if we know that 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.209
 we are going to put something on them and they will last 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.030
 little time we did not go to the next 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.979
 level of treatment even slightly 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.260
 more aggressive a little more wear 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.880
 but we know they will last to 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.100
 lineman I can not tell ya what you eat 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.199
 sweet the child will do what he wants 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.780
 begins crown then or with that 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.800
 resin then we have to do this one 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.080
 the best treatment for your cases 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.259
 this is an example of an x-ray 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.620
 where we see a pulp ect or mine that 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:42.919
 different to this wind where the nerve 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.650
 it looks black 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:49.900
 here it looks white because it already 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.600
 cleaned and placed the sealing material 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.600
 That friend is working the channel 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 radicular and the camera tip 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.330
 as it is done in an appointment under the 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.369
 existence with its small terms I do not 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.849
 be afraid of assistances dads 

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:13.070
 moms and I'm telling you all this 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.590
 has changed to this 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.810
 let's say how can we call him 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.540
 Some 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.990
 as we can call doctor the coconuts of 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.629
 liters 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.150
 costumes for syringes are already more 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:32.599
 friendly external anesthesia by 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:36.469
 computer food children talk to them 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:38.300
 magical or magical pistolite already makes them 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.389
 very friend the consultation are not have 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.220
 fear in that all the medical wolf 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:46.460
 general practice stomatologist 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.850
 20 has that touch to talk to his 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.390
 children doing with them if there is not 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.290
 the specialty to have children 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.480
 pediatric dentistry in all of them center of 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.240
 calls prepared to attend to 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.000
 your little ones then on a low date 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.290
 anesthesia 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.600
 with the disguise of the resistance is 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.940
 does the nerve cleaning depends on the 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.470
 level that is necessary and how they 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:17.260
 we commented that here is the decay 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.390
 here is an example of a pulpotomies 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.750
 seen in the root canals 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.060
 intact 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.300
 and the accompaniment of a coronary 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.610
 mentally do it 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.159
 how they open those with the mouth of 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.479
 our child learns this color 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:37.950
 I also always tell you about my 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:40.170
 little ones who are customers of silver 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.750
 they presume that their parents take care of us 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.490
 I am in ten very happy sums is that 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.440
 I already have my princesses teeth a 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.280
 crown and how nice 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.650
 then do not be afraid and check the 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.990
 temporary teeth milk teeth of 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.730
 your children do not allow them to reach 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.040
 these levels in case they reach these 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.370
 levels also sometimes moms are 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:06.180
 they are very sad there are doctors who 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.580
 nerve do not worry use we have the 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.160
 tools to clean and leave a 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.920
 function in your little ones but the best thing is 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.710
 prevention 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.840
 then calm down so that the ones with the 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.700
