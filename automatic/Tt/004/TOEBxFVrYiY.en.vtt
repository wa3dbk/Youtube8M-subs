only<00:01:21.810> downside<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> animation<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.610> this

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
only downside with the animation in this

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.880 
only downside with the animation in this
campaign<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.200> doesn't<00:01:25.409> look<00:01:25.710> as

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
campaign is that that doesn't look as

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.670 
campaign is that that doesn't look as
insane<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.700> crazy<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.990> fighting<00:01:28.290> stuff

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
insane and crazy as the fighting stuff

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.140 
insane and crazy as the fighting stuff
it<00:01:28.950> kind<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> almost<00:01:29.400> looks<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.939> little

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
it kind of almost looks like a little

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.539 
it kind of almost looks like a little
bit<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.659> cheap<00:01:30.990> way<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:32.040> through<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
bit of a cheap way of going through the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.429 
bit of a cheap way of going through the
animation<00:01:33.030> story<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:33.930> really<00:01:34.079> well

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
animation story but it's really well
