00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.970 

alright<00:02:30.900> let's<00:02:31.140> look<00:02:31.380> at<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.890> an

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
alright let's look at that for an

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.780 
alright let's look at that for an
attachment<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.580> were<00:02:32.670> talking<00:02:33.060> about

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
attachment you were talking about

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.200 
attachment you were talking about
basically

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
basically

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
basically
the<00:02:37.390> first<00:02:37.690> position

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
the first position

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.470 
the first position
not<00:02:39.470> as<00:02:39.620> fired<00:02:39.860> what

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.740 

as<00:02:42.690> far<00:02:43.050> as<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.379> secure<00:02:43.739> bar<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.400> find<00:02:44.670> it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
as far as a secure bar we find it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.900 
as far as a secure bar we find it
now<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.470> actually<00:02:46.860> locking<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.490> frame<00:02:47.790> of

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
now it's actually locking the frame of

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.550 
now it's actually locking the frame of
the<00:02:47.940> motorcycle<00:02:48.570> there's<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.230> little<00:02:49.410> bit

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
the motorcycle there's a little bit

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.440 
the motorcycle there's a little bit
higher<00:02:49.800> with<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.070> gooseneck<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.820> would<00:02:50.940> it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
higher with the gooseneck it would it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.330 
higher with the gooseneck it would it
would<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.600> hanging<00:02:52.080> off<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.440> bike<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:53.130> way

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
would be hanging off the bike this way

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.790 
would be hanging off the bike this way
the<00:02:53.550> bikes<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:54.000> attached<00:02:54.470> with<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> see<00:02:55.740> the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
the bikes now attached with a see the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.090 
the bikes now attached with a see the
second<00:02:56.220> edition

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
second edition

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.540 
second edition
it<00:02:58.430> goes<00:02:58.700> right<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.570> flow<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.930> cream<00:03:00.550> run

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
it goes right to the flow of cream run
