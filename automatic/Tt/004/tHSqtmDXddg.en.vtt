ones that get push notifications so

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.000 
ones that get push notifications so
let's<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.870> ahead<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> go<00:00:37.590> into<00:00:37.800> something

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
let's go ahead and go into something

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.799 
let's go ahead and go into something
like<00:00:38.160> Facebook<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.239> ahead<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.450> change

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
like Facebook we can go ahead and change

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.400 
like Facebook we can go ahead and change
around<00:00:40.050> our<00:00:41.120> animation<00:00:42.120> banner<00:00:42.450> color<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.140> we

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
around our animation banner color and we

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.139 
around our animation banner color and we
can<00:00:43.559> also<00:00:43.680> test<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> notification<00:00:44.340> down<00:00:45.030> at

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
can also test the notification down at

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
can also test the notification down at
the<00:00:45.270> bottom<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.899> also<00:00:46.200> set<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> sound<00:00:46.980> right

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the bottom we can also set a sound right

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
the bottom we can also set a sound right
there<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.450> ahead<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.079> under

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
there so if we go ahead and go under

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
there so if we go ahead and go under
banner<00:00:49.559> color<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:50.399> ahead<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.579> enable

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
banner color we can go ahead and enable

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.060 
banner color we can go ahead and enable
it<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:51.780> let's<00:00:52.110> go<00:00:52.260> ahead<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.649> set<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
it and then let's go ahead and set the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.160 
it and then let's go ahead and set the
background<00:00:53.309> color<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.239> either<00:00:54.449> use<00:00:54.570> color

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
background color we can either use color

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.740 
background color we can either use color
presets<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:55.949> RGB<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.270> let's<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.539> ahead<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
presets or RGB so let's go ahead and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.660 
presets or RGB so let's go ahead and
choose<00:00:58.109> something<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.649> magenta<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.460> we're

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
choose something like magenta but we're

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.920 
choose something like magenta but we're
not<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> use<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.270> we're<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> go

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
not going to use that we're going to go

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.080 
not going to use that we're going to go
ahead<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> use<00:01:01.440> gradient<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.609> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
ahead and use gradient right here as you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.060 
ahead and use gradient right here as you
can<00:01:03.180> see<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.539> has<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> magenta<00:01:04.260> gradient<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> we

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
can see it has a magenta gradient and we

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.230 
can see it has a magenta gradient and we
can<00:01:05.220> change<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> around<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:06.060> different

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
can change it around with different

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600 
can change it around with different
colors<00:01:06.750> right<00:01:07.140> there<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.460> also

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
colors right there and then we can also

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.940 
colors right there and then we can also
change<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.060> from<00:01:09.180> vertical<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> horizontal

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
change it from vertical to horizontal

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.980 
change it from vertical to horizontal
which<00:01:10.950> ever<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.400> guys<00:01:11.729> prefer<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.479> then<00:01:12.869> if

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
which ever you guys prefer and then if

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
which ever you guys prefer and then if
we<00:01:13.080> go<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.820> go

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we go back all the way here we can go

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
we go back all the way here we can go
ahead<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.119> test<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> notification<00:01:15.979> there<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
ahead and test the notification there it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.609 
ahead and test the notification there it
is<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.509> pink<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
is as you can see it is pink now that

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
is as you can see it is pink now that
isn't<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> coolest<00:01:20.640> thing<00:01:20.820> about<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
isn't the coolest thing about this the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.570 
isn't the coolest thing about this the
animations<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.710> probably<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> coolest

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
animations are probably the coolest

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.670 
animations are probably the coolest
thing<00:01:23.939> about<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.259> under<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
thing about this so if you go under the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
thing about this so if you go under the
animations<00:01:26.220> tab<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.299> ahead<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
animations tab here you can go ahead and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.050 
animations tab here you can go ahead and
do<00:01:27.750> things<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.200> rotation<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.640> go

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
do things like rotation so if we go

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
do things like rotation so if we go
ahead<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.240> test<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.990> notification<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
ahead and test the notification as you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.390 
ahead and test the notification as you
can<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.939> notification<00:01:33.659> spins<00:01:34.200> into<00:01:34.590> my

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
can see my notification spins into my

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.030 
can see my notification spins into my
screen<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.540> that's<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.259> cool<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.619> changes

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
screen so that's really cool it changes

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.280 
screen so that's really cool it changes
things<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.610> bit<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.939> even<00:01:39.270> spins<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
things up a bit it even spins out it's a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.230 
things up a bit it even spins out it's a
really<00:01:40.530> nice<00:01:40.740> animation<00:01:41.430> transition<00:01:42.060> right

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
really nice animation transition right
