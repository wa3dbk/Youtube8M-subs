probably the most preferred type of

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.420 
probably the most preferred type of
finish<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.690> would<00:02:34.750> say<00:02:35.080> from<00:02:35.410> all<00:02:35.680> people<00:02:36.310> I've

the geometry of the grind and then the
secondary<00:02:43.390> grind<00:02:43.920> very<00:02:44.920> nice<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.340> see<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.519> had

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
secondary grind very nice you see I had

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.319 
secondary grind very nice you see I had
a<00:02:45.670> little<00:02:45.820> stylized<00:02:46.720> fin<00:02:47.110> right<00:02:47.560> there<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:49.299> has

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
a little stylized fin right there it has

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.250 
a little stylized fin right there it has
some<00:02:49.690> texture<00:02:50.640> right<00:02:51.640> there<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.959> apply

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
some texture right there like to apply

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.069 
some texture right there like to apply
more<00:02:53.500> pressure<00:02:55.079> but<00:02:56.079> all<00:02:56.260> together<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:57.130> very

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
more pressure but all together is very

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.530 
more pressure but all together is very
very<00:02:59.079> well<00:02:59.350> made<00:02:59.590> knife<00:02:59.890> now<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.060> button

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
very well made knife now it is a button

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.960 
very well made knife now it is a button
lock<00:03:01.840> or<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.829> is<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.549> pivot

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
lock or that is that that is the pivot

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.199 
lock or that is that that is the pivot
screw<00:03:04.500> ru<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.980> very<00:03:06.220> heavy-duty<00:03:06.549> pivot

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
screw ru it's a very heavy-duty pivot

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.310 
screw ru it's a very heavy-duty pivot
screw<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.860> lock<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:10.570> disengage<00:03:11.079> it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
screw that is the lock to disengage it

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.039 
screw that is the lock to disengage it
just<00:03:11.950> press<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.280> there<00:03:12.730> can<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:13.720> see<00:03:13.930> that

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
just press that there can you see that

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:21.600 
just press that there can you see that
see<00:03:14.290> how<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.590> works<00:03:19.320> there<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.650> now<00:03:21.549> the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
see how that works there it is now the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.180 
see how that works there it is now the
advantage<00:03:22.239> of<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.510> button<00:03:22.840> lock<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:24.010> it's

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
advantage of a button lock is that it's

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.660 
advantage of a button lock is that it's
so<00:03:24.459> compact<00:03:25.120> now<00:03:26.019> that's<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.470> hole<00:03:26.620> lock<00:03:26.950> it's

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
so compact now that's the hole lock it's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.970 
so compact now that's the hole lock it's
so<00:03:27.970> lightweight<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:28.989> compact<00:03:29.530> very

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
so lightweight and so compact very

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.030 
so lightweight and so compact very
simple<00:03:30.610> right<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.959> is<00:03:32.079> placed<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.010> that

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
simple right and it is placed so that

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.280 
simple right and it is placed so that
it's<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.450> way<00:03:34.600> you're<00:03:34.840> not<00:03:34.959> going<00:03:35.230> to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
it's out of the way you're not going to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.470 
it's out of the way you're not going to
accidentally<00:03:35.799> hit<00:03:36.070> that<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.970> see<00:03:37.180> how<00:03:37.329> it's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
accidentally hit that you see how it's

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.240 
accidentally hit that you see how it's
it's<00:03:37.810> not<00:03:37.989> going<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> get<00:03:38.440> hit<00:03:38.650> accidentally

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
it's not going to get hit accidentally

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.940 
it's not going to get hit accidentally
no<00:03:39.910> matter<00:03:40.120> what<00:03:40.389> grip<00:03:40.660> you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
no matter what grip you

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.610 
no matter what grip you
use<00:03:41.099> so<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.849> placed<00:03:42.209> right<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.930> also<00:03:43.440> I

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
use so it is placed right and also I

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.589 
use so it is placed right and also I
like<00:03:43.860> just<00:03:44.129> how<00:03:44.280> large<00:03:44.610> they<00:03:44.910> make<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.330> button

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
like just how large they make the button

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.470 
like just how large they make the button
so<00:03:45.840> when<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.080> do<00:03:46.290> need<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.739> get<00:03:46.860> at<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.480> it's

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
so when you do need to get at it it's

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.390 
so when you do need to get at it it's
very<00:03:48.540> easy<00:03:48.860> obviously<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:49.950> can<00:03:50.099> close<00:03:50.370> it

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
very easy obviously you can close it

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.670 
very easy obviously you can close it

now<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:53.150> switch<00:03:54.150> right<00:03:54.420> here<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.959> a

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
now this switch right here is a

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.190 
now this switch right here is a
secondary<00:03:56.250> lock<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:57.000> when<00:03:57.599> that<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.930> pushed

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
secondary lock and when that is pushed

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.009 
secondary lock and when that is pushed
forward<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:59.190> makes<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.670> impossible<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.840> makes

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
forward it makes it impossible it makes

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.470 
forward it makes it impossible it makes
it<00:04:01.200> impossible<00:04:01.530> see<00:04:02.099> you<00:04:02.760> cannot<00:04:03.060> disengage

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
it impossible see you cannot disengage

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.259 
it impossible see you cannot disengage
the<00:04:04.200> primary<00:04:04.650> lock<00:04:04.920> when<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.819> is<00:04:06.000> pushed

the primary lock when that is pushed
forward<00:04:06.769> alright<00:04:08.390> one<00:04:09.390> interesting<00:04:10.049> feature

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
forward alright one interesting feature

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.059 
forward alright one interesting feature
about<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.280> secondary<00:04:11.849> lock<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.380> manual

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
about the secondary lock it is manual

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.940 
about the secondary lock it is manual
but<00:04:14.670> if<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.910> push<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.390> halfway<00:04:15.810> up<00:04:16.260> when<00:04:16.799> it's

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
but if you push it halfway up when it's

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.020 
but if you push it halfway up when it's
closed<00:04:17.400> as<00:04:17.729> you<00:04:18.600> open<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.290> blade<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:21.000> will

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
closed as you open the blade it will

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.730 
closed as you open the blade it will
engage<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.870> rest<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.320> way

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
all right so it's manual but if you push

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.330 
all right so it's manual but if you push
it<00:04:25.470> halfway<00:04:25.680> up

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
it halfway up

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.969 
it halfway up
it'll<00:04:26.610> engage<00:04:26.940> automatically<00:04:27.840> it's<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.830> nice

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
it'll engage automatically it's a nice

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.030 
it'll engage automatically it's a nice

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
the Spyderco militaries handle is

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.490 
the Spyderco militaries handle is
slightly<00:04:43.830> longer<00:04:44.690> now<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.750> weight<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.350> the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
slightly longer now the weight on the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.040 
slightly longer now the weight on the
hope<00:04:46.710> knife<00:04:47.039> is<00:04:47.310> five<00:04:47.669> point<00:04:48.210> eight<00:04:48.419> ounces

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
hope knife is five point eight ounces

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.680 
hope knife is five point eight ounces
alright<00:04:50.039> so<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.430> is<00:04:50.580> it's<00:04:50.880> not<00:04:51.030> super<00:04:51.510> heavy

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
alright so it is it's not super heavy

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.590 
alright so it is it's not super heavy
for<00:04:52.169> this<00:04:52.320> size<00:04:52.620> but<00:04:53.039> it<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.190> on<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:54.419> heavy

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
for this size but it is on the heavy

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.469 
for this size but it is on the heavy
side<00:04:55.100> I<00:04:56.100> have<00:04:56.400> no<00:04:56.550> problem<00:04:56.940> with<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.240> because

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
side I have no problem with that because

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.230 
side I have no problem with that because
it's<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.050> it's<00:04:58.710> so<00:04:58.800> strongly<00:04:59.310> built<00:04:59.729> there<00:05:00.120> was

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
it's so it's so strongly built there was

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.200 
it's so it's so strongly built there was
no<00:05:00.419> blade<00:05:00.780> play<00:05:00.810> or<00:05:01.229> anything<00:05:01.440> like<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:02.210> so

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
no blade play or anything like that so

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.480 
no blade play or anything like that so
this<00:05:03.360> would<00:05:03.600> be<00:05:03.780> very<00:05:04.260> comparable<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.250> the

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
this would be very comparable to the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.000 
this would be very comparable to the
Spyderco<00:05:06.030> military<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:07.110> is<00:05:07.169> slightly<00:05:07.680> more

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
Spyderco military it is slightly more

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.210 
Spyderco military it is slightly more
it's<00:05:08.190> more<00:05:08.850> expensive<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:10.560> is<00:05:10.620> a<00:05:10.740> little<00:05:11.070> more

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
it's more expensive it is a little more

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.879 
it's more expensive it is a little more
heavily<00:05:11.729> built<00:05:12.030> but<00:05:12.840> generally<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.620> same

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
heavily built but generally the same

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.909 
heavily built but generally the same
types<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.580> missions<00:05:14.789> it's<00:05:15.300> just<00:05:15.630> if<00:05:16.620> you<00:05:16.770> want

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
types of missions it's just if you want

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.590 
types of missions it's just if you want
something<00:05:17.250> that's<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.729> little<00:05:17.760> more<00:05:18.030> heavily

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
something that's a little more heavily

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.110 
something that's a little more heavily
built<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.620> fit<00:05:19.889> and<00:05:20.070> finish<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.520> overall

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
built the fit and finish and overall

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.860 
built the fit and finish and overall
quality<00:05:21.360> I<00:05:21.930> would<00:05:22.650> say<00:05:22.889> is<00:05:23.250> as<00:05:23.610> good<00:05:24.090> it's

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
quality I would say is as good it's

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.350 
quality I would say is as good it's
actually<00:05:25.050> even<00:05:25.560> a<00:05:25.650> little<00:05:25.830> bit<00:05:26.070> better

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
actually even a little bit better

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.760 
actually even a little bit better
alright<00:05:27.360> then<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.780> spider<00:05:28.020> coat<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.650> the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
alright then the spider coat and the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.860 
alright then the spider coat and the
spider<00:05:29.039> coat<00:05:29.340> is<00:05:29.639> very<00:05:29.880> good<00:05:30.210> all<00:05:30.539> right<00:05:30.690> so

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
spider coat is very good all right so

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.670 
spider coat is very good all right so
these<00:05:31.020> Hogue<00:05:31.500> knives<00:05:32.060> they<00:05:33.060> are<00:05:33.620> first-rate

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
these Hogue knives they are first-rate

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.250 
these Hogue knives they are first-rate
right<00:05:35.160> now<00:05:35.370> since<00:05:35.669> hope<00:05:35.940> makes<00:05:36.330> grips<00:05:36.930> for

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
right now since hope makes grips for

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.990 
right now since hope makes grips for
firearms<00:05:37.919> a<00:05:38.070> lot<00:05:38.220> of<00:05:38.340> people<00:05:38.580> might<00:05:38.820> actually

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
firearms a lot of people might actually

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.870 
firearms a lot of people might actually
be<00:05:39.360> checking<00:05:39.900> out<00:05:40.020> this<00:05:40.200> knife<00:05:40.470> as<00:05:40.820> as<00:05:41.820> a

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
be checking out this knife as as a

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.839 
be checking out this knife as as a
backup<00:05:42.330> to<00:05:42.570> their<00:05:43.139> handgun<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:44.550> do<00:05:44.700> I<00:05:44.760> think

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
backup to their handgun and do I think

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.629 
backup to their handgun and do I think
it<00:05:45.180> would<00:05:45.300> serve<00:05:45.539> as<00:05:45.720> that<00:05:45.930> yes<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:46.889> do<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:47.520> is

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
it would serve as that yes I do it is

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.800 
it would serve as that yes I do it is
very<00:05:47.910> well<00:05:48.210> built<00:05:48.630> high<00:05:49.560> quality<00:05:50.450> because<00:05:51.450> of

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
very well built high quality because of

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.020 
very well built high quality because of
the<00:05:52.020> length<00:05:52.500> of<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.830> blade<00:05:52.950> it<00:05:53.250> would<00:05:53.370> be

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
the length of the blade it would be

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.210 
the length of the blade it would be
categorized<00:05:54.660> as<00:05:54.930> a<00:05:54.960> tactical<00:05:55.560> folder<00:05:56.010> but

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220
