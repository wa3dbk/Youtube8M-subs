bit<00:00:53.309> mixed<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.879> me<00:00:53.969> I've<00:00:54.120> seen<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.780> low

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
bit mixed for me I've seen it go as low

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
bit mixed for me I've seen it go as low
as<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.260> five<00:00:55.649> minutes<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.219> over<00:00:56.460> five

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
as about five minutes a little over five

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.400 
as about five minutes a little over five
to<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.270> high<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.780> six<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> half

minutes<00:00:58.770> depending<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> way<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.699> you're

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
minutes depending on the way that you're

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.130 
minutes depending on the way that you're
flying<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> really<00:01:00.780> nice<00:01:00.899> thing<00:01:01.109> about

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
flying but the really nice thing about

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.779 
flying but the really nice thing about
it<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.649> works<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> same<00:01:02.370> batteries

rear<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.479> well<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.470> red<00:01:25.770> LED<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> top

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
rear as well as one red LED on the top

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.450 
rear as well as one red LED on the top
that<00:01:27.090> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.450> looks<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.840> fake<00:01:28.259> GPS<00:01:28.619> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
that kind of looks like a fake GPS it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
that kind of looks like a fake GPS it
does<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.820> actually<00:01:30.150> function<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> GPS<00:01:30.990> it's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
does not actually function as a GPS it's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
does not actually function as a GPS it's
just<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.650> red<00:01:31.799> LED<00:01:31.979> after<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.909> you've<00:01:33.030> got<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
just a red LED after that you've got to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.179 
just a red LED after that you've got to
install<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.810> props<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.350> each<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> motors

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
install the props on each of the motors

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.710 
install the props on each of the motors
the<00:01:35.369> little<00:01:35.549> shaft<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.939> held<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.210> place<00:01:36.360> by<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the little shaft is held in place by a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.630 
the little shaft is held in place by a
cotter<00:01:37.110> pin<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> sort<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.310> prop

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
cotter pin so you have to sort of prop

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.670 
cotter pin so you have to sort of prop
all<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.270> pull<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> pin<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.049> put<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
all of that up pull the pin out put the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.469 
all of that up pull the pin out put the
prop<00:01:40.890> itself<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.490> place<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.210> then<00:01:42.299> put<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
prop itself in place and then put a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.090 
prop itself in place and then put a
screw<00:01:42.780> through<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.170> into<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.649> hole<00:01:43.829> that's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
screw through it into the hole that's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.950 
screw through it into the hole that's
actually<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.820> shaft<00:01:45.060> itself<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
actually in the shaft itself it's a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.450 
actually in the shaft itself it's a
whole<00:01:46.110> lot<00:01:46.259> simpler<00:01:46.530> than<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.890> sounds

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
whole lot simpler than it sounds

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.499 
whole lot simpler than it sounds
but<00:01:47.610> once<00:01:47.759> you've<00:01:47.880> got<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.149> said<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.450> done

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
but once you've got it all said and done

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.149 
but once you've got it all said and done
that's<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.049> looks<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that's what it looks like and actually I

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.440 
that's what it looks like and actually I
took<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.579> second<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> compare<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
took just a second to compare it to the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.210 
took just a second to compare it to the
FY<00:01:51.810> three<00:01:52.049> two<00:01:52.200> six<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> earliest

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
FY three two six one of the earliest

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.889 
FY three two six one of the earliest
quad<00:01:53.490> copters<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> actually<00:01:54.299> reviewed

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
quad copters that I actually reviewed

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.690 
quad copters that I actually reviewed
the<00:01:55.170> FY<00:01:55.409> three<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.680> six<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.340> little<00:01:56.579> bit

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the FY three to six is just a little bit

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.789 
the FY three to six is just a little bit
smaller<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:57.719> fly<00:01:57.930> pretty<00:01:58.290> similarly

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
smaller but they do fly pretty similarly

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.999 
smaller but they do fly pretty similarly
the<00:01:59.310> h2o<00:01:59.759> AVX<00:02:00.390> has<00:02:00.630> four<00:02:00.899> different<00:02:01.049> rates<00:02:01.439> 20

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the h2o AVX has four different rates 20

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.969 
the h2o AVX has four different rates 20
40<00:02:02.549> 60<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.030> 100<00:02:03.719> %<00:02:04.049> rates<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.680> mentioned

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
40 60 and 100 % rates as I mentioned

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.289 
40 60 and 100 % rates as I mentioned
earlier<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> does<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> headless<00:02:06.060> mode

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
earlier it does have a headless mode

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.910 
earlier it does have a headless mode
it's<00:02:06.659> supposed<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> hundred<00:02:07.710> meter

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it's supposed to have a hundred meter

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
it's supposed to have a hundred meter
range<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.819> cruise<00:02:09.090> control<00:02:09.450> mode<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
range and a cruise control mode so that

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.690 
range and a cruise control mode so that
it<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.259> remember<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.709> last<00:02:10.890> 40<00:02:11.220> seconds<00:02:11.640> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it can remember the last 40 seconds of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
it can remember the last 40 seconds of
flight<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> whatever<00:02:12.450> you've<00:02:12.629> been<00:02:12.780> doing

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
flight of whatever you've been doing

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.750 
flight of whatever you've been doing
so<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.349> hit<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.680> one<00:02:13.950> button<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.640> will

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so you hit this one button and it will

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.640 
so you hit this one button and it will
do<00:02:14.940> whatever<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.780> did<00:02:15.959> for<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.200> last<00:02:16.260> 40

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
do whatever you did for the last 40

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.440 
do whatever you did for the last 40
seconds<00:02:17.010> over<00:02:17.220> again<00:02:17.489> really<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.300> thing

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
seconds over again really the one thing

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.119 
seconds over again really the one thing
that<00:02:18.569> makes<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.870> special<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.530> unique<00:02:19.860> the

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
that makes this special and unique the

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.229 
that makes this special and unique the
one<00:02:20.250> thing<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.489> made<00:02:20.610> me<00:02:20.730> want<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:20.910> look<00:02:21.120> at

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
one thing that made me want to look at

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.400 
one thing that made me want to look at
it<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.629> thing<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.900> made<00:02:22.019> me<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.319> in

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
it the one thing that made me get in

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.229 
it the one thing that made me get in
touch<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.590> gearbest<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.310> say<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.670> have<00:02:24.060> to

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
touch with gearbest and say I have to

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.580 
touch with gearbest and say I have to
check<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.599> out<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.440> waterproof

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
check this out is that it's waterproof

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.589 
check this out is that it's waterproof
you<00:02:26.250> may<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.519> actually<00:02:26.700> noticed<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
you may have actually noticed in the

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.900 
you may have actually noticed in the
camera<00:02:27.959> here<00:02:28.230> there's<00:02:28.739> water<00:02:29.010> on<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.489> AVX

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
camera here there's water on the AVX

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.699 
camera here there's water on the AVX
right<00:02:30.150> now<00:02:30.330> because<00:02:30.690> I'd<00:02:30.989> literally<00:02:31.380> just

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
right now because I'd literally just

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.259 
right now because I'd literally just
brought<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.010> back<00:02:32.130> inside<00:02:32.459> from<00:02:32.700> flying<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.150> in

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
brought it back inside from flying it in

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.940 
brought it back inside from flying it in
the<00:02:33.540> water<00:02:33.720> let's<00:02:34.260> go<00:02:34.380> ahead<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.620> move<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.830> to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
the water let's go ahead and move on to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.080 
the water let's go ahead and move on to
the<00:02:35.040> flight<00:02:35.220> review<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> can<00:02:35.849> talk<00:02:35.970> about

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the flight review so I can talk about

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.610 
the flight review so I can talk about
that<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.330> little<00:02:36.480> bit<00:02:36.660> more<00:02:36.810> as<00:02:37.110> far<00:02:37.349> as<00:02:37.440> how<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
that a little bit more as far as how it

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.160 
that a little bit more as far as how it
flies<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.370> y'all<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.940> lot<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.510> FY<00:02:39.780> 3<00:02:39.959> to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
flies it y'all is a lot like the FY 3 to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.170 
flies it y'all is a lot like the FY 3 to
6<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.830> r8<00:02:41.099> doesn't<00:02:41.489> change<00:02:41.730> very<00:02:41.849> much

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
6 the r8 doesn't change very much

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.670 
6 the r8 doesn't change very much
through<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.480> 4<00:02:42.629> rates<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.080> does<00:02:43.230> change<00:02:43.530> a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
through the 4 rates it does change a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.740 
through the 4 rates it does change a
little<00:02:43.830> bit<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.310> not<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.519> huge<00:02:44.849> amount<00:02:45.030> has<00:02:45.720> a

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
little bit but not a huge amount has a

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.180 
little bit but not a huge amount has a
pretty<00:02:45.989> decent<00:02:46.319> amount<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.560> pitch<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.069> can

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
pretty decent amount of pitch and it can

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.440 
pretty decent amount of pitch and it can
fight<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.549> wind<00:02:47.730> pretty<00:02:47.970> well<00:02:48.180> actually

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
fight the wind pretty well actually

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.820 
fight the wind pretty well actually
fights<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.019> wind<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.260> think<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.560> little<00:02:49.680> bit

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
fights the wind I think a little bit

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.890 
fights the wind I think a little bit
better<00:02:50.010> than<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> FY<00:02:50.580> 3<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.940> 6<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.510> having

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
better than the FY 3 to 6 and having

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.330 
better than the FY 3 to 6 and having
those<00:02:52.019> 4<00:02:52.290> different<00:02:52.470> rates<00:02:52.769> means<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.250> you

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
those 4 different rates means that you

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.740 
those 4 different rates means that you
get<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.549> little<00:02:53.910> bit<00:02:54.000> more<00:02:54.209> fine<00:02:54.480> grained

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
get a little bit more fine grained

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.930 
get a little bit more fine grained
control<00:02:54.810> amongst<00:02:55.769> your<00:02:55.920> flying<00:02:56.160> as<00:02:56.640> far<00:02:56.849> as

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
control amongst your flying as far as

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.789 
control amongst your flying as far as
the<00:02:57.060> flips<00:02:57.329> they're<00:02:57.690> okay<00:02:58.290> they're<00:02:58.530> not<00:02:58.650> the

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
the flips they're okay they're not the

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.199 
the flips they're okay they're not the
best<00:02:58.890> I've<00:02:59.099> ever<00:02:59.250> seen<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.640> course<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.180> a

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
best I've ever seen of course it is a

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.059 
best I've ever seen of course it is a
large<00:03:00.569> plastic<00:03:00.930> craft<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.680> when<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:01.890> go<00:03:02.010> to

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
large plastic craft so when you go to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.440 
large plastic craft so when you go to
flip<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.610> takes<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:03.000> little<00:03:03.239> bit<00:03:03.390> more

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
flip it it takes a little bit more

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.270 
flip it it takes a little bit more
effort<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.260> they're<00:03:04.410> not<00:03:04.500> really<00:03:04.680> super<00:03:04.920> fast

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
effort so they're not really super fast

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.699 
effort so they're not really super fast
or<00:03:05.489> anything<00:03:05.730> they're<00:03:06.299> kind<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.630> big<00:03:07.049> but<00:03:07.620> they

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
or anything they're kind of big but they

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.140 
or anything they're kind of big but they
definitely<00:03:07.829> get<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.250> job<00:03:08.280> done<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.030> can

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
definitely get the job done and you can

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.000 
definitely get the job done and you can
even<00:03:09.269> do<00:03:09.510> some<00:03:09.720> double<00:03:10.079> flips<00:03:10.319> if<00:03:10.590> you're<00:03:10.799> very

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
even do some double flips if you're very

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.920 
even do some double flips if you're very
careful<00:03:11.280> not<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> fly<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.329> into<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.750> ground

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
careful not to fly it into the ground

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.839 
careful not to fly it into the ground
more<00:03:13.590> often<00:03:13.890> than<00:03:14.040> not<00:03:14.069> when<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.370> try<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.670> do

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
more often than not when I try to do

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.520 
more often than not when I try to do
double<00:03:15.120> flips<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.510> crashed<00:03:15.870> into<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.290> ground

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
double flips I crashed into the ground

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.140 
double flips I crashed into the ground
which<00:03:16.709> actually<00:03:17.040> does<00:03:17.250> speak<00:03:17.519> volumes<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
which actually does speak volumes to the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.849 
which actually does speak volumes to the
durability<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:19.019> thing<00:03:19.260> compared<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.769> the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
durability of this thing compared to the

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.069 
durability of this thing compared to the
FY<00:03:20.100> 3<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.430> 6<00:03:20.700> I've<00:03:21.000> slammed<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.720> directly

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
FY 3 to 6 I've slammed this directly

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.809 
FY 3 to 6 I've slammed this directly
into<00:03:22.290> concrete<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.280> does<00:03:23.489> not<00:03:23.609> have<00:03:23.790> a

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
into concrete and it does not have a

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.910 
into concrete and it does not have a
scratch<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.359> except<00:03:25.019> for<00:03:25.049> this<00:03:25.290> one<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.859> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
scratch on it except for this one of the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.800 
scratch on it except for this one of the
props<00:03:26.160> when<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.760> landed<00:03:27.150> hard<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.480> landed

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
props when I landed hard I landed

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.990 
props when I landed hard I landed
straight<00:03:27.930> down<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.829> prop<00:03:29.100> bent<00:03:29.489> straight<00:03:29.819> up

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
straight down the prop bent straight up

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.640 
straight down the prop bent straight up
so<00:03:30.389> of<00:03:30.480> course<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.810> was<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.989> little<00:03:31.200> bit<00:03:31.290> panicked

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
so of course I was a little bit panicked

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.620 
so of course I was a little bit panicked
but<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.130> bent<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.549> straight<00:03:32.850> back<00:03:33.000> down<00:03:33.060> and

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
but I bent it straight back down and

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.479 
but I bent it straight back down and
even<00:03:34.410> though<00:03:34.500> it's<00:03:34.620> got<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:34.799> white<00:03:35.160> line<00:03:35.459> on

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
even though it's got this white line on

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.740 
even though it's got this white line on
it<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:36.030> still<00:03:36.359> works

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
it it still works

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.660 
it it still works
it<00:03:36.930> still<00:03:37.260> works<00:03:37.380> quite<00:03:37.739> well<00:03:37.980> actually<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
it still works quite well actually and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.190 
it still works quite well actually and
other<00:03:38.970> than<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.480> flies<00:03:39.630> pretty

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
other than that it flies pretty

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.990 
other than that it flies pretty
similarly<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.980> all<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> rest<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.790> them<00:03:41.910> in

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
similarly to all of the rest of them in

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.120 
similarly to all of the rest of them in
this<00:03:42.090> genre<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.720> flies<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> lot<00:03:43.170> like<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.650> FY<00:03:43.980> 3

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
this genre it flies a lot like the FY 3

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.819 
this genre it flies a lot like the FY 3
to<00:03:44.370> 6<00:03:44.639> or<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.180> syma<00:03:45.389> x5c<00:03:45.870> but<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.769> said

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
to 6 or like the syma x5c but as I said

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.110 
to 6 or like the syma x5c but as I said
before<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.250> does<00:03:47.400> not<00:03:47.519> come<00:03:47.760> with<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> camera

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
before it does not come with a camera

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.670 
before it does not come with a camera
included<00:03:48.660> but<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:48.959> does<00:03:49.200> have<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.530> little

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
included but it does have this little

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.289 
included but it does have this little
plug<00:03:49.950> here<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.370> could<00:03:50.609> plug<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.880> camera

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
plug here that you could plug a camera

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.120 
plug here that you could plug a camera
and<00:03:51.480> if<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.690> wanted<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.200> but<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.799> don't<00:03:52.920> know

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
and if you wanted to but I don't know

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.650 
and if you wanted to but I don't know
why<00:03:53.250> you'd<00:03:53.400> want<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.760> because<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.180> real

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
why you'd want to because the one real

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.300 
why you'd want to because the one real
draw<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.230> as<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.590> mentioned<00:03:55.889> earlier<00:03:56.099> is

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
draw of this as I mentioned earlier is

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.370 
draw of this as I mentioned earlier is
that<00:03:56.549> it's<00:03:56.700> waterproof<00:03:57.120> now<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:57.930> was<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.170> little

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
that it's waterproof now I was a little

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.349 
that it's waterproof now I was a little
hesitant<00:03:58.470> about<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.099> at<00:03:59.250> first<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.730> what<00:04:00.239> did

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
hesitant about this at first so what did

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:00.710 
hesitant about this at first so what did
I<00:04:00.389> do

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
I do

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.229 
I do
I<00:04:00.930> took<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:02.040> put<00:04:02.069> it<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.670> shower<00:04:03.209> I

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
I took it and I put it in the shower I

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.849 
I took it and I put it in the shower I
turned<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.690> shower<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.349> turned<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
turned the shower on I turned on the

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.349 
turned the shower on I turned on the
quadcopter<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.489> paired<00:04:05.670> everything<00:04:06.000> up<00:04:06.150> and

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
quadcopter and paired everything up and

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.819 
quadcopter and paired everything up and
I<00:04:06.480> gave<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> little<00:04:07.049> bit<00:04:07.139> of<00:04:07.230> throttle<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.650> I

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
I gave it a little bit of throttle and I

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.620 
I gave it a little bit of throttle and I
just<00:04:08.040> held<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.489> in<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.730> shower<00:04:09.000> stream<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.510> see

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
just held it in the shower stream to see

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.199 
just held it in the shower stream to see
what<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.840> would<00:04:09.930> do<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.319> it<00:04:10.829> kept<00:04:11.130> going<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:12.180> I

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
what it would do and it kept going so I

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.580 
what it would do and it kept going so I
put<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.750> down<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.049> base<00:04:13.169> of<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.410> shower

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
put it down in the base of the shower

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.800 
put it down in the base of the shower
and<00:04:13.859> I<00:04:13.919> took<00:04:13.980> off<00:04:14.430> in<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.000> shower<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.599> only

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
and I took off in the shower the only

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.390 
and I took off in the shower the only
real<00:04:15.930> problem<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.320> had<00:04:16.470> there<00:04:16.650> was<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.160> shower

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
real problem it had there was the shower

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.310 
real problem it had there was the shower
was<00:04:17.669> really<00:04:17.940> pouring<00:04:18.329> down<00:04:18.510> on<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.200> was

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
was really pouring down on it and it was

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.779 
was really pouring down on it and it was
kind<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.620> beating<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.099> down<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.519> was<00:04:20.639> hard

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
kind of beating it down so it was hard

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.610 
kind of beating it down so it was hard
to<00:04:20.880> keep<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.150> in<00:04:21.269> place<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.140> got<00:04:22.500> me

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
to keep it in place so that got me

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.310 
to keep it in place so that got me
inspired<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.370> actually<00:04:24.030> yesterday<00:04:24.479> we

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
inspired and actually yesterday we

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.590 
inspired and actually yesterday we
a<00:04:25.350> horrible<00:04:26.160> horrible<00:04:26.460> thunderstorm<00:04:27.300> so<00:04:27.570> I

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
a horrible horrible thunderstorm so I

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.210 
a horrible horrible thunderstorm so I
took<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.870> out<00:04:28.080> in<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.320> rain<00:04:28.500> there<00:04:29.070> have<00:04:29.160> been

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220

took it out in the rain there have been
so<00:04:29.430> many<00:04:29.490> days<00:04:29.790> where<00:04:30.060> I've<00:04:30.150> wanted<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.540> go<00:04:30.690> out

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
so many days where I've wanted to go out

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.690 
so many days where I've wanted to go out
and<00:04:30.930> fly<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.080> quadcopter<00:04:31.380> but<00:04:31.920> I<00:04:31.950> can't<00:04:32.430> because

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
and fly a quadcopter but I can't because

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.130 
and fly a quadcopter but I can't because
we<00:04:32.940> get<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.120> decent<00:04:33.540> amount<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.750> rain<00:04:33.900> here

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
we get a decent amount of rain here

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.320 
we get a decent amount of rain here
where<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.320> live<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.070> was<00:04:35.370> absolutely<00:04:35.670> pumped

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
where I live so I was absolutely pumped

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.910 
where I live so I was absolutely pumped
to<00:04:36.420> have<00:04:36.570> this<00:04:36.690> opportunity<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.320> try<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:37.650> out

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
to have this opportunity to try this out

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.560 
to have this opportunity to try this out
in<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.310> rain<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:38.880> took<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.150> out<00:04:39.270> there<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.540> I

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
in the rain so I took it out there and I

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.210 
in the rain so I took it out there and I
flew<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:39.900> in<00:04:40.050> some<00:04:40.260> lighter<00:04:40.500> rain<00:04:40.770> earlier<00:04:41.160> in

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
flew it in some lighter rain earlier in

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.830 
flew it in some lighter rain earlier in
the<00:04:41.370> day<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:42.120> performed<00:04:42.570> beautifully

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
the day and it performed beautifully

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.690 
the day and it performed beautifully
except<00:04:43.680> for<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.890> fact<00:04:44.040> that<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.220> can't<00:04:44.550> see

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
except for the fact that I can't see

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.490 
except for the fact that I can't see
distance<00:04:45.060> very<00:04:45.270> well<00:04:45.450> so<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:45.810> ended<00:04:46.170> up<00:04:46.260> in<00:04:46.440> a

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
distance very well so I ended up in a

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.170 
distance very well so I ended up in a
tree<00:04:46.770> but<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.370> second<00:04:47.670> time<00:04:47.790> when<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.090> was

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
tree but the second time when it was

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.000 
tree but the second time when it was
absolutely<00:04:48.780> pouring<00:04:49.050> down<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.470> rain<00:04:49.650> I<00:04:49.830> took

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
absolutely pouring down the rain I took

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.650 
absolutely pouring down the rain I took
it<00:04:50.130> out<00:04:50.220> there<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.790> had<00:04:51.000> absolutely<00:04:51.210> no

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
it out there it had absolutely no

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.480 
it out there it had absolutely no
problems<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:52.320> only<00:04:52.500> kept<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.830> out<00:04:52.950> for<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.220> couple

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
problems I only kept it out for a couple

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.890 
problems I only kept it out for a couple
of<00:04:53.610> minutes<00:04:53.760> at<00:04:54.000> that<00:04:54.090> point<00:04:54.420> but<00:04:54.720> it<00:04:54.870> just

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
of minutes at that point but it just

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.420 
of minutes at that point but it just
down<00:04:55.260> poured<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.680> rain<00:04:55.830> on<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.250> wind

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
down poured the rain on it the wind

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.370 
down poured the rain on it the wind
pushed<00:04:56.730> it<00:04:56.910> around<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.540> I<00:04:57.870> did<00:04:58.080> not<00:04:58.230> lose

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
pushed it around and I did not lose

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.320 
pushed it around and I did not lose
control<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:59.040> didn't<00:04:59.370> crash<00:04:59.610> I<00:04:59.850> didn't<00:05:00.090> have<00:05:00.180> any

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
control I didn't crash I didn't have any

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.420 
control I didn't crash I didn't have any
real<00:05:00.570> issues<00:05:01.050> now<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.470> should<00:05:01.770> say<00:05:01.800> there<00:05:02.220> have

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
real issues now I should say there have

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.310 
real issues now I should say there have
been<00:05:02.610> some<00:05:02.970> minor<00:05:03.240> issues<00:05:03.810> with<00:05:03.960> regard<00:05:04.260> to

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
been some minor issues with regard to

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.080 
been some minor issues with regard to
the<00:05:04.470> waterproofing<00:05:05.070> such<00:05:05.460> that<00:05:05.670> if<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:05.940> gets

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
the waterproofing such that if it gets

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.360 
the waterproofing such that if it gets
too<00:05:06.330> wet<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:06.780> lands<00:05:07.440> or<00:05:07.560> crashes<00:05:08.250> or

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
too wet and lands or crashes or

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.040 
too wet and lands or crashes or
something<00:05:08.520> it's<00:05:09.000> gonna<00:05:09.210> probably<00:05:09.510> just<00:05:09.840> turn

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
something it's gonna probably just turn

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.750 
something it's gonna probably just turn
off<00:05:10.260> its<00:05:10.560> gonna<00:05:10.710> stop<00:05:10.980> responding<00:05:11.310> entirely

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
off its gonna stop responding entirely

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.370 
off its gonna stop responding entirely
that's<00:05:12.270> part<00:05:12.540> of<00:05:12.600> what<00:05:12.750> happened<00:05:13.050> whenever<00:05:13.320> I

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
that's part of what happened whenever I

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.080 
that's part of what happened whenever I
crashed<00:05:13.740> out<00:05:13.950> in<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.160> rain<00:05:14.340> was<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:15.000> the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
crashed out in the rain was that the

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.790 
crashed out in the rain was that the
motors<00:05:15.330> just<00:05:15.570> stopped<00:05:15.780> working<00:05:15.870> entirely<00:05:16.380> now

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
motors just stopped working entirely now

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.110 
motors just stopped working entirely now
that<00:05:16.950> wasn't<00:05:17.280> necessarily<00:05:17.610> because<00:05:17.910> of<00:05:17.940> the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
that wasn't necessarily because of the

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.940 
that wasn't necessarily because of the
rain<00:05:18.300> but<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:18.630> was<00:05:18.750> because<00:05:19.080> it<00:05:19.350> landed<00:05:19.830> or

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
rain but it was because it landed or

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.800 
rain but it was because it landed or
crashed<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:20.940> was<00:05:21.000> raining<00:05:21.300> so<00:05:21.480> I<00:05:21.660> guess

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
crashed and it was raining so I guess

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.880 
crashed and it was raining so I guess
somewhere<00:05:22.110> there's<00:05:22.290> some<00:05:22.440> sort<00:05:22.590> of<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.740> water

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
somewhere there's some sort of a water

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.620 
somewhere there's some sort of a water
sensor<00:05:23.370> in<00:05:23.460> here<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:23.910> it<00:05:24.090> just<00:05:24.120> turns<00:05:24.390> itself

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
sensor in here and it just turns itself

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.480 
sensor in here and it just turns itself
off<00:05:24.810> for<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.080> sake<00:05:25.200> of<00:05:25.260> safety<00:05:25.590> however<00:05:26.310> that

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
off for the sake of safety however that

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.520 
off for the sake of safety however that
might<00:05:26.730> be<00:05:26.880> kind<00:05:27.180> of<00:05:27.270> wrong<00:05:27.510> because<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.440> this

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
might be kind of wrong because just this

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.380 
might be kind of wrong because just this
afternoon<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:29.190> took<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:29.640> out<00:05:29.790> to<00:05:30.000> a<00:05:30.030> lake

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
afternoon I took this out to a lake

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.120 
afternoon I took this out to a lake
nearby<00:05:30.690> I'd<00:05:31.200> seen<00:05:31.440> some<00:05:31.620> videos<00:05:31.710> of<00:05:32.040> people

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
nearby I'd seen some videos of people

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.280 
nearby I'd seen some videos of people
trying<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.670> fly<00:05:32.820> this<00:05:33.030> on<00:05:33.270> water<00:05:33.540> or<00:05:33.840> in<00:05:34.050> water

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
trying to fly this on water or in water

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.200 
trying to fly this on water or in water
so<00:05:34.740> I<00:05:34.770> decided<00:05:35.100> to<00:05:35.250> try<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.430> myself<00:05:35.640> but<00:05:36.030> I<00:05:36.120> was

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
so I decided to try it myself but I was

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.700 
so I decided to try it myself but I was
a<00:05:36.270> little<00:05:36.420> bit<00:05:36.630> hesitant<00:05:36.750> about<00:05:37.080> it<00:05:37.230> after<00:05:37.680> I

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
a little bit hesitant about it after I

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.200 
a little bit hesitant about it after I
took<00:05:37.890> it<00:05:38.010> out<00:05:38.070> over<00:05:38.370> the<00:05:38.490> lake<00:05:38.670> just<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:39.000> little

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
took it out over the lake just a little

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.450 
took it out over the lake just a little
bit<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.540> let<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.050> drop<00:05:40.320> it<00:05:40.710> hit<00:05:40.890> the<00:05:41.010> water<00:05:41.160> it

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
bit I let it drop it hit the water it

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.280 
bit I let it drop it hit the water it
splashed<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.240> I<00:05:42.570> was<00:05:42.690> able<00:05:42.780> to<00:05:42.900> take<00:05:43.050> right

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
splashed and I was able to take right

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.960 
splashed and I was able to take right
back<00:05:43.470> off<00:05:43.650> I<00:05:43.890> was<00:05:44.010> able<00:05:44.100> to<00:05:44.190> spin<00:05:44.430> around<00:05:44.520> I<00:05:44.880> was

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
back off I was able to spin around I was

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.730 
back off I was able to spin around I was
able<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.210> pitch<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.020> roll<00:05:46.140> left<00:05:46.500> right

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
able to pitch and roll left right

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.500 
able to pitch and roll left right
forward<00:05:46.980> back<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.640> it<00:05:47.910> would<00:05:48.000> actually<00:05:48.270> dip

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
forward back and it would actually dip

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.240 
forward back and it would actually dip
the<00:05:48.690> propellers<00:05:49.110> down<00:05:49.350> into<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.740> water<00:05:49.950> and

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
the propellers down into the water and

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.040 
the propellers down into the water and
push<00:05:50.610> against<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.180> water<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.630> move<00:05:51.720> itself

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
push against the water to move itself

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.200 
push against the water to move itself
very<00:05:52.800> very<00:05:52.890> cool<00:05:53.250> stuff<00:05:53.460> and<00:05:53.790> I<00:05:53.910> was<00:05:54.000> able<00:05:54.120> to

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
very very cool stuff and I was able to

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.850 
very very cool stuff and I was able to
take<00:05:54.390> back<00:05:54.570> off<00:05:54.750> from<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.170> water<00:05:55.350> I<00:05:55.470> was<00:05:55.680> able

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
take back off from the water I was able

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.650 
take back off from the water I was able
to<00:05:55.890> do<00:05:56.040> flips<00:05:56.340> and<00:05:56.520> crash<00:05:56.970> down<00:05:57.240> into<00:05:57.570> the

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
to do flips and crash down into the

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.420 
to do flips and crash down into the
water<00:05:57.810> and<00:05:58.080> have<00:05:58.230> it<00:05:58.320> keep<00:05:58.500> going<00:05:58.740> I<00:05:59.100> didn't

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
water and have it keep going I didn't

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.920 
water and have it keep going I didn't
actually<00:05:59.550> end<00:05:59.880> up<00:05:59.910> going<00:06:00.090> very<00:06:00.390> deep<00:06:00.480> under

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
actually end up going very deep under

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.480 
actually end up going very deep under
the<00:06:00.960> water<00:06:01.080> at<00:06:01.380> any<00:06:01.500> point<00:06:01.770> there's<00:06:02.160> one<00:06:02.340> point

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
the water at any point there's one point

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.430 
the water at any point there's one point
where<00:06:02.640> it<00:06:03.000> did<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.180> flip<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:03.690> it<00:06:03.780> landed<00:06:04.110> upside

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
where it did a flip and it landed upside

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.350 
where it did a flip and it landed upside
down<00:06:04.620> on<00:06:04.920> the<00:06:05.040> water<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.520> sunk<00:06:05.850> a<00:06:05.970> bit<00:06:06.120> and

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
down on the water and sunk a bit and

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.210 
down on the water and sunk a bit and
just<00:06:06.690> for<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:06.930> sake<00:06:07.050> of<00:06:07.200> testing<00:06:07.590> I<00:06:07.710> tried<00:06:08.040> it

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
just for the sake of testing I tried it

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.740 
just for the sake of testing I tried it
again<00:06:08.280> and<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.670> motors<00:06:08.940> actually<00:06:09.300> tried<00:06:09.540> to

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
again and the motors actually tried to

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.450 
again and the motors actually tried to
spin<00:06:09.960> under<00:06:10.200> the<00:06:10.320> water<00:06:10.500> too<00:06:10.740> but<00:06:11.280> at<00:06:11.370> that

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
spin under the water too but at that

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.770 
spin under the water too but at that
point<00:06:11.670> it<00:06:11.820> had<00:06:11.910> hit<00:06:12.060> the<00:06:12.150> bottom<00:06:12.450> and<00:06:12.600> so<00:06:12.690> it

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
point it had hit the bottom and so it

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.390 
point it had hit the bottom and so it
didn't<00:06:12.990> really<00:06:13.020> want<00:06:13.320> to<00:06:13.350> spin<00:06:13.590> very<00:06:13.770> well<00:06:13.950> but

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
didn't really want to spin very well but

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.740 
didn't really want to spin very well but
I<00:06:14.430> pulled<00:06:14.670> it<00:06:14.790> back<00:06:14.910> out<00:06:15.060> I<00:06:15.090> set<00:06:15.480> it<00:06:15.600> back<00:06:15.690> down

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
I pulled it back out I set it back down

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.170 
I pulled it back out I set it back down
on<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.170> water<00:06:16.350> and<00:06:16.650> it<00:06:16.920> took<00:06:17.100> off<00:06:17.250> again<00:06:17.460> now

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
on the water and it took off again now

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.550 
on the water and it took off again now
there<00:06:18.330> was<00:06:18.480> one<00:06:18.720> instance<00:06:19.020> when<00:06:19.230> I<00:06:19.260> was<00:06:19.440> out

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
there was one instance when I was out

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.260 
there was one instance when I was out
there<00:06:19.590> and<00:06:19.980> something<00:06:20.640> went<00:06:20.940> completely

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
there and something went completely

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.030 
there and something went completely
weird<00:06:21.780> the<00:06:22.230> motors<00:06:22.500> just<00:06:22.620> kept<00:06:22.860> right<00:06:23.010> on

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
weird the motors just kept right on

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.920 
weird the motors just kept right on
spinning<00:06:23.640> even<00:06:24.240> though<00:06:24.360> I<00:06:24.390> had<00:06:24.600> turned<00:06:24.750> the

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
spinning even though I had turned the

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.570 
spinning even though I had turned the
throttle<00:06:25.230> off<00:06:25.410> but<00:06:25.890> once<00:06:26.040> I<00:06:26.100> picked<00:06:26.280> it<00:06:26.400> up<00:06:26.430> out

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
throttle off but once I picked it up out

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
throttle off but once I picked it up out
of<00:06:26.610> the<00:06:26.700> water<00:06:26.850> I<00:06:26.940> just<00:06:27.030> kind<00:06:27.270> of<00:06:27.300> grabbed<00:06:27.480> it

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
of the water I just kind of grabbed it

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.760 
of the water I just kind of grabbed it
like<00:06:27.720> this<00:06:27.810> and<00:06:27.990> lifted<00:06:28.290> it<00:06:28.320> up

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
like this and lifted it up

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.920 
like this and lifted it up
the<00:06:29.100> motors<00:06:29.370> stopped<00:06:29.760> immediately<00:06:30.060> so<00:06:30.780> there

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
the motors stopped immediately so there

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.990 
the motors stopped immediately so there
may<00:06:31.080> be<00:06:31.110> some<00:06:31.500> weird<00:06:31.800> issues<00:06:32.190> there<00:06:32.460> but<00:06:32.640> in

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
may be some weird issues there but in

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.520 
may be some weird issues there but in
this<00:06:33.090> case<00:06:33.270> I<00:06:33.450> was<00:06:33.540> very<00:06:33.810> very<00:06:33.990> lucky<00:06:34.200> I<00:06:34.350> was

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
this case I was very very lucky I was

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.200 
this case I was very very lucky I was
able<00:06:34.620> to<00:06:34.740> take<00:06:34.919> it<00:06:35.040> out<00:06:35.130> on<00:06:35.190> the<00:06:35.520> water<00:06:35.669> and<00:06:35.970> in

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
able to take it out on the water and in

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.470 
able to take it out on the water and in
the

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
the

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.820 
the
water<00:06:36.600> and<00:06:36.810> I<00:06:37.020> didn't<00:06:37.290> have<00:06:37.410> any<00:06:37.560> real

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
water and I didn't have any real

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.470 
water and I didn't have any real
problems<00:06:38.100> I<00:06:38.430> didn't<00:06:38.610> have<00:06:38.730> to<00:06:38.820> restart<00:06:39.270> it<00:06:39.360> at

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
problems I didn't have to restart it at

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.330 
problems I didn't have to restart it at
any<00:06:39.630> point<00:06:39.870> so<00:06:40.410> I<00:06:40.440> was<00:06:40.650> very<00:06:40.710> pleased<00:06:41.160> with

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
any point so I was very pleased with

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.010 
any point so I was very pleased with
that<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:41.730> actually<00:06:42.240> as<00:06:42.330> you<00:06:42.420> can<00:06:42.480> see<00:06:42.690> it<00:06:42.900> is

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
that and actually as you can see it is

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.260 
that and actually as you can see it is
still<00:06:43.290> wet<00:06:43.680> at<00:06:43.860> this<00:06:43.980> point<00:06:44.280> and<00:06:44.520> if<00:06:44.820> I<00:06:44.940> open<00:06:45.090> it

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
still wet at this point and if I open it

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.720 
still wet at this point and if I open it
up<00:06:45.420> it's<00:06:45.990> actually<00:06:46.230> wet<00:06:46.770> down<00:06:47.250> inside<00:06:47.700> of

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
up it's actually wet down inside of

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.890 
up it's actually wet down inside of
there<00:06:47.970> so<00:06:48.090> I'm<00:06:48.180> guessing<00:06:48.420> you<00:06:48.480> have<00:06:48.570> some<00:06:48.720> sort

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
there so I'm guessing you have some sort

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.240 
there so I'm guessing you have some sort
of<00:06:48.930> a<00:06:48.990> waterproof<00:06:49.230> coating<00:06:49.620> on<00:06:49.860> the<00:06:50.040> board

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
of a waterproof coating on the board

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.280 
of a waterproof coating on the board
it's<00:06:50.730> not<00:06:50.880> hugely<00:06:51.270> wet<00:06:51.570> but<00:06:51.780> it<00:06:51.870> definitely<00:06:52.170> is

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
it's not hugely wet but it definitely is

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.900 
it's not hugely wet but it definitely is
wet<00:06:52.560> down<00:06:52.740> in<00:06:52.920> there<00:06:53.100> when<00:06:53.610> I<00:06:53.640> pulled<00:06:53.880> the

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
wet down in there when I pulled the

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.520 
wet down in there when I pulled the
battery<00:06:54.090> out<00:06:54.300> it<00:06:54.450> was<00:06:54.570> not<00:06:54.750> wet<00:06:55.050> though<00:06:55.260> so<00:06:55.470> I

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
battery out it was not wet though so I

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.110 
battery out it was not wet though so I
was<00:06:55.620> a<00:06:55.680> little<00:06:55.770> bit<00:06:55.950> confused<00:06:56.340> by<00:06:56.490> that<00:06:56.640> so<00:06:57.060> to

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
was a little bit confused by that so to

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.310 
was a little bit confused by that so to
go<00:06:57.270> ahead<00:06:57.330> and<00:06:57.480> wrap<00:06:57.600> things<00:06:57.780> up<00:06:57.990> what<00:06:58.200> do<00:06:58.260> I

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
go ahead and wrap things up what do I

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.750 
go ahead and wrap things up what do I
think<00:06:58.350> of<00:06:58.620> this<00:06:58.680> thing<00:06:58.920> if<00:06:59.310> you've<00:06:59.550> been<00:06:59.670> in

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
think of this thing if you've been in

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.100 
think of this thing if you've been in
the<00:06:59.790> market<00:07:00.090> for<00:07:00.180> something<00:07:00.510> like<00:07:00.660> the<00:07:00.810> syma

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
the market for something like the syma

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.130 
the market for something like the syma
x5c<00:07:01.500> or<00:07:02.040> the<00:07:02.490> FY<00:07:02.760> three<00:07:02.970> to<00:07:03.150> six<00:07:03.420> this<00:07:03.900> is

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.140 
x5c or the FY three to six this is

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.690
