00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello friends of 'youtube' I am ex ex monster destroyer csi now I bring you my 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.889
 first video of secrets and curiosities of videogames very well let's start 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.799
 this time we will talk about mario bros 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.539
 let's start with 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.529
 bounce on the walls 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.759
 consists of pressing the jump button again when Mario is next to 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.710
 a wall so that it comes bouncing upwards as if it will lean on the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.960
 wall to make a new jump 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.529
 In theory this phenomenon is due to the simple calculation system that uses 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.670
 the game to adjust the horizontal position of mario 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.220
 the game calculates if mario is in a position that is multiple of 16 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.350
 and if there is a solid block under the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.400
 however as part of mario's body is inside a wall the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.770
 esprit that propelled him up 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.800
 is very common in many platform games so I tried it in others 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.890
 it might work 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.020
 so that the trick works, it is necessary that Mario reaches the wall with some 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.040
 speed and that the pulsation is made in the gap between sprites 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.440
 every 16 pixels in the case of super mario bros 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.710
 in fact 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.070
 if they are fixed with attention they will see that the matching jumps for example in the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.480
 Union between two rows of soil blocks 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.490
 in the image you can see how each object in the game is composed 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.340
 by esprit is 16 16 pixels being able to take advantage of the areas of union between 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.410
 them to perform this trick 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.680
 in this workshop 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.180
 mario skater 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.140
 this trick is really simple to do 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.530
 to do it, it is necessary to have a fire 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.690
 When you start a level or exit through a pipeline, you must press the button at the same time 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.810
 you jump and keep pushing me when mario falls to the ground 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.170
 for a few seconds mario will slide across the floor instead of 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.990
 walk 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.590
 it's not really useful 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.070
 but very fun 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.470
 Another very common vessel does not always occur in other games but this is due to a 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.240
 collision error 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.960
 turtle propulsion 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.310
 this trick is not only fun but allows mario to perform more jumps 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.810
 long than normal 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.770
 if mario hit a flying turtle while it is in the air 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.270
 the upward movement of the mario jump will not stop providing it 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.719
 an additional boost 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.579
 this trick is then adapted but consciously in the mario and luigi 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.869
 go through walls 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:22.009
 this is one of the most exploited super mario ships to all 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.029
 has ever been out of our house 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:29.149
 it's an easy trick to do if we drive super mario can also be done 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.909
 with mario but it's a bit more complicated to get it, just jump against 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.259
 a corner at the same time we bend over and start walking 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:41.449
 Mario will begin to slide inside the wall and be ejected by the other 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:42.099
 side 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.250
 It is important not to touch any button during the process because if we do 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.459
 will be expelled by the opposite side where we entered 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.989
 I hate these fucking errors 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.849
 one hundred lives in the world 3 1 to the fianl of the scene on the stairs and two turtles 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.799
 lets go the first turtle 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.109
 wait for the second jump a little when it reaches you and you'll start it 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.109
 jump several times and you will get many lives 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.719
 you are small or big 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.989
 in any case, when that cup comes, do not make it fall, wait before 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.680
 to press the button when cup comes to you as close as you can 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.399
 wait jump and press the button it will press psychopathy bra touched on that 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:32.370
 moment to follow the big ones but in reality you are small in the next 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.769
 scene when aguirre is a mushroom that you will make small and with a palette 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.499
 you will throw little ball being small 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.499
 the trick you should not do being great symbolic 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:45.779
 turtul gytis 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:51.040
 in the world 3 2 there is a place where there is a flattened turtle and so move forward and 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.599
 kill many others but when you are about to kill the actors left the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.290
 move on until you get off the screen and then walk around a bit and kill 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.969
 to another one so you'll get a life 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.969
 do not grab the star that is behind or it will not work 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.569
 I 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.409
 two 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.489
 two 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.159
 in this moment
