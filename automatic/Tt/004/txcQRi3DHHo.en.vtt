living<00:00:14.700> fine<00:00:15.379> question<00:00:16.379> number<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.830> is

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
living fine question number one is

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.870 
living fine question number one is
somebody<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:19.470> removing<00:00:19.800> carbon<00:00:20.279> buildup<00:00:20.670> on

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
somebody just removing carbon buildup on

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.109 
somebody just removing carbon buildup on
the<00:00:21.090> valves<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.689> piston<00:00:22.250> after<00:00:23.250> 6.5

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the valves and piston after 6.5

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.990 
the valves and piston after 6.5
horsepower<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.840> come<00:00:25.080> soon

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
horsepower to come soon

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.269 
horsepower to come soon
so<00:00:27.630> they<00:00:27.779> had<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.080> remove<00:00:28.259> the<00:00:28.470> head<00:00:28.679> to<00:00:29.130> do

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so they had to remove the head to do

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.700 
so they had to remove the head to do
this<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.449> guy<00:00:30.750> says<00:00:31.050> I'd<00:00:31.199> invite<00:00:31.500> any

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
this now the guy says I'd invite any

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.619 
this now the guy says I'd invite any
head<00:00:31.859> gasket<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.610> fighting<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.510> old

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
head gasket and just fighting the old

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.869 
head gasket and just fighting the old
one<00:00:33.930> back<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.379> is<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.040> hurting<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.579> engine

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
one back on is this hurting the engine

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.510 
one back on is this hurting the engine
or<00:00:36.120> affecting<00:00:36.510> its<00:00:36.690> performance<00:00:37.520> so

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
or affecting its performance so

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.950 
or affecting its performance so
basically<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.149> asking<00:00:39.420> me<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.809> can

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
basically it's asking me if you can

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.869 
basically it's asking me if you can
reuse<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.470> head<00:00:40.590> gasket<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.340> long<00:00:41.519> as<00:00:41.699> it's

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
reuse the head gasket as long as it's

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.020 
reuse the head gasket as long as it's
not<00:00:42.090> been<00:00:42.300> taken<00:00:42.690> apart<00:00:42.780> ten<00:00:43.410> times<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.160> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
not been taken apart ten times and that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.430 
not been taken apart ten times and that
the<00:00:45.300> foil<00:00:45.900> on<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.559> gasket<00:00:46.769> isn't<00:00:47.519> separating

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
the foil on the gasket isn't separating

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.990 
the foil on the gasket isn't separating
from<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.800> rest<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.159> the<00:00:50.220> gasket<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:50.820> you're

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
from the rest of the gasket then you're

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.619 
from the rest of the gasket then you're
fine

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
fine

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.840 
fine
in<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.140> case<00:00:52.470> you<00:00:52.710> could<00:00:52.890> grind<00:00:53.250> off<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
in this case you could grind off all the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.479 
in this case you could grind off all the
carbon<00:00:54.239> off<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.540> engine<00:00:54.989> stick<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.010> back<00:00:56.159> on

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
carbon off this engine stick it back on

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.810 
carbon off this engine stick it back on
and<00:00:56.730> torque<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> head<00:00:57.659> on<00:00:57.809> properly<00:00:58.549> and<00:00:59.549> your

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and torque the head on properly and your

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
and torque the head on properly and your
gasket<00:01:00.360> is<00:01:00.479> still<00:01:00.720> good<00:01:00.989> always<00:01:01.739> check<00:01:01.979> for

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
gasket is still good always check for

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
gasket is still good always check for
oil<00:01:02.400> leaks<00:01:02.519> between<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.689> head<00:01:03.900> and<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
oil leaks between the head and the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.399 
oil leaks between the head and the
cylinder<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.670> leaks<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.600> replace<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
cylinder if it leaks then replace the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.609 
cylinder if it leaks then replace the
gasket<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.970> said<00:01:09.270> most<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.530> time

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
gasket but like I said most of the time

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.490 
gasket but like I said most of the time
you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.549> reuse<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.119> gasket<00:01:12.360> question<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you can reuse this gasket question is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.679 
you can reuse this gasket question is
how<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.369> adjust<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.790> high<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.180> low<00:01:15.210> screw

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
how do you adjust a high or low screw

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.020 
how do you adjust a high or low screw
when<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.259> running<00:01:16.560> full<00:01:16.799> throttle<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.490> this

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
when it's running full throttle so this

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
when it's running full throttle so this
would<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.420> small<00:01:18.780> few<00:01:18.960> cycle<00:01:19.350> engines<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
would be on small few cycle engines and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.530 
would be on small few cycle engines and
I'll<00:01:20.159> show<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.430> how<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.180> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
I'll show you how to do that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.660 
I'll show you how to do that
so<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.439> are<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.619> carburetors<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> came

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so here are some carburetors that came

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760 
so here are some carburetors that came
off<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.090> two<00:01:24.360> cycle<00:01:24.570> engine<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.590> see

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
off of a two cycle engine you can see

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.390 
off of a two cycle engine you can see
here<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.369> L<00:01:26.610> screw<00:01:27.030> high<00:01:27.240> screw<00:01:27.659> L<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> H<00:01:29.040> so

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
here the L screw high screw L and H so

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
here the L screw high screw L and H so
basically<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.420> would<00:01:30.540> adjust<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> high

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
basically you would adjust the high

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.950 
basically you would adjust the high
screw<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.920> full<00:01:32.280> throttle<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.840> would

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
screw with full throttle and you would

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.770 
screw with full throttle and you would
adjust<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.500> L<00:01:34.800> screw<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.240> machine<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
adjust the L screw when your machine is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.380 
adjust the L screw when your machine is
idling<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> would<00:01:38.430> adjust<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.880> H<00:01:39.030> screw

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
idling so you would adjust the H screw

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.750 
idling so you would adjust the H screw
at<00:01:39.630> full<00:01:39.900> throttle<00:01:40.170> until<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.220> get<00:01:41.370> a<00:01:41.400> happy

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
at full throttle until you get a happy

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.390 
at full throttle until you get a happy
medium<00:01:42.120> and<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> else<00:01:43.470> brew<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.250> would

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
medium and for the else brew you would

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.490 
medium and for the else brew you would
adjust<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.909> when<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.330> engines<00:01:45.690> idling<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
adjust that when the engines idling and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
adjust that when the engines idling and
you<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.400> turn<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.820> screw<00:01:48.120> until<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.690> onion

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you would turn the screw until the onion

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.370 
you would turn the screw until the onion
idles<00:01:50.250> nice<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.850> steady

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
idles nice and steady

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.750 
idles nice and steady
where<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.530> feel<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.490> stall

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
where you feel it's not going to stall

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.719 
where you feel it's not going to stall
and<00:01:54.030> die<00:01:54.900> out<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.460> would

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and die out on you and then you would

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
machine title slower you would turn out

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.990 
machine title slower you would turn out
this<00:03:17.840> screw<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.739> that's<00:03:19.069> all<00:03:19.250> there<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.459> these

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
this screw so that's all there is these

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.199 
this screw so that's all there is these
few<00:03:20.239> carbs<00:03:20.540> here<00:03:20.870> are<00:03:21.230> identical<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:23.000> there

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
few carbs here are identical and there

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.170 
few carbs here are identical and there
is<00:03:23.329> no<00:03:23.569> adjusting<00:03:23.750> screws<00:03:24.519> some<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:25.760> older

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
is no adjusting screws some of the older

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.680 
is no adjusting screws some of the older
machines<00:03:26.359> may<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.439> adjusting<00:03:27.889> screws<00:03:28.690> but

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
machines may have adjusting screws but

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.569

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
now even on some two cycle trimmers do

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.819 
now even on some two cycle trimmers do
not<00:03:34.849> have<00:03:35.090> adjusting<00:03:35.599> screws<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.470> if<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:36.709> have

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
not have adjusting screws so if you have

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.729 
not have adjusting screws so if you have
problems<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.669> may<00:03:38.269> have<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.780> tear<00:03:39.260> open<00:03:39.290> your
