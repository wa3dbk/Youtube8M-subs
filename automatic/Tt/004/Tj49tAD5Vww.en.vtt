00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
together whatever I could so with this I

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.810

I<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:22.229> together<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> my<00:01:23.280> revised<00:01:23.580> when

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
I put together this is my revised when

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.969 
I put together this is my revised when
you<00:01:23.880> deck<00:01:24.060> put<00:01:24.390> together<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:25.020> lot<00:01:25.350> better<00:01:25.619> I

you deck put together a lot better I

think it retains about like I would say

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.719 
think it retains about like I would say
70<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.939> percent<00:01:33.710> maybe<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.799> little<00:01:34.979> less<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
70 or so percent maybe a little less of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.050 
70 or so percent maybe a little less of
all<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> cards<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.939> alright<00:01:38.939> so

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
great 22 for flying that's great so

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.569 
great 22 for flying that's great so
that's<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.590> for<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.769> creature<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.340> three

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
that's it for the creature is this three

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.199 
that's it for the creature is this three
of<00:03:18.670> those<00:03:18.760> um<00:03:20.190> moving<00:03:21.190> on<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.310> all<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:21.970> other

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
of those um moving on to all the other

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.199 
of those um moving on to all the other
spells<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.690> there's<00:03:23.579> probably<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:24.670> think

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
spells and there's probably I think

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.520 
spells and there's probably I think
that's<00:03:25.420> probably<00:03:25.540> more<00:03:25.840> spells<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.350> our

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
that's probably more spells and our

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.220 
that's probably more spells and our
creatures<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.730> I'm<00:03:27.850> not<00:03:27.970> sure<00:03:28.120> if<00:03:28.239> this<00:03:28.420> can<00:03:29.109> be

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
creatures so I'm not sure if this can be

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.840 
creatures so I'm not sure if this can be
considered<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.650> weenie<00:03:29.859> Veck<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.340> matter<00:03:30.670> if<00:03:30.730> you

so that way creatures can attack you and

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.630 
so that way creatures can attack you and
even<00:04:23.110> if<00:04:23.200> you<00:04:23.289> do<00:04:23.470> still<00:04:23.919> creatures<00:04:24.490> with
