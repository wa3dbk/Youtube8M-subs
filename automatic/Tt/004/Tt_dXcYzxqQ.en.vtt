00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.240
 very good kids welcome to a 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.990
 new video for the channel and for the blog 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.330
 wordpress.com this time I'm going to 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.870
 make a video about how to update 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.560
 from the windows 7 operating system 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.490
 to the new windows 10 that a few days ago 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.630
 a few weeks the version came out 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.820
 let's say public of the beta to try and 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.080
 I will teach you how from your own 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.950
 windows 7 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.160
 can be installed is this preview this 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.079
 beta without losing any type of program 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.600
 neither of document nor of configuration that 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.079
 have on the team then the steps 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.910
 to follow 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.320
 would be the following the first thing that 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.060
 we would have to do would be to enter 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.760
 Internet 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.070
 and download the image the iso image 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.840
 from the microsoft website 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.840
 here is less to windows 10 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.700
 is this link download and on windows 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.590
 10 inside the preview you give 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.360
 here you see it good sign up 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.680
 program speaks speaks nothing we what 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.440
 what interests us is these links of 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.310
 download which we select Spanish 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.790
 and either the 64-bit version or the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.200
 32 bit I'm going to download it not the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.150
 I'm going to download but I have it 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.590
 download is the one that you 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.220
 correspond to our systems then 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.130
 with 77 gigabyte that of 64 and 2 with 75 the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.479
 of the 32's once you have the iso 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.940
 downloaded then record it jce on a dvd or 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.100
 you pass it to a usb stylus you do 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.259
 voting as you want 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.659
 and put it in the team and it will come out 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.030
 this screen and I already have the dvd I already 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.850
 I got the DVD so that all will 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.920
 to do is to execute it and this will come out 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.570
 same that will now appear on the screen 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.570
 So far we say yes 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.540
 I already made this same installation already 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.690
 I did it on another on another computer in a 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.850
 tower a tower that he had with windows 7 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.470
 also in the 4-bit version which 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.990
 est and the truth that surprised me 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.300
 pleasantly the first because I do not know 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.460
 loses absolutely nothing of what 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.080
 I had what you would have of what 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.830
 you have installed in the operating system 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.590
 nothing or an icon on the desktop or 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.240
 no driver of anything or any program 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.490
 Well the only problem I had was with 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.790
 an office version that I had to 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.230
 reinstall but it was the only problem 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.610
 stood out the rest of things worked 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.070
 everything perfectly both the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.680
 network configuration if you have it fixed 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.630
 like the printers that you have 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.370
 installed the team name the group 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.799
 work or if you have it in domain 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.450
 what else left the user ready 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.010
 you have current or the users that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.920
 you have on the team together with your 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.470
 keys remain users I always 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.520
 I use local users in windows as 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.830
 this one that I have here I am going to teach you 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.380
 before user this wall is worth 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.020
 administrator without a password because it is going to 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.970
 leave a local user in windows 10 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.760
 same is called equal and if it has a key 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.590
 Well, the key that he had and he leaves everything 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.620
 perfectly as the team is called 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.700
 he does not catch it all of what of what 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.380
 there is already installed it picks up all terms 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.470
 of good licenses we are telling you 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.450
 that if they worked hard and that 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.760
 it's a beta then it's supposed to be 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.170
 to improve the good stability a 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.540
 graphic aspect that you have to polish a 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.380
 little but in general terms I think 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.470
 that is going to be a windows that is going to 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.040
 succeed will be a very pleasant surprise 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.480
 and also if he could still read me in several 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.090
 forums 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.370
 backward compatibility with the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.930
 hardware with the programs at the level of 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.760
 software that I did not have any problem with 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.159
 no type of program that would have 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.349
 have windows 7 and do not function t 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.670
 I have windows 7 license I have 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:01.170
 Windows 8 license I bought myself a 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.239
 portable one year ago year and peak 2 comes out 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.739
 the windows 10 fuck I do not want to install it 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.900
 touch again to turn off hundred and peak of 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.750
 euros for the license no you already have 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.000
 windows 8 and admires took advantage and I teach you 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.640
 the warning window that appears in the 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.750
 windows look out this little window get 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.579
 windows 10 how this works 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.739
 free update book install 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.740
 Enjoy and I already gave it to you and it comes out here 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.389
 a button that you give and it points to you like 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.479
 you want to download it and bought it 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.979
 license I see it right the truth that 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.600
 I quite like myself in the teams that 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.750
 I have already skipped the update and what 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.970
 I already have booked in 23 computers and 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.440
 wait has nothing to do with this 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.060
 beta that we are installing now the 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.220
 Ojito, this is not something else completely 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.930
 different this is supposed to be in the 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.820
 time skip the official version 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.380
 this beta that we are installing now 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.990
 it will be deactivated 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:54.330
 jump to some kind of update of 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.970
 notice that tells you you need code 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.250
 buy it or activate it in some way not 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.440
 I know I do not know this beta that 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.660
 we are installing now it has nothing 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.520
 what to do with the reservation or with the notice 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.190
 that you get to get windows 10 in 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.620
 within a couple of months when when 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.080
 release it officially to follow 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.630
 it will be a final version and it will be installed 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.700
 I suppose in the same way that 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.560
 it is still what what it provides is 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.900
 quite simple and quite easy without 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.840
 no problem of not being at any 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.220
 person that we are going to read simply 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.040
 you have to read and follow the steps that are 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.250
 33 clicks and you're done 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.610
 what else can I say about windows days 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.190
 in principle I see it well to change a 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:43.170
 heap of icons design change 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:45.900
 they did it more like more comic type 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.790
 I would say no more with more colorful not 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.450
 so avant-garde lines or lines 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.610
 so future so marked is more more 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.460
 familiar so to speak so maybe so 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.900
 professional I like I like the 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.510
 speed of the network the speed of 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.020
 access to things is quite enough 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.490
 well optimized I think that until this 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.410
 beta works even better than a 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.410
 windows 7 windows 8 doing the same 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.999
 look and just put yourself here ready to 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.589
 install you can not use your pc while 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.029
 install windows save and close the 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:18.499
 files before you start in summary 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.050
 this is what he decided to do 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:22.339
 install windows 10 pro inside preview 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.169
 keep personal files 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:26.269
 applications and configurations 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.489
 windows change the elements that are going 

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:30.800
 to keep good I did not give this in 

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:34.399
 the moment that I give him the one that I will give him 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.550
 you give to install and load some files 

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:39.679
 it takes a little bit the computer restarts and 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.809
 does an installation as if you put the 

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:44.779
 dvd from the start 

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:46.069
 from ms-two so to speak 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.719
 restart I think it's four or five 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.519
 times more do not touch anything is going 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:53.029
 indicating what you are doing loading 

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:54.529
 configuration ending preparing not 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:56.240
 you have to touch anything in the world that you 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.849
 let's install, do not touch 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.379
 absolutely nothing since then what 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.079
 I'm going to do is stop the recording here 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:04.969
 the moment you give it to install it goes 

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:05.959
 it will surely be cut you go to the 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:08.479
 programs are going to restart the computer 

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:10.459
 and when I finish installing windows and 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.129
 start the session I go back to 

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:16.369
 record and linked as the video 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:18.759
 and so I show you the first steps and 

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.759
 how 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.390
 manage the users because now you 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.640
 will create a local user that is the 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.340
 that I had taught myself but I want 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.110
 access with an outlook account or a 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.570
 email account let's say to be able 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.940
 synchronize several machines with windows 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.230
 10 that I have and that I move or so 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.640
 less is the theory that moves me the 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.410
 configuration both the start button 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.930
 as from the default applications 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.880
 browsing favorites and such a 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.550
 team to another without having to take me 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.690
 nothing good then that's what I'm going to 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.650
 do I'm going to stop the recording now and 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.259
 when I finish installing 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.600
 I keep recording at the moment I give to 

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:55.669
 install you do not have to touch anything up 

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.590
 that until it ends it is worth it now 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:59.590
 now now we'll see you later
