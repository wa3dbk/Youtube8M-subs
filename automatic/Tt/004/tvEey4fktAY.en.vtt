in a future video this one is just for

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.649 
in a future video this one is just for
the<00:01:38.040> diagonal<00:01:38.460> stripe<00:01:38.670> pattern<00:01:39.000> I'm<00:01:39.240> doing

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the diagonal stripe pattern I'm doing

what<00:03:22.440> you're<00:03:22.530> going<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.769> do<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:22.980> separate<00:03:23.489> your

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
what you're going to do is separate your

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.930 
what you're going to do is separate your
strings<00:03:24.959> in<00:03:25.290> half<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.130> way<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.790> do

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
strings in half and the way I like to do

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.840 
strings in half and the way I like to do
it<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.269> take<00:03:27.600> one<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.079> each<00:03:28.200> color<00:03:28.530> like<00:03:29.519> this

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
it is take one of each color like this

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.229 
it is take one of each color like this
and<00:03:30.410> put<00:03:31.410> one<00:03:32.220> over<00:03:32.250> here<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.799> then<00:03:35.060> one<00:03:36.060> up

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
and put one over here and then one up

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.259 
and put one over here and then one up
here<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:38.000> one<00:03:39.000> over<00:03:39.030> here<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.139> one<00:03:40.910> up<00:03:41.910> here

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
here and one over here and one up here

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.910 
here and one over here and one up here
you<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:43.079> separate<00:03:43.470> them<00:03:43.560> down<00:03:43.769> the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
you can just separate them down the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.500 
you can just separate them down the
middle<00:03:44.100> but<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.489> have<00:03:44.700> found<00:03:44.819> that<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.269> way

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
middle but I have found that this way

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.900 
middle but I have found that this way
makes<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.989> bracelet<00:03:46.470> lay<00:03:46.769> flatter<00:03:47.400> once<00:03:47.760> you

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
makes the bracelet lay flatter once you

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.789 
makes the bracelet lay flatter once you
tie<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.150> on<00:03:48.389> and<00:03:48.720> then<00:03:48.870> take<00:03:49.109> one<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.590> those

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
tie it on and then take one of those

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.949 
tie it on and then take one of those
just<00:03:50.519> tuck<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.790> right<00:03:51.060> through<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.569> loop

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
just tuck it right through that loop

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.840 
just tuck it right through that loop
that<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.500> made<00:03:52.739> at<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.160> beginning<00:03:53.310> at<00:03:53.819> the

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
that you made at the beginning at the

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.849 
that you made at the beginning at the
top<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.480> pull<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.840> all<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.109> way<00:03:55.260> through<00:03:55.680> so

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
top and pull it all the way through so

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.160 
top and pull it all the way through so
now<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.250> your<00:03:56.430> bracelet<00:03:56.970> with<00:03:57.810> half<00:03:58.019> of

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
them coming through this loop here go

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.210 
them coming through this loop here go
ahead<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.810> slip<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.989> on<00:04:04.109> like<00:04:04.380> that<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.980> then

ahead and slip it on like that and then

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.120 
ahead and slip it on like that and then
use<00:04:05.579> those<00:04:06.000> two<00:04:06.329> sets<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.720> strings<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.410> tie<00:04:07.620> and

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
use those two sets of strings to tie and

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.849 
use those two sets of strings to tie and
not<00:04:08.780> just<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.989> regular<00:04:11.690> square<00:04:12.690> knot<00:04:13.019> here<00:04:13.650> and
