as I said the design makes up for it and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.130 
as I said the design makes up for it and
the<00:02:06.640> black<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.090> white<00:02:07.210> senior<00:02:07.570> is<00:02:07.720> really

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
the black and white senior is really

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.380 
the black and white senior is really
cool<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.950> effects<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.520> explosions<00:02:10.030> all<00:02:10.179> look

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
cool the effects and explosions all look

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.840 
cool the effects and explosions all look
great<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.899> for<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.950> most<00:02:12.100> part<00:02:12.220> besides<00:02:12.490> some

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
great and for the most part besides some

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.699 
great and for the most part besides some
framerate<00:02:13.180> issues<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.020> lot<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.200> clipping

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
framerate issues and a lot of clipping

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.800 
framerate issues and a lot of clipping
it's<00:02:15.310> not<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.550> bad<00:02:15.790> looking<00:02:16.120> game<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.600> one's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
it's not a bad looking game and one's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.830 
it's not a bad looking game and one's
pretty<00:02:17.080> decent<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.910> funny<00:02:25.180> picking<00:02:25.570> up<00:02:25.690> this

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
pretty decent it's funny picking up this

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.630 
pretty decent it's funny picking up this
game<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.230> can't<00:02:26.470> really<00:02:26.590> describe<00:02:27.010> as<00:02:27.310> one

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
game you can't really describe as one

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.310 
game you can't really describe as one
type<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:27.940> game<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:28.570> not<00:02:28.720> exactly<00:02:29.170> like

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
type of game it's not exactly like

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.230 
type of game it's not exactly like
Seth's<00:02:29.680> Creed<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.190> not<00:02:30.370> exactly<00:02:30.820> like<00:02:30.910> when

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
Seth's Creed it's not exactly like when

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.390 
Seth's Creed it's not exactly like when
the<00:02:31.390> photo<00:02:31.750> however<00:02:32.440> tries<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.950> mix<00:02:33.160> both

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the photo however tries to mix both

the photo however tries to mix both
though<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.030> don't<00:02:34.300> think<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.630> really<00:02:34.660> does

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
though I don't think it really does

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.110

is<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.680> broken<00:03:12.030> when<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.209> do<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:13.690> they<00:03:13.810> say

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
is so broken when you do what they say

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.530 
is so broken when you do what they say
as<00:03:14.290> in<00:03:14.530> walking<00:03:14.980> slow<00:03:15.280> past<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.760> guard<00:03:16.000> there

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
the back of the head with a gun gets

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.729 
the back of the head with a gun gets
boring<00:03:34.750> after<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.140> fourth<00:03:35.380> or<00:03:35.530> fifth<00:03:35.709> time

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
creed in the stealth area I have to say

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.820 
creed in the stealth area I have to say
for<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.570> most<00:03:40.690> part<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.200> missions<00:03:41.560> didn't

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
for the most part the missions didn't

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.380 
for the most part the missions didn't
really<00:03:42.100> get<00:03:42.250> me<00:03:42.430> going<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.940> wasn't<00:03:43.299> really

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
really get me going I wasn't really

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.360 
really get me going I wasn't really
enjoying<00:03:43.630> them<00:03:44.140> besides<00:03:44.830> one<00:03:45.100> or<00:03:45.220> two

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
enjoying them besides one or two

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.010 
enjoying them besides one or two
missions<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.910> were<00:03:46.060> actually<00:03:46.269> really<00:03:46.810> fun

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
missions that were actually really fun

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.230 
missions that were actually really fun
like<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.349> blimp<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.340> divorce<00:03:48.700> mission<00:03:49.090> I

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
like the blimp and the divorce mission I

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.059 
like the blimp and the divorce mission I
would<00:03:49.750> say<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.020> rest<00:03:50.170> are<00:03:50.349> just<00:03:50.380> kind<00:03:50.680> of

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
would say the rest are just kind of

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.339 
would say the rest are just kind of
and<00:03:51.400> once<00:03:51.700> again<00:03:51.849> feel<00:03:52.209> like<00:03:52.450> another<00:03:52.810> grand<00:03:53.230> a

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
photo following and the combat feels

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.190
