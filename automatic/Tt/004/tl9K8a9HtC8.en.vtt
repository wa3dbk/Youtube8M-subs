fortunate to have oil production

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.100 
fortunate to have oil production
increase<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.550> our<00:00:47.940> economies<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.690> developed

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110

over the past decades and now we're
reaching<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.930> point<00:00:52.170> where<00:00:52.340> we're<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.370> to

oil production after that oil production

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.139 
oil production after that oil production
will<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:01.170> decline<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.980> prices<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.940> course

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
will then decline in prices of course

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.490 
will then decline in prices of course
we'll<00:01:03.390> continue<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.049> what<00:01:04.229> they've<00:01:04.409> been

that we get from petroleum which is

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.670 
that we get from petroleum which is
something<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.689> lot<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.140> people<00:01:55.259> don't

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
something that a lot of people don't

something that a lot of people don't
always<00:01:56.610> appreciate<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.140> look<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.469> gas

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
always appreciate so if you look at gas

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
always appreciate so if you look at gas
prices<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.090> high<00:02:00.479> potentially<00:02:01.409> heating<00:02:01.710> oil

prices that high potentially heating oil
prices<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.430> high<00:02:02.670> what<00:02:03.180> does<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.450> mean<00:02:03.659> for

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
prices that high what does that mean for

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.410 
prices that high what does that mean for
the<00:02:03.840> economy<00:02:04.439> Robert<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.579> means<00:02:05.820> bad<00:02:06.090> things

the economy Robert it means bad things

the economy Robert it means bad things
for<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> economy<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.409> did<00:02:07.649> an<00:02:07.799> analysis

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
for the economy we did an analysis

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.630 
for the economy we did an analysis
recently<00:02:09.420> looking<00:02:09.899> at

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
recently looking at

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.330 
recently looking at
what<00:02:11.030> will<00:02:11.270> happen<00:02:11.810> or<00:02:12.050> could<00:02:12.860> happen

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
what will happen or could happen

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.850 
what will happen or could happen
worldwide<00:02:13.940> as<00:02:14.300> oil<00:02:14.810> production<00:02:15.170> goes<00:02:15.560> into

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
worldwide as oil production goes into

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.320 
worldwide as oil production goes into
decline<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.610> what<00:02:17.330> we<00:02:17.540> found<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:18.200> as<00:02:18.850> as<00:02:19.850> well

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
decline and what we found is as as well

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.470 
decline and what we found is as as well
does<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:20.959> into<00:02:20.990> decline<00:02:21.740> world<00:02:22.520> gdp<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:23.330> go

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
does go into decline world gdp will go

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.110 
does go into decline world gdp will go
into<00:02:23.660> decline<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.350> roughly<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.830> same<00:02:25.069> rate<00:02:25.130> so

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
into decline it roughly the same rate so

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.060 
into decline it roughly the same rate so
if<00:02:26.209> we're<00:02:26.360> talking<00:02:26.540> about<00:02:26.840> decline<00:02:27.440> rates<00:02:27.709> of

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
if we're talking about decline rates of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.960 
if we're talking about decline rates of
three<00:02:28.610> four<00:02:28.850> five<00:02:29.090> percent<00:02:29.660> per<00:02:29.930> year<00:02:30.620> on<00:02:30.800> a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
three four five percent per year on a

three four five percent per year on a
continuing<00:02:31.970> basis<00:02:32.390> we're<00:02:32.570> talking<00:02:32.990> about

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
continuing basis we're talking about

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.340 
continuing basis we're talking about
world<00:02:33.440> GDP<00:02:34.100> decreasing<00:02:34.940> at<00:02:35.180> something<00:02:36.140> like

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
world GDP decreasing at something like

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.320 
world GDP decreasing at something like
that<00:02:36.680> rate<00:02:36.980> which<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.610> not<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.880> very<00:02:38.239> good

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
that rate which is not a very good

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.199 
that rate which is not a very good
situation<00:02:38.720> not<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.530> happy<00:02:39.770> future<00:02:40.100> but<00:02:40.880> okay

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
situation not a happy future but okay

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.180 
situation not a happy future but okay
there's<00:02:42.020> got<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.350> be<00:02:42.410> something<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.770> do<00:02:42.920> with

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
there's got to be something to do with

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.530 
there's got to be something to do with
the<00:02:43.310> problem<00:02:43.640> like<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:43.820> how<00:02:44.180> do<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.330> solve

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the problem like this how do you solve

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.780 
the problem like this how do you solve
it<00:02:44.860> that's<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.220> things<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.610> we

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
it that's one of the things that we

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.110 
it that's one of the things that we
started<00:02:47.270> on<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> number<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.840> years<00:02:48.140> ago<00:02:48.580> we<00:02:49.580> saw

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
started on a number of years ago we saw

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.330 
started on a number of years ago we saw
that<00:02:50.300> this<00:02:50.450> problem<00:02:50.780> was<00:02:50.989> coming<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.769> of

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
that this problem was coming and of

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.640 
that this problem was coming and of
course<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.420> world<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.290> United<00:02:54.620> States

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
course the world in the United States

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.040 
course the world in the United States
will<00:02:55.250> be<00:02:55.390> doing<00:02:56.390> everything<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.930> we

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
will be doing everything that we

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.820 
will be doing everything that we
possibly<00:02:57.140> can<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.160> mitigate<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.700> problem<00:02:59.830> the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
possibly can to mitigate the problem the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.820 
possibly can to mitigate the problem the
difficulty<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.330> there<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.200> no<00:03:03.470> silver

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
difficulty is that there is no silver

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.640 
difficulty is that there is no silver
bullet<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:05.600> other<00:03:05.810> problem<00:03:06.350> is<00:03:06.590> that

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
bullet and the other problem is that

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.910 
bullet and the other problem is that
because<00:03:07.100> oil<00:03:07.820> production<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.200> massive<00:03:09.530> and

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
because oil production is so massive and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.000 
because oil production is so massive and
oil<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.489> used<00:03:10.820> in<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.540> many<00:03:11.690> things<00:03:12.019> in<00:03:12.320> our

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
oil is used in so many things in our

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.910 
oil is used in so many things in our
society<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:14.390> it's<00:03:14.570> going<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.810> take<00:03:15.079> us<00:03:15.320> much

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
society that it's going to take us much

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.250 
society that it's going to take us much
more<00:03:15.950> than<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.489> decade<00:03:16.670> maybe<00:03:17.209> two<00:03:17.540> decades<00:03:17.989> to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
more than a decade maybe two decades to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.259 
more than a decade maybe two decades to
catch<00:03:18.470> up<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.829> a<00:03:18.860> problem<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.970> will<00:03:20.120> be

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
catch up to a problem that will be

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.259 
catch up to a problem that will be
