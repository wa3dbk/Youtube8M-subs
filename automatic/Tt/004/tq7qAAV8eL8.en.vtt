00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
earlier iteration so when like this

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.890 
earlier iteration so when like this
model<00:03:07.040> was<00:03:07.160> introduced<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.910> was<00:03:08.150> used<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.810> be

has the red red pinstripe instead of the
silver<00:04:13.100> finish<00:04:13.340> right<00:04:13.520> so<00:04:14.330> that's<00:04:14.570> that<00:04:14.900> and

foreign<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.040> was<00:04:25.250> are<00:04:25.430> kind<00:04:25.700> of<00:04:25.730> afraid

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
foreign and I was are kind of afraid

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.760 
foreign and I was are kind of afraid
that<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.390> will<00:04:26.480> kind<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:26.810> dig<00:04:27.050> in<00:04:27.260> because<00:04:27.470> the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
that it will kind of dig in because the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.550 
that it will kind of dig in because the
notes<00:04:28.280> it's<00:04:28.700> very<00:04:29.000> protruding<00:04:29.660> right<00:04:29.840> it's<00:04:30.470> a

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
notes it's very protruding right it's a

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.010 
notes it's very protruding right it's a
higher<00:04:30.770> up<00:04:31.130> than<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:31.940> lot<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.330> other<00:04:32.600> guitars

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
higher up than a lot of other guitars

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.400 
higher up than a lot of other guitars
especially<00:04:33.740> like<00:04:33.890> a<00:04:33.919> Super<00:04:34.310> Stretch<00:04:34.580> shape

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
especially like a Super Stretch shape

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.180 
especially like a Super Stretch shape
but<00:04:36.490> actually<00:04:38.080> alone<00:04:39.080> with<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.350> body<00:04:39.500> contour

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
but actually alone with the body contour

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.860 
but actually alone with the body contour
what<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.490> actually<00:04:40.729> have<00:04:41.030> does<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.510> actually

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
what you actually have does it actually

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.390 
what you actually have does it actually
gives<00:04:42.080> you<00:04:42.169> something<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.560> lean<00:04:42.950> against

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
gives you something to lean against

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.860 
gives you something to lean against
right<00:04:43.550> it's<00:04:43.850> actually<00:04:44.210> kind<00:04:44.419> of<00:04:44.479> comfortable

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
right it's actually kind of comfortable

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.230 
right it's actually kind of comfortable
to<00:04:45.050> play<00:04:45.169> with<00:04:45.500> guitar<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.700> very<00:04:47.000> well

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
to play with guitar is very well

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.350 
to play with guitar is very well
balanced<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.990> doesn't<00:04:48.500> like<00:04:48.800> tip<00:04:49.310> one<00:04:50.030> way<00:04:50.180> or

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
balanced it doesn't like tip one way or

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.120 
balanced it doesn't like tip one way or
another<00:04:51.790> so<00:04:52.790> all<00:04:53.270> in<00:04:53.510> all<00:04:53.630> it's<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.350> pretty

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
another so all in all it's a pretty

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.030 
another so all in all it's a pretty
decent<00:04:55.520> guitar<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:57.050> has<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:57.470> don't<00:04:57.770> think<00:04:57.950> hit

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040

it then you collectivist value but to me

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.680 
it then you collectivist value but to me
it<00:05:01.669> was<00:05:01.790> kind<00:05:02.000> of<00:05:02.030> an<00:05:02.150> instant<00:05:02.450> gratification

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690
