00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
plan B literally over the course of one
night<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.979> thought<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.000> break<00:01:42.180> this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
night we thought what if we break this

night we thought what if we break this
into<00:01:42.600> two<00:01:42.780> parts<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.530> everybody's<00:01:44.399> like

into two parts then everybody's like
alright<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.000> could<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> reality<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.869> then

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
alright this could be a reality so then

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.060 
alright this could be a reality so then
they<00:01:46.110> went<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> studio<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> network

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
they went to the studio in the network

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800 
they went to the studio in the network
and<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.340> pitched<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.909> called<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.479> studio

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and then pitched it we called the studio

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.510 
and then pitched it we called the studio
and<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.259> were<00:01:49.320> incredibly<00:01:49.829> supportive<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and they were incredibly supportive the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.240 
and they were incredibly supportive the
network<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.970> incredibly<00:01:51.659> supportive<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
network is incredibly supportive and it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.270 
network is incredibly supportive and it
allowed<00:01:53.610> our<00:01:53.640> crew<00:01:54.350> more<00:01:55.350> time<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.890> develop

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
allowed our crew more time to develop

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.639 
allowed our crew more time to develop
some<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> ideas<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.540> they<00:01:57.899> had<00:01:58.140> come<00:01:58.469> up

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
some of the ideas that they had come up

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.280 
some of the ideas that they had come up
with<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.189> comes<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.960> how<00:02:00.960> much<00:02:01.140> more

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
with when it comes to how much more

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.389 
with when it comes to how much more
difficult<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.189> had<00:02:02.280> already

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
difficult it was they had already

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.740 
difficult it was they had already
prepped<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.850> lot<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.119> sets<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:03.570> already

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
prepped a lot of the sets they already

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.880 
prepped a lot of the sets they already
had<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.990> costumes<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> props

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
had the costumes all the props

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.770 
had the costumes all the props
everything<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> lot

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
everything so that I think was a lot

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.419 
everything so that I think was a lot
easier<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.229> production<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.310> could

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
easier for production because we could

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.219 
easier for production because we could
just<00:02:08.550> spread<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.330> out<00:02:09.479> over<00:02:09.780> two<00:02:10.050> full

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
just spread that out over two full

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.660 
just spread that out over two full
episodes<00:02:10.619> rather<00:02:10.800> than<00:02:10.979> having<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.250> prep<00:02:11.459> an

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
episodes rather than having to prep an

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.300 
episodes rather than having to prep an
entire<00:02:12.360> new<00:02:12.510> episode<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:12.989> news

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
entire new episode with news

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.849 
entire new episode with news
it's<00:02:13.430> not<00:02:13.640> that
