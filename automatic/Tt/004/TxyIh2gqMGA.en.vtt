Nicole about my hair so I have layers in
the<00:00:56.109> front<00:00:56.410> I<00:00:56.679> don't<00:00:56.980> have<00:00:57.129> any<00:00:57.309> in<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:57.489> back

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
the front I don't have any in the back

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.430 
the front I don't have any in the back
try<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.690> keep<00:00:58.929> it<00:00:59.050> long<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.940> I<00:01:01.929> guess<00:01:02.109> my<00:01:02.260> first

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
try to keep it long and I guess my first

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.390 
try to keep it long and I guess my first
layer<00:01:02.710> starts<00:01:03.190> about<00:01:03.429> my<00:01:03.609> cheekbone<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:05.400> next

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
layer starts about my cheekbone the next

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.220 
layer starts about my cheekbone the next
set<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:06.640> layer<00:01:06.940> starts<00:01:07.450> around<00:01:09.660> gives<00:01:10.660> my<00:01:10.810> chin

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
set of layer starts around gives my chin

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.590 
set of layer starts around gives my chin
and<00:01:11.260> then<00:01:11.680> there's<00:01:12.370> like<00:01:12.580> two<00:01:12.910> or<00:01:13.030> three<00:01:13.090> after

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
and then there's like two or three after

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.710 
and then there's like two or three after
that<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.369> told<00:01:15.579> my<00:01:15.670> stylist<00:01:16.030> on<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.240> want<00:01:16.479> to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
that but I told my stylist on I want to

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.210 
that but I told my stylist on I want to
put<00:01:16.869> my<00:01:16.960> layers<00:01:17.170> in<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.500> front<00:01:17.799> and<00:01:17.950> I<00:01:18.009> think

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
put my layers in the front and I think

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.179 
put my layers in the front and I think
it's<00:01:18.340> easier<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.790> spell<00:01:19.619> I'm<00:01:20.619> gonna<00:01:20.799> do<00:01:20.950> first

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
it's easier to spell I'm gonna do first
