I've<00:00:49.530> noticed<00:00:50.190> when<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.809> public

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
I've noticed when I go to a public

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
I've noticed when I go to a public
restroom<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:55.820> people<00:00:56.820> don't<00:00:57.000> seem<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.420> have

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
restroom that people don't seem to have

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.770 
restroom that people don't seem to have
women<00:00:58.350> some<00:00:58.859> women<00:00:59.190> some<00:01:00.059> women<00:01:00.449> don't<00:01:00.629> seem

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
women some women some women don't seem

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.889 
women some women some women don't seem
to<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:02.190> proper<00:01:02.579> control<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.719> think

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to have the proper control and I think

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.420 
to have the proper control and I think
you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.320> maybe<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you know maybe it's just because you

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.859 
you know maybe it's just because you
don't<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.210> hands<00:01:06.420> dirty<00:01:06.659> and

don't want to get your hands dirty and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.810 
don't want to get your hands dirty and
it's<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.530> sort<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.890> thing<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.369> try<00:01:08.670> as

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it's just sort of a thing and try as

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.109 
it's just sort of a thing and try as
hard<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.360> sometimes<00:01:09.869> there's<00:01:11.119> you
