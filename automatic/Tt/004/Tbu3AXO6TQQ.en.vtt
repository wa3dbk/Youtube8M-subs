you've just played for a couple days you
could<00:00:56.790> play<00:00:56.970> that<00:00:57.000> beat<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:58.080> I'm<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.650> going

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
could play that beat now I'm just going

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.619 
could play that beat now I'm just going
to<00:00:58.860> quickly<00:00:58.980> explain<00:00:59.129> what<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> was<00:00:59.970> doing<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
to quickly explain what I was doing and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.420 
to quickly explain what I was doing and
it's<00:01:00.989> gonna<00:01:01.140> play<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.470> for<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.769> and<00:01:01.949> then

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it's gonna play it for you and then

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.549 
it's gonna play it for you and then
we're<00:01:02.550> gonna<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:02.879> into<00:01:03.059> how<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.839> came

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
we're gonna go into how I actually came

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.870 
we're gonna go into how I actually came
up<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.250> how<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.430> start<00:01:05.790> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
up with that and how you start to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.130 
up with that and how you start to
orchestrate<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.540> stuff<00:01:06.720> around<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
orchestrate that stuff around and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:22.600 
orchestrate that stuff around and
recycle<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> basic<00:01:08.850> beat<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.060 

now<00:01:23.610> most<00:01:23.880> years<00:01:24.090> say<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:25.080> easy<00:01:25.350> too<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.860> can

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
now most years say that's easy too I can

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
now most years say that's easy too I can
easily<00:01:26.310> play<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:27.120> great<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.260> now

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
easily play that that's great and so now

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.740 
easily play that that's great and so now
when<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.710> start<00:01:29.010> doing<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.670> am<00:01:29.940> hitting<00:01:30.510> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
when I start doing is I am hitting the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.620 
when I start doing is I am hitting the
eighth<00:01:31.470> notes<00:01:31.830> with<00:01:32.430> my<00:01:32.610> right<00:01:32.790> hand<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.210> each

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
eighth notes with my right hand on each

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.600 
eighth notes with my right hand on each
ate<00:01:34.020> them<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.470> I'm<00:01:34.710> hitting<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> snare<00:01:35.550> and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.219 
bass drum on the one in the end and then
the<00:01:40.650> three<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.550> end<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.630> now<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.110> going

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the three and the end so now I'm going

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.680 
the three and the end so now I'm going
to<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.440> is<00:01:43.710> I'm<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> take<00:01:44.430> those<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
to do is I'm going to take those the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.390 
to do is I'm going to take those the
places<00:01:46.140> where<00:01:46.290> I'm<00:01:46.380> placing<00:01:46.560> those<00:01:46.800> notes<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
places where I'm placing those notes and

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.150 
places where I'm placing those notes and
just<00:01:47.660> orchestrate<00:01:48.660> them<00:01:48.780> differently<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.860> on

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
just orchestrate them differently so on

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.070 
just orchestrate them differently so on
the<00:01:50.580> snare<00:01:50.910> I'm<00:01:51.210> gonna<00:01:51.420> hit<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.690> snare<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
the snare I'm gonna hit the snare and

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.810 
the snare I'm gonna hit the snare and
counts<00:01:52.350> two<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.399> high<00:01:53.550> Tom<00:01:53.789> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820

count two and four

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:10.430 
count two and four
so<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.440> would<00:01:55.530> sound<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.740> this<00:02:08.989> then<00:02:09.989> I'm

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
so that would sound like this then I'm

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.699 
so that would sound like this then I'm
gonna<00:02:10.739> take<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.880> end<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.600> one<00:02:12.900> bass<00:02:13.290> drum<00:02:13.560> in

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
gonna take the end of one bass drum in

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.440 
gonna take the end of one bass drum in
the<00:02:13.739> end<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.280> three<00:02:14.489> bass<00:02:14.700> drum<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.090> I'll<00:02:15.239> play

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
the end of three bass drum and I'll play

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.650 
the end of three bass drum and I'll play
them<00:02:15.630> on<00:02:15.989> my<00:02:16.769> hi-hat<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.310> my<00:02:17.459> foot<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
them on my hi-hat with my foot so the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.930 
them on my hi-hat with my foot so the
feet<00:02:18.840> would<00:02:19.019> just<00:02:19.200> sound<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.650> one<00:02:20.280> two

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
feet would just sound like this one two

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:35.449 
feet would just sound like this one two
three<00:02:21.720> four<00:02:33.709> right<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.070> fairly<00:02:35.340> basic

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
three four right so it's fairly basic

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.520 
three four right so it's fairly basic
we're<00:02:35.910> not<00:02:36.060> adding<00:02:36.570> sixteenth<00:02:37.079> notes<00:02:37.320> we're

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
we're not adding sixteenth notes we're

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.770 
we're not adding sixteenth notes we're
not<00:02:37.680> adding<00:02:38.010> different<00:02:38.630> subdivisions<00:02:39.630> like

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
not adding different subdivisions like

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.630 
not adding different subdivisions like
sixteenth<00:02:40.170> triplets<00:02:40.650> or<00:02:40.920> thirty-second

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
sixteenth triplets or thirty-second

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.850 
sixteenth triplets or thirty-second
notes<00:02:41.790> we're<00:02:42.120> keeping<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.049> exact<00:02:43.500> same

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
notes we're keeping the exact same

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.220 
notes we're keeping the exact same
eighth<00:02:44.489> note<00:02:45.000> groove<00:02:45.450> we're<00:02:46.049> just

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
eighth note groove we're just

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.569 
eighth note groove we're just
orchestrating<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.950> little<00:02:47.190> bit<00:02:47.280> differently

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
orchestrating a little bit differently

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.910 
orchestrating a little bit differently
so<00:02:48.269> with<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.840> foot<00:02:49.110> pattern<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.650> would<00:02:49.769> sound

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
so with that foot pattern it would sound

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:12.460 
so with that foot pattern it would sound
like<00:02:50.010> this

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.930 

so<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.739> starting<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.250> come<00:03:14.370> together<00:03:14.580> and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
so it's starting to come together and

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.250 
so it's starting to come together and
it's<00:03:15.120> starting<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.450> sound<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:15.810> something

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
it's starting to sound like something

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.600 
it's starting to sound like something
completely<00:03:16.890> different<00:03:16.920> than<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.520> original

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
completely different than the original

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.850 
completely different than the original
but<00:03:18.450> now<00:03:18.600> we're<00:03:18.810> gonna<00:03:18.930> really<00:03:19.319> really<00:03:19.560> mess

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
but now we're gonna really really mess

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.590 
but now we're gonna really really mess
it<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.430> we're<00:03:20.819> gonna<00:03:20.910> start<00:03:21.150> moving<00:03:21.450> our

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
it up and we're gonna start moving our

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.750 
it up and we're gonna start moving our
right<00:03:21.750> hand<00:03:21.989> around<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.620> we're<00:03:23.400> gonna<00:03:23.519> move

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
right hand around and we're gonna move

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.720 
right hand around and we're gonna move
it<00:03:23.940> around<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.560> groups<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.680> three<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.370> starting

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
it around in groups of three so starting

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.259 
it around in groups of three so starting
from<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.970> ride<00:03:27.150> mid<00:03:28.019> Tom<00:03:28.290> low<00:03:28.860> tom<00:03:29.100> ride<00:03:29.610> mid

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
from the ride mid Tom low tom ride mid

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.180 
from the ride mid Tom low tom ride mid
tom<00:03:30.480> low<00:03:30.840> tom<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.440> what<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.650> need<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.830> do<00:03:32.010> is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
tom low tom so what you need to do is

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.970 
tom low tom so what you need to do is
just<00:03:32.670> kind<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:33.000> start<00:03:33.780> playing<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.260> forget

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
just kind of start playing it and forget

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.289 
just kind of start playing it and forget
about<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.370> forget<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.819> it's<00:03:35.940> moving<00:03:36.239> around

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
about it forget that it's moving around

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.449 
about it forget that it's moving around
don't<00:03:36.660> think<00:03:37.260> about<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.920> melody<00:03:38.340> it's

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
don't think about the melody it's

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.740 
don't think about the melody it's
creating<00:03:38.940> or<00:03:39.090> what<00:03:39.209> your<00:03:39.330> arm<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.630> doing

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
creating or what your arm is doing

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.059 
creating or what your arm is doing
because<00:03:39.930> that's<00:03:40.260> what's<00:03:40.470> really<00:03:40.530> gonna<00:03:40.799> mess

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
because that's what's really gonna mess

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.949 
because that's what's really gonna mess
you<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.610> trick<00:03:42.540> your<00:03:42.720> brain<00:03:42.840> into

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
you up and trick your brain into

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.110 
you up and trick your brain into
thinking<00:03:43.260> hey<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.980> shouldn't<00:03:44.640> be<00:03:44.700> used<00:03:44.940> to

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
thinking hey I shouldn't be used to

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.720 
thinking hey I shouldn't be used to
doing<00:03:45.269> this<00:03:45.540> even<00:03:46.410> though<00:03:46.500> we<00:03:46.680> all<00:03:46.980> know<00:03:47.040> that

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
doing this even though we all know that

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.940 
doing this even though we all know that
simple<00:03:48.120> be<00:03:48.269> but<00:03:49.019> your<00:03:49.440> brain<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.680> gonna

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
simple be but your brain is gonna

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.250 
simple be but your brain is gonna
naturally<00:03:50.220> try<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.940> say<00:03:51.120> no<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.600> shouldn't

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
naturally try and say no you shouldn't

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.539 
naturally try and say no you shouldn't
be<00:03:52.380> playing<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.830> that's<00:03:53.040> different<00:03:53.310> that

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
be playing that that's different that

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.490 
be playing that that's different that
sounds<00:03:53.910> different<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.269> me<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.600> don't<00:03:55.290> let<00:03:55.410> it

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
sounds different to me and don't let it

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.870 
sounds different to me and don't let it
do<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.920> yourself<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.519> kind<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.730> like

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
do that to yourself so just kind of like

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.940 
do that to yourself so just kind of like
block<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.330> out<00:03:57.450> forget<00:03:58.080> about<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.440> just<00:03:58.590> focus

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
block it out forget about it just focus

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.580 
block it out forget about it just focus
on<00:03:59.100> what<00:03:59.609> the<00:04:00.060> other<00:04:00.090> limbs<00:04:00.450> are<00:04:00.630> doing<00:04:00.810> so

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
on what the other limbs are doing so

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:19.710 
on what the other limbs are doing so
just<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.220> right<00:04:02.400> hand<00:04:02.640> will<00:04:02.970> sound<00:04:03.209> like<00:04:03.269> this

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.390 

so<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.840> pattern<00:04:21.049> takes<00:04:21.410> quite<00:04:21.709> long<00:04:21.949> for<00:04:21.979> it

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
so the pattern takes quite long for it

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.790 
so the pattern takes quite long for it
actually<00:04:22.910> to<00:04:23.090> repeat<00:04:23.509> itself<00:04:23.810> where<00:04:24.289> you<00:04:24.500> come

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
actually to repeat itself where you come

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.339 
actually to repeat itself where you come
back<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.310> ride<00:04:25.520> symbol<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.210> count<00:04:26.810> one<00:04:27.080> and

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
back to the ride symbol on count one and

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:28.689 
back to the ride symbol on count one and
so<00:04:27.710> that's<00:04:27.889> why<00:04:28.039> it's<00:04:28.160> really<00:04:28.190> important<00:04:28.639> to

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
so that's why it's really important to

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.540 
so that's why it's really important to
just<00:04:28.759> block<00:04:29.449> it<00:04:29.660> out<00:04:29.780> all<00:04:30.349> right<00:04:30.410> so<00:04:31.130> let's

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
just block it out all right so let's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.029 
just block it out all right so let's
just<00:04:31.789> play<00:04:31.970> that<00:04:32.150> groove<00:04:32.509> really<00:04:32.990> slowly<00:04:33.289> with

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
just play that groove really slowly with

00:04:34.039 --> 00:05:04.109 
just play that groove really slowly with
the<00:04:34.400> ride<00:04:34.820> pattern<00:04:35.060> in<00:04:35.360> there

00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:04.119 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.419 

so<00:05:05.119> it's<00:05:05.270> really<00:05:05.539> really<00:05:06.139> simple<00:05:06.469> thing<00:05:07.099> to<00:05:07.249> do

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:07.429 
so it's really really simple thing to do

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:10.659 
so it's really really simple thing to do
and<00:05:07.669> you<00:05:08.360> created<00:05:08.719> a<00:05:08.839> whole<00:05:09.229> new<00:05:09.259> beat<00:05:09.679> out<00:05:09.979> of

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
and you created a whole new beat out of

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.189 
and you created a whole new beat out of
playing<00:05:10.879> something<00:05:11.149> that<00:05:11.419> you<00:05:11.509> already<00:05:12.020> knew

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
playing something that you already knew

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.659 
playing something that you already knew
you<00:05:12.409> already<00:05:12.709> know<00:05:12.979> how<00:05:13.159> to<00:05:13.189> play<00:05:13.279> an<00:05:13.520> eighth

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
you already know how to play an eighth

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:14.799 
you already know how to play an eighth
note<00:05:13.699> beat<00:05:14.149> you're<00:05:14.509> just<00:05:14.659> really

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:14.809 
note beat you're just really

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:16.959 
note beat you're just really
orchestrating<00:05:15.469> it<00:05:15.559> a<00:05:15.619> tiny<00:05:15.919> bit<00:05:16.219> and<00:05:16.399> you<00:05:16.819> can

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:16.969 
orchestrating it a tiny bit and you can

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:18.790 
orchestrating it a tiny bit and you can
do<00:05:17.059> this<00:05:17.209> a<00:05:17.240> very<00:05:17.479> small<00:05:17.839> amount<00:05:17.990> or<00:05:18.379> you<00:05:18.529> can

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
do this a very small amount or you can

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.350 
do this a very small amount or you can
do<00:05:18.889> this<00:05:19.099> something<00:05:19.550> like<00:05:19.669> this<00:05:19.789> where<00:05:20.209> you

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
do this something like this where you

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.389 
do this something like this where you
actually<00:05:20.539> change<00:05:20.990> up<00:05:21.229> each<00:05:21.439> limb<00:05:21.830> you<00:05:22.279> know

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:22.399 
actually change up each limb you know

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:23.889 
actually change up each limb you know
change<00:05:22.699> up<00:05:22.849> what<00:05:22.879> my<00:05:23.149> right<00:05:23.300> foot<00:05:23.479> is<00:05:23.569> doing<00:05:23.689> I

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
split up with my left foot as well

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.489 
split up with my left foot as well
change<00:05:25.969> it<00:05:26.179> with<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.569> left<00:05:26.779> hand<00:05:26.959> let's<00:05:27.169> do<00:05:27.259> it

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:27.499 
change it with the left hand let's do it

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:29.949 
change it with the left hand let's do it
just<00:05:27.740> simple<00:05:28.069> snare<00:05:28.819> to<00:05:28.969> the<00:05:29.059> high<00:05:29.149> Tom<00:05:29.360> change

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:29.959
