00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:12.700
 Yes, here we will study about the bisector of the triangle outside corner and the day to do here 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:17.560
 There's only one triangle abc and that for example the outside corner of the horn 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:21.560
 It is here that the extension of the bisector and bc of here 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.220
 if d then d then bd want dc ab 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.949
 Iida ac was early this still remains Na Ne I'm such a place Tteyuu I stand sounds 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.119
 The person who is saying is looking at the country slowly 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:37.550
 First, Do Ya say if the bisector of the corner is not the last of the video 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.720
 I'm done So there is likely aside is amazing not a specific image took me a lot of people 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.550
 It's easy 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.530
 What, for example, of the two, such as Bunsen place this Kakuei 9 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.980
 If I draw a line that divides it into two equal now 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.810
 Once you have their'll be on whether the d and up to here 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:56.100
 I want to be here I want to be here I want to be here 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.230
 This it's seemed sound of Tteyuu the was unknown Metropolitan This not made in the previous video 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 Please review the last video 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.600
 and bd other containing Kokotae and I here is Mr. ab was a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:12.770
 That's what I'm going to do this time, but I'm talking about medicine 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:20.990
 Each What is this is a medicine that can be here that this extended to such Fu 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:21.649
 It's a battle that bisects this outer corner, it's a battle that divides it into two equal lines and the extension of this bc 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.080
 Intersection point 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.720
 Let this be d 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.830
 At that time 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.480
 But this will sound should here want Kokogako 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:39.260
 This is what I mean by standing without this Taeko voice 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:44.090
 This is an image that should be quite difficult compared to the cabinet, is n't it? 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.340
 Depending on the person is there are people who would make a mistake like a co-answer here bc want cd 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.710
 It's this, this is this , it's like this 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.799
 Ne 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.630
 An outer amount is difficult to springing a little not a specific image 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.990
 Of course, people who can remember the bear here'm good here is useful to those who can remember I here want here 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.799
 It is 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:06.700
 It is easy for people who are confusing to find this bisect of this outside corner , so it is easy to die 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:13.330
 I have not been able to derive the formula myself Please pay attention to what it means 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.950
 This want is this you would like to come and say what is true when the time being students to Cabinet Cabinet is this in 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.160
 Is true 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:26.390
 Replacing a character bd want bc may want bd bc is ab large Wing nurses 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:32.270
 I this I is true it is I'm with a even when the external angle 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:37.850
 Even in the outer corner bd want dc is ab body ac is true 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.750
 So if you remember the completion in the outside corner or remember here or if you refer to the cabinet 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.650
 I think it's good 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.770
 Once the intersection of the bisector and d if there is participation kbc 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.410
 bd wants dc to become ab 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.900
 Outside corner 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.040
 There is also a triangle abc, and the bisector of the outside corner and the guard are d and the intersection point 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.880
 if you do 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:02.320
 If bd wants dc to ab and this holds 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:08.620
 It is okay if I hold this down, of course people who can remember the first image 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:13.390
 Still it is good , referring to the two-man system of the cabinet which was hard to remember 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.739
 I think whether I as long as the Tteyuu dcab was Lee want bd Recall 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.459
 I will 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:23.200
 If you hold on to the official version, you will be able to solve various problems afterward 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:29.799
 For example, it will go this radar ab is 6 bc 5 c movie 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:34.640
 When ad is the bisector of the outside corner of the triangle abc 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:40.430
 When I think that I hope use official of Uh at the time saw the Wu du 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.660
 d body d 4 example here is bd large wheel and this is bd where dc is where 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.490
 Where did you want 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.540
 This is a good, if available I large this in this want this that keep in mind the other not a specific image 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.250
 Ne 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.590
 So came the answer here is that Teｰｰｰｰ4 was I, as were 6ｰｰｰｰ6 is contained in the three-body 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.850
 Recognize 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:04.340
 In other words bd here you can see here 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:07.280
 I'll have forgotten that it should be a dirty spot in the corner of the horn I should be able to immediately recall 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.170
 I write myself and write abcd 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.070
 In this I want this I want this bd I want to say dc 8 a b 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.260
 Recall 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:22.180
 bd tai dc ab It seems like there is no problem with a large o 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.140
 Here until bd When the makeup this in this with its Well then seen entering the three bodies become a three-body 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.410
 Want b 4 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:33.760
 If this is this, this is the place where you are here and here is the place where the roof is here 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:37.090
 Of course it's 1 so it's 3 to 1 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:42.310
 If you aim at it, then you will be asked for the length of b . 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:45.040
 I's formal position of Once Ya' Naa is No. length round of bc from bitter gourd year three times Once 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.970
 It means that it will be 15th because it is good 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:53.660
 I'm a little difficult to understand people is how the idea of this princess would love to have you on the other x 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:57.920
 The length of this bd x and Then earth flight's 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:02.930
 I think you know as soon as 15 were grass dumping calculation made in the wind Tteyuu Daiekkusu 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:08.240
 So at the time here in the external angle of the bisector in the fact that yes it is to say it becomes 15 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:11.630
 The important thing also I studied with was two, and the like part of it is this external angle of this participatory diamond 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.680
 dc is true that a Mr. was ab want bd 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.130
 It is good to remember by the image by all means 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.699
 It is okay to remember this symbol character 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.690
 It is only after the practice four times can be a Nohinto this yourself 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:28.949
 People who use this problem collection have a request that there is a problem immediately 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:32.880
 Bisector of the external angle of this problem one bought not people also cats I Nde insanely important place 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.670
 Firmly keep in training to be sure to have you, so a no hint to the problem child 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.760
 Let's go 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.760
 I will
