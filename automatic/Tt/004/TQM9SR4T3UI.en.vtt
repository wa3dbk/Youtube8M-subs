00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.690
 my 50 in Dresden 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.069
 the fee 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:12.259
 separate the couples 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.999
 where they are easier to say or windows immediately Coppola and around 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:18.949
 the pastor 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.329
 the place ten 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.720
 that was a lie and you can watch it again and again at Christmas 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.720
 this is actually how you now lure a piston eater inside Rhoder 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 Minister or one 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.410
 we left a 9 near or young or percent and we left 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.360
 now came to Winnenden Rogans 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.050
 beatiful movie about the love of the stories of the Bible 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.480
 he could not banish the bookings after a happy ending 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.630
 End - Red 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.330
 our one is late for this year 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.450
 it's Christmas again trained in Val Blu ray player lying whole 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.350
 strong movie 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.090
 Ninth place for never 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.390
 the IOC goes alone 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.230
 You also criticized the Republic for criticizing it and the St 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.560
 Lord of the rings 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.840
 the trilogy 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.030
 that is in the nine to twelve hours 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.600
 an absolute heartbeat final the Greens want on 1 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.100
 and the Kerner his Peter Jackson is a god I'm looking forward to any movie 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.950
 as much as on the hood 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.640
 because she's at Paul's hood 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.290
 Then I think next year, Lord of the Rings, it will fall 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.670
 out and where not that goes 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.830
 you have to look at that is deserved for me 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.440
 8th place 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.350
 the number once largest role and first major roles in films such as 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.380
 Philadelphia's wife spent 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.530
 and "Woman of the Year" points out that's a wonderful one 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.320
 Title tune the man again under the skin go beautiful on the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.240
 Playing the piano is faithfulness 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.400
 and there you have to be honest full also gave me a look I also watch 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.850
 can 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.770
 for me one of the most important criteria for this is not just one 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.259
 names 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.270
 Percentage at Straubing is 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.490
 but that you have to look at them so often Voss has 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.420
 gigantic 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.479
 and now a passage 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.820
 already at the beginning of a storm with 2 do not brake now support 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.909
 this movie is terrific and thank you for this movie and that is mine 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.970
 Percent at 7 3 6 4 for me in the circumstances that prevented our 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.829
 but it is way too good for that 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.950
 and somehow I can not say those cases, so yes 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.240
 was Hasselfeldt 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.840
 Allergies are different Uzun Josh Hartnett lustful had to go back to 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.230
 field 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.969
 take the environment into account when looking 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.970
 He is almost a kind of gangster comedy about the grandiose 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.929
 and I say Kansas City season know who knows this movie 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:47.999
 The movie is more than just a normal movie riddled with dialogues itself 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:48.519
 like this 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.659
 from represented and too wet 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:51.770
 incredibly strong 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.550
 Being a pretty fast pace than now that's ninth to be boring 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.920
 becomes 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.860
 close to 30 bad to his comedy gangster violence 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.830
 fulfill the glorify 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.199
 Countered very much for me on the field 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:06.000
 and there helps only the technical side with it consumes out of town 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.409
 Loser in the bavarian forest is 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.519
 So lochner-bristle the recommendation bad weather should not know 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.139
 looks at yourself 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.699
 Part now comes to the top 5 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.049
 Pot 5 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.869
 5 best movie one 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:24.829
 Percent top 50 list against Andreas Rees sees the market in a role 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.279
 which keeps Erlacher very strong and that reflects life in the film 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:30.700
 is ethics going 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.069
 the story immensely 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.519
 her husband and the death penalty marry and all this took a piece of way 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.690
 staged me too much to betray 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.959
 and the dutchman later also a terrific 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.269
 the euro always has to go to this movie is not wrong for me forever 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.619
 still in top form 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.129
 startled over the promenade 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.180
 the hate in itself and always when you think it will be freezing your back 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.480
 Down in the last three minutes of the movie in the last minute will be one 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.189
 much colder 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.489
 and 11th place four is no for me 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.879
 no wonder then ever open and donations score of serious 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.450
 it was once in America and also in the 3rd 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.309
 Wehrheim for around a real youth gang who grows up and 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.930
 while Prohibition does business 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.229
 and thereby it is about politics around scam Rome 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.059
 a justice and injustice in the two my America 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:27.679
 This movie is about I also just under two hours can be boring customers 

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:30.569
 demonstrators had not reported more 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.050
 that's just number four of the monkey 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.379
 but class 3 the family made a movie after 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.389
 want to hug a massive kids 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.759
 um and that is the convicted researchers Bregenz 19 clock and Mo Williams 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.059
 In parallel to her life, health is given a percent chance in prison 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:51.639
 and percent 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.889
 In an outbreak of winter, the child might not be like that at first 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.090
 insanely good feeling for dealing with the topic 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.440
 that's the best at one that has probably now revealed that 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.419
 Wings in the pop-olymp scored 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.620
 big movie change the movie more than nine pounds 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.629
 terrific second place 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:10.980
 for me 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.140
 and now it's getting slow authorities too since last week he has for 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.770
 Woody everyone 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.960
 what I know is not much that you just 50 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.460
 that two goes to Schindler's list 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.720
 The goal is that we have in this role bad ranking she has 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.360
 is expected 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.789
 and this movie is march of his films in the wake of this movie 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.389
 the street on the ground floor is no longer coming in the short term 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.550
 The Shoah Foundation was founded 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.710
 an au-delegation working in a team 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.289
 next to Dr show the gene analysis 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.850
 Struck had been busy at the moment 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.610
 also works process and retail and thus a very complete 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.870
 strong nerves 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.300
 I know that the second place is one 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.770
 he is intelligent 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.659
 he still did not have the most important ones for Minsk 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.379
 Shopping is not necessarily one and the ice is going on but off 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.120
 now it is for the Rhinelander 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.540
 First place goes a different start during the fair in Munich is well and 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.779
 the money is 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.449
 Handel 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:16.499
 First, most of the storefront 5 and I have seen it 40 to 40 miles 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.789
 is just the movie of my childhood and i can understand if someone is now 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.569
 just under 12 13 is dangerous and must be from Guttenberg 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:24.960
 mostly reveal 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.050
 No Christian MÃ¶wes more 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.330
 The Lion King seen so many times and seen so many coaches 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.320
 taken by my childhood the far 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.650
 the soundtrack is terrific one of the 15 o'clock without words 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.159
 Everyone knows heaps of quotes right away 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.800
 Hakuna Matata has become a household word around the globe 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.469
 climb on this front 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:47.689
 their hatred has a masterpiece and this story 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.639
 in Morocco 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.719
 Felix goal called it just does not know nobody 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:57.110
 Lion King part one place one of my gate 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.059
 50 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:01.949
 than did it 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.699
 that is now 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:04.919
 the end 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.129
 my dad and i just got unlucky enough to have it through now thanks for that 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.090
 I enjoyed it, I also enjoyed it - Monday 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:17.559
 Thanks again for turning on Thank you for listening Thanks for that 

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:19.249
 Interest was very hard 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:22.039
 so a big compliment to you 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.419
 Would you like to receive EUR 4 50 or a suitable match for the top ten? 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:28.050
 Post calm underneath 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.699
 everything I am there I am sure the result is not so 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:34.600
 the production version that the relatively simple Dzeko 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.600
 he will also need too little willing has surfaced again but no matter 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.289
 whether to remove Noda 

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:43.999
 the person concerned very interested 

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:45.570
 in advance was the comments 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.820
 I will continue to see the company alone on this model 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.830
 would be a terrific weekend 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.810
 Markus Guhl becomes more confident Bois Bonnet
