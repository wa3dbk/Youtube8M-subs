always one that talks about promoting

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.559 
always one that talks about promoting
and<00:02:22.250> more<00:02:22.370> but<00:02:22.579> I<00:02:22.610> think<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:22.909> was<00:02:22.969> okay<00:02:23.269> that<00:02:23.299> it

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
and more but I think it was okay that it

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.360 
and more but I think it was okay that it
got<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.079> buzz<00:02:24.319> on<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.500> internet<00:02:24.560> certainly

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
got a buzz on the internet certainly

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.280 
got a buzz on the internet certainly
there<00:02:25.790> was<00:02:25.909> there<00:02:26.599> was<00:02:26.689> that<00:02:26.840> buzz<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.200> i'm

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
there was there was that buzz and i'm

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.240 
there was there was that buzz and i'm
and<00:02:27.469> i<00:02:27.530> think<00:02:27.739> that<00:02:27.829> the<00:02:27.890> numbers<00:02:28.129> might

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
and i think that the numbers might

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.099 
and i think that the numbers might
reflect<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:28.819> when<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.390> watch<00:02:29.569> you're<00:02:29.900> right

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
reflect so when you watch you're right

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.319 
reflect so when you watch you're right
though<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.549> a<00:02:31.579> bit<00:02:31.760> surprising<00:02:31.879> but

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
though this is a bit surprising but

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.630 
though this is a bit surprising but
maybe<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.049> shouldn't<00:02:33.349> be<00:02:33.439> if<00:02:33.620> we're<00:02:34.129> going<00:02:34.340> on

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
fit to run a wrestling company she

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.160 
fit to run a wrestling company she
focuses<00:04:54.240> way<00:04:54.390> too<00:04:54.450> much<00:04:54.600> of<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.780> internet<00:04:55.020> she

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
focuses way too much of the internet she

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.840 
focuses way too much of the internet she
gets<00:04:55.320> worked<00:04:55.500> by<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.680> boys<00:04:55.890> I<00:04:56.160> think<00:04:56.670> she<00:04:56.730> has

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
gets worked by the boys I think she has

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.850 
gets worked by the boys I think she has
too<00:04:57.000> much<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.210> she<00:04:57.540> choose<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.380> wrong<00:04:58.500> battles

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
too much of she choose the wrong battles

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.990 
too much of she choose the wrong battles
to<00:04:58.920> fight<00:04:58.950> with<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.280> think<00:04:59.460> that's<00:04:59.580> just<00:04:59.700> the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
to fight with I think that's just the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.550 
to fight with I think that's just the
overall<00:05:00.150> consensus<00:05:00.510> I've<00:05:01.200> never<00:05:01.350> worked

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
overall consensus I've never worked

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.630 
overall consensus I've never worked
there<00:05:01.770> but<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:02.010> seems<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:02.250> be<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.340> overall

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
there but that seems to be the overall

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.130 
there but that seems to be the overall
consensus<00:05:02.790> from<00:05:03.090> those<00:05:03.330> who<00:05:03.480> have<00:05:03.690> been<00:05:03.930> there

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
consensus from those who have been there

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.690 
consensus from those who have been there
so<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.530> would<00:05:04.770> say<00:05:04.920> if<00:05:05.010> Jeff<00:05:05.190> Jarrett<00:05:05.490> can<00:05:05.580> had

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
so I would say if Jeff Jarrett can had

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.190 
so I would say if Jeff Jarrett can had
the<00:05:05.790> full<00:05:05.940> total<00:05:06.210> control<00:05:06.390> he<00:05:06.870> might<00:05:07.050> be<00:05:07.170> a

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
the full total control he might be a

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.050 
the full total control he might be a
better<00:05:07.380> guy<00:05:07.590> is<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.860> guy<00:05:08.010> his<00:05:08.370> father<00:05:08.670> was<00:05:08.850> a<00:05:08.910> man

better guy is a guy his father was a man

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.820 
better guy is a guy his father was a man
was<00:05:09.240> going<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.390> take<00:05:09.540> over<00:05:09.840> wbf<00:05:10.320> if<00:05:10.470> Vince<00:05:10.680> went
