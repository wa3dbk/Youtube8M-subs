 stay the night 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.310
 Obviously you would have recovered bastardidentro you must have just saved

 the life 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.720
 saved my life 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.110
 via the gracchi you have tied me to that thing 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.550
 animus 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.990
 I don't even know a nimbus 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.110
 why are you doing this to me 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.570
 mary of the information we need, Mr. Max 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.070
 information 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.830
 I'm a bartender because of what you want me to do as you teach me 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.539
 make a martini we know i am 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.869
 what is it 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:16.660
 I don't know what you're talking about 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.419
 I'm not a fool 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.699
 no time she is a murderer 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.429
 because I understand it - to something my employers are looking for 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.569
 hidden in the recesses of his mind 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.569
 but I'm not a murderer 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.759
 your file and confirm it 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.039
 there is talk of an escape 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.519
 a nice stroke of luck for us 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.059
 what do you want from me 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.069
 and do what you are told 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.099
 the soul will allow itself to find what we want 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.709
 when we will have free presentation to go 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.579
 I'm not back in there 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.319
 then induce the new municipalities we will continue the work 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.439
 when we're done, we won't die 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.449
 Andrea means to say the only reason why you are still aware of this 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.389
 procedure saves us time 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.929
 her and not only 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:10.299
 then it normalizes 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.299
 riccardo death 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.299
 September lights 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.419
 wise decision 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:30.899
 goooooaaal 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:32.179
 but what are they? 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.639
 create within the news 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.539
 would be to say 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:41.999
 is a projector that reproduces genetic memories in three-dimensional remembered dinners 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:46.699
 circulate with reserve any indication ahahha very well 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.829
 let's start from the basics 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:55.059
 what is a memory mr marines the gel memories of a past event. 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.529
 specific to individual who remember hypermotard 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:04.589
 yes sure if I told you that the human body pushed not only the memory of a 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:07.789
 individual but also that of his friends 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.909
 genetic memory if you want 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.709
 international migration reproduction as animals do when and when 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.749
 where to go what to do 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:22.219
 but it is only a hard animal instinct is discussing semantics meaning xd 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:26.469
 whatever you call it, the fact remains that these creatures keep their 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:30.029
 knowledge that transcends the requirement of personal experience 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.729
 I have spent the last 30 years trying to understand 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.090
 I discovered something very fascinating, our DNA works like an archive 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.880
 contains not only the genetic instructions derived from the generations 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.879
 past memories but also memories of our ancestors 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.580
 in the soul if it allows to decode to read these DNA files 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.219
 exact 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.059
 but there's a problem 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:00.109
 this is the specific memory we content ourselves with accessing in Mongolian 

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:03.369
 too much when we try to open that memory your mind re-enters the 

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:07.079
 ice cream security to enter the body of his ancestor is what it is 

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:08.029
 success first 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:12.249
 you have been expelled from the desired memory you are reported in a condition you were 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.149
 because in your subconscious soup we have not found resistance 

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:20.589
 similar reactions on patients undergoing doses to remove traumatic events. 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:24.559
 they can jump directly to a specific memory must be accompanied on 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:27.419
 travel in that case there may be problems 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.759
 and then how we do it 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.629
 we find a memory how you can tune in 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.370
 and let's proceed tallinn 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.280
 you will get used to the situation we cannot get closer than this 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.789
 so we should start from 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.779
 I'm uploading the destruction program
