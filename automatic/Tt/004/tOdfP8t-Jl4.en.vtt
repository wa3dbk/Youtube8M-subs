00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello vinyl friends and fishing line in this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.960
 trick we will teach you how to tie 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.440
 our line to a hook for it 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.440
 we need 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 the line that launched what we want to tie 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 and a nail clipper to finally cut the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.369
 excess thread tip 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.369
 the first thing we must do 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.940
 in the thread in this way 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.350
 leaving enough and what is left 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 we put the hook and place it here 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.430
 between our fingers 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.430
 so that the thread that this way 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.120
 and what we will do is 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.000
 the tip this tip is always quiet 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.700
 and the book will be spinning 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.830
 that this limb is in the center and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.830
 this one revolves around the hook 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.830
 we will give 789 laps 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 according to us we want 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.500
 and notice that there is always the tip of 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.420
 the line in the center 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.210
 once we have the turns 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.400
 we must 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.400
 here we see this tip 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.470
 the knot has already created the hook and 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.290
 will 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.420
 bring the knot to the side of the temple 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.980
 of the hook 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.410
 always make sure 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.100
 the thread is in this part from within 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.000
 of the hook shovel for what 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.000
 do not cut 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.550
 and we squeeze everything we can 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.830
 and now with 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.830
 nail clippers cut the excess 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.510
 and in this way the thread remains 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.510
 well tied to the ground 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.310
 and good friends we hope you serve 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.310
