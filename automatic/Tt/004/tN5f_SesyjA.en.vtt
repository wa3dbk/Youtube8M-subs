great<00:01:07.140> head<00:01:07.380> unit<00:01:07.650> from<00:01:07.740> eclipse<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.280> about

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
great head unit from eclipse it's about

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.920 
great head unit from eclipse it's about
the<00:01:08.580> front<00:01:08.850> speaker<00:01:09.240> systems<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.750> getting

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the front speaker systems and getting

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.840 
the front speaker systems and getting
good<00:01:10.049> sound<00:01:10.350> stage<00:01:10.710> plus<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.340> think<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.610> used<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
good sound stage plus I think you used a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
good sound stage plus I think you used a
trick<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> make<00:01:12.360> them<00:01:12.479> sound<00:01:12.689> better<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.380> did

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
trick to make them sound better what did

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.170 
trick to make them sound better what did
you<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.610> did<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.939> used<00:01:15.090> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
you do well what we did we used to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
you do well what we did we used to
probably<00:01:15.420> called<00:01:15.600> dynamat<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.530> happens

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
probably called dynamat and what happens

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
probably called dynamat and what happens
is<00:01:17.009> every<00:01:17.159> speaker<00:01:17.700> will<00:01:17.880> resonate<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.390> certain

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
is every speaker will resonate a certain

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
is every speaker will resonate a certain
frequency<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.470> when<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> does<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
frequency and when it does that it

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.950 
frequency and when it does that it
vibrates<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> metal<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.540> actually<00:01:21.869> lose

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
vibrates the metal you actually lose

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990 
vibrates the metal you actually lose
sound<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.070> use<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.310> product<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.909> a

sound so we use this product it's a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
sound so we use this product it's a
stick<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.360> Peele<00:01:24.570> product<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.530> does

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
stick and Peele product and was it does

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.770 
stick and Peele product and was it does
is<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.920> stops<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.549> metal<00:01:26.790> from<00:01:26.909> vibrating<00:01:27.360> in

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
is it stops the metal from vibrating in

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.510 
is it stops the metal from vibrating in
order<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.409> get<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.740> complete<00:01:28.950> sound<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.490> of

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and then we have a 400-watt amplifier

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.680 
and then we have a 400-watt amplifier
that<00:02:28.170> runs<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.770> 212<00:02:29.420> alright<00:02:30.420> well<00:02:30.540> we're

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
that runs the 212 alright well we're

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.660 
that runs the 212 alright well we're
going<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.930> wrap<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.320> up<00:02:31.410> for<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.890> overview<00:02:32.640> of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
going to wrap it up for the overview of

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.160 
going to wrap it up for the overview of
the<00:02:32.790> system<00:02:33.150> maybe<00:02:33.360> give<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.660> break<00:02:33.960> down

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
the system maybe give a break down

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.780 
the system maybe give a break down
really<00:02:34.350> quickly<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> whole<00:02:35.580> system

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
really quickly of what the whole system

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.570 
really quickly of what the whole system
cost<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.660> where<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.560> ranges<00:02:37.980> can<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.490> you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
cost and where the ranges can be if you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.010 
cost and where the ranges can be if you
don't<00:02:38.760> want<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.000> spend<00:02:39.210> all<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.600> money<00:02:39.630> oh

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
don't want to spend all the money oh

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.740 
don't want to spend all the money oh
well<00:02:40.560> basically<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.310> head<00:02:42.150> unit<00:02:42.330> with<00:02:42.600> the
