a I do think the other thing about last
night<00:01:50.490> was<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.420> should<00:01:51.840> show<00:01:52.079> some

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
night was that it it should show some

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
part he didn't just lose he lost my 41

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
part he didn't just lose he lost my 41
points<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.170> Senator<00:01:58.500> clinics<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> point

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
points and Senator clinics the point

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.889

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
general election on the other hand I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.749 
general election on the other hand I
don't<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.680> either<00:02:04.829> campaign<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.399> mean<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
don't think either campaign I mean that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
don't think either campaign I mean that
Senator<00:02:06.060> Obama<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.479> never<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:06.840> thinking

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
Senator Obama was never really thinking

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.380 
Senator Obama was never really thinking
of<00:02:07.259> West<00:02:07.469> Virginia<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.070> probable<00:02:09.000> victory

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
of West Virginia as a probable victory

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.240 
of West Virginia as a probable victory
state<00:02:09.630> for<00:02:09.869> him<00:02:09.989> right<00:02:10.440> probably<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> think

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
state for him right probably and I think

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.009 
state for him right probably and I think
it<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.430> shows<00:02:11.549> you<00:02:11.880> how<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> electoral<00:02:12.840> math

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
it just shows you how the electoral math

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.130 
it just shows you how the electoral math
gets<00:02:13.230> reshuffled<00:02:13.950> every<00:02:14.640> decade<00:02:15.000> or<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
gets reshuffled every decade or so and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.900 
gets reshuffled every decade or so and
both<00:02:16.230> Democrats<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.100> Republicans<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
both Democrats and Republicans have to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.309 
both Democrats and Republicans have to
put<00:02:18.090> together<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.660> slightly<00:02:19.080> different
