00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
had to work with the performance at all

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.420 
had to work with the performance at all
because<00:00:46.449> all<00:00:46.900> your<00:00:47.080> games<00:00:47.379> were<00:00:47.710> tailored<00:00:48.190> for

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
because all your games were tailored for

your specific console everything's all

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.869 
your specific console everything's all

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
standardized so you're never really have

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.229 
standardized so you're never really have
to<00:00:51.970> worry<00:00:52.150> about<00:00:52.269> that<00:00:53.729> piece<00:00:54.729> of<00:00:54.909> gaming's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
settings on that game so there's a lot

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.189 
settings on that game so there's a lot
that<00:01:02.409> goes<00:01:02.470> into<00:01:02.650> it<00:01:02.979> um<00:01:03.659> essentially<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.960> good

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
that goes into it um essentially a good

that goes into it um essentially a good
analogy<00:01:05.590> is<00:01:05.799> racing<00:01:06.250> if<00:01:06.790> it's<00:01:07.210> pretty<00:01:07.450> much<00:01:07.540> a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
analogy is racing if it's pretty much a

counter<00:01:31.360> definitely<00:01:31.990> look<00:01:32.080> into<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.440> but

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
counter definitely look into that but

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.280 
counter definitely look into that but
like<00:01:33.280> I<00:01:33.310> said<00:01:33.610> never<00:01:34.120> want<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.420> dip<00:01:34.630> below<00:01:34.780> 60

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
like I said never want to dip below 60

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.649 
like I said never want to dip below 60

a frame Distortion artifacts a lot of
stuff<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.620> really<00:01:41.890> hinder<00:01:42.100> your

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.600 
problems first thing just get a Barry
computer<00:01:55.510> better<00:01:55.950> processor<00:01:56.950> video<00:01:57.340> card<00:01:57.580> to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
computer better processor video card to

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.300 
computer better processor video card to
play<00:01:57.790> video<00:01:58.240> card<00:01:58.450> processor<00:01:59.100> Ram<00:02:00.100> would

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
play video card processor Ram would

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.010 
play video card processor Ram would
probably<00:02:00.670> be<00:02:00.729> three<00:02:01.240> biggest<00:02:01.510> things<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.870> can

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
probably be three biggest things you can

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
probably be three biggest things you can
upgrade<00:02:02.229> depending<00:02:02.830> on<00:02:02.950> what<00:02:03.040> you<00:02:03.130> have<00:02:03.479> but

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
upgrade depending on what you have but

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.620 
upgrade depending on what you have but
that's<00:02:06.040> out<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.460> question<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:07.420> cheap

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
that's out of the question the cheap

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.999 
that's out of the question the cheap
solution<00:02:07.810> will<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.289> be<00:02:08.379> a<00:02:08.409> large<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.799> video

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
solution will just be a large of video

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.740 
solution will just be a large of video
settings

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
settings

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.900 
settings
probably<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.680> biggest<00:02:12.160> thing<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.550> can<00:02:12.670> do<00:02:12.790> is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
probably the biggest thing you can do is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.240 
probably the biggest thing you can do is
disable<00:02:13.180> direct<00:02:13.750> pixel<00:02:14.140> Evan<00:02:14.440> that's<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.740> huge

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
disable direct pixel Evan that's a huge

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.790 
disable direct pixel Evan that's a huge
huge<00:02:15.970> impact<00:02:16.300> on<00:02:16.750> your<00:02:16.900> resources<00:02:17.410> on<00:02:17.680> your

huge impact on your resources on your

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.370 
huge impact on your resources on your
computer<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.850> can<00:02:19.420> really<00:02:19.720> help<00:02:19.870> out<00:02:20.230> your

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
computer and it can really help out your

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.760 
computer and it can really help out your
performance<00:02:20.920> texture<00:02:21.850> settings<00:02:22.560> depth<00:02:23.560> of

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
field not really for the performance but

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.810 
field not really for the performance but
it's<00:02:25.960> really<00:02:26.830> hindering<00:02:27.220> for<00:02:27.550> when<00:02:27.730> you're

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
it's really hindering for when you're

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.210 
it's really hindering for when you're
trying<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.090> aim<00:02:28.480> down<00:02:28.900> sight<00:02:29.290> long-range<00:02:29.890> it's

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
trying to aim down sight long-range it's

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.550 
trying to aim down sight long-range it's
really<00:02:31.000> blurry<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.510> basically<00:02:31.930> blurs<00:02:32.320> out

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
really blurry it basically blurs out

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.280 
really blurry it basically blurs out
your<00:02:32.800> own<00:02:32.950> vision<00:02:33.310> long<00:02:33.640> distances<00:02:34.209> so<00:02:34.870> more

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
your own vision long distances so more

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.620 
your own vision long distances so more
more<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.580> having<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.180> clearer<00:02:37.450> picture

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
more of it for having a clearer picture

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.920 
more of it for having a clearer picture
I<00:02:37.870> would<00:02:37.990> disable<00:02:38.320> at<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.010> field<00:02:39.250> but<00:02:39.970> game

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
I would disable at the field but game

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.270 
I would disable at the field but game
hasn't<00:02:41.110> have<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.350> be<00:02:41.440> pretty<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.830> mean<00:02:42.010> it's<00:02:42.160> a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
hasn't have to be pretty I mean it's a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.000 
hasn't have to be pretty I mean it's a
gorgeous<00:02:42.580> game<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.380> long<00:02:44.560> run<00:02:44.590> you

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
gorgeous game but in the long run you

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.610 
gorgeous game but in the long run you
want<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.340> sacrifice<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:47.500> have

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
want to sacrifice that to have

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.890 
want to sacrifice that to have
consistent<00:02:48.400> performance<00:02:48.940> so<00:02:49.330> definitely

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
consistent performance so definitely

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.440 
consistent performance so definitely
look<00:02:50.050> into<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.620> know<00:02:50.820> making<00:02:51.820> sure<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.270> have

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
look into you know making sure you have

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.630 
look into you know making sure you have
at<00:02:52.720> least<00:02:52.780> some<00:02:53.230> sort<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.980> stable<00:02:54.370> performance

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
at least some sort of stable performance

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.100 
at least some sort of stable performance

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
you probably could have killed them if

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.740 
you probably could have killed them if
you<00:03:09.430> didn't<00:03:10.000> have<00:03:10.090> those<00:03:10.239> issues<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.660> the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
you're in tight situations definitely go

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.240 
you're in tight situations definitely go
and<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.790> know<00:03:30.910> use<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.209> seatbelt<00:03:31.799> you<00:03:32.799> really

and you know use a seatbelt you really
want<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.790> get<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.480> get<00:03:34.600> out<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:34.930> as<00:03:35.230> soon

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
want to get in and get out of it as soon

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.800 
want to get in and get out of it as soon
as<00:03:35.530> possible<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.850> has<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.180> be<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.299> quick<00:03:37.510> trick

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
as possible it has to be a quick trick

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.240 
as possible it has to be a quick trick
because<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.260> longer<00:03:38.500> you're<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:38.650> there<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
because the longer you're in there the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.520 
because the longer you're in there the
more<00:03:39.519> vulnerable<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.570> are<00:03:40.600> for<00:03:41.019> enemy<00:03:41.290> firing

more vulnerable you are for enemy firing

pretty<00:05:59.880> much<00:06:00.060> if<00:06:00.300> you<00:06:00.930> have<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.199> have<00:06:01.349> about

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
pretty much if you have to have about

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.350 
pretty much if you have to have about
three<00:06:01.889> or<00:06:02.009> four<00:06:02.219> grenades<00:06:02.580> hit<00:06:02.880> to<00:06:03.180> kill

three or four grenades hit to kill

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.540 
three or four grenades hit to kill
someone<00:06:03.630> so<00:06:04.469> it's<00:06:04.590> more<00:06:04.740> of<00:06:04.830> a<00:06:04.919> spamming<00:06:05.400> what

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
someone so it's more of a spamming what

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.490 
someone so it's more of a spamming what
then<00:06:05.729> by<00:06:05.940> still<00:06:06.509> think<00:06:06.779> that<00:06:06.870> just<00:06:07.289> better

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
then by still think that just better

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.189 
then by still think that just better
options<00:06:07.979> available<00:06:08.449> then<00:06:09.449> to<00:06:09.750> use<00:06:09.990> the

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
options available then to use the

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.790 
options available then to use the
grenade<00:06:10.349> launcher<00:06:11.690> many<00:06:12.690> guns<00:06:12.930> you<00:06:13.380> know<00:06:13.500> it's

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
grenade launcher many guns you know it's

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.960 
grenade launcher many guns you know it's
guerilla<00:06:14.159> then<00:06:14.370> Stan<00:06:14.969> is<00:06:15.210> basically

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
guerilla then Stan is basically

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.120 
guerilla then Stan is basically
many<00:06:17.330> going<00:06:17.540> on<00:06:17.720> not<00:06:18.080> admitting<00:06:18.350> in<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.620> light

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
many going on not admitting in the light

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.880 
many going on not admitting in the light
machinegun<00:06:19.610> on<00:06:19.730> steroids<00:06:20.240> so<00:06:20.680> not<00:06:21.680> really

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
machinegun on steroids so not really

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.880 
machinegun on steroids so not really
much<00:06:22.010> to<00:06:22.040> talk<00:06:22.160> about<00:06:22.310> in<00:06:22.700> that<00:06:22.970> regard<00:06:23.420> and<00:06:23.890> um

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
much to talk about in that regard and um

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.820 
much to talk about in that regard and um
I<00:06:25.430> think<00:06:25.820> um<00:06:26.150> last<00:06:26.690> thing<00:06:26.900> probably<00:06:27.170> is<00:06:27.380> the

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
I think um last thing probably is the

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.660 
I think um last thing probably is the
railgun

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
railgun

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.770 
railgun
which<00:06:29.060> is<00:06:29.360> pretty<00:06:30.200> much<00:06:30.320> a<00:06:30.680> when<00:06:30.980> a<00:06:31.130> kill<00:06:31.460> on

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
which is pretty much a when a kill on

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.380 
which is pretty much a when a kill on
infantry<00:06:32.780> players<00:06:33.110> so<00:06:34.040> that's<00:06:34.790> also<00:06:35.030> pretty

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.390 
infantry players so that's also pretty

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.790 
infantry players so that's also pretty
handy<00:06:35.750> and<00:06:35.810> something<00:06:36.080> can<00:06:36.320> really<00:06:36.560> change

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
handy and something can really change

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.860 
handy and something can really change
the<00:06:37.190> scope<00:06:37.460> of<00:06:37.610> the<00:06:37.730> battle<00:06:38.060> or<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.330> game<00:06:38.540> so

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
the scope of the battle or the game so

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.770 
the scope of the battle or the game so

had<00:07:02.270> the<00:07:02.300> enemy<00:07:02.750> team<00:07:02.930> just<00:07:03.140> camping<00:07:03.470> the

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
point you use though the brimstone round

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.630 
point you use though the brimstone round
the<00:07:06.170> point<00:07:06.410> and<00:07:06.560> no<00:07:06.950> lawyers<00:07:07.220> called<00:07:07.550> an

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.640 
the point and no lawyers called an

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.910 
the point and no lawyers called an
airstrike<00:07:07.970> right<00:07:08.180> on<00:07:08.360> the<00:07:08.480> point<00:07:08.920> usually

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920 
airstrike right on the point usually

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.500 
airstrike right on the point usually
you'll<00:07:10.340> get<00:07:10.670> at<00:07:10.760> least<00:07:10.880> like<00:07:11.150> three<00:07:11.390> or<00:07:11.480> four

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
you'll get at least like three or four

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.280 
you'll get at least like three or four
of<00:07:11.810> them<00:07:11.930> off<00:07:12.290> the<00:07:12.530> bat<00:07:12.710> but<00:07:13.700> on<00:07:14.080> he<00:07:15.080> feels

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.290 
of them off the bat but on he feels

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.810 
of them off the bat but on he feels
great<00:07:15.620> especially<00:07:15.890> if<00:07:16.280> you're<00:07:16.430> in<00:07:16.520> those

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
great especially if you're in those

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.970 
great especially if you're in those
tough<00:07:17.150> situations<00:07:17.780> but<00:07:18.050> I<00:07:18.080> generally<00:07:18.560> think

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
tough situations but I generally think

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.340 
tough situations but I generally think
you<00:07:19.070> guys<00:07:19.250> should<00:07:19.280> just<00:07:19.550> avoid<00:07:19.760> it<00:07:19.970> um<00:07:20.350> you're

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
you guys should just avoid it um you're

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.860 
you guys should just avoid it um you're
not<00:07:21.380> gonna<00:07:21.680> get<00:07:21.980> better<00:07:22.160> just<00:07:22.760> by<00:07:22.940> using<00:07:23.180> a

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.870 
not gonna get better just by using a

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.260 
not gonna get better just by using a
hard<00:07:24.680> suit<00:07:24.920> all<00:07:25.040> the<00:07:25.070> time<00:07:25.190> using<00:07:25.700> your<00:07:25.820> rocket

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
hard suit all the time using your rocket

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.220 
hard suit all the time using your rocket
launcher<00:07:26.300> all<00:07:26.690> the<00:07:26.780> time

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
launcher all the time

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.410 
launcher all the time
you<00:07:27.470> want<00:07:27.650> to<00:07:27.740> improve<00:07:28.100> your<00:07:28.250> gun<00:07:28.430> skills<00:07:28.760> so<00:07:29.390> I

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:29.420 
you want to improve your gun skills so I

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.990 
you want to improve your gun skills so I
think<00:07:29.900> really<00:07:30.170> just<00:07:30.460> aside<00:07:31.460> from<00:07:31.610> health<00:07:31.880> and

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 
think really just aside from health and

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000 
think really just aside from health and
ammo<00:07:32.150> just<00:07:32.540> use<00:07:32.780> the<00:07:32.930> Depot<00:07:33.230> as<00:07:33.440> a<00:07:33.470> last<00:07:33.770> resort

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.010 
ammo just use the Depot as a last resort

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.210 
ammo just use the Depot as a last resort
or<00:07:34.670> just<00:07:34.880> using<00:07:35.060> sparingly<00:07:35.750> I<00:07:36.140> think<00:07:36.710> you<00:07:36.950> can

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.220 
or just using sparingly I think you can

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.270 
or just using sparingly I think you can
really<00:07:37.730> improve<00:07:38.480> a<00:07:38.630> lot<00:07:38.750> more<00:07:39.050> if<00:07:39.290> you<00:07:39.470> stick

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 
really improve a lot more if you stick

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.340 
really improve a lot more if you stick
to<00:07:40.400> your<00:07:40.520> guns<00:07:40.760> or<00:07:41.090> stick<00:07:41.390> to<00:07:41.540> you<00:07:41.750> know<00:07:41.870> your

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.350 
to your guns or stick to you know your

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.780
