00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.770
 the color guide of cold in wild in 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.750
 allows the dentist and the patient 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.750
 select the final color together 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.430
 The contour guide allows you to determine 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.610
 the shape and size of the veneers 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.460
 compose that they are going to place the 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.169
 Compose veneers are based 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.029
 individually the reverse label 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.520
 is used for the documentation of 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.120
 patient 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.640
 the veneers are removed with forceps 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.100
 before the preparation the color of the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.050
 dentin is determined cervically mind and the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.059
 of the enamel and finally on the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.059
 teeth using the color guide 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.879
 the prepared rubber dam is placed 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.450
 over the dental arch and it is fixed 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.510
 digitally using staples 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.760
 then if necessary the surface 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.400
 of the teeth is reduced by eliminating the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.960
 minimum possible amount of enamel we 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.150
 requires a defined margin of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.290
 preparation and shortening of the 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.290
 incisa edges them 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.080
 the preparation of the cervical zones 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.580
 of enamel is especially important 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.830
 the enamel is also prepared inter 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.960
 proximally mind to get a better 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.940
 adaptation 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.190
 the shape and size turn to 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.770
 check after the preparation and 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.780
 before removing the plate from the container if 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.940
 it is necessary the forms are corrected with 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.869
 a disk at low speed in an environment 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.869
 oral dry 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.100
 now the corrections in the form of 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.229
 cervical contour and length 15 salt 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.280
 can be verified directly on 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.170
 the tooth 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.210
 the engraving geo is applied on the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.090
 teeth and extends over all 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.490
 surfaces with a brush after 30 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.940
 seconds the gel is washed thoroughly with water 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.830
 for 30 seconds and air dry 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.130
 one coat point is evenly distributed 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.200
 especially the teeth and friction the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.360
 acting time is 20 seconds 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.370
 then an air jet is applied 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.270
 over the excessive until getting a 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.620
 thin layer and latex ivo excess is aspirated 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.569
 now the matrices are placed for 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.569
 ensure free access to the teeth 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.830
 the selected cementing composite is 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.300
 applied directly on the tooth and 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.400
 spreads evenly 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.980
 One coat bounce is applied on the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.600
 internal surface and at the margins is 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.230
 drip with air to get a 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.150
 thin layer and it does not prepolymerize the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.560
 cementing composite is also 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.990
 Apply the veneer to avoid 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.500
 inclusions of air it is important that the 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.420
 marginal adjustment be exact the first 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.790
 what would make composing is placed with 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.950
 tweezers on the tooth with the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.500
 positioner and its silicone adapter 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.960
 you can apply a uniform pressure and 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.090
 without slippage the great excesses 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.760
 of material are removed with a spatula 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.740
 specially designed for it and the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.070
 composite adapts exactly to the 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.070
 margins 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.410
 when the veneers are correctly 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.629
 positioned are photo polarized first 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.050
 by palatal and then by vestibular 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.060
 for 30 seconds each the others 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.550
 Veneers compose are placed the same 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.560
 way the marginal zones can be 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.260
 seal with a fled composer to 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.360
 ensure the integrity of the edges the 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.370
 excesses of composite are eliminated by 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.380
 palatino with a thick strawberry of 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.209
 pear-shaped diamond and the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.400
 continuity of the surfaces is 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.680
 check the areas with a probe 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.019
 cervical especially those close to 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.940
 interdental areas are worked with 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.390
 a fine diamond bur of 40 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.640
 micrometers with a flame before 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.709
 polish is checked for occlusion and if it is 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.970
 necessary is carved on the surfaces 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.010
 occlusal 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.140
 for cervical polishing are used 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.600
 ultrafine diamond burs 8 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.460
 micrometer the strawberries processes shape 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.240
 They are ideal for getting 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.640
 smooth transitions 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.890
 the interdental contouring is performed 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.350
 with diamond strips and later 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.770
 polished with thickness strips more and more 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.770
 fine 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.760
 the fine discs are indicated for the 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.620
 Interim angle Caesar crests 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.840
 marginals are contoured with pre 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.490
 bell-shaped polishers and with 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.630
 polisher is high gloss with 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.630
 air cooling 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.540
 at the end of the treatment the patient 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.490
 and the dentist evaluate together the appearance 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.740
 end of the restoration if they have 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.320
 restored several pieces will be agreed a 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.900
 Follow-up appointment for its brightness and 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.580
 luminosity the veneers make up 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.640
 deliver perfectly in their environment 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.640
 giving the patient an attractive smile 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.210
 yes 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.280
 yes
