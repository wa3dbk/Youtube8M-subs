 The 8th race crazy crazy this kitty 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 passed had in the ballad 8Âª race crazy 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 pirate 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.420
 the success of crazy music painted is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.750
 being a very pleasant surprise to 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.240
 people because when we got this 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.960
 music of a great composer of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.630
 savior, the face people fell in love 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.219
 music and soon noticed that it would be a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.920
 footprint very young come forward 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.730
 typical of ballad parties in the nightclub where 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.850
 We play a lot and it's crazy. 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.379
 An easy refrain then fell on my face 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.800
 I like the people a song that we 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.780
 is betting a lot and that now in 2014 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.960
 We're going to make a great clip. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.690
 who will portray and will give a start 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.969
 even more in this great song 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.060
 on the first day of carnival to be limit 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.750

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.080
 We made a carnival here, the people. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.299
 okay with this that our great moral that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.180
 great responsibility to open the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.250
 Carnival in the city on Friday 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.009
 I believe that around 10 o'clock 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.670
 boundary will be entering the avenue with 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.200
 electric trio and the galley 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 I want to call the galley to power. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.490

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.500
 galley of the whole region 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.670
