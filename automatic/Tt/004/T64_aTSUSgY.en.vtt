00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
group play didn't go so well but I guess

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.369 
group play didn't go so well but I guess
you<00:00:14.309> still<00:00:14.730> were<00:00:14.880> happy<00:00:15.269> coming<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:15.809> and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
you still were happy coming here and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.320 
you still were happy coming here and
what<00:00:17.190> were<00:00:17.340> your<00:00:17.460> expectations<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:18.300> been

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
what were your expectations have been

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.950 
what were your expectations have been
defeating<00:00:18.960> world<00:00:18.990> elite<00:00:20.449> like<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.689> knew<00:00:21.930> that

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
defeating world elite like we knew that

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.710 
defeating world elite like we knew that
they<00:00:22.289> aren't<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:23.400> good<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> team<00:00:24.420> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
they aren't really good as a team and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.060 
they aren't really good as a team and
the<00:00:24.960> other<00:00:24.990> teams<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.410> much<00:00:25.560> better<00:00:25.710> because

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the other teams are much better because

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.589 
the other teams are much better because
they<00:00:26.220> didn't<00:00:26.430> expect<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.760> play<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> didn't

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
they didn't expect to play so I didn't

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.349 
they didn't expect to play so I didn't
practice<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.039> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.880> expected

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
practice at all so we kind of expected

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.120 
practice at all so we kind of expected
this<00:00:30.480> outcome<00:00:30.869> because<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.679> didn't<00:00:31.920> practice

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
this outcome because we didn't practice

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.720 
this outcome because we didn't practice
much<00:00:32.340> ourselves<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:34.190> kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> expected<00:00:35.610> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
much ourselves so we kind of expected it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.530 
much ourselves so we kind of expected it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
practice hard and we definitely want to
be<00:00:52.590> home<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.370> were<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.850> top<00:00:54.030> eight

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
be home because we were like top eight

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.260 
be home because we were like top eight
at<00:00:54.329> least<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.649> gold<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.010> far<00:00:56.270> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
at least and that's all gold so far the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.040 
at least and that's all gold so far the
home<00:00:57.480> came<00:00:57.870> second<00:00:58.320> last<00:00:58.559> international<00:00:59.010> and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
home came second last international and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.209 
home came second last international and
seems<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> team<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:01.739> China<00:01:02.010> let's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
seems that the team from China let's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.799 
seems that the team from China let's
switch<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.489> Delta<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> first<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.660> they

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
switch to Delta to first but they

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.350 
switch to Delta to first but they
haven't<00:01:03.989> performed<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.559> well<00:01:05.180> how<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.240> you
