if I would ever get it in I iphone I

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.349 
if I would ever get it in I iphone I
would<00:02:38.590> jailbreak<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.159> just<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.549> get<00:02:40.150> out<00:02:40.180> of

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
would jailbreak it just to get out of

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.619 
would jailbreak it just to get out of
those<00:02:40.450> restrictions<00:02:40.840> because<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:42.510> prefer<00:02:43.510> to

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
those restrictions because I prefer to

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:44.940 
those restrictions because I prefer to
have<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> phone<00:02:44.079> I<00:02:44.109> can<00:02:44.260> do<00:02:44.439> a<00:02:44.470> little<00:02:44.620> bit<00:02:44.739> more

have a phone I can do a little bit more
and<00:02:45.810> that's<00:02:46.810> really<00:02:47.019> where<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.859> droid<00:02:48.159> comes

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
and that's really where the droid comes

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.460 
and that's really where the droid comes
in<00:02:48.579> now<00:02:49.180> what<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.540> really<00:02:49.840> like<00:02:50.019> about<00:02:50.049> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
in now what I really like about the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.500 
in now what I really like about the
droid<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:51.069> that<00:02:51.459> it's<00:02:51.579> got<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.909> full<00:02:52.090> keyboard

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
droid is that it's got the full keyboard

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.039 
droid is that it's got the full keyboard
and<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:54.010> has<00:02:54.549> just<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.120> beautiful<00:02:55.510> display<00:02:55.659> this

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
and it has just a beautiful display this

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.890 
and it has just a beautiful display this
is<00:02:56.230> what<00:02:56.409> is<00:02:56.500> Exley<00:02:56.739> nicer<00:02:57.129> than<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.430> iphone

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
is the touchscreen is incredibly

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.030 
is the touchscreen is incredibly
incredibly<00:03:09.370> accurate<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.989> droid<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.319> not<00:03:11.799> as

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
incredibly accurate the droid is not as

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.430 
incredibly accurate the droid is not as
accurate<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.939> causes<00:03:13.239> some<00:03:13.930> headaches<00:03:14.260> at

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
accurate and it causes some headaches at

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.569 
accurate and it causes some headaches at
times<00:03:14.650> but<00:03:15.220> it's<00:03:16.120> workable<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:17.280> but<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> main

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
times but it's workable and but the main

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.089 
times but it's workable and but the main
thing<00:03:18.609> to<00:03:18.849> realize<00:03:19.329> is<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.590> really<00:03:20.829> comes

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
thing to realize is that it really comes

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.240 
thing to realize is that it really comes
down<00:03:21.159> on<00:03:21.370> three<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.609> network<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:23.250> pretty

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
down on three a network is that pretty

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.589 
down on three a network is that pretty

the less hassles in the long run and for

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.860 
the less hassles in the long run and for
me<00:04:59.100> when<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.400> made<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.700> change<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.510> was<00:05:00.750> the

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
me when I made the change it was the

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.550 
me when I made the change it was the
right<00:05:00.960> decision<00:05:01.020> because<00:05:02.150> verizon<00:05:03.150> is<00:05:03.560> the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
right decision because verizon is the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.320 
right decision because verizon is the
only<00:05:04.740> network<00:05:04.980> that<00:05:05.250> really<00:05:05.580> is<00:05:05.760> worth<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.150> damn

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330

phone just slid in this one you had to

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.930 
phone just slid in this one you had to
kind<00:05:43.590> of<00:05:43.650> force<00:05:44.040> it<00:05:44.250> in<00:05:44.370> because<00:05:44.729> I<00:05:44.760> was<00:05:44.850> very

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
kind of force it in because I was very

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.360 
kind of force it in because I was very
tight<00:05:45.330> then<00:05:46.260> that<00:05:46.500> case<00:05:46.770> ended<00:05:47.040> up<00:05:47.160> breaking
