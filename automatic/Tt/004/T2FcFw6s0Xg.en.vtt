somewhere that the Richard Schaefer said

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.080 
somewhere that the Richard Schaefer said
that<00:00:47.340> Canelo<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.600> demanding<00:00:49.170> Lara<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that Canelo is demanding Lara and at the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
that Canelo is demanding Lara and at the
same<00:00:51.239> time<00:00:51.300> i<00:00:51.870> read<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.379> ladder<00:00:52.739> isn't

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
definitely fight Canelo in my opinion I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.869 
definitely fight Canelo in my opinion I
guess<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.920> also<00:02:29.160> depends<00:02:29.519> on<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
guess it also depends on the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.740 
guess it also depends on the
negotiations<00:02:30.720> what<00:02:31.379> if<00:02:31.500> Canelo<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.190> is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
negotiations what if Canelo is is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.380 
negotiations what if Canelo is is
offering<00:02:33.750> lata<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:35.129> little<00:02:35.459> money<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
offering lata so little money that to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.559 
offering lata so little money that to
the<00:02:36.480> point<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.780> maybe<00:02:37.170> lata<00:02:37.530> isn't<00:02:38.220> what

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
the point that maybe lata isn't what

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.910 
the point that maybe lata isn't what
well<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.599> don't<00:02:39.720> think<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.200> because<00:02:40.379> Lara<00:02:40.830> is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
well I don't think so because Lara is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.800 
well I don't think so because Lara is
under<00:02:41.310> al<00:02:41.580> Haymon<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.299> guess<00:02:42.540> there<00:02:42.720> won't

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
under al Haymon so I guess there won't

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.110 
under al Haymon so I guess there won't
be<00:02:42.989> any<00:02:43.140> problems<00:02:43.709> with<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> negotiation<00:02:44.879> so

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
be any problems with the negotiation so

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.960 
be any problems with the negotiation so
chances<00:02:45.540> are<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:47.040> fight<00:02:47.310> will<00:02:47.459> definitely
