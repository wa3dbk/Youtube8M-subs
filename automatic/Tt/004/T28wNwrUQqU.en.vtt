00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.059
 Ernst Ludwig Kirchner 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.320
 38 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.749
 as sunday 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.599
 Scene at the fountain 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.599
 1923-1925 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.050
 the Alb Sunday by Kirchner falls through 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.079
 unusual coloring on 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.890
 The basic colors of the picture are Green Blue Pink and Purple 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.410
 to match the landscape in color 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.450
 the representation is fleeting 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.450
 no details are displayed 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.240
 in the picture are eleven people in a small 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.730
 one on the easel and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 the season old is located above Davos 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.380
 writes his work as follows 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.150
 Emmental figure 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.900
 live a landscape 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.350
 it is a picture of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.010
 of peace 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.010
 the title Alp Sonntag Zauner at the fountain 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.250
 visibly thinking of a peaceful scene under free work school 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.570
 but look closer at the picture 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.950
 it is only limited this idea 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.000
 the people reach from the lower to the upper edge of the picture 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.960
 this gives him but little room 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.750
 considering that they will actually communicate with each other this 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.750
 String and, of course, Star 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.460
 You can not see the sky 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.350
 the sunlight and wide are not noticeable 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.229
 The impression of spatiality arises only through the overlay and the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.550
 Size ratios of the forms 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.430
 There is no driving perspective or modeling of the volume through the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.060
 colour 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.700
 that hardly recognizes that between the season Alb and the landscape in the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.630
 Background a valley lies 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.909
 and the way to the honored steel in the middle of the left upper half of the picture 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.420
 above and not into the depth 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
 the unique natural light source does not exist 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.730
 Example the different colors of the faces like light spot appear 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.339
 People do not throw any 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.389
 and the colors look rather bleak 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:18.229
 So the artist shows us a peaceful scene in a real one 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:22.489
 At the same time, landscape finds its fears through the formal realization 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.999
 felt loneliness and his own inner feeling expression 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.319
 the Kunstmuseum Bernd from the picture in 1933 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.329
 Cen Kirchner exhibition at the Kunsthalle Damen 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.989
 the art museum ladies 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.689
 if they have the works in the original 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.509
 and invite her 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:03.089
 to download from the App Store
