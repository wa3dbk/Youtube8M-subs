00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
out for and that was that the big quake

event this weather event would include
high<00:02:27.800> winds<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.640> flooding<00:02:30.459> at<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.850> time<00:02:32.120> I

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
high winds and flooding at the time I

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.350 
high winds and flooding at the time I
knew<00:02:33.110> nothing<00:02:33.140> about<00:02:33.970> geoengineering<00:02:34.970> or

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
knew nothing about geoengineering or

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.350 
knew nothing about geoengineering or
HAARP<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:38.110> finally<00:02:39.110> discovering<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:41.060> truth

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
HAARP and finally discovering the truth

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.449 
HAARP and finally discovering the truth
about<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.550> realized<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:45.230> was

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
about that I realized that this was

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.990 
about that I realized that this was
probably<00:02:46.459> what<00:02:46.790> would<00:02:46.910> happen<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:49.000> they

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
probably what would happen that they

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.820 
probably what would happen that they
would<00:02:52.750> do<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.780> HAARP<00:02:54.230> event<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.510> HAARP<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.930> HAARP

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
would do a HAARP event and HAARP a HAARP

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.300 
would do a HAARP event and HAARP a HAARP
related<00:02:58.610> weather<00:02:59.269> event<00:02:59.840> heart<00:03:00.620> made<00:03:00.920> weather

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
related weather event heart made weather

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.740 
related weather event heart made weather
event<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:04.459> in<00:03:04.580> itself<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.150> suppose<00:03:05.510> could

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
event and that in itself I suppose could

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.690 
event and that in itself I suppose could
set<00:03:05.989> off<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.530> quake

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.860 

now<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:11.140> not<00:03:11.440> my<00:03:12.209> strength<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.569> really

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
now this is not my strength I really

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.059 
now this is not my strength I really
don't<00:03:14.050> know<00:03:14.170> how<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.380> read<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.830> information

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
don't know how to read this information

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.270 
don't know how to read this information
I'm<00:03:15.849> just<00:03:16.060> looking<00:03:16.810> at<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:16.989> now<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:18.220> know

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
I'm just looking at it now and I know

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.800 
I'm just looking at it now and I know
there<00:03:18.640> are<00:03:18.790> people<00:03:19.060> out<00:03:19.330> there<00:03:19.360> who<00:03:19.780> really

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
there are people out there who really

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.199 
there are people out there who really
know<00:03:20.410> how<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.680> pull<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.190> data<00:03:21.489> together<00:03:21.790> and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
know how to pull this data together and

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.650 
know how to pull this data together and
I<00:03:22.300> hope<00:03:22.480> they<00:03:22.750> will<00:03:23.610> because<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.760> know<00:03:25.360> that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
I hope they will because I know that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.870 
I hope they will because I know that
many<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.620> us<00:03:26.800> are<00:03:27.540> very<00:03:28.540> very<00:03:28.900> concerned<00:03:29.880> it's

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
many of us are very very concerned it's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.640 
many of us are very very concerned it's
something<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:32.640> my<00:03:33.640> spirit<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.630> feel<00:03:35.050> about

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
something in my spirit that I feel about

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.190 
something in my spirit that I feel about
the<00:03:36.640> West<00:03:36.850> Coast<00:03:37.120> right<00:03:37.420> now<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.720> it's<00:03:38.019> like<00:03:38.170> a

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
the West Coast right now is it's like a

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.040 
the West Coast right now is it's like a
red<00:03:38.560> flag<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:39.190> my<00:03:39.370> spirit<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.330> there<00:03:40.959> are

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
red flag in my spirit and there are

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.900 
red flag in my spirit and there are
scientists<00:03:41.709> who<00:03:41.950> have<00:03:42.069> been<00:03:42.220> sending<00:03:42.790> out

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
scientists who have been sending out

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.110
