routine so I haven't concealed my face

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.490 
routine so I haven't concealed my face
at<00:00:09.090> all<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:09.750> feel<00:00:09.900> like<00:00:09.960> it's<00:00:10.260> so

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
at all and I just feel like it's so

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.249 
at all and I just feel like it's so
important<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.389> conceal<00:00:12.389> especially<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.049> me

important to conceal especially for me

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.680 
important to conceal especially for me
because<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.799> always<00:00:14.280> look<00:00:14.490> tired<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.420> my<00:00:15.450> own

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
because I always look tired in my own

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.260 
because I always look tired in my own
opinion<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:17.160> always<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.640> under<00:00:18.210> eye

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
opinion and I always have under eye

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.720 
opinion and I always have under eye
circles<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.619> will<00:00:19.830> go<00:00:19.949> ahead<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.430> show<00:00:20.490> you

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.750 
circles and I will go ahead and show you
the<00:00:20.910> steps<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.990> achieve<00:00:22.619> my<00:00:23.160> fresh

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the steps that I do to achieve my fresh

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.560 
the steps that I do to achieve my fresh
face<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.510> make<00:00:25.410> appt<00:00:25.560> not<00:00:25.800> liking<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.250> pound

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
face and make appt not liking that pound

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.759 
face and make appt not liking that pound
