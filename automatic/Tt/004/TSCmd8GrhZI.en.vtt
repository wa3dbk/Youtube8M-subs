this<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.119> I<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.599> duplicate<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.500> layer<00:00:31.669> from

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
this is I can duplicate the layer from

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.119 
this is I can duplicate the layer from
the<00:00:32.759> layers<00:00:33.030> palette<00:00:35.239> go<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.630> filter<00:00:37.260> down

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the layers palette go up to filter down

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.700 
the layers palette go up to filter down
to<00:00:38.190> blur<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> choose<00:00:39.329> average<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to blur and choose average what this

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680 
to blur and choose average what this
does<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.250> averages<00:00:41.969> all<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> colors<00:00:42.660> in

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
does is it averages all the colors in

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.220 
does is it averages all the colors in
the<00:00:43.050> image<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.620> gives<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> solid<00:00:44.610> color

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
the image and gives you a solid color

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.250 
the image and gives you a solid color
next<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.379> go<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.129> adjustment<00:00:48.090> layers<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:49.140> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
next I go to the adjustment layers and I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.189 
next I go to the adjustment layers and I
choose<00:00:49.500> levels<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:51.629> gray<00:00:51.840> point

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
layers and I turn off that solid color

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.210 
layers and I turn off that solid color
layer<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> adjusted<00:01:08.040> layer

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
layer and now we have the adjusted layer

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.679 
layer and now we have the adjusted layer
and<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.200> original<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:11.240> now<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.420> still

nice thing about the adjustment layers

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.160 
nice thing about the adjustment layers
it's<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.189> destructive<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.479> edit<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.930> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.899 
it's not destructive you can edit it so
I'm<00:01:19.590> not<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> double<00:01:20.340> click<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
I'm not going to double click on the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.990 
I'm not going to double click on the
actual<00:01:22.729> just<00:01:23.729> layer<00:01:24.060> itself<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.580> go<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.759> here

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
actual just layer itself and go in here

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.350 
actual just layer itself and go in here
for<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:27.689> I'll<00:01:27.930> try<00:01:28.229> auto<00:01:28.970> seems<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
for this one I'll try auto seems like it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.170 
for this one I'll try auto seems like it
might<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.689> little<00:01:30.869> too<00:01:31.020> much<00:01:31.729> they're<00:01:32.729> still

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
might be a little too much they're still

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.429 
might be a little too much they're still
so<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> blue<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:39.020> bring<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.079> down

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.999 
so I go to blue and just bring that down
a<00:01:40.500> bit<00:01:41.360> increases<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.540> black<00:01:43.040> go<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> green

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
a bit increases to black go to green

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.260 
a bit increases to black go to green
bring<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.220> down<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.909> white<00:01:51.240> is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
bring that down so and now the white is

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.850 
bring that down so and now the white is
pretty<00:01:51.659> white<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> black<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.619> pretty

pretty white and the black is pretty

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.840 
pretty white and the black is pretty
black<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.939> back<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.329> my<00:01:54.450> layers<00:01:54.689> again<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
black go back to my layers again and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.190 
black go back to my layers again and
remove<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.090> adjustment<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> show<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:57.990> what
