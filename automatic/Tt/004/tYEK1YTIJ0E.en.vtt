00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:05.190
 Many of the English children and adolescents often brutal computer games 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.449
 play later if you yourself violent 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.419
 This assumption has been studied in many studies 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.549
 but never could a direct connection be proved 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.519
 because of course, caution is needed if young people really only 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.039
 rumballern for hours on a screen 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.390
 Many adults even teachers could even do with this computer games world 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.329
 do not start anything 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.919
 no idea about the current games 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.659
 it will be useful if 50 teachers help out at the University of Leipzig 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.060
 For a few hours, Brigitte Heim Stars makes many students the whole thing 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.400
 Make weekend over 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.700
 constantly crawling and just shoot it seems completely absorbed 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.240
 from the game deeply immersed in the illegal ball fend off and because they 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.620
 wants to win where they shoot at their colleagues, of course 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.230
 Schaefer Dr Orchestra Dresden coach very treasures 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.170
 a couple had the attacker in the 3 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.350
 be applied more 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.090
 by the self-experiment we can have why their students sometimes 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.400
 are inattentive 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 and why are the threshold for violence 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.100
 Colleague of the Chatpartner Sattelzug has shot two children 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.560
 that will be successful 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.470
 As donations, bites horrified blood and your leg s so when you go 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.820
 In fact, open opponents find it to be a creeping death 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.160
 our Samsung 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.310
 not so dramatic roles 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.270
 actually read 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.090
 now is Action Concept s 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.690
 terrifying bloodthirsty 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.159
 So far, it was only a game for later gunman 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.979
 that they knew from television now they too are afraid that their students 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.190
 where the real world would like to kill 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.710
 Such a game is addictive and you should talk about it with the students 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.420
 speak Attac Klopsch Weather first ask my class teacher to 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.399
 what has already made experience and how much time spend with it 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.180
 I appreciate the electricity customer numbers 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.740
 but that makes me curious 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.910
 who really does that 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.960
 and to what extent 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.120
 Awareness that is a goal of the University of Leipzig 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.400
 The media educator, however, does not want the teachers to be the students 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.370
 People from the other star happen Teachers should be able to have a say and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.179
 maybe also able to play with 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.459
 There are also games in corresponding year lessons 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.549
 maybe fit in 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.480
 So a construction simulation by simply pointing can be economical here 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.189
 To make connections even playful and thereby reach 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.040
 Of course, I also motivate students who have said things here 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.700
 Book or something that interests me as no longer so counter-strike is with it 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:40.690
 but not meant 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.420
 because the teachers also played games for which they could get excited and 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.220
 Maybe the Leipzig students will not be looking forward to the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.160
 Pause but to the next level
