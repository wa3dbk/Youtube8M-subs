00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello how are you I hope that super good and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.750
 today I bring you a video of hold of 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.360
 some little things that I've been buying 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 and want to share them with you are not 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.620
 many things so it's not going to be a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.509
 video like that super long and good to me 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.039
 I love this kind of videos because 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.350
 so maybe I want to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.170
 buy me something but I do not have anymore where 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.439
 they sell and these videos they serve me 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.180
 as for an orientation or review in 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.369
 the Chinese stores that we sometimes have 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 doubts and then to start in the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.110
 comments of this type of videos them 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 help if it seems useful to you and so I know if 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.200
 follow them doing and well let's 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.149
 start 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.770
 the first thing is this coat of jean inside 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.510
 As you know I had already made a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 order from this store and the truth is 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.039
 really liked the quality and everything and this 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.559
 Private order arrived quite fast 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.379
 and well I asked for this coat that is in 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.390
 pink and I think it's perfect for the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.170
 transition to spring to go 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.090
 like putting more cake to the outfits and 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.100
 besides they are not so thick as to 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.950
 that you die of heat because if it continues 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.340
 being still cold and I think 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.619
 that if the season changes as it is 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.930
 half of March then if still 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.300
 there are many weeks of cold and then my 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.950
 Perfect pressure for the transition 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.320
 taxes I do not know the pink color is one 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.630
 of my favorites and that I do not like 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.060
 I wanted to add some color to my 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.289
 wardrobe so buy station sweet 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.860
 but it's short and brings this cut here in 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.420
 the chest part but I do not like 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.170
 because I feel that from the bottom 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.340
 well here is an opening how 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.000
 leave the breasts if you're not careful 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.580
 but I think that closing a little bit 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.410
 better giving him a stitch or something 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.780
 because the zipper has it for the part 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.490
 from behind I think I could hold everything 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.159
 very very well so 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.079
 but I find it beautiful and the cut 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.580
 It is also very beautiful 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.430
 so 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.800
 I asked for it I had to ask for it and well 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.830
 following with this wave of things a little 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.830
 fresher and more for the seasons 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.500
 that they come to me I asked for this dress the 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.210
 color seems beautiful to me in the past year 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.880
 because all the bloggers bought it 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.160
 because I did not get it myself a page 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.170
 I was exhausted so when I saw it that 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.570
 they had it in stock definitely what 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.930
 I had to have it does not matter if it's not 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.480
 so fashionable I wear what I like 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.460
 Of course it's nice to follow a 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.610
 little in the trends what you have left 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.459
 Well, well, you're not going to lose your 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.120
 personality so then if something does 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.640
 like you put it on, I also gave myself this 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.130
 dress that is like with a cut 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.990
 Asymmetrical in the part of the skirt has 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.910
 it cost us a little deep but I think 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.670
 that with him the underwear has to be able 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.160
 It can be very elegant and with this 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.590
 belt and I love the combination of 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.630
 black with gold I think it's perfect and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.480
 I think it's one 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.520
 little dresses that fit you or fit you 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.410
 very well and that are perfect for 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.180
 have them for any trouble or 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.850
 any event that we do not know that 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.040
 put them and good in Sara's sales 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.260
 that almost finished I bought this 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.110
 little bag you know that you no longer cover 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.410
 no white blouses because if they do not take me out 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.290
 of some trouble and this one has sleeves 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.780
 as well as transparent as lace and 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.880
 super feminine the cut is also super 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.100
 feminine and I think it's very cool 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.400
 to go as if the transition 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.730
 next season and then this color 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.100
 combines with everything in any season 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.080
 and well from bershka I got this blouse 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.110
 that is very police the court of the other 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.240
 but this one is in color like rose unemployment and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.810
 it is very cool, that is, 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.550
 brands are very very normal but I think 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.100
 that is beautiful and with a necklace that 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.950
 highlight more because you can see very beautiful 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.800
 as well 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.160
 finally at h &amp; m I got this serum 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.590
 it was lowered as 200 pesos I think the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.500
 I do not know, I really liked the color 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.440
 It makes me super comfortable I put it with 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.040
 these as you will see LEDs that are like this 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.110
 Lacy and I know I liked a lot of 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.269
 cosmetics that you already have marketing and 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.609
 I think I buy a gesture that 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.570
 you approve the time but I had not gone 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:26.650
 him and is this the hero of mac is the is 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.110
 like mate is not not like mate is mate and 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.780
 It's super nice I really like 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.760
 you know one day I can give you for 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.490
 this kind of lipsticks that are not so so 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.500
 economical than to disapprove if you 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.080
 you feel good with him because he comes back 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.590
 you buy it and I also bought this 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.410
 rumor that it's also matte finish and it 's 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.470
 beautiful and color at a perfect price it 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.090
 llama desert rose and I 'm going to go 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.790
 making approach to things for 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.360
 that you can see them more in detail 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.300
 and there I went to do there I bought this 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.670
 pencil that is called instant bragged and what 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.110
 what I like is that on the side of one 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.780
 from the sides brings a little brush 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.760
 superpractice the color also I chose 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.620
 I like it a lot for the eyebrow and I think 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.320
 It's perfect for travel themes 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.610
 because nothing else with the pita stuffed and 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.940
 ready and I also bought this one called 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:25.810
 and king space that is of benefit also and 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.690
 It is very very beautiful because the texture is 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.090
 soft and slides very well in 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.160
 the skin when you put it on and also I 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.800
 I really liked it and it's being one of my 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.410
 favorites finally happened to me from xavi 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.930
 I bought this that is like tree oil 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.600
 but it only brings a concentration 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.400
 of 15 percent and I bought it for 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.800
 the granites what I do is take a 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.380
 little bit with your finger and I'm going 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.840
 applied at night or by 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.460
 mornings and if it helps me to dry 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.200
 quite because I have some 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.780
 due to stress 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.360
 I liked it very much smells like herbs 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.350
 and because it is perfect and not being so 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.110
 Concentrate because it does not hurt your skin 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.000
 If you have sensitive skin I hope you 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.460
 I would like you to have entertained 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.500
