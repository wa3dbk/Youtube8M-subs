00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
is pretty much instant as you accelerate

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.330 
is pretty much instant as you accelerate

filling<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.770> machine<00:01:05.009> is<00:01:05.130> very<00:01:05.309> easy<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
filling up the machine is very easy the

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.650 
filling up the machine is very easy the
it's<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.800> touched<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.490> small<00:01:08.910> touch<00:01:09.119> screen<00:01:09.450> by

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
it's all touched a small touch screen by

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.740 
it's all touched a small touch screen by
the<00:01:10.250> induction<00:01:11.250> hopper<00:01:11.550> you<00:01:12.149> hit<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.330> button<00:01:12.509> it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the induction hopper you hit a button it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.180 
the induction hopper you hit a button it
starts<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:13.170> fill<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.619> hit<00:01:13.740> another<00:01:13.950> button

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
starts to fill you hit another button

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.660 
starts to fill you hit another button
and<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.000> induction<00:01:15.390> hopper<00:01:15.630> works<00:01:16.670> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and the induction hopper works the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.840 
and the induction hopper works the
autofill<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.390> set<00:01:18.600> from<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.610> cab<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
autofill is set from the cab of the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.670 
autofill is set from the cab of the
machine<00:01:21.149> so<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.479> fill<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> designated

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
machine so you fill up to a designated

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.240 
machine so you fill up to a designated
amount<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> stops<00:01:23.490> automatically<00:01:25.250> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
amount and it stops automatically and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.560 
amount and it stops automatically and
the<00:01:26.310> clean<00:01:26.490> water<00:01:26.640> tank<00:01:27.000> fills<00:01:27.210> at<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> same

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the clean water tank fills at the same

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.640 
the clean water tank fills at the same
time<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.229> wish<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.940> very<00:01:30.210> easy
