issues<00:00:19.080> I've<00:00:19.320> been<00:00:19.590> having<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.189> truck

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
issues I've been having on this truck

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.089 
issues I've been having on this truck
you<00:00:20.970> recall<00:00:21.900> if<00:00:22.199> you've<00:00:22.380> seen<00:00:22.619> part<00:00:22.919> one<00:00:23.249> I<00:00:23.640> was

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
you recall if you've seen part one I was

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.450 
you recall if you've seen part one I was
almost<00:00:26.099> 100%<00:00:26.669> sure<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:28.039> this<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
almost 100% sure that this was the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.960 
almost 100% sure that this was the
culprit<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> about<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.950> when<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.280> got<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.670> hand

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
culprit so about this when I got my hand

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.300 
culprit so about this when I got my hand
put<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.810> truck<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.680> didn't<00:00:38.010> fix<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
put on the truck it didn't fix the

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.490 
put on the truck it didn't fix the
problem

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
problem

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.670 
problem
well<00:00:41.360> had<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:43.190> checked<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:45.260> before<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.290> put<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
well had I checked this before I put it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.200 
well had I checked this before I put it
on<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> truck<00:00:47.220> I<00:00:47.460> probably<00:00:47.730> would<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.000> saved

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
on the truck I probably would have saved

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.890 
on the truck I probably would have saved
a<00:00:48.450> lot<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.900> hassle<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.180> main<00:00:51.420> reason<00:00:51.870> for

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
a lot of hassle but the main reason for

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.310 
a lot of hassle but the main reason for
the<00:00:52.170> video<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.040> show<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.720> or<00:00:54.720> try<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> show

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the video was to show you or try to show

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010 
the video was to show you or try to show
you<00:00:56.420> some<00:00:57.420> trouble

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
you some trouble

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.120 
you some trouble
how<00:00:58.470> to<00:00:58.530> troubleshoot<00:00:58.860> how<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.610> test<00:01:00.090> circuits

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
how to troubleshoot how to test circuits

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.800 
how to troubleshoot how to test circuits
and<00:01:02.130> this<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> pretty<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.850> pretty<00:01:03.329> simple

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
and this is pretty a pretty simple

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.340 
and this is pretty a pretty simple
circuit<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.450> pretty<00:01:06.659> sure<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:06.990> it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
circuit and I was pretty sure that it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.910 
circuit and I was pretty sure that it
wouldn't<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> computer<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:09.230> if<00:01:10.230> I<00:01:10.470> had<00:01:10.680> me<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
wouldn't the computer but if I had me a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.910 
wouldn't the computer but if I had me a
little<00:01:11.100> bit<00:01:11.250> buffaloed<00:01:11.790> really<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.110> I'd<00:01:13.650> put

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
little bit buffaloed really so I'd put

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
little bit buffaloed really so I'd put
the<00:01:14.100> old<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:16.050> old<00:01:16.080> relay<00:01:16.710> back<00:01:17.010> on<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the old the old relay back on here and I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.870 
the old the old relay back on here and I
think<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.470> issue<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.580> old<00:01:20.700> one

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
think what the issue is with the old one

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.360 
think what the issue is with the old one
is<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.300> believe<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.720> sticking<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
is I believe it's sticking because it

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.370 
is I believe it's sticking because it
did<00:01:23.550> work<00:01:23.790> when<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.120> bench<00:01:24.479> test<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.050> but<00:01:25.260> it

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
did work when I bench test it but it

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.070 
did work when I bench test it but it
didn't<00:01:25.620> work<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> truck<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
didn't work on the truck so then I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.530 
didn't work on the truck so then I
stopped<00:01:28.409> by<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:30.270> got<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> picked<00:01:31.110> up<00:01:31.260> another

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
stopped by and got a picked up another

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.280 
stopped by and got a picked up another
another<00:01:33.540> relay

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
another relay

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.620 
another relay
with<00:01:35.440> pretty<00:01:35.920> much<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.190> exact<00:01:36.730> relay<00:01:37.150> is<00:01:37.330> this

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
with pretty much the exact relay is this

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.910 
with pretty much the exact relay is this
one<00:01:38.490> stuck<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.640> on<00:01:39.790> here<00:01:40.120> I<00:01:40.390> had<00:01:41.290> no<00:01:41.320> problem

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
one stuck it on here I had no problem

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.210 
one stuck it on here I had no problem
sense<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.930> what<00:01:44.110> I'm<00:01:44.260> going<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.470> do<00:01:44.590> today<00:01:44.740> is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
sense so what I'm going to do today is

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.820 
sense so what I'm going to do today is
I'm<00:01:45.730> gonna<00:01:45.910> take<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.360> whole<00:01:46.450> relay<00:01:46.900> off<00:01:47.140> and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
I'm gonna take the whole relay off and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:56.790 
I'm gonna take the whole relay off and
remove<00:01:48.160> mount<00:01:49.030> this<00:01:49.240> new<00:01:49.570> one<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:55.800> then

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
remove mount this new one and so then

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.160 
remove mount this new one and so then
I'll<00:01:56.950> crank<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.430> up<00:01:57.520> for<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.600> I'll<00:01:58.840> show

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
I'll crank it up for you and I'll show

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.210 
I'll crank it up for you and I'll show
you<00:01:59.230> that<00:01:59.440> it's<00:01:59.620> working<00:01:59.800> fine<00:02:00.220> now

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
you that it's working fine now

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.950 
you that it's working fine now
I've<00:02:03.220> got<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:04.030> new<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.690> mounted<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:07.510> guess

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
I've got the new and mounted and I guess

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.650 
I've got the new and mounted and I guess
the<00:02:08.140> moral<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:08.649> story<00:02:08.710> is<00:02:09.250> never<00:02:09.660> assumed

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
the moral of this story is never assumed

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.600 
the moral of this story is never assumed
that<00:02:11.050> because<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.590> parts<00:02:11.950> knew<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.460> it's

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
that because the parts knew that it's

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.840 
that because the parts knew that it's
going<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.880> work<00:02:13.090> especially<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.890> electronic

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
going to work especially in electronic

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.310 
going to work especially in electronic
Park<00:02:17.460> but<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:19.000> hadn't<00:02:19.720> had<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.050> trouble

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
Park but I hadn't had that trouble

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.410 
Park but I hadn't had that trouble
before<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.190> will<00:02:21.490> be<00:02:21.670> checking<00:02:21.910> from<00:02:22.240> now

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
before but I will be checking from now

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.930 
before but I will be checking from now
on<00:02:22.660> any<00:02:22.900> kind<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.460> anything<00:02:24.460> that<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.730> could

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
on any kind of anything that I could

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.130 
on any kind of anything that I could
check<00:02:25.930> for<00:02:27.540> stick<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.660> on<00:02:28.810> there<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:30.270> now<00:02:31.270> she's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
check for stick it on there so now she's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
check for stick it on there so now she's
super<00:02:32.350> far

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.430 

it's<00:02:43.160> worth<00:02:43.370> good<00:02:43.700> now<00:02:44.000> and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440
