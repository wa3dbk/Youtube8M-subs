00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.220
 hi hello friends you want a donnet me 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.139
 there are two still I do not guarantee that 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.690
 come to the end of the video but have 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.600
 been talking here with my friends the 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.520
 ducklings 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.870
 I came to aranjuez there was no 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.830
 You never come here by bike the case 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.480
 of what are the things that always 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.280
 I train here in the area and the truth 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.740
 is that it never had become a 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.779
 except one day I want to remember the day that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.150
 follow the 160- kilometer route with the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.740
 grupeta but it is not an area to which 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.600
 usually a wish 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.239
 hydrangea climb ports and I'm going to do 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.830
 about 33 hours three and a half hours out there 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.930
 although with the treatment that I am taking 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.330
 here for the donettes and the water and such 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.340
 about which will be more time 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.809
 I wanted to record a video for a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.400
 conversation that is repeating itself in 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.230
 the last weeks that I'm having with 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.500
 different people from different environments 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.019
 different moves I'm going to talk about what 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.970
 which is to challenge you something like 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.580
 titan desert but I really think that it 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.460
 you can apply to any any 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.260
 another similar challenge that you want you to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.710
 you want to do is not that it calls me a lot 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.990
 the attention and I included myself and included myself in 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.730
 the excuses that one can get to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.930
 put with such 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.670
 put on patches before having the wound 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.020
 I remember when I drew this 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.390
 history of the titan desert this year 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.950
 and with this year that is with the year that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.630
 rather it is going to happen is 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.190
 happening exactly the same as my 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.750
 mind has been focused in a way 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.260
 brutal and that facilitates everything 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.420
 very much but I see many people who 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.490
 they talk about appointments in this case of 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.230
 any other story an ironman can 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.300
 know what you call it does not matter 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.780
 it starts not very hard such money the time 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.370
 I do not have time 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.200
 I've seen so many things in this year and in 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.270
 concrete in the current titan that the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.360
 written with one leg and people who 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.170
 came from a stroke and many people with more 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.310
 50 years old even a man with 67 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.310
 the truth that these things 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.259
 well if you do not want for the reason that 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.600
 it's very different if you do not want 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.069
 make a challenge of this type or do not you 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.720
 fancy or whatever by perfect what 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.239
 he says not sometimes that I do not want he does not go 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.000
 with me now I want to do it but not 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.280
 can equip to save the patatín money 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.040
 patatán 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.110
 fuck take I do not believe anything I do not believe 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.660
 nothing has to be very weird has to 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.640
 be truly that your situation 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.530
 economic whatever it is complicated 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.060
 so you can not face it 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.440
 because people tell me that I do not 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.690
 I want to remove for example that image 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.489
 it's weeks a little angel of mine is that a 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.560
 challenge of this type requires sacrifices and 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.940
 immediately you have to take off the four 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.470
 Cups on Fridays and Saturdays 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.120
 after having to remove but it's a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.709
 question of priorities so if your 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.200
 Priority on Saturdays no problem 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.540
 but it's clear that something like titan 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.800
 requires sacrifice and no longer just 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.800
 economic level trainings 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.459
 but I think it 's part of the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.459
 challenge also investment and saving 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.630
 economic even notice that it happens to you 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.459
 how you fight like there are people that you 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.530
 happened there the first day you get a 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.360
 mosquita has house fire 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.730
 imbecile face that has to stay 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.530
 it's important because you stay in one 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.819
 proof of a day is better life because the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.260
 story then imagine something like 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.440
 city that implies more travel outside 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.280
 from your country etc. and so on 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.819
 I sincerely believe that the people we 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.380
 we put too many excuses sometimes for 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.220
 do certain things I do not say 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.170
 sporting challenges that is evidently 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.430
 cod in which resigned but 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.620
 general for anything are not 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.200
 too many things we do not try 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.000
 justify a lot to ourselves I think 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.610
 it's good that we are aware of 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 what is shit all people who do not do not 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.210
 like he can not like this like that 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.980
 the other clear thing that can another thing that not 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.200
 you're going to compete that you're not going to do it 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.390
 a level of the host but put you what 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.430
 I'm going to make it clear it requires sacrifices 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.390
 what do you think if there is a phrase 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.520
 I really like it says that if it were 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.820
 easy everyone would do it there is a 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.110
 true as a temple friends but 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.130
 lately I have been told many things and 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.230
 the truth that I found curious 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.050
 noise always comes to the same conclusion 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.810
 if you put so many excuses first you 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.940
 is dominating the fear and second 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.640
 you do not really want to do one thing if 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.100
 not the version if you want to go through it 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.989
 blue then you may not get there then you can 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.850
 do not do it because once you're 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.330
 in a race I have things happen for not 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.849
 finish 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.530
 and they are not necessarily your fault it 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.319
 but even in the course you can 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.699
 pass food but johnny k 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.080
 mikael and that last year I was going to do 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.270
 the titan with me this year we're going to 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.159
 try to do it again last year 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.569
 because it gave him a problem in a kidney he had 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.419
 to stop training for almost 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:46.129
 four months and a couple of months or a month 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.129
 and a half before the titan 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.970
 unviable and used in preparation 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.040
 pretty short on yesterday and I 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.500
 it seemed fine but this year the return to 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.230
 try is an example that you have to 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.900
 spend something very weird so you can not 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.030
 do what you really want if you 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.010
 you really want to do it 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.129
 I want to finish the buttons that I 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.409
 are left and then for home I need 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.029
 you arrive and not methods and do not enter a postscript 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.379
 is that it is no longer a video 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:16.569
 lately I like it I just 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.189
 write with a person here from 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.789
 aranjuez which met in latita 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:23.739
 Manuel Mar and the written message program 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.360
 answer is working whatever it is 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.830
 that I remember perfectly and antenor 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.159
 has told a conversation I had with 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.349
 him on the bus on the way out 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.839
 of guzman ages in this year's titan 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.580
 and it is that he spoke to me that he saves 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.769
 throughout the year for the ink of 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.099
 say your holidays are great 

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:44.709
 because that's what I like that 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.269
 It seems that it is a perfect definition of 

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.939
 a little what I was talking about earlier 

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:51.189
 I do not have money now I do not have 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.349
 time this man trains at night 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:54.849
 a couple of hours of knee or three and those 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.339
 weekends out when you can be your 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.280
 training for the titan and he pulls 

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:02.770
 all year long preparing what 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.630
 if you want you can if you want you can to the 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:09.480
 ctu self-deception, whatever you want 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.480
 but if you want you can now if I go
