folded over piece of leather you know
with<00:01:15.240> us<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> swivel<00:01:17.009> belt<00:01:17.460> loop<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.550 
with us like a swivel belt loop and it
just<00:01:19.049> wasn't<00:01:19.409> very<00:01:19.790> nice-looking<00:01:21.320> plus<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
just wasn't very nice-looking plus the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
just wasn't very nice-looking plus the
knife<00:01:22.740> would<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.070> stuck<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:23.880> he'd

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
knife would get stuck in it and he'd

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.940 
knife would get stuck in it and he'd
have<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.689> squeeze<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> whole<00:01:25.500> thing<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
have to like squeeze the whole thing to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.660 
have to like squeeze the whole thing to
get<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> down<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.110> didn't<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.860> so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
get it down so I didn't like that so

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700 
get it down so I didn't like that so
what<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> did<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.810> went<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> tandy<00:01:31.470> Leather

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
what I did was I went to tandy Leather

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.060 
what I did was I went to tandy Leather
and<00:01:33.020> picked<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.170> some<00:01:34.350> leather<00:01:34.560> picked<00:01:34.950> up

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and picked up some leather picked up

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.149 
and picked up some leather picked up
some<00:01:35.310> hardware<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.320> I<00:01:37.490> built<00:01:38.540> my<00:01:39.540> own<00:01:39.570> sheath

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
some hardware and I built my own sheath

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.719 
some hardware and I built my own sheath
now<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> carry<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.890> sounds

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
now I was going to carry it it sounds

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.399 
now I was going to carry it it sounds
stupid<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.299> was<00:01:45.479> hoping<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.049> carry<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
stupid but I was hoping to carry it

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.929 
stupid but I was hoping to carry it
concealed<00:01:47.390> but<00:01:48.680> there's<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.799> law<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.040> Nebraska

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
concealed but there's a law in Nebraska

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.550 
concealed but there's a law in Nebraska
and<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.060> guess<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> lot<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.750> other<00:01:51.899> states<00:01:52.229> maybe

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and I guess a lot of other states maybe

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.230 
and I guess a lot of other states maybe
the<00:01:52.829> entire<00:01:52.979> country<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.810> can't<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
the entire country that you can't have a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
the entire country that you can't have a
knife<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> blade<00:01:57.719> over<00:01:58.189> or<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.430> three

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
knife with a blade over or like three

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580 
knife with a blade over or like three
and<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.909> half<00:02:00.060> inches<00:02:00.509> concealed<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.350> illegal

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and a half inches concealed it's illegal

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.800 
and a half inches concealed it's illegal
and<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.700> 8<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> half<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.540> I'd<00:02:03.630> probably

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
and this is 8 and a half so I'd probably

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.690 
and this is 8 and a half so I'd probably
be<00:02:04.259> doing<00:02:04.469> some<00:02:04.829> time<00:02:05.100> for<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.429> made<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
be doing some time for that so I made a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.930 
be doing some time for that so I made a
drop<00:02:09.060> leg<00:02:09.390> sheath<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
drop leg sheath and you can see the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.089 
drop leg sheath and you can see the
straps<00:02:12.239> there

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
straps there

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.649 
straps there
