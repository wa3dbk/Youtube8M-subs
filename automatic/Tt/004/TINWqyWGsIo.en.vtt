00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
 very cross 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.019
 Welcome to the live 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.610
 here I bring you another video guys and this 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.170
 We're going to see a tutorial on how 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.480
 use a turntable to activate 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.860
 any kind of mechanism and we have 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.360
 sometimes seen for example with a 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.650
 oven but I did not know that you could 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.390
 do with a record player I want to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.680
 take advantage to thank you one 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 from my dear subscribers 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.369
 walter xp for giving me the idea of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.590
 use it with a record player I did not know 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.419
 that could be used so so many 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.579
 thank you walter and let's what is the 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.230
 tutorial because it's pretty simple 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.250
 guys now you're going to see it first 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 what we have to do is simply 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.500
 put the record player in the back 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.240
 let's put a sticky piston in the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.940
 which are we going to put a block of 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.890
 any material once we have this 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.240
 done guys are we going to go to one of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.250
 the sides and let's put two 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.140
 blocks on top of each other as I say 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.730
 of any material and in front of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.920
 those two blocks we're going to put two more 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.329
 online in the block that stays more 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.430
 At the end we are going to put an antenna 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.710
 red stone and in the other we're going to put 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.570
 a repeater as you can see very simple 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.979
 moment guys in front of the piston 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.380
 adhesive in front of the block that we have 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.270
 put we are going to dig a block and put 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.560
 an antenna red stone if they let us 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.570
 the Wolves 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.479
 and it would only be to put red stone of the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.520
 way you're going to see here and for this 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.590
 side also this would be what is the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.149
 exit from the circuit so that 's where 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 let's connect everything as usual 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.570
 always in this type of circuit I will 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.549
 put a sticky piston to make it look 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.710
 the operation and when it is activated and 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.289
 when it's not very simple simply 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.560
 let's put a music disc in the 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.490
 record player and while it is sounding 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.320
 let's say that our circuit will be 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.850
 activated when we take it out then it 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.130
 will deactivate the truth is that it is very 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.750
 well it 's pretty simple to do and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.069
 I think in an adventure map in the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.110
 that we have to get a disk for 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.490
 pass a door or just make a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.459
 secret room within our 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.399
 houses can be very well worth it so 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.830
 good guys how I always do 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.420
 I'm going to show you how it works 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.280
 Well, a little more basic with a door 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.599
 with a gun is very simple simply 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.369
 I'm going to put a door, what is this? 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.830
 that we have put here so that 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.119
 current go backwards and I will do 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.619
 a little door here that usually 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.019
 do always in these jolin tutorials 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.370
 with the wolves they are getting into me 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.569
 half of the tutorial they do not let me do 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.189
 nothing 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.349
 good is the door that usually makes 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.730
 I'm always doing it with 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.469
 any material all this you can 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.260
 do with any material simply 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.359
 I'm going to make the door the frame and cover 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.280
 everything that remains in a very good way 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.799
 no need to do anything in 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.569
 special simply looks pretty good 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.939
 so I'm going to do it from a height of 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.579
 three so that it does not clash with the theme 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.170
 of the door frame and well you'll see 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.689
 what simple is the truth that is 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.099
 very well that yes guys there is a block that 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.840
 you can not cover what is above 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.180
 of the piston if we put that block on top of 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.530
 of the piston may be activated 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.769
 circuit so it 's very important that 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.780
 do not put any block over there and 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.549
 nothing the rest then simply cover it 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.989
 it can be a wall of our house what 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.849
 that we want or we can leave the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.439
 turntable on the other side does not matter there's no 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.900
 no but there is no problem with 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:04.890
 that and I would be kids as you see is 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.720
 very well covered the truth you do not see anything 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.980
 and as I say you can be with any 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.330
 door type this door looks 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.890
 clearly it is there but with a 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.140
 hidden door maybe a little bit 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.850
 better so I leave it to you 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.440
 freedom guys just so that 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.390
 you see the activator of what would be the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.250
 door when we put our disk it 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.810
 will activate and when we take it out 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.670
 will deactivate the truth is that it remains very 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.760
 good for adventure maps or 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.080
 secret rooms I would use it and I would 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.090
 He has drawn enough attention so 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.050
 I wanted to bring you this operation I do not 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.910
 I knew what could be done with the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.190
 record player so I hope guys that 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.410
 take advantage and try it simply 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.450
 Like if you liked psuv for more 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.430
 videos and nothing I hope that soon we 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.050
 let's see in new tutorials this kind of 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.300
 mechanisms I always like a lot 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.519
 so that's why I always bring them to you and 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.870
 with this green me asking for a little treat 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.870
 and until the new
