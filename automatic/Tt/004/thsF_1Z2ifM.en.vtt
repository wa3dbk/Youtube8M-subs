is<00:00:43.950> probably<00:00:44.489> what<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> should<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.030> clicked

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
is probably what you should have clicked

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.440 
is probably what you should have clicked
off<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.520> right<00:00:47.520> now<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.969> probably<00:00:48.300> only

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
off and right now this probably only

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.180 
off and right now this probably only
applies<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> Vista<00:00:49.200> users<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.890> some<00:00:50.160> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
applies to Vista users because some of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.840 
applies to Vista users because some of
the<00:00:50.480> options<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.899> are<00:00:52.170> available<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.460> XP

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the options here are available to XP

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.740 
the options here are available to XP
users<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.199> would<00:00:55.350> probably<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.860> for

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
users so it would probably just for

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.250 
users so it would probably just for
Vista<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.930> Windows<00:00:58.079> 7<00:00:58.320> users<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.079> want

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
Vista and Windows 7 users so if you want

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.910
