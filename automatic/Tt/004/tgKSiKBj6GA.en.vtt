00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.740
 I had too much speed for today 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.880
 saved data 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.880
 I like it very much but 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.500
 I hope so is the mario cardoso of fast 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.500
 very good next mission 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.510
 the valley of the waterfalls 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.810
 for two years 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.270
 on these mint platforms and very 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.810
 bad memories we will see how 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.810
 you are dyed 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.340
 please visit 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.510
 or what is it that you think I remember 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.510
 salts in super mario galaxy 2 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.660
 and if not that I fire 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.450
 because for me and I can say how is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.729
 the situation 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.300
 let's see the red blocks I do not have anymore 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.090
 that are 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.090
 up to the flag of the other scenario 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.680
 in time we go thank you 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.070
 nothing 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.070
 and let's go 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.729
 for that 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.610
 as we expected the star 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.060
 for that I could go through here let's see 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.060
 if there is something here 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.330
 a star 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:23.820
 I am invincible can not touch me can 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.820
 hide 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.360
 two 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.130
 but that there is nothing in those waterfalls 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.700
 how will I repeat 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.700
 wow 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.920
 before this 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.980
 interesting 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.230
 sometimes but you know 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.650
 the tree 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.690
 a new lose cat 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.620
 and if you are sure that you will need good 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.520
 But surely 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.150
 way we got to the middle of the road 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.150
 very well 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.370
 of currency is great I love these 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.680
 trees are spectacular others 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.340
 galaxy they looked good but it 's things so 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.340
 wide wrong 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.140
 let's see what you have for me 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.190

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.190

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.510
 come to give 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.340
 sing 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.340
 we go 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.360
 out with the radios 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.480
 the key 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.080
 ah 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.810
 a moment already go down 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.810
 look at the star 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.939
 I do not like those mega rollers 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.939
 I'm not going to kill him 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.550
 our already saw I 'm not me 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.830
 goodbye bye 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.850
 father 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.479
 I'm going to kill I 'm going to kill 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.790
 to see yes why not 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.730
 down 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.770
 we know others to us 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.560
 ruby almost killed me again like a 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.120
 demon 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.710
 Well I have the star 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.850
 only missing the seal that was already 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.740
 down that I caught a glimpse of when I was 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.560
 I died of martyr death 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.819
 I calculate that it must be here they wait 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.819
 to see the gifts and I 'm not going to kill 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.980
 excellent we achieve we have all other 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.980
 yahoo time 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.440
 but I was not going to achieve it 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.650
 for the coup de grace of not reaching the 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.650
 goal
