00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
I think that's the fires caught down

I think that's the fires caught down
inside<00:02:37.290> there<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.680> I'm<00:02:37.739> going<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:37.980> add<00:02:38.130> the

it that and the fire the frypan is
spreading<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:25.660> flame<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.170> had<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.500> and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770

the wind is blowing it around I had to

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.300 
the wind is blowing it around I had to
get<00:03:28.930> up<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.319> be<00:03:29.470> able<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.680> move<00:03:29.830> around<00:03:29.980> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
get up and be able to move around the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.680 
get up and be able to move around the
flame<00:03:30.520> was<00:03:30.700> actually<00:03:31.030> coming<00:03:31.300> right<00:03:31.450> into<00:03:31.600> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
flame was actually coming right into the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.780 
flame was actually coming right into the
camera<00:03:31.870> there<00:03:32.230> look<00:03:33.130> at<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.250> baby<00:03:33.580> burn

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
camera there look at that baby burn

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.430 
camera there look at that baby burn
that's<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.970> advantage<00:03:37.270> of<00:03:37.480> having<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.900> larger

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
that's the advantage of having a larger

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.350 
that's the advantage of having a larger
dimension<00:03:38.730> combustion<00:03:39.730> chamber<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.239> can

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
dimension combustion chamber you can

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.729 
dimension combustion chamber you can
just<00:03:40.540> get<00:03:40.690> more<00:03:40.959> wood<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:41.320> there<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.709> just

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
pieces but I didn't really think I

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.219 
pieces but I didn't really think I
needed<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.889> add<00:05:13.979> those<00:05:16.850> okay

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
done faster than I thought mo to

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.100 
done faster than I thought mo to
practice<00:06:32.000> whoo<00:06:32.180> that<00:06:32.420> one's<00:06:32.630> burn<00:06:32.840> a<00:06:32.870> bit<00:06:35.050> yep

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200 
I'm out of practice okay so let's just

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.730 
I'm out of practice okay so let's just
literally<00:06:42.620> a<00:06:42.710> few<00:06:42.980> seconds<00:06:43.460> and<00:06:44.320> I<00:06:45.320> think

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
literally a few seconds and I think

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.580 
literally a few seconds and I think
that's<00:06:46.280> done<00:06:48.220> and<00:06:49.630> they<00:06:50.630> they<00:06:51.230> get<00:06:51.410> really

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
that's done and they they get really

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.730 
that's done and they they get really
thick<00:06:52.870> look<00:06:53.870> at<00:06:53.990> the<00:06:54.170> I<00:06:54.380> don't<00:06:54.530> know<00:06:54.590> if<00:06:54.650> you

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
thick look at the I don't know if you

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.990 
thick look at the I don't know if you
can<00:06:54.890> see<00:06:55.040> that<00:06:55.220> look<00:06:55.340> at<00:06:55.430> the<00:06:55.490> thickness<00:06:55.850> of

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
can see that look at the thickness of

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.860 
can see that look at the thickness of
these<00:06:56.180> they<00:06:57.430> swell<00:06:58.430> right<00:06:58.610> up<00:06:58.820> so<00:06:59.180> they're

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
these they swell right up so they're

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.510 
these they swell right up so they're
really<00:07:00.140> really<00:07:00.380> good<00:07:00.620> give<00:07:00.830> them<00:07:00.950> a<00:07:00.980> try<00:07:01.220> dried

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
really really good give them a try dried
