bronzing and then for contouring I

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.160 
bronzing and then for contouring I
recommend<00:01:16.280> something<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:16.640> is<00:01:16.909> gray<00:01:17.450> toned

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
recommend something that is gray toned

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.310 
recommend something that is gray toned
for<00:01:19.100> bronzer<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:19.670> doesn't<00:01:19.939> matter<00:01:20.119> well<00:01:20.960> in<00:01:21.170> my

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
for bronzer it doesn't matter well in my

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.200 
for bronzer it doesn't matter well in my
opinion<00:01:21.799> if<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:22.250> have<00:01:22.490> something<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:23.030> little

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
opinion if you have something a little

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.370 
opinion if you have something a little
bit<00:01:23.299> more<00:01:23.330> orange<00:01:23.810> red<00:01:24.290> or<00:01:25.240> neutral<00:01:26.380> whatever

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
bit more orange red or neutral whatever

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.609 
bit more orange red or neutral whatever
bronzer<00:01:27.860> really<00:01:28.100> suits<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:28.640> because

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
bronzer really suits you because

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.069 
bronzer really suits you because
bronzing<00:01:30.619> is<00:01:30.829> just<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.430> warm<00:01:31.700> up<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.000> face<00:01:32.270> so

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
bronzing is just to warm up the face so

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.679 
bronzing is just to warm up the face so
it's<00:01:33.259> not<00:01:33.380> all<00:01:33.829> one<00:01:34.220> color<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:34.850> like

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
it's not all one color of like

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.840 
it's not all one color of like
foundation<00:01:37.030> so<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.810> can<00:01:38.960> pretty<00:01:39.110> much<00:01:39.229> use

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
foundation so you can pretty much use

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.160 
foundation so you can pretty much use
any<00:01:40.850> kind<00:01:41.150> of<00:01:41.180> bronzer<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:41.960> want<00:01:44.170> but
