 hello you take guys and girls and then 

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.090
 we are here back with a video this 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.070
 once we are in another tutorial that makes 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.570
 while he did not bring tutorials to the channel and 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.130
 this is basically going to be how 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.410
 install a map that is a map that played 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.059
 the russian marat ends here I leave the video 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.999
 so that they are not some moments 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.159
 is going to do this I'm going to silence it here 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.960
 see with the case is that it's like a class 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.609
 of wine here on this map does not really 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.470
 there is no tutorial in Spanish as in 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.390
 the social thing is called guess who new 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.710
 which is a milestone to close we are here 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.149
 I skip that awareness of third parties and 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 good all that roll then here I 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.350
 I bring you the link I spend on my time 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.699
 looking for it there and then finally what 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.289
 found here are you sent them to the 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.850
 official page to the official forum of the site 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.910
 of the map so to speak as we are 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.670
 good creators interests me 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.050
 the case sent us this page is not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.050
 It depends on how they put it, I do not know if 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.790
 was young is more then if butterfly 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.160

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.720
 This page is sent to us and here we are 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.879

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.180
 tutorial here is the link and apart from 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.640
 everything is the tutorial is going to leave 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.950

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.030
 atf light 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.130
 or is it more than an entity has an idea 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.200
 and is to leave it directly by mediafire 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.820
 so you do not have to have to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.409
 I'm going to leave this heavy part 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.259
 directly this media fire link 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.149
 then they are going to give you here to download 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.619
 is going to open we close this here a 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.200
 rar file we wait for you to download a 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.700
 little and if basically after the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.219
 rare file that would have to be networks 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.240
 extract it and then area here in 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.920
 installation 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.229
 now let's put it for dating 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.399
 percentage for those who already know 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.869
 minecraft moment we pass this this already 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.729
 the map was downloaded as they already know 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.280
 I had downloaded myself and what will happen 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.840
 is that we are going to open all this 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.939
 section here what we have to do 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.290
 is to create a new folder let's say no 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.390
 I know we will go 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.110
 We are going to give libraries here the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.800
 new new folder does not let me say 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.810
 documents we will create the new 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.009
 folder is going to put tutorial that in 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.090
 this case you can put the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.840
 name they want tutorial 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.670
 to see if I know how to write perfect tutorial 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.010
 is what we are going to do is extract the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.390
 files give you here to extract in and 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.100
 let's find the folder that we just 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.720
 to create that would be for this 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.120
 architecture let's accept we wait for 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.459
 to fully extract this is already 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.050
 he extracted it completely and as you see already 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.940
 we have here the tutorial the folder 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.610
 complete then this what we have to 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.830
 to do is take this folder to app 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.200
 attack was the motherboard of minecraft 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.790
 let's go here to app data we write here what 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.690
 that what will happen to them on screen in 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.910
 this moment 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.830
 there is the ppa is perfect what is 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.709
 appeared on the screen and what happens is 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.330
 that we have here to give to enter 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.220
 here to minecraft and we give save 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.570
 are the maps that we have for now what 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.370
 what we have to do is copy this 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.260
 folder that we created and we take it here 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.940

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.830
