00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
that's fantastic seriously that's made

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.400 
that's fantastic seriously that's made
the<00:02:04.740> both<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.220> boxes<00:02:05.810> really<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:07.229> quite

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
the both the boxes really really quite

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.390 
the both the boxes really really quite
happy<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.830> now<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.830> has<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.370> be

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
happy with that now and that has to be

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.449 
happy with that now and that has to be
my<00:02:12.290> second<00:02:13.290> choice<00:02:13.440> I'd<00:02:13.709> pull<00:02:13.950> from<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> box

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
my second choice I'd pull from a box

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.180 
my second choice I'd pull from a box
which<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.000> quite<00:02:15.270> satisfying<00:02:15.980> considering<00:02:16.980> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
which is quite satisfying considering I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.840 
which is quite satisfying considering I
never<00:02:17.459> got<00:02:17.810> any<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.470> my<00:02:19.800> three<00:02:20.040> basic<00:02:20.489> booster

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
never got any in my three basic booster

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.479 
never got any in my three basic booster
boxes<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:23.610> still<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.660> grudge<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:25.080> but

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
boxes so I still have a grudge there but

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.180 
boxes so I still have a grudge there but
wicked<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:28.170> believe<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.709> they<00:02:28.830> let<00:02:28.980> their

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
wicked and I believe that they let their

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.670 
wicked and I believe that they let their
the<00:02:29.640> decks<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.690> deck<00:02:30.870> only<00:02:31.200> has<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> non

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the decks and deck only has a non

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.000 
the decks and deck only has a non
holographic<00:02:32.190> form<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.800> that'd<00:02:34.800> be

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
holographic form of this so that'd be

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:47.600 
holographic form of this so that'd be
really<00:02:35.520> really<00:02:35.940> cool<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.270> see<00:02:37.940> absolutely<00:02:46.610> no

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
really really cool to see absolutely no

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.800 
really really cool to see absolutely no
