first of all that it's in English which
is<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:04.049> nice<00:01:04.260> step<00:01:05.159> up<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:06.090> were

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
is really nice step up from what we were

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.000 
is really nice step up from what we were
used<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.540> seeing<00:01:06.780> which<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.229> basically<00:01:07.799> just

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
used to seeing which was basically just

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.789 
used to seeing which was basically just
a<00:01:08.250> bunch<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> random<00:01:09.510> characters<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.290> now

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
a bunch of random characters but now

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
a bunch of random characters but now
we're<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.280> English<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.630> nice

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

we're in English so that's really nice
the<00:01:13.350> first<00:01:13.560> thing<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> make

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the first thing you want to do is make

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
the first thing you want to do is make
sure<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.760> don't<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.240> passcode<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.900> your

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
sure you don't have a passcode on your

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.539 
sure you don't have a passcode on your
device<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.740> ahead<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.009> slide<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> unlock

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
device so go ahead and slide to unlock

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
device so go ahead and slide to unlock
and<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and you can see that I don't have a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
and you can see that I don't have a
passcode<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.920> my<00:01:20.009> phone<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> first

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
passcode on my phone so that's the first

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
passcode on my phone so that's the first
step<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.799> need<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.220> make

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
step so then all you need to do is make

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
step so then all you need to do is make
sure<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.580> your<00:01:23.820> device<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.299> recognized<00:01:24.930> as
