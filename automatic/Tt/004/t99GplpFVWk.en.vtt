deficiency<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.649> comparison<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
deficiency in comparison to the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.590 
deficiency in comparison to the
International<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:56.879> notice<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.449> slight

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
International I do notice a slight

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.880 
International I do notice a slight
difference<00:00:58.109> between<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
difference between this one and the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.549 
difference between this one and the
quad-core<00:00:59.719> Exynos<00:01:00.719> processor<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
quad-core Exynos processor it is a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.410 
quad-core Exynos processor it is a
noticeable<00:01:01.859> difference<00:01:02.149> although<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.210> know

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
noticeable difference although you know

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
noticeable difference although you know
again<00:01:03.750> keeping<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.439> mind<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> consumer

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
again keeping in mind that the consumer

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.560 
again keeping in mind that the consumer
is<00:01:05.220> probably<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> migrate<00:01:06.479> between

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
is probably not going to migrate between

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.539 
is probably not going to migrate between
international<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.799> US<00:01:08.010> version<00:01:08.250> that's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
international and the US version that's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.890 
international and the US version that's
something<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> keep<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.630> mind<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
something to out to keep in mind is

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
something to out to keep in mind is
still<00:01:10.080> relatively<00:01:10.680> quick<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.280> having<00:01:11.490> some

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
still relatively quick I'm having some

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.460 
still relatively quick I'm having some

rather and was on that was stuck for
three<00:01:19.110> hours<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> crazy<00:01:20.340> story

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
three hours and that was a crazy story

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
three hours and that was a crazy story
within<00:01:20.850> itself<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.390> we'll<00:01:21.540> talk<00:01:21.659> about<00:01:21.720> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
within itself but we'll talk about that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.630 
within itself but we'll talk about that

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
but that's the biggest thing I don't

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.230

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
on android 4.0 a minor thing that's the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.210 
on android 4.0 a minor thing that's the
least<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.389> my<00:04:46.449> concerns<00:04:46.930> then<00:04:47.590> it's<00:04:47.919> still<00:04:48.190> a

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
least of my concerns then it's still a

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.430 
least of my concerns then it's still a
pretty<00:04:48.610> strong<00:04:49.060> solid<00:04:49.690> device<00:04:49.930> messaging<00:04:50.169> you

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
pretty strong solid device messaging you

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.659 
pretty strong solid device messaging you
have<00:04:50.650> somebody<00:04:50.830> asked<00:04:51.130> about<00:04:51.250> this<00:04:51.430> as<00:04:51.550> well

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
have somebody asked about this as well

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.189

in<00:04:51.819> the<00:04:51.910> US<00:04:52.150> version<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.509> think<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.780> covered<00:04:53.020> this

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
in the US version I think I covered this

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.570 
in the US version I think I covered this
in<00:04:53.259> another<00:04:53.440> video<00:04:53.770> but<00:04:53.979> you<00:04:54.250> do<00:04:54.370> have<00:04:54.520> the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
in another video but you do have the

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.730 
in another video but you do have the
option<00:04:54.729> to<00:04:55.210> change<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.870> background<00:04:56.020> stuff<00:04:56.530> as

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
option to change the background stuff as

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.589 
option to change the background stuff as
well<00:04:57.370> you<00:04:57.550> can<00:04:57.580> change<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:57.940> background<00:04:58.060> style

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
well you can change the background style

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.930 
well you can change the background style
then<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:58.870> can<00:04:58.990> change<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.740> bubbles<00:05:00.190> as<00:05:00.400> well

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
then you can change the bubbles as well

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.309 
then you can change the bubbles as well
as<00:05:01.030> I<00:05:01.120> can<00:05:01.180> go<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.449> here<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:01.659> change<00:05:01.990> those

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
as I can go in here and change those

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.960 
as I can go in here and change those
much<00:05:02.830> like<00:05:02.979> a<00:05:03.009> County<00:05:03.310> international<00:05:03.819> build

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
much like a County international build

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.730 
much like a County international build

you've got some nice customization
options<00:05:06.159> and<00:05:06.310> then<00:05:06.400> those<00:05:06.550> will<00:05:06.699> change<00:05:07.030> when

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
options and then those will change when

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.809 
options and then those will change when
I<00:05:07.690> get<00:05:07.960> text<00:05:08.319> messages<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:08.979> like<00:05:09.400> I<00:05:09.490> said<00:05:09.580> two
