00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
is just the robot damage aversion but I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.140 
is just the robot damage aversion but I
really<00:01:59.320> did<00:01:59.470> like<00:01:59.740> it<00:01:59.980> so<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.640> plastic

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150

really did like it so get the plastic
out<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.300> there

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
out of there

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.050 
out of there
and<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.960> initial<00:02:08.530> impression<00:02:09.100> he<00:02:09.550> has<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> lot

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
and just initial impression he has a lot

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.220 
and just initial impression he has a lot
of<00:02:10.209> weight<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.390> him<00:02:11.130> much<00:02:12.130> more<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:14.140> you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
of weight to him much more so and you

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.699 
of weight to him much more so and you
would<00:02:14.350> obviously<00:02:14.500> assume<00:02:15.400> much<00:02:15.760> more<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.240> than

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
would obviously assume much more so than

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.070 
would obviously assume much more so than
the<00:02:17.709> robot<00:02:18.070> tamashii<00:02:18.520> version<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.959> do

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080
