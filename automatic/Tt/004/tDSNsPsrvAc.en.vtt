 he knows that the astronauts discovered 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.859
 ancient extraterrestrial cities and the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.109
 remnants of machinery incredibly 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 advanced on the moon some of these 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.400
 technologies can manipulate the severity 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.869
 says that people ordered a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.690
 concealment and forced him to

 participate in it in the last 40 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.160
 years other scientific engineers and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 technicians have accused the nasa of 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.660
 cover-ups and hide data the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.940
 increasing number of allegations of the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.039
 accusers goes from hiding information 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.780
 about anomalous space objects and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.940
 lie about the discovery of 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.920
 artifacts on the surface of the moon and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.989
 Mars to deny the evidence of life 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 informed by the viking probe in mid 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.260
 of the 1970s according to houston the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.300
 apollo astronauts brought evidence 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.949
 photographs of the artifacts that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.900
 found during their activities 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.300
 extravehicular on the moon 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.490
 johnston claimed that the nasa ordered 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.960
 destroy extravehicular images 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.070
 while I was in the jet propulsion 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.500
 laboratory jp l but he refused when he 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 the space agency made it public 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.080
 dismissed in a press release 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 that ferrari director of jp l del 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.940
 program was explained why she 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 asked johnston to resign had criticized 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.410
 publicly to your employer point 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.500
 Johnston refused to offer his resignation and 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.570
 he was summarily dismissed without cause 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.430
 after his abrupt departure he indicated that 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.380
 he had had enough and was 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 tired of that the us government 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.880
 I was sitting in the tests during 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.880
 more than four decades tests that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.740
 they show that there are ancient cities 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.830
 aliens on the moon I have nothing 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.020
 to lose said I argued with the nasa and 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.580
 I got fired that the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 conson is not the only one that has 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.900
 discomfort with the nasa 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.270
 gilbert levin gilbert levin 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.340
 scientist who oversaw the important 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.400
 life detection experiment on board 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.590
 of the viking test probe in 1976 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.680
 on Mars continues critical 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.569
 to the US space agency gilbert 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.550
 levin insists that his experiment 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.519
 biological proof that there is life in the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.050
 Martian soil we got positive data 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.420
 that corresponded with all 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.459
 criteria of previous missions that 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.739
 proved the existence of microbial life 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.260
 on the floor of Mars said levin and 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.670
 national geographic I have found life 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.099
 on Mars in 1976 the scientist said the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.080
 prominent scientist is so angry 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.390
 with the nasa that has even created its 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.549
 own website designed to scream at 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.250
 world that there really is life in the 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.140
 red planet there are incredible things in the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.019
 moon and on Mars in the Martian moon 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.630
 people on Saturn's moon Titan and a 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.640
 handful of other unknown moons that 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.579
 They seem to show that we are not alone 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.890
 in the solar system in fact these 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.160
 places seem to have been full of 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.160
 lifetime
