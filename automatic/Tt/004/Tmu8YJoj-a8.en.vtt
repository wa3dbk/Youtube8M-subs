the galaxy are no longer replenished
with<00:00:05.279> new<00:00:05.910> stars<00:00:06.180> because<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:06.690> run<00:00:06.870> out<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.049> gas

with new stars because we run out of gas
you've<00:00:08.880> made<00:00:09.120> your<00:00:09.300> last<00:00:09.540> star<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.380> then<00:00:10.860> the

you've made your last star and then the

you've made your last star and then the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
stars begin to burn out it's as though

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.960

you looked at the Milky Way galaxy from
afar<00:00:20.510> it<00:00:21.510> slowly<00:00:21.930> begins<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.529> get<00:00:22.740> dimmer<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
afar it slowly begins to get dimmer and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.640 
afar it slowly begins to get dimmer and
dimmer<00:00:23.250> as<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.869> dying<00:00:25.080> stars<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.619> not

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
replenished and eventually the galaxy

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.970
