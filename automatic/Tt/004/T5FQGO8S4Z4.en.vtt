00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.529
 it was the most expensive afp for years but now 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.320
 is going to be the one that charges the commission more 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.150
 Life plan system was awarded 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.370
 the tender of the new portfolio 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.650
 affiliated for the next two years something 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.940
 that could also benefit the rest 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.290
 of contributors 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.460
 you get disappointed because you think that 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.680
 it's going to be bad the version that is going to take 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.660
 once I had a jubilee I thought about mentions but 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.960
 do not 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.869
 it is not the discontent of many people 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.330
 Maria Eugenia has just retired and after 30 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.129
 years of work will receive little more than 82 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.830
 thousand pesos a month for the next 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.110
 five years a system problem according to 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.629
 some shared responsibility for 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.940
 others set Maria Eugenia how much you 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.550
 charged commission I never noticed 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.010
 it is by normal ignorance a situation 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.930
 in which many affiliates fit without 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.879
 But for them, especially those who 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.820
 will enter the system since August there 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.010
 good news the afp vital plan the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.540
 mask for years now is going to be the one 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.300
 charge the lowest commission in the system 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.820
 by winning the tender of the portfolio of 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.560
 new affiliates 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.450
 directly benefited all our 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.700
 current customers who are going to enter 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.530
 for the process and all the affiliates that 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.300
 in a system that should have been able to choose 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.240
 be together in a short the vital plan 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.770
 an administrator who charged a 3.46 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.570
 percent of commissions 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.080
 sanjur and with the bidding 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.509
 offer 0.47 and left behind the afp 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.990
 model the only other participant that 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.180
 offered 0.72 as of August 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.040
 the new contributors must impose 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.259
 obligatorily in vital plan so 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.450
 less during the first two years what 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.899
 that will enlarge its portfolio of 400 thousand 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.939
 users to more than one million for 2016 the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.070
 low commission they will also charge 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.530
 will benefit current affiliates 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.770
 other administrators are excellent 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.320
 news if you change your life plan 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.020
 salary can be increased in quite 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.330
 we are talking about rank of up to thousand 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.250
 200 thousand pesos a year from someone who 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.289
 with your business happy and lined 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.720
 has been advising the contributors 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.090
 with this change the commissions in other 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.769
 afp can reach three times that of 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.140
 vital plan although from the 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.510
 pension superintendency expect 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.239
 that with these current tenders after 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.790
 the 2008 reform the market is made 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.519
 increasingly competitive we hope that 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.130
 that dynamics the inside of the industry 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.769
 continue and that there is a greater perception 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.450
 by the people regarding the price that 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.489
 are paying if the quality of service 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.599
 he is satisfied if the profitability that 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.040
 are receiving from that part 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.109
 administrator is the satisfactory 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.920
 because the pension when we retire only 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.110
 It depends on the desire 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.780
 management's effort but also 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.250
 of the proactivity of the contributor 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.800
 change background or even afp 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.660
 during our working life we could 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.319
 ensure reaching old age with 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.319
 tranquility
