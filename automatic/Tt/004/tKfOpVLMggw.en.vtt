I'm bouncing off the high D the low D
starting<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> low<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.340> high<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
starting on the low to the high it's a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
starting on the low to the high it's a
little<00:00:55.320> syncopated<00:00:55.890> thing<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.430> got

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
little syncopated thing I think I got

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
little syncopated thing I think I got
this<00:00:56.850> from<00:00:57.000> twenty<00:00:57.270> Trischka<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.680> can't

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
remember and the rest that lick is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.410 
remember and the rest that lick is
similar<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> first<00:01:04.830> one

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.560

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
from might been Pete Wernick it might

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.690 
from might been Pete Wernick it might
have<00:03:57.620> been<00:03:57.709> Tony<00:03:57.920> Trischka<00:03:58.099> but<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.489> sounds

I<00:05:03.039> learned<00:05:03.219> from<00:05:03.309> Tony<00:05:03.459> Trischka<00:05:03.819> which<00:05:04.149> is<00:05:04.360> a

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189 
I learned from Tony Trischka which is a

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:18.760 
I learned from Tony Trischka which is a
it's<00:05:06.189> a<00:05:07.229> chromatic

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.070 

and<00:05:19.639> all<00:05:19.789> you're<00:05:19.910> doing<00:05:19.940> is<00:05:20.300> walking<00:05:20.569> straight

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
and all you're doing is walking straight

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.050 
and all you're doing is walking straight
up<00:05:21.259> the<00:05:21.410> strings<00:05:21.740> starting<00:05:22.490> on<00:05:22.729> your<00:05:22.849> open

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
up the strings starting on your open

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:38.439 
up the strings starting on your open
floor<00:05:35.410> okay<00:05:36.410> and<00:05:36.620> finally<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.639> last<00:05:37.970> lick<00:05:38.270> is

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
floor okay and finally the last lick is

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.900 
floor okay and finally the last lick is
when<00:05:38.630> I<00:05:38.660> came<00:05:38.780> up<00:05:39.080> with<00:05:39.110> years<00:05:39.500> ago<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:40.099> wanted

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
when I came up with years ago I wanted

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.490 
when I came up with years ago I wanted
something<00:05:41.240> that<00:05:41.360> sounded<00:05:41.780> chromatic<00:05:42.319> and

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
something that sounded chromatic and

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.640 
something that sounded chromatic and
sounded<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.490> me<00:05:43.819> anyway<00:05:44.090> exciting<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:44.870> I<00:05:45.440> came

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
sounded to me anyway exciting and I came

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.830 
sounded to me anyway exciting and I came
and<00:05:45.889> I<00:05:45.979> realized<00:05:46.160> this<00:05:46.520> is<00:05:46.699> a<00:05:46.729> G<00:05:47.030> and<00:05:47.330> this<00:05:47.389> is<00:05:47.449> C

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
and I realized this is a G and this is C

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.760 
and I realized this is a G and this is C
that's<00:05:48.199> a<00:05:48.319> D<00:05:48.470> to<00:05:48.860> C<00:05:49.099> and<00:05:49.400> that's<00:05:49.550> G<00:05:52.960> that's<00:05:53.960> a<00:05:54.169> G

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
that's a D to C and that's G that's a G

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.649 
that's a D to C and that's G that's a G
I<00:05:54.800> won't<00:05:55.099> break<00:05:55.220> it<00:05:55.280> all<00:05:55.460> down<00:05:55.490> but<00:05:55.880> it<00:05:56.000> if

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
I won't break it all down but it if

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:57.969 
I won't break it all down but it if
you've<00:05:56.780> been<00:05:56.900> playing<00:05:57.110> banjo<00:05:57.560> any<00:05:57.740> like<00:05:57.949> the

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
you've been playing banjo any like the

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.740 
you've been playing banjo any like the
time<00:05:58.280> you'll<00:05:58.520> understand<00:05:59.150> what<00:05:59.419> what<00:05:59.630> that's

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
time you'll understand what what that's

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.050 
time you'll understand what what that's
all<00:06:00.020> about<00:06:00.050> but<00:06:00.590> but<00:06:01.250> the<00:06:01.370> key<00:06:01.550> thing<00:06:01.819> here<00:06:01.849> is

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
all about but but the key thing here is

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.640 
all about but but the key thing here is
the<00:06:02.300> right<00:06:02.479> hand<00:06:02.750> is<00:06:02.900> really<00:06:03.139> just<00:06:03.349> doing<00:06:03.560> a

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
the right hand is really just doing a

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.159 
the right hand is really just doing a
forward<00:06:03.919> backward<00:06:04.310> roll<00:06:04.789> and<00:06:05.030> walking<00:06:05.960> down

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
forward backward roll and walking down

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:15.159 
forward backward roll and walking down
chromatically<00:06:06.500> so<00:06:07.159> it's<00:06:13.240> like<00:06:14.240> on<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.690> John

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
chromatically so it's like on the John

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.390 
chromatically so it's like on the John
Hardy<00:06:15.710> song<00:06:16.580> where<00:06:17.000> there's<00:06:17.150> that<00:06:17.360> D<00:06:17.659> for<00:06:17.960> a

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
Hardy song where there's that D for a

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.780 
Hardy song where there's that D for a
longer<00:06:19.400> than<00:06:19.520> usual<00:06:19.699> time<00:06:20.120> it<00:06:20.360> works<00:06:20.539> good
