turning away from the ocean where it

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.419 
turning away from the ocean where it
gets<00:00:09.450> very<00:00:09.540> very<00:00:09.809> windy<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.040> little<00:00:11.219> bit<00:00:11.340> of

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
gets very very windy and a little bit of

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.089 
gets very very windy and a little bit of
strategy<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:12.150> playing<00:00:12.330> off<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.599> tee<00:00:13.099> I'm

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
strategy for playing off the tee I'm

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.560 
strategy for playing off the tee I'm
going<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> show<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.549> two<00:00:14.790> scenarios<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.389> need

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
going to show you two scenarios I need

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.029 
going to show you two scenarios I need
you<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:15.990> bear<00:00:16.170> with<00:00:16.379> me<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.710> we'll

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
you to just bear with me and we'll

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.439 
you to just bear with me and we'll
pretend<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.760> wind<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> wind<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.300> fact

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
pretend that the wind the wind in fact

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.820 
pretend that the wind the wind in fact
is<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> little<00:00:18.900> bit<00:00:19.020> off<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.170> right<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
is a little bit off the right but in a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.810 
is a little bit off the right but in a
second<00:00:20.130> I'm<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> show<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.550> what<00:00:20.699> we

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
second I'm going to show you what we

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.189 
second I'm going to show you what we
would<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.119> if<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> wind<00:00:21.510> was<00:00:21.600> off<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> left

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
would do if the wind was off the left

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.200 
would do if the wind was off the left
now<00:00:22.949> first<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.760> need<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.060> know

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
now first of all what we need to know

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.150 
now first of all what we need to know
here<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.960> must<00:00:25.170> take<00:00:25.350> account<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.949> your

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
here is you must take account of your

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.890 
here is you must take account of your
natural<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.240> looking<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:27.779> this

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
natural I'm looking at this

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.179 
natural I'm looking at this
from<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.230> point<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.560> view<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> somebody<00:00:29.010> who

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
from the point of view of somebody who

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.439 
from the point of view of somebody who
hits<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> ball<00:00:29.490> pretty<00:00:29.880> straight<00:00:30.210> but

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
hits the ball pretty straight but

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.659 
hits the ball pretty straight but
obviously<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:31.439> you're<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.710> great<00:00:31.980> hitter<00:00:32.279> from

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
obviously if you're a great hitter from

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.280 
obviously if you're a great hitter from
right<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> left

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
right to left

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.630 
right to left
we're<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.680> suddenly<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.370> able<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
we're not suddenly going to be able to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.400 
we're not suddenly going to be able to
shape<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> ball<00:00:36.120> necessarily<00:00:36.840> from<00:00:37.079> left<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
shape the ball necessarily from left to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.709 
shape the ball necessarily from left to
right<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.280> based<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.850> predominantly

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
right so this is based on predominantly

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.869 
right so this is based on predominantly
straight<00:00:40.020> hitters<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.399> wind

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
straight hitters but here we are wind

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.459 
straight hitters but here we are wind
off<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.090> right<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> long<00:00:43.230> way<00:00:43.290> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
off the right you can see a long way I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.590 
off the right you can see a long way I
can<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> good<00:00:44.100> carry<00:00:44.430> using<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> wind<00:00:45.360> on

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
can get a good carry using the wind on

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.240 
can get a good carry using the wind on
this<00:00:45.930> situation<00:00:46.140> I'd<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> use<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> wind

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
this situation I'd like to use the wind

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
this situation I'd like to use the wind
out<00:00:47.430> over<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> water<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.020> blows<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
out over the water so it then blows the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.490 
out over the water so it then blows the
ball<00:00:49.980> back<00:00:50.219> into<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> fairway<00:00:52.260> so

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
ball back into the into the fairway so

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610 
ball back into the into the fairway so
let<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.520> show<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.379> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> tee

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
let me just show you that going to tee

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.240 
let me just show you that going to tee
the<00:00:55.739> ball<00:00:55.770> quite<00:00:56.190> high<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> help<00:00:57.000> promote<00:00:58.250> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the ball quite high to help promote the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.860 
the ball quite high to help promote the
height<00:00:59.460> I'm<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> use<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.210> driver<00:01:00.510> for

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
height I'm going to use my driver for

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
height I'm going to use my driver for
this<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.770> gonna<00:01:01.920> aim<00:01:02.160> away<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:02.789> there

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
this and I'm gonna aim away down there

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.910 
this and I'm gonna aim away down there
over<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> lake<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.880> use<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.350> breeze<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
over the lake and use the the breeze to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.520 
over the lake and use the the breeze to
blow<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.280> ball<00:01:08.430> back<00:01:08.670> into<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> fairway<00:01:09.530> I'm

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
blow the ball back into the fairway I'm

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.230 
blow the ball back into the fairway I'm
gonna<00:01:10.680> widen<00:01:10.920> my<00:01:11.100> stance<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:12.119> bit

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
gonna widen my stance just a little bit

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.880 
gonna widen my stance just a little bit
to<00:01:12.360> keep<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.689> Center<00:01:12.960> behind<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.860> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to keep my Center behind because what I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
to keep my Center behind because what I
want<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:15.060> behind<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.600> ball<00:01:15.750> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
want is to just be behind the ball that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.899 
want is to just be behind the ball that
way<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.380> hit<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> way<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.430> help

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
way I can hit it on the way up and help

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.370 
way I can hit it on the way up and help
to<00:01:18.060> promote<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> good<00:01:18.659> height<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> wind

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to promote a good height that the wind

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:29.690 
to promote a good height that the wind
can<00:01:19.590> turn<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.979> over

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.010 

like<00:01:30.700> that<00:01:30.880> one<00:01:31.000> plenty<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.510> early<00:01:31.810> height

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
like that one plenty of early height

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.920 
like that one plenty of early height
using<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.980> wind<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.460> bring<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.180> round<00:01:34.360> now<00:01:36.930> I'd

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
using the wind to bring it round now I'd

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.300 
using the wind to bring it round now I'd
just<00:01:37.990> like<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.560> bear<00:01:38.800> with<00:01:39.010> me<00:01:39.040> and

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
just like you to bear with me and

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.530 
just like you to bear with me and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
imagine that the wind is now that

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.510 
imagine that the wind is now that
horrible<00:01:43.990> wind<00:01:44.320> that's<00:01:44.500> blowing<00:01:44.680> from<00:01:45.130> seven

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
horrible wind that's blowing from seven

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.790

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110
