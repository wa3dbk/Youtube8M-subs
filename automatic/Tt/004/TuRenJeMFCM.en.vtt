ribbon cable I'm going to look at this
forest<00:00:52.250> inside<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.550> we've<00:00:54.270> got<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.570> sensors

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
forest inside here we've got the sensors

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.090 
forest inside here we've got the sensors
this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.210> where<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> coin<00:00:57.809> runs<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.739> it's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
this is where the coin runs down so it's

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.549 
this is where the coin runs down so it's
all<00:00:59.280> important<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> area<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.230> kept

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
all important that this area is all kept

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.479 
all important that this area is all kept
quite<00:01:02.010> clean

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
quite clean

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.910 
quite clean
so<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.820> cleaned<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> damp<00:01:03.690> cloth<00:01:03.920> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
so just cleaned up with a damp cloth and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.250 
so just cleaned up with a damp cloth and
make<00:01:04.949> sure<00:01:05.309> nothing<00:01:05.670> sticky<00:01:06.150> same<00:01:06.810> along<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
make sure nothing sticky same along this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.920 
make sure nothing sticky same along this
rumour<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.549> coin<00:01:08.820> runs<00:01:09.330> down<00:01:09.600> along

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
rumour here the coin runs down along

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.770 
rumour here the coin runs down along
there<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.580> these<00:01:11.580> sensors<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> check<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
there so these sensors have to check the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.929 
there so these sensors have to check the
kind<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.290> has<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:14.010> split

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
kind that it has to do as are split

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.270 
kind that it has to do as are split
second<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.080> does<00:01:16.229> any<00:01:16.380> dork<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.890> slow<00:01:17.220> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
second so it does any dork it's slow in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160 
second so it does any dork it's slow in
the<00:01:17.430> coin<00:01:17.610> gown<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.780> reading

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the coin gown and it's not reading

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
team comes up inside here as well we've

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.399 
team comes up inside here as well we've
got<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> couple<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.280> more<00:01:41.460> sensors<00:01:42.229> make<00:01:43.229> sure

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
got a couple of more sensors make sure

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.660 
got a couple of more sensors make sure
all<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:44.040> clean<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.820> around<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.390> area

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
all these are clean and around this area

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.340 
all these are clean and around this area
these<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.909> these<00:01:48.360> things<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.869> are<00:01:48.899> called

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
these are these things here are called

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.819 
these are these things here are called
gates<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.570> coin<00:01:51.750> comes<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.409> gate<00:01:52.619> may

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
gates so as the coin comes in a gate may

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.429 
gates so as the coin comes in a gate may
drop<00:01:53.100> over<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.880> coin<00:01:54.299> will<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:55.049> into<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
drop over so coin will go into a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.370 
drop over so coin will go into a
particular<00:01:55.680> tube<00:01:56.540> depend<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.810> tube<00:01:58.110> or

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
particular tube depend on what tube or

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.830 
particular tube depend on what tube or
may<00:01:59.100> continue<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.329> straight<00:02:00.570> down

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
may continue on and go straight down

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.999 
may continue on and go straight down
into<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> cash<00:02:01.500> box<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.649> feel<00:02:04.829> that's

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
into the cash box so you can feel that's

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.550 
into the cash box so you can feel that's
a<00:02:05.310> bit<00:02:05.640> stiff<00:02:06.119> there<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.899> get<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.350> coin

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
a bit stiff there so you get the coin

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.969 
a bit stiff there so you get the coin
dropping<00:02:07.860> down<00:02:08.160> runs<00:02:08.910> along<00:02:09.179> here<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.649> it's

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
dropping down runs along here so if it's

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.860 
dropping down runs along here so if it's
a<00:02:11.190> five<00:02:11.730> cent<00:02:12.270> coin

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a five cent coin

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.770 
a five cent coin
that<00:02:14.870> gate<00:02:15.080> will<00:02:15.230> pull<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.540> pie<00:02:17.540> sounds

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
that gate will pull in and pie sounds

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.340 
that gate will pull in and pie sounds
will<00:02:18.050> drop<00:02:18.260> straight<00:02:18.710> into<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.160> change<00:02:19.460> tube

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
will drop straight into the change tube

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.590 
will drop straight into the change tube
so<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.380> have<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.650> look<00:02:22.060> put<00:02:23.060> this<00:02:23.150> back<00:02:23.390> together

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
so I have a look put this back together

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.190 
so I have a look put this back together
again

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
again

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.190 
again
so<00:02:24.680> two<00:02:25.580> nips<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:25.970> these<00:02:26.120> sides<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.660> pops<00:02:26.990> in

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
so two nips on these sides this pops in

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.300 
so two nips on these sides this pops in
there<00:02:27.350> into<00:02:27.830> place<00:02:30.490> just<00:02:31.490> make<00:02:33.040> sure<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.130> hold

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
there into place just make sure you hold

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:47.860 
there into place just make sure you hold
this<00:02:34.490> up<00:02:34.550> their<00:02:38.740> kicks<00:02:39.740> into<00:02:39.950> position<00:02:46.750> as<00:02:47.750> are

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
this up their kicks into position as are

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.240 
this up their kicks into position as are
the<00:02:47.960> same<00:02:48.170> sometimes<00:02:48.740> those<00:02:49.040> gates<00:02:49.430> are<00:02:51.250> not

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
the same sometimes those gates are not

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.210 
the same sometimes those gates are not
working<00:02:52.610> too<00:02:52.730> well<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:55.190> kinds<00:02:56.590> jamming<00:02:57.590> me<00:02:57.710> so

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
working too well the kinds jamming me so

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.530 
working too well the kinds jamming me so
what<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.760> need<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.940> do<00:02:59.180> just<00:03:01.120> pop<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.300> off

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
what you need to do just pop this off

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:14.340 
what you need to do just pop this off
and<00:03:02.720> have<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:02.870> look

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.110 

so<00:03:15.350> these<00:03:15.530> are<00:03:15.740> all<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.010> different<00:03:16.130> gates<00:03:16.550> so

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
so these are all the different gates so

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.400 
so these are all the different gates so
sometimes<00:03:17.570> we're<00:03:17.780> actually<00:03:18.230> happens<00:03:18.740> is<00:03:20.410> they

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
sometimes we're actually happens is they

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.560 
sometimes we're actually happens is they
they're<00:03:22.130> not<00:03:22.160> sitting<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.940> know<00:03:23.150> in<00:03:23.390> their

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
they're not sitting you know in their

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.470 
they're not sitting you know in their
correct<00:03:24.200> well<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:27.760> if<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:28.940> if<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.300> have<00:03:29.450> a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
correct well and if you if you have a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.570 
correct well and if you if you have a
good<00:03:29.960> look<00:03:30.110> at<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.500> can<00:03:30.650> see<00:03:30.920> what<00:03:31.190> if

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
good look at it you can see what if

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.910 
good look at it you can see what if
there's<00:03:31.820> any<00:03:32.000> particular<00:03:32.540> issues<00:03:32.840> give<00:03:33.620> an

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
there's any particular issues give an

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.030 
there's any particular issues give an
awful<00:03:34.220> lot<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.370> leavers<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.440> stuff<00:03:36.440> in<00:03:36.740> here

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
awful lot of leavers and stuff in here

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.550 
awful lot of leavers and stuff in here
vosam<00:03:37.610> a<00:03:37.970> lot<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.780> time<00:03:38.960> you<00:03:39.110> can<00:03:39.260> see<00:03:39.530> a

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
vosam a lot of time you can see a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.710 
vosam a lot of time you can see a
particular<00:03:39.830> problem<00:03:42.280> okay<00:03:43.310> inside<00:03:44.240> this<00:03:44.540> is

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
particular problem okay inside this is

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.830 
particular problem okay inside this is
where<00:03:44.930> your<00:03:45.560> change<00:03:45.890> those<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:47.120> drops<00:03:47.540> true

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
where your change those so it drops true

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.080 
where your change those so it drops true
down<00:03:48.770> and<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:50.620> stored<00:03:51.620> in<00:03:51.800> these<00:03:51.950> tubes<00:03:52.310> so

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
down and is stored in these tubes so

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.010 
down and is stored in these tubes so
when<00:03:53.240> it<00:03:53.360> fills<00:03:53.570> up<00:03:54.160> reflector<00:03:55.160> here<00:03:55.990> with<00:03:56.990> a

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
when it fills up reflector here with a

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.530 
when it fills up reflector here with a
sensor<00:03:57.440> inside<00:03:57.770> there<00:03:58.100> reflects<00:03:58.610> seen<00:03:59.180> that

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
sensor inside there reflects seen that

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.300 
sensor inside there reflects seen that
it's<00:03:59.690> being<00:03:59.990> blocked<00:04:00.290> knows<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.130> car

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
it's being blocked knows that the car

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.910 
it's being blocked knows that the car
has<00:04:01.430> been<00:04:02.170> it's<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.650> chip<00:04:04.070> is<00:04:04.280> full<00:04:05.800> also<00:04:06.800> on

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
has been it's the chip is full also on

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.220 
has been it's the chip is full also on
the<00:04:07.010> back<00:04:07.220> here<00:04:07.460> you've<00:04:07.610> got<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.880> little<00:04:08.060> chute

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.720 

which<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.440> coins<00:04:12.770> actually<00:04:12.890> go<00:04:13.190> down<00:04:13.400> and

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
which the coins actually go down and

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.210 
which the coins actually go down and
into<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.620> cash<00:04:15.620> box

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
into the cash box

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.610 
into the cash box
now<00:04:16.790> I've<00:04:17.200> what<00:04:18.200> can<00:04:18.380> actually<00:04:18.530> happen<00:04:18.770> is

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
now I've what can actually happen is

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.590 
now I've what can actually happen is
the<00:04:21.190> machine<00:04:21.609> could<00:04:21.880> be<00:04:21.910> this<00:04:22.270> could<00:04:22.540> be

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
the machine could be this could be

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.400 
the machine could be this could be
jammed<00:04:22.960> up<00:04:23.199> with<00:04:24.419> URL<00:04:25.419> coins<00:04:25.840> or<00:04:25.990> two<00:04:26.139> euro

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
jammed up with URL coins or two euro

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.040 
jammed up with URL coins or two euro
coins<00:04:26.820> but<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.940> machine<00:04:28.240> would<00:04:28.480> still<00:04:28.870> be

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
coins but the machine would still be

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.460 
coins but the machine would still be
taking<00:04:29.530> money<00:04:30.690> but<00:04:31.690> on<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:33.690> until<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.020> tubes

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
taking money but on the until the tubes

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.560 
taking money but on the until the tubes
are<00:04:35.770> full<00:04:36.040> and<00:04:36.639> once<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.970> tubes<00:04:37.210> are<00:04:37.360> fold

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
are full and once the tubes are fold

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.750 
are full and once the tubes are fold
it'll<00:04:37.840> actually<00:04:37.990> stop<00:04:38.380> taking<00:04:39.100> coin<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:39.610> if

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
it'll actually stop taking coin so if

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.469 
it'll actually stop taking coin so if
these<00:04:39.940> were<00:04:40.270> low<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.199> change<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:42.280> will<00:04:42.850> accept

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
these were low and change it will accept

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.110 
these were low and change it will accept
small<00:04:44.580> change<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:46.020> 5/10<00:04:47.020> 20s<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.680> 50s<00:04:48.120> but

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
small change like a 5/10 20s and 50s but

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.290 
small change like a 5/10 20s and 50s but
will<00:04:49.570> reject<00:04:50.500> all<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.160> euros<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.880> two<00:04:52.060> euro

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
will reject all the euros and two euro

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.110 
will reject all the euros and two euro
coins<00:04:52.690> so<00:04:53.620> just<00:04:53.919> open<00:04:54.130> up<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.490> back<00:04:54.700> there

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
coins so just open up the back there

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.790 
coins so just open up the back there
make<00:04:55.270> sure<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.570> sensor<00:04:55.960> is<00:04:56.020> clean<00:04:56.320> you've<00:04:56.590> got

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
make sure the sensor is clean you've got

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.860 
make sure the sensor is clean you've got
another<00:04:57.040> sensor<00:04:57.610> here<00:04:57.880> just<00:04:58.479> make<00:04:58.720> sure

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
another sensor here just make sure

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.840 
another sensor here just make sure
everything's<00:04:59.320> clean<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:00.040> just<00:05:00.310> remove<00:05:00.700> the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
everything's clean and just remove the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.250 
everything's clean and just remove the
coins<00:05:02.970> your<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.060> problem<00:05:04.270> that<00:05:04.600> you<00:05:04.750> guess<00:05:04.960> a

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
coins your the problem that you guess a

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.330 
coins your the problem that you guess a
lot<00:05:05.590> of<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:06.190> kind<00:05:07.060> jamming<00:05:07.750> in<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.340> dispensers

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
lot of is kind jamming in the dispensers

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.070 
lot of is kind jamming in the dispensers
down<00:05:09.520> here<00:05:10.110> so<00:05:11.110> these<00:05:11.290> are<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.560> two<00:05:11.979> kickers

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
down here so these are the two kickers

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.590 
down here so these are the two kickers
that<00:05:14.080> keep<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.650> coin<00:05:14.860> out<00:05:15.210> into<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.330> coin

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
that keep the coin out into the coin

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.480 
that keep the coin out into the coin
with<00:05:16.780> torn<00:05:17.020> shoes<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.680> I'm<00:05:17.800> going<00:05:18.039> to<00:05:18.100> take

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
with torn shoes and I'm going to take

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.580 
with torn shoes and I'm going to take
this<00:05:18.639> apart<00:05:18.940> to<00:05:19.150> show<00:05:19.180> you<00:05:19.479> I<00:05:19.720> had<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.169> take<00:05:20.380> it

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
this apart to show you I had to take it

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:41.360 
this apart to show you I had to take it
all<00:05:20.979> right<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.639> two<00:05:21.850> screws<00:05:22.180> on<00:05:22.419> each<00:05:22.660> side

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:55.860 

one<00:05:42.370> here<00:05:42.639> in<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:42.849> middle<00:05:54.270> so<00:05:55.270> in<00:05:55.539> here<00:05:55.720> you

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
one here in the middle so in here you

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.120 
one here in the middle so in here you
can<00:05:55.930> see<00:05:56.729> small<00:05:57.729> little<00:05:58.060> Springs<00:05:58.979> on<00:05:59.979> each

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
can see small little Springs on each

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.610 
can see small little Springs on each
side<00:06:00.430> so<00:06:01.240> that's<00:06:01.360> what<00:06:01.599> kicks<00:06:01.930> the<00:06:02.139> coin<00:06:02.410> out

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
side so that's what kicks the coin out

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.379 
side so that's what kicks the coin out
now<00:06:03.400> sometimes<00:06:04.360> you've<00:06:04.570> got<00:06:04.750> a<00:06:04.780> jam<00:06:05.220> and<00:06:06.389> these

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
now sometimes you've got a jam and these

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.290 
now sometimes you've got a jam and these
can<00:06:07.660> go<00:06:08.110> out<00:06:08.289> of<00:06:08.530> position<00:06:09.190> so<00:06:09.370> you<00:06:09.580> need<00:06:10.150> to

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
can go out of position so you need to

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.360 
can go out of position so you need to
actually<00:06:10.570> reset<00:06:10.990> them<00:06:11.169> so<00:06:11.950> what<00:06:12.160> you've<00:06:12.340> got

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
actually reset them so what you've got

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.450 
actually reset them so what you've got
here<00:06:12.639> is<00:06:13.410> on<00:06:14.410> the<00:06:14.979> motor<00:06:15.840> you've<00:06:16.840> got<00:06:17.139> a<00:06:17.500> small

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
here is on the motor you've got a small

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.430 
here is on the motor you've got a small
little<00:06:18.760> mark<00:06:19.330> and<00:06:19.660> you've<00:06:19.900> got<00:06:20.050> a<00:06:20.080> small

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
little mark and you've got a small

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.460 
little mark and you've got a small
little<00:06:20.470> cosell<00:06:21.160> on<00:06:21.340> there<00:06:21.550> so<00:06:21.849> they<00:06:25.440> should<00:06:26.440> be

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
little cosell on there so they should be

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.210 
little cosell on there so they should be
actually<00:06:26.889> gone<00:06:27.070> and<00:06:27.430> matching<00:06:28.150> up

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
actually gone and matching up

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.430 
actually gone and matching up
so<00:06:29.820> what<00:06:30.000> you<00:06:30.090> need<00:06:30.210> to<00:06:30.270> do<00:06:30.540> is<00:06:30.690> actually<00:06:30.870> do

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
so what you need to do is actually do

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.670 
so what you need to do is actually do
this<00:06:31.620> with<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.920> power<00:06:32.310> on<00:06:32.580> on<00:06:33.510> the<00:06:33.780> Mac<00:06:33.990> so<00:06:34.410> if

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
this with the power on on the Mac so if

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.120 
this with the power on on the Mac so if
if<00:06:35.370> it's<00:06:35.790> not<00:06:35.970> matching<00:06:36.210> up<00:06:36.920> you<00:06:37.920> need<00:06:38.070> to

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
if it's not matching up you need to

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.510 
if it's not matching up you need to
reset<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.640> motor<00:06:38.940> so<00:06:39.330> just<00:06:40.310> press<00:06:41.310> the

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
it'll run the motor and the motor should

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.930 
it'll run the motor and the motor should
go<00:06:48.270> back<00:06:48.600> to<00:06:48.660> its<00:06:48.960> own<00:06:49.200> position<00:06:49.500> so<00:06:50.400> get<00:06:50.820> the
