00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.069

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.420
 his poll for the first 30 seconds was still 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.290
 put in skate, I think that's one 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.040
 a little bit of a shame 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.910
 so this was n't your brain damage 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.489
 achievement but what you put down is 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.540
 the delicious Saturday night showbiz 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.030
 feeling of the hood yes 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.750
 filter in the song and very happy and out 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.220
 those children 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.530
 since I got it the image that had with 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.720

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.980

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.840
 is really nice with the images 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.640

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.590

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.360
 full of humor and indeed the only thing 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.150
 little skating that was something 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.670
 less because you can gulul talia here 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.650
 so unfortunately so 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.480
 you can much more what you have watched 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.579
 last show is really beautifully damaged 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.920
 and this was a little less but true show 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.489
 it was very nice and very nice 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.810
 funny but that's it 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.120
 Chris those ugly men with those glasses 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.100
 who already have the pub route 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.960
 young boy may appeal to 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.900
 me so often it wouldn't earn 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.479
 our jury there is genuine love for love 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.900

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.490
 patricia yes and we just know you 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.880
 well french goes so have already seen 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.680
 so I'll just keep that aside for a while 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.419
 must say i agree with gerard 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.250
 There was a time not for you 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.280
 the netherlands came then i thought what should be 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.569
 we with annoying man what is that 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.860
 but 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:57.520
 hey you are a great asset to 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:05:00.279
 the Netherlands and we do 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.050
 you're october i really my favorite yes 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:04.050
 and your clutch mojo 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:10.669
 I love you 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.139
 the banner that already meets that is 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.439
 well that didn't happen 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.550
 let's look at the jody points 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.550
 and behind 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:28.659
 maurits dear 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:28.659
 patricia and 9 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.499
 our look i want seriously but maybe 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.639
 it is not that bad 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:39.439
 martine jabal i really like it though 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.870
 the skating skill is clear 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:46.870
 fewer dairy cows make a choice between 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.870
 both it is for my unfortunately a 7 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.280
 Well let 's take a look at it 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.020
 average 8 is all that bad 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.169
 in on the scoreboard means that for 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.590
 you prefer that you are currently on the fourth 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.590
 place
