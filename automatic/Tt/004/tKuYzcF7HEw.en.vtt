with them and so people get kind of

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.179 
with them and so people get kind of
afraid<00:00:23.840> we're<00:00:24.260> gonna<00:00:24.380> talk<00:00:24.650> specifically

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
afraid we're gonna talk specifically

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.730 
afraid we're gonna talk specifically
about<00:00:25.310> how<00:00:25.730> you<00:00:26.210> can<00:00:26.449> repot<00:00:27.050> them<00:00:27.080> which<00:00:27.560> is<00:00:27.710> a

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
about how you can repot them which is a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.890 
about how you can repot them which is a
an<00:00:28.099> issue<00:00:28.550> for<00:00:28.820> some<00:00:29.000> not<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:29.420> much<00:00:29.570> for<00:00:29.779> others

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
an issue for some not so much for others

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.800 
an issue for some not so much for others
so<00:00:30.590> let's<00:00:31.310> look<00:00:31.460> at<00:00:31.609> one<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:31.939> I<00:00:32.119> think<00:00:32.660> most

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
so let's look at one that I think most

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.120 
so let's look at one that I think most
of<00:00:32.900> us<00:00:32.990> would<00:00:33.140> look<00:00:33.260> at<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.530> go<00:00:33.590> wow<00:00:33.770> that

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
of us would look at and go wow that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.280 
of us would look at and go wow that
really<00:00:34.400> needs<00:00:35.000> repotting<00:00:35.540> but<00:00:35.780> it's<00:00:36.080> not<00:00:36.170> the

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
really needs repotting but it's not the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.540 
really needs repotting but it's not the
case<00:00:36.410> with<00:00:36.590> this<00:00:36.710> one<00:00:36.770> well<00:00:37.130> this<00:00:37.340> particular

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
case with this one well this particular

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.030 
case with this one well this particular
orchid<00:00:38.240> does<00:00:38.510> not<00:00:38.690> like<00:00:39.020> to<00:00:39.200> be<00:00:39.320> repotted<00:00:39.650> and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
orchid does not like to be repotted and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.010 
orchid does not like to be repotted and
so<00:00:40.220> it<00:00:40.430> sends<00:00:40.760> out<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:41.000> message<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.600> says<00:00:41.780> I

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
so it sends out a message and says I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.960 
so it sends out a message and says I
have<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.620> be<00:00:42.740> repotted<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.460> then<00:00:43.550> you<00:00:43.640> have<00:00:43.850> to

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
is about 50% of the time if you just in

is about 50% of the time if you just in
my<00:02:10.940> scissors<00:02:11.450> are<00:02:11.600> nice<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:11.959> clean<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
sterile I want to emphasize that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.849 
sterile I want to emphasize that
just<00:02:14.359> cut<00:02:14.540> up<00:02:14.659> here<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.140> second<00:02:15.650> knuckle

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
just cut up here on this second knuckle

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.580 
just cut up here on this second knuckle
mm-hm<00:02:16.549> and<00:02:16.700> about<00:02:17.299> 50%<00:02:17.629> of<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.109> time<00:02:18.319> it'll

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
mm-hm and about 50% of the time it'll

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.619 
mm-hm and about 50% of the time it'll
send<00:02:18.859> off<00:02:19.040> another<00:02:19.400> slice<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.120> don't<00:02:20.390> close

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
send off another slice so don't close

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.149 
send off another slice so don't close
all<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.079> way<00:02:21.170> back<00:02:21.349> if<00:02:21.530> they're<00:02:21.680> still<00:02:21.890> nice

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
all the way back if they're still nice

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.819 
all the way back if they're still nice
and<00:02:22.189> green<00:02:22.900> now<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:23.959> look<00:02:24.349> like<00:02:24.379> you<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:24.799> a

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
and green now you look like you have a

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.250 
and green now you look like you have a
very<00:02:25.129> different<00:02:25.519> potting<00:02:26.150> medium<00:02:26.780> than<00:02:27.049> what

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
very different potting medium than what

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.259 
very different potting medium than what
this<00:02:27.409> was<00:02:27.650> originally<00:02:28.099> in<00:02:28.250> again<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> good

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
this was originally in again a good

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.089 
this was originally in again a good
point<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.870> thing<00:02:30.079> is<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.349> these<00:02:30.560> come<00:02:30.859> in

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
point the thing is is these come in

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.190 
point the thing is is these come in
Spagna<00:02:31.670> Moss<00:02:31.879> a<00:02:31.909> lot<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.420> times<00:02:32.599> from<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.900> lot<00:02:33.079> of

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
Spagna Moss a lot of times from a lot of

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.199 
Spagna Moss a lot of times from a lot of
different<00:02:33.530> nurseries<00:02:33.889> and<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.700> does<00:02:34.939> tend

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
different nurseries and this does tend

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.089 
different nurseries and this does tend
to<00:02:35.269> break<00:02:35.480> down<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.989> try<00:02:36.379> to<00:02:36.439> start<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.889> smell

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
to break down and try to start to smell

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.709 
to break down and try to start to smell
a<00:02:37.159> little<00:02:37.340> funny<00:02:37.639> why<00:02:38.209> do<00:02:38.269> you<00:02:38.389> want<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.629> do

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
that to me that really is a sign for you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.069 
that to me that really is a sign for you
though<00:02:43.489> change<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.510> out

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
though change it's just out

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.899 
though change it's just out
it's<00:02:45.200> time<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:45.769> in<00:02:45.950> again<00:02:46.189> you<00:02:46.340> can<00:02:46.489> see<00:02:46.700> that

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
it's time it's in again you can see that

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.479 
it's time it's in again you can see that
it<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.629> little<00:02:48.019> Brown<00:02:48.260> here<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:49.280> again

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
it is a little Brown here and so again

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.210 
it is a little Brown here and so again
it<00:02:49.669> was<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.150> media<00:02:50.480> for<00:02:50.750> too<00:02:50.930> long<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:52.159> you

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
it was in that media for too long so you

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.149 
it was in that media for too long so you
take<00:02:52.489> your<00:02:52.519> sterilized<00:02:53.150> pot<00:02:53.650> put<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.709> little<00:02:54.950> of

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
take your sterilized pot put a little of

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.920 
take your sterilized pot put a little of
these<00:02:55.310> peanuts<00:02:55.849> in<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.120> bottom<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:56.599> them<00:02:56.750> you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
these peanuts in the bottom of them you

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.629 
these peanuts in the bottom of them you
can<00:02:57.079> just<00:02:57.109> save<00:02:57.500> those<00:02:57.739> little<00:02:58.040> peanuts<00:02:58.430> from

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
can just save those little peanuts from

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.179 
can just save those little peanuts from
shipping<00:02:59.120> yeah<00:02:59.450> shipping<00:02:59.840> things<00:03:00.109> and<00:03:00.560> then

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
shipping yeah shipping things and then

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.309 
shipping yeah shipping things and then
you<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.700> just<00:03:01.969> put<00:03:02.239> your<00:03:02.389> plan<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:02.959> here<00:03:03.200> and

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
you you just put your plan in here and

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.309 
you you just put your plan in here and
nicely<00:03:03.709> balanced<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.609> this<00:03:04.969> is<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.359> fir<00:03:06.079> bark

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
nicely balanced and this is a fir bark

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.699 
nicely balanced and this is a fir bark
fir<00:03:06.859> bark<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:08.200> apparently<00:03:09.200> well<00:03:09.560> it's

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
fir bark and apparently well it's

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.830 
fir bark and apparently well it's
actually<00:03:09.889> I<00:03:10.189> it's<00:03:10.849> more<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.209> sponge<00:03:11.540> rock

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
actually I it's more of a sponge rock

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.809 
actually I it's more of a sponge rock
Toralei<00:03:12.439> it's<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.680> little<00:03:12.950> smaller<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:13.700> is

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
Toralei it's a little smaller so this is

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.050 
Toralei it's a little smaller so this is
but<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.180> retains<00:03:14.750> moisture<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.549> just<00:03:16.819> give

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
but it retains moisture so you just give

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.849 
but it retains moisture so you just give

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
it a real good little tap in there and

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.309 
it a real good little tap in there and
you<00:03:18.919> put<00:03:19.099> it<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.400> center<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.109> has

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
you put it in the center so that it has

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.219 
you put it in the center so that it has
a<00:03:21.349> good<00:03:21.769> year<00:03:22.459> again<00:03:23.359> these<00:03:23.569> love<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.079> be

a good year again these love to be

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.879 
a good year again these love to be
repotted

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
repotted

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.689 
repotted
every<00:03:25.280> year<00:03:25.609> they<00:03:26.419> tend<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.319> break<00:03:27.590> down<00:03:27.699> the

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
every year they tend to break down the

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.059 
every year they tend to break down the
media<00:03:29.359> tends<00:03:29.659> to<00:03:29.840> break<00:03:30.019> down<00:03:30.229> and<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.769> really

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
media tends to break down and you really

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.619 
media tends to break down and you really
didn't<00:03:31.310> follow<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.699> 2<00:03:32.030> inch<00:03:32.239> rule<00:03:32.449> that's

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
didn't follow that 2 inch rule that's

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.839 
didn't follow that 2 inch rule that's
about<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.019> same<00:03:33.229> size<00:03:33.439> as<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.949> pot<00:03:34.159> yeah<00:03:34.489> this

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
about the same size as the pot yeah this

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.929 
about the same size as the pot yeah this
pot<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.569> basically<00:03:36.169> was<00:03:37.099> just<00:03:37.459> fine<00:03:37.729> in<00:03:37.909> the

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:37.939 
pot this basically was just fine in the

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.580 
pot this basically was just fine in the
pot<00:03:38.239> really<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.810> only<00:03:39.109> reason<00:03:39.439> we're

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
pot really the only reason we're

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.110 
pot really the only reason we're
repotting<00:03:40.129> it<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.340> because<00:03:40.639> the<00:03:40.790> media<00:03:40.909> has

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
repotting it is because the media has

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.089 
repotting it is because the media has
broken<00:03:41.629> down<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:42.229> was<00:03:42.349> about<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.739> same<00:03:42.949> and

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
broken down it was about the same and

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.800 
broken down it was about the same and
again<00:03:43.340> they<00:03:43.519> like<00:03:43.759> to<00:03:43.909> be<00:03:44.030> kind<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.299> tight<00:03:44.509> in

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
again they like to be kind of tight in

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.619

their<00:03:44.959> pot<00:03:45.199> this<00:03:45.799> particular<00:03:46.250> one<00:03:46.759> and<00:03:47.239> there
