system with this padded interior this

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.080 
system with this padded interior this
one<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.769> available<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.310> black<00:03:22.519> but<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.910> would

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
one is available in black but it would

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.640 
one is available in black but it would
probably<00:03:23.299> be<00:03:23.690> available<00:03:24.110> in<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.320> bunch<00:03:24.530> of

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
probably be available in a bunch of

probably be available in a bunch of
other<00:03:24.829> colors<00:03:25.400> as<00:03:25.610> well<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.510> exterior<00:03:26.930> is

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
other colors as well and the exterior is

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.520 
other colors as well and the exterior is
made<00:03:27.260> from<00:03:27.709> this<00:03:28.930> textured<00:03:32.049> material<00:03:33.049> I<00:03:33.260> think

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
made from this textured material I think

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.729 
made from this textured material I think
it<00:03:34.070> looks<00:03:34.640> fairly<00:03:35.000> alright<00:03:35.600> let<00:03:35.930> me<00:03:36.260> go<00:03:36.620> ahead

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
it looks fairly alright let me go ahead

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.750 
it looks fairly alright let me go ahead
and<00:03:36.920> insert<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.790> iPad<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.709> see<00:03:39.709> how<00:03:40.100> it's

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
and insert the iPad and see how it's

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.780 
and insert the iPad and see how it's
going<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.450> go<00:03:42.260> into<00:03:42.590> feel

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
going to go into feel

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.600 
going to go into feel
okay<00:03:44.480> that's<00:03:44.780> how<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:45.049> looks<00:03:45.620> overall<00:03:46.400> all

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
okay that's how it looks overall all

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.399 
okay that's how it looks overall all
right<00:03:46.819> but<00:03:47.030> this<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.209> like<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.480> said<00:03:47.750> very<00:03:47.989> basic

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
right but this is like I said very basic

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.399 
right but this is like I said very basic
you<00:03:48.560> don't<00:03:48.590> have<00:03:49.150> wake<00:03:50.150> up<00:03:50.360> magnets<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.200> don't

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
you don't have wake up magnets you don't

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.530 
you don't have wake up magnets you don't
have<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.650> screen

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
have a screen

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.020 
have a screen
magnetic<00:03:54.170> latch<00:03:54.379> for<00:03:54.950> for<00:03:55.489> attaching<00:03:55.760> the

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
magnetic latch for for attaching the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.780 
magnetic latch for for attaching the
upper<00:03:56.299> part<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.019> lower<00:03:57.890> part<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.489> lower

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
upper part to the lower part a lower

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.030 
upper part to the lower part a lower
part<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.510> course<00:03:59.750> it<00:03:59.989> doesn't<00:04:00.290> act<00:04:00.799> as<00:04:00.980> a

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
part and of course it doesn't act as a

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.390 
part and of course it doesn't act as a
stand<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:02.360> you<00:04:03.049> can't<00:04:03.440> really<00:04:03.769> expect<00:04:04.190> much

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
stand so you can't really expect much

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.430 
stand so you can't really expect much
from<00:04:04.459> this<00:04:04.760> one<00:04:04.909> but<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.329> at<00:04:05.510> least<00:04:05.810> cheaper

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
from this one but it's at least cheaper

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.300 
from this one but it's at least cheaper
than<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.860> others<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:09.140> strap<00:04:09.440> cover<00:04:09.680> is<00:04:10.010> also

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
than the others the strap cover is also

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.309 
than the others the strap cover is also
a<00:04:10.340> very<00:04:10.640> basic<00:04:10.879> case<00:04:11.299> but<00:04:11.659> unlike<00:04:12.079> the

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
a very basic case but unlike the

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.619 
a very basic case but unlike the
previous<00:04:12.530> one<00:04:12.739> this<00:04:13.129> one<00:04:13.310> is<00:04:13.549> covered<00:04:13.970> in<00:04:14.329> some
