yeah<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:32.750> screw<00:02:33.050> up<00:02:33.080> there<00:02:33.350> on<00:02:35.800> until<00:02:36.800> the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
yeah just screw up there on until the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.790 
yeah just screw up there on until the
top<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.490> nut<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:38.780> flush<00:02:39.080> with<00:02:39.110> its<00:02:39.440> bulb

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
top of the nut is flush with its bulb

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.720 
top of the nut is flush with its bulb
coming<00:02:40.100> through<00:02:41.410> there's<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:43.100> about<00:02:43.430> that

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
coming through there's just about that

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.460 
coming through there's just about that
much<00:02:43.790> movements<00:02:44.390> good<00:02:44.570> enough<00:02:44.810> because<00:02:44.990> after

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
much movements good enough because after

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.490 
much movements good enough because after
a<00:02:45.500> while<00:02:45.560> it'll<00:02:45.980> compress<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.550> cardboard<00:02:47.500> and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
a while it'll compress the cardboard and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.620 
a while it'll compress the cardboard and
if<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.770> comes<00:02:48.950> if<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.640> gets<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.090> bit<00:02:50.209> sloppy<00:02:50.450> a

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
if it comes if it gets a bit sloppy a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.660 
if it comes if it gets a bit sloppy a
bit<00:02:50.870> loose<00:02:51.050> all<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.100> have<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.280> do<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.490> just

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
bit loose all you have to do is just

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.510 
bit loose all you have to do is just
take<00:02:53.360> another<00:02:53.570> big<00:02:53.780> piece<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.110> there

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
take another big piece in there

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.480 
take another big piece in there
all<00:02:55.520> right<00:02:56.080> onto<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.170> side<00:02:57.350> pieces<00:02:57.680> you'll

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
all right onto the side pieces you'll

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.640 
all right onto the side pieces you'll
see<00:02:58.700> I've<00:02:58.870> already<00:02:59.870> glued<00:02:59.990> them<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.440> there

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
see I've already glued them in there

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.970

just for ease of alignment drop a bit of

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.900 
just for ease of alignment drop a bit of
glue<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.280> each<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.610> them

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.890

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.210 
put them together make sure you've got
the<00:03:09.170> half-moons<00:03:09.590> down<00:03:14.830> make<00:03:15.830> sure<00:03:16.010> they're

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the half-moons down make sure they're

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:37.170 
the half-moons down make sure they're
all<00:03:16.310> lined<00:03:16.550> up

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.190 

but<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.049> they're<00:03:38.349> all<00:03:38.530> then

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
but so they're all then

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.770 
but so they're all then
you<00:03:40.560> can<00:03:40.710> wait<00:03:40.860> for<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.340> dry<00:03:41.420> if<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.570> want

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
you can wait for that to dry if you want

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.390 
you can wait for that to dry if you want
but<00:03:43.710> I<00:03:44.100> just<00:03:44.820> go<00:03:45.210> on<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.800> put<00:03:47.010> them<00:03:47.190> together

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
but I just go on and put them together

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.200 
but I just go on and put them together
anyway

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
anyway

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.080

without the hole in it the top one's got
a<00:03:54.390> hold<00:03:54.600> on<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.680> just<00:03:55.830> get<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.780> push<00:03:57.780> that

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
a hold on it so just get that push that

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.660 
a hold on it so just get that push that
through<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.440> air

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.680

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
if you treat plain pieces in pieces glue

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.250 
if you treat plain pieces in pieces glue

glue in there push them on make sure
it's<00:04:11.500> quite<00:04:12.069> even<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:14.770> doesn't<00:04:15.100> matter<00:04:15.250> if

it's quite even the it doesn't matter if

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.030 
it's quite even the it doesn't matter if
the<00:04:15.550> glues<00:04:16.269> are<00:04:16.480> there<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.930> they<00:04:17.440> stick<00:04:17.859> to

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
the glues are there and they stick to

the glues are there and they stick to
the<00:04:18.160> base<00:04:18.390> because<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.480> boom<00:04:19.690> will<00:04:19.959> pivot<00:04:20.200> on

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:05.750 
about every second year I had to glue

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.080 
about every second year I had to glue
the<00:08:06.020> hand<00:08:06.199> wheel<00:08:06.379> on<00:08:06.590> so<00:08:06.919> that's<00:08:07.819> that's
