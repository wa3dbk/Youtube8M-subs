quite<00:01:39.390> high<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.540> sugar<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.110> one's<00:01:40.290> actually

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
quite high in sugar this one's actually

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.300 
quite high in sugar this one's actually
reduced<00:01:40.770> sugar<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.630> spread<00:01:42.630> away

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
like cream cheese and jam sounds a bit

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.090 
like cream cheese and jam sounds a bit
of<00:01:50.420> an<00:01:50.509> odd<00:01:50.600> combination<00:01:50.899> but<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.680> Americans

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
of an odd combination but the Americans

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.160 
of an odd combination but the Americans
actually<00:01:52.250> have<00:01:52.579> peanut<00:01:53.390> butter<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.689> jam<00:01:53.930> and

think<00:02:03.619> it's<00:02:03.710> more<00:02:03.830> interesting<00:02:04.070> than<00:02:04.340> having

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
think it's more interesting than having

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.380 
think it's more interesting than having
just<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.909> bit<00:02:05.119> of<00:02:05.210> cereal<00:02:05.659> or<00:02:10.180> quite<00:02:11.180> an<00:02:11.269> easy

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
just a bit of cereal or quite an easy

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
could do yourself and it makes a bit of

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.240 
could do yourself and it makes a bit of
a<00:02:15.260> difference<00:02:15.560> rather<00:02:15.680> than<00:02:15.830> having<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.099> same
