like<00:00:07.440> work<00:00:07.770> glove<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:09.200> use<00:00:10.200> these<00:00:10.440> sometimes<00:00:10.980> at

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
like work glove I use these sometimes at

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.839 
like work glove I use these sometimes at
work<00:00:11.400> but<00:00:12.120> uh<00:00:12.230> not<00:00:13.230> often<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.889> actually<00:00:14.219> mainly

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
work but uh not often I actually mainly

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.890 
work but uh not often I actually mainly
use<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.660> mechanic<00:00:16.170> gloves<00:00:16.410> at<00:00:16.619> work<00:00:17.750> but<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.840> do

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
use the mechanic gloves at work but I do

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.370 
use the mechanic gloves at work but I do
find<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.830> these<00:00:20.340> gloves<00:00:20.640> work<00:00:21.570> awfully<00:00:22.170> good

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
find that these gloves work awfully good

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.939 
find that these gloves work awfully good
for<00:00:22.769> backpacking<00:00:23.900> they're<00:00:24.900> really<00:00:25.380> thin<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
for backpacking they're really thin and

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.609 
for backpacking they're really thin and
lightweight<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:27.240> really<00:00:27.599> lightweight<00:00:27.840> I'd

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
lightweight like really lightweight I'd

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.230 
lightweight like really lightweight I'd
say<00:00:28.859> they're<00:00:29.070> probably<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:29.789> one<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.060> these

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
say they're probably like one of these

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.659 
say they're probably like one of these
is<00:00:30.390> about<00:00:30.570> half<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.130> most<00:00:32.130> mechanic

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is about half of what most mechanic

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.260 
is about half of what most mechanic
gloves<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:34.130> plus<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.180> get

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
gloves are and plus you know you can get

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
gloves are and plus you know you can get
a<00:00:36.329> variety<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> sizes<00:00:36.989> these<00:00:37.380> are<00:00:37.559> mainly<00:00:38.399> for

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
a variety of sizes these are mainly for

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.760 
a variety of sizes these are mainly for
females<00:00:39.149> my<00:00:39.690> wife<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.140> wear<00:00:40.170> these<00:00:40.440> no

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
females my wife can wear these no

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.180 
females my wife can wear these no
problem<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.809> know<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.590> know<00:00:43.680> these<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:44.040> like

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
problem I know you know these are like

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.100 
problem I know you know these are like
my<00:00:44.430> size<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.960> um<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:47.180> just<00:00:48.180> think<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
my size here but um I just think for the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.010 
my size here but um I just think for the
most<00:00:49.320> part<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.829> grip<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.340> these<00:00:50.460> things<00:00:51.020> I

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
most part the grip on these things I

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.010 
most part the grip on these things I
mean<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.530> did<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.070> mean<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.329> go<00:00:54.690> down<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
mean just did I mean just to go down and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.560 
mean just did I mean just to go down and
pick<00:00:55.170> something<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.680> seems<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.760> way<00:00:57.539> more

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
pick something up seems to be way more

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
pick something up seems to be way more
effective<00:00:58.079> than<00:00:58.500> most<00:00:59.039> mechanical<00:00:59.670> clothes

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
effective than most mechanical clothes

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.209 
effective than most mechanical clothes
which<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.469> mechanical<00:01:01.980> claws

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
which I do really like mechanical claws

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.130 
which I do really like mechanical claws
don't<00:01:02.520> get<00:01:02.640> me<00:01:02.760> wrong<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.960> more

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
don't get me wrong and in one more

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
don't get me wrong and in one more
weather<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.280> mean<00:01:05.460> cooler<00:01:05.820> weather<00:01:06.030> as

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
weather or I mean cooler weather as

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.289 
weather or I mean cooler weather as

to sweat in any glove no matter would a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.140 
to sweat in any glove no matter would a
mechanical<00:01:19.290> gloves<00:01:19.530> sometimes<00:01:20.100> take<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
mechanical gloves sometimes take that

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.670 
mechanical gloves sometimes take that
from<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.509> body<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.930> little<00:01:22.020> better<00:01:22.409> than

from your body a little better than
these<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.729> rubber<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.210> them

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
these do because of the rubber on them

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.710 
these do because of the rubber on them
but<00:01:25.610> summertime<00:01:26.610> conditions<00:01:27.180> lightweight
