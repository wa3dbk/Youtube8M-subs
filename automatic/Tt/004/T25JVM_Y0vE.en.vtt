00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.490 
there and get the Scrambler off the hill
right<00:03:18.080> now<00:03:18.140> but<00:03:18.740> I<00:03:19.570> don't<00:03:20.570> think<00:03:21.050> it's<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.350> good

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
right now but I don't think it's a good

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.320 
right now but I don't think it's a good
idea<00:03:21.650> because<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.520> driveways<00:03:22.940> not<00:03:23.120> then

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
idea because the driveways not then

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.720 
idea because the driveways not then
being<00:03:23.600> plowed<00:03:23.900> from<00:03:24.230> all<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.500> snow<00:03:24.560> but<00:03:25.490> when

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
being plowed from all the snow but when

00:03:25.730 --> 00:04:21.650 
being plowed from all the snow but when
this<00:03:25.910> stops<00:03:26.240> I'm<00:03:26.660> bringing<00:03:27.020> it<00:03:27.080> down

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.310 

so<00:04:22.660> last<00:04:23.080> night<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:24.600> realized<00:04:25.600> that<00:04:25.900> my<00:04:26.050> brother

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
so last night I realized that my brother

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.800 
so last night I realized that my brother
was<00:04:26.620> right<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.400> her<00:04:27.490> than<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:27.760> am<00:04:28.000> not<00:04:28.389> he's

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
was right to her than I am not he's

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.470 
was right to her than I am not he's
never<00:04:29.020> fully<00:04:29.560> right<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.100> you<00:04:30.220> know<00:04:30.360> he<00:04:31.360> was

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
never fully right but you know he was

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.590 
never fully right but you know he was
closer<00:04:31.840> than<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.320> was<00:04:32.590> because<00:04:33.370> yes<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.330> croisé

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
closer than I was because yes the croisé

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.629 
closer than I was because yes the croisé
still<00:04:35.229> on<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:36.250> hill

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
still on the hill

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.480 
still on the hill
it<00:04:36.700> moved<00:04:37.030> probably<00:04:37.840> about<00:04:37.930> eight<00:04:38.200> feet<00:04:38.590> and

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
it moved probably about eight feet and

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.570 
it moved probably about eight feet and
that<00:04:40.240> was<00:04:40.389> because<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.660> shoveled<00:04:41.250> which<00:04:42.250> the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
that was because I shoveled which the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.040 
that was because I shoveled which the
camera<00:04:42.790> was<00:04:43.000> chosen<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.479> so<00:04:43.600> that<00:04:43.750> we<00:04:43.810> didn't

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
camera was chosen and so that we didn't

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.650 
camera was chosen and so that we didn't
get<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.290> on<00:04:44.410> tape<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:45.100> so<00:04:46.030> now<00:04:46.210> I've<00:04:46.360> got<00:04:46.570> to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
get that on tape and so now I've got to

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.840 
get that on tape and so now I've got to
finish<00:04:46.870> shoveling<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.590> out<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.010> that's<00:04:48.580> kind

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
finish shoveling it out and that's kind

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.810 
finish shoveling it out and that's kind
of<00:04:48.910> cheating<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:51.240> but<00:04:52.240> don't<00:04:52.419> tell<00:04:52.630> him
