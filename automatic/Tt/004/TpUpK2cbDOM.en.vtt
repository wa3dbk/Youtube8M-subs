not motorcycles and even I when I first
looked<00:01:13.580> at<00:01:13.760> this<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.360> was<00:01:14.840> concerned<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:15.410> the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
looked at this I was concerned that the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.980 
looked at this I was concerned that the
belly<00:01:15.830> pan<00:01:16.100> might<00:01:16.790> be<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:16.970> little<00:01:17.240> too<00:01:17.360> low<00:01:17.630> for

some<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.410> curves<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:18.890> I<00:01:19.040> hop<00:01:19.310> again<00:01:19.910> I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
some of the curves that I hop again I

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.510 
some of the curves that I hop again I
wasn't<00:01:20.510> sure<00:01:20.810> know<00:01:21.440> it's<00:01:22.160> been<00:01:22.370> our

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
wasn't sure know it's been our

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.300 
wasn't sure know it's been our
contestant<00:01:23.300> and<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:24.560> you'd<00:01:24.710> be<00:01:24.830> surprised

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
because it turns orange again at the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.950 
because it turns orange again at the
bottom<00:01:27.830> instead<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.250> black<00:01:28.810> visually<00:01:29.810> it
