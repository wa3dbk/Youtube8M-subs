get it because ebay costs like thirty

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.450 
get it because ebay costs like thirty
dollars<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.579> crazy<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:04.070> Amazon<00:01:05.070> they

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
dollars which is crazy and Amazon they

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.010 
dollars which is crazy and Amazon they
didn't<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.850> any<00:01:06.090> when<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> looked<00:01:07.520> apparently

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
didn't have any when I looked apparently

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.020 
didn't have any when I looked apparently
but<00:01:10.020> anyways<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.740> pretty<00:01:10.979> cool<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
but anyways it's pretty cool you know I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.410 
but anyways it's pretty cool you know I
mean<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.780> think<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.310> possible<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
mean I think it's very possible that the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.350 
mean I think it's very possible that the
clear<00:01:16.409> crystal<00:01:16.830> case<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.340> crack<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.119> falls

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
clear crystal case can crack if it falls

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.760 
clear crystal case can crack if it falls
down<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> stairs<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.549> it's<00:01:20.549> wooden<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:22.290> just

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
down the stairs if it's wooden it just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
down the stairs if it's wooden it just
seems<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.369> would<00:01:23.460> crack<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.000> mean<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> way

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
seems like it would crack I mean the way

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.999 
seems like it would crack I mean the way
it<00:01:24.479> feels<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.880> mean<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.150> would<00:01:27.479> honestly<00:01:28.009> suggest

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
