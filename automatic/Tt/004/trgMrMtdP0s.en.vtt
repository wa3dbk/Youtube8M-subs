my<00:00:41.309> videos<00:00:41.610> I've<00:00:42.120> talked<00:00:42.510> about<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.899> Burning

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
my videos I've talked about the Burning

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
my videos I've talked about the Burning
Legion<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> ongoing<00:00:44.280> threat<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:45.120> believe

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
Legion and the ongoing threat I believe

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.750 
Legion and the ongoing threat I believe
like<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.230> Q&amp;A<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.579> least

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
like here for my Q&amp;A is here at least

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.810 
like here for my Q&amp;A is here at least
some<00:00:48.090> Burning<00:00:48.480> Legion<00:00:48.510> question<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.530> yes<00:00:50.309> we

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
some Burning Legion question and yes we

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.150 
some Burning Legion question and yes we
have<00:00:51.120> defeated<00:00:51.449> him<00:00:51.750> twice<00:00:52.079> Sargeras<00:00:52.739> was

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
have defeated him twice Sargeras was

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.520 
have defeated him twice Sargeras was
banished<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.059> argument<00:00:54.930> was<00:00:55.110> killed

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
banished and argument was killed

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.350 
banished and argument was killed
although<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.430> fully<00:00:56.670> certain<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.239> he

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
although it is not fully certain if he

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.180 
although it is not fully certain if he
was<00:00:57.510> killed<00:00:57.809> even<00:00:58.170> though<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.010> he

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
was killed even though I think that he

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.430 
was killed even though I think that he
was<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.460> killed<00:01:00.210> killed<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.140> does<00:01:01.289> not

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
was like killed killed but it does not

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.439 
was like killed killed but it does not
mean<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.190> Burning<00:01:02.520> Legion<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:03.149> still

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
mean that the Burning Legion is still

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
mean that the Burning Legion is still
not<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:03.780> there<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.439> huge<00:01:04.799> numbers<00:01:04.890> just

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
not out there in huge numbers just

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.149 
not out there in huge numbers just
waiting<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> start<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.380> final<00:01:07.680> Burning

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
waiting to start the final Burning

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.429 
waiting to start the final Burning
Legion<00:01:08.189> evasion<00:01:09.119> where<00:01:09.390> they<00:01:09.780> will<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.110> rid

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
Legion evasion where they will get rid

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.770 
Legion evasion where they will get rid
of<00:01:10.500> Azeroth<00:01:11.189> once<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:11.909> at<00:01:12.570> this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
of Azeroth once and for all at this

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.280 
of Azeroth once and for all at this
point

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
point

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.289 
point
I'm<00:01:13.409> almost<00:01:13.710> entirely<00:01:14.159> certain<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.119> will

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
I'm almost entirely certain that we will

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
I'm almost entirely certain that we will
see<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> burning<00:01:15.780> rage<00:01:16.020> invasion<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.890> lot<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
see a burning rage invasion a lot of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
see a burning rage invasion a lot of
people<00:01:17.580> say<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.090> will<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.780> final

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
people say it will be like the final

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.170 
people say it will be like the final
expansion<00:01:19.920> since<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> Burning<00:01:20.580> Legion<00:01:20.610> is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
expansion since the Burning Legion is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.480 
expansion since the Burning Legion is
like<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> prime<00:01:21.990> evil<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> world<00:01:22.830> but

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
like the prime evil in the world but

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
like the prime evil in the world but
that<00:01:24.000> doesn't<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> case

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that doesn't really have to be the case

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
that doesn't really have to be the case
maybe<00:01:26.130> there<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.909> something<00:01:27.270> more<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
maybe there is something more with the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.590 
maybe there is something more with the
old<00:01:28.170> gods<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> void<00:01:29.280> although<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
old gods and the void although there is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.999 
old gods and the void although there is
a<00:01:30.630> story<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.170> another<00:01:31.229> time<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.920> another

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
a story for another time in another

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.069 
a story for another time in another
video<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.610> mean<00:01:32.850> I've<00:01:32.970> talked<00:01:33.270> about<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.840> old

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
video I mean I've talked about the old

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.260 
video I mean I've talked about the old
gods<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> void<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> past<00:01:35.490> few<00:01:35.700> days

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
gods and the void in the past few days

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
gods and the void in the past few days
but<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> biggest<00:01:37.140> case<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> new<00:01:37.860> invasion

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
but the biggest case for a new invasion

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.539 
but the biggest case for a new invasion
are<00:01:38.700> two<00:01:39.060> things<00:01:39.390> first<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.140> raddion<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
are two things first is raddion and that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.550 
are two things first is raddion and that
is<00:01:41.670> something<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.150> talked<00:01:42.390> about<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.840> lot<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.470> the

world of Azeroth which you can learn
more<00:01:49.920> about<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> said<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.729> previous<00:01:50.820> video

more about as I said in previous video
and<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.990> second<00:01:52.470> part<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.670> Burning

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
and the second part is that the Burning

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.480 
and the second part is that the Burning
Legion<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.720> does<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.049> want<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.890> defeated

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
Legion just does not want to be defeated

Legion just does not want to be defeated
they<00:01:56.610> don't<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.149> defeated<00:01:57.659> by<00:01:57.810> such<00:01:58.140> a

they don't want to be defeated by such a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
they don't want to be defeated by such a
small<00:01:58.530> force<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.040> Azeroth<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.909> mean<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
small force of Azeroth I mean you have a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719 
small force of Azeroth I mean you have a
force<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.680> powerful<00:02:01.979> throughout<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
force that is so powerful throughout the

force that is so powerful throughout the

entire universe and they're led by dark

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.160 
entire universe and they're led by dark
Titan<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:06.119> he<00:02:06.299> destroyed<00:02:06.750> countless

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
Titan and they he destroyed countless

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.070 
Titan and they he destroyed countless
worlds<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.369> countless<00:02:08.879> races<00:02:09.569> you've<00:02:09.840> been

worlds and countless races you've been
enslaved<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.580> they<00:02:11.730> get<00:02:11.879> stopped<00:02:12.239> by<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
enslaved and then they get stopped by a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.220 
enslaved and then they get stopped by a
a<00:02:13.069> small<00:02:13.670> world<00:02:13.969> like<00:02:14.150> Azeroth<00:02:14.629> is<00:02:14.780> very<00:02:14.959> tiny

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
a small world like Azeroth is very tiny

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.530 
a small world like Azeroth is very tiny
compared<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.799> other<00:02:15.980> worlds<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.700> they<00:02:17.390> even

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
compared to other worlds and they even

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.229 
compared to other worlds and they even
got<00:02:17.810> stopped<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.409> Azeroth<00:02:18.829> two<00:02:19.159> times<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:20.060> it

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
got stopped on Azeroth two times and it

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.000 
got stopped on Azeroth two times and it
kind<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.510> ruins<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.930> reputation<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.680> mean<00:02:21.829> who

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
kind of ruins the reputation I mean who

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.530 
kind of ruins the reputation I mean who
is<00:02:22.129> going<00:02:22.219> to<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.579> scared<00:02:22.939> of<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.239> Burning

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
is going to be scared of the Burning

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.750 
is going to be scared of the Burning
Legion<00:02:23.569> when<00:02:24.200> such<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> powerful<00:02:24.980> forces<00:02:25.579> they

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
Legion when such a powerful forces they

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.640 
Legion when such a powerful forces they
claim<00:02:25.969> to<00:02:26.000> be<00:02:26.269> can<00:02:26.540> be<00:02:26.569> stopped<00:02:27.200> by<00:02:27.349> mere

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
claim to be can be stopped by mere

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.819 
claim to be can be stopped by mere
mortals<00:02:28.159> so<00:02:28.670> my<00:02:29.060> speculation<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:30.109> that<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
mortals so my speculation is that the

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.490 
mortals so my speculation is that the
final<00:02:31.220> invasion<00:02:31.489> will<00:02:31.970> be<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.480> last<00:02:32.720> invasion

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
final invasion will be the last invasion

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.770 
final invasion will be the last invasion
and<00:02:33.799> at<00:02:34.129> this<00:02:34.340> time<00:02:34.640> they<00:02:35.150> will<00:02:35.299> kind<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.629> go

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
and at this time they will kind of go

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.110 
and at this time they will kind of go
all<00:02:36.049> in<00:02:36.590> they<00:02:36.859> won't<00:02:37.010> send<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:37.609> a<00:02:37.640> certain

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
all in they won't send like a certain

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.240 
all in they won't send like a certain
part<00:02:38.329> of<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.510> forces<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.290> they<00:02:39.620> will<00:02:39.799> use

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
part of the forces that they will use

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.069 
part of the forces that they will use
all<00:02:40.519> other<00:02:40.730> forces<00:02:41.329> on<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.629> world<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.900> an

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
all other forces on the world of an

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.349 
all other forces on the world of an
throught<00:02:42.409> because<00:02:42.859> the<00:02:43.310> first<00:02:43.579> one<00:02:43.879> like<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
throught because the first one like the

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.000 
throught because the first one like the
first<00:02:44.629> invasion<00:02:44.989> was<00:02:45.349> just<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.859> regular

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
first invasion was just like a regular

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.699 
first invasion was just like a regular
invasion<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.060> second<00:02:47.569> one<00:02:47.810> they<00:02:48.290> were<00:02:48.409> a<00:02:48.439> bit

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
invasion the second one they were a bit

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.800 
invasion the second one they were a bit
more<00:02:48.739> cautious<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.819> they<00:02:49.909> started<00:02:50.329> fiddling

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
more cautious and they started fiddling

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.479 
more cautious and they started fiddling
with<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.169> mortals<00:02:51.650> in<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.859> world<00:02:52.099> in<00:02:52.370> order

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
with the mortals in the world in order

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.610 
with the mortals in the world in order
to<00:02:52.639> weaken<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:53.359> for<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.629> invasion<00:02:54.260> even

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
to weaken it for the invasion even

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.559 
to weaken it for the invasion even
though<00:02:54.919> that<00:02:55.250> did<00:02:55.459> not<00:02:55.609> really<00:02:55.909> work<00:02:56.060> because

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
though that did not really work because

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.539 
though that did not really work because
the<00:02:56.689> Scourge<00:02:56.959> defected<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:57.919> they<00:02:58.159> started

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
the Scourge defected and they started

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.330 
the Scourge defected and they started
doing<00:02:58.639> they<00:02:58.849> don't<00:02:58.939> think<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.049> now<00:03:00.709> what<00:03:01.310> I

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
doing they don't think so now what I

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.920 
doing they don't think so now what I
think<00:03:01.430> they<00:03:01.730> would<00:03:01.909> do<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.389> that<00:03:02.720> they<00:03:02.810> would

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
think they would do is that they would

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.500 
think they would do is that they would
try<00:03:03.169> to<00:03:03.230> weaken<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.889> world<00:03:04.159> in<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.760> way<00:03:04.939> just<00:03:05.299> as

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
try to weaken the world in a way just as

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.360 
try to weaken the world in a way just as
they<00:03:05.629> did<00:03:05.750> before<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.409> then<00:03:06.859> they<00:03:06.980> would<00:03:07.129> go

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
they did before and then they would go

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.580 
they did before and then they would go
in<00:03:07.579> full<00:03:07.879> force<00:03:08.299> in<00:03:08.569> order<00:03:08.689> to<00:03:08.959> finally

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
in full force in order to finally

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.559 
in full force in order to finally
conquer<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:10.099> world<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.370> Azeroth<00:03:10.939> which<00:03:11.359> is

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
conquer the world of Azeroth which is

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.199 
conquer the world of Azeroth which is
why<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:11.810> think<00:03:11.980> Sargeras<00:03:12.980> will<00:03:13.280> actually<00:03:13.909> show

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
why I think Sargeras will actually show

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.849 
why I think Sargeras will actually show
up<00:03:14.419> on<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.840> world<00:03:15.079> this<00:03:15.290> time

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
up on the world this time

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.009 
up on the world this time
I<00:03:15.889> mean<00:03:16.430> cicadas<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.120> considered<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.750> be<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
I mean cicadas is considered to be the

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.339 
I mean cicadas is considered to be the
prime<00:03:18.349> evil<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.220> he<00:03:19.909> was<00:03:20.150> once<00:03:20.479> a<00:03:20.659> very<00:03:20.780> strong

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
prime evil and he was once a very strong

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.110

other Titans

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.259 
other Titans
and<00:03:24.199> then<00:03:24.379> he<00:03:24.560> got<00:03:24.680> corrupted<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.579> instead<00:03:26.120> of

and then he got corrupted and instead of

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.210 
and then he got corrupted and instead of
building<00:03:26.599> world<00:03:26.810> he<00:03:27.169> wanted<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.590> destroy

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
building world he wanted to destroy

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.280 
building world he wanted to destroy
worlds<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.909> destroy<00:03:29.239> all<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.690> Titans<00:03:30.079> work

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
worlds and destroy all the Titans work

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.920 
worlds and destroy all the Titans work
and<00:03:30.620> then<00:03:30.859> he<00:03:31.099> was<00:03:31.280> defeated<00:03:31.760> barely<00:03:32.510> but<00:03:32.750> it

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and then he was defeated barely but it

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.719 
and then he was defeated barely but it
is<00:03:33.139> said<00:03:33.409> that<00:03:33.440> he<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:33.739> still<00:03:33.949> alive<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.250> he's

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729 
is said that he is still alive and he's

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.460 
is said that he is still alive and he's
just<00:03:35.030> waiting<00:03:35.540> for<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.810> opportunity<00:03:36.349> to

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
just waiting for the opportunity to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.649 
just waiting for the opportunity to
return<00:03:36.620> which<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.430> why<00:03:37.819> I<00:03:37.849> think<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.389> last

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
return which is why I think the last

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.899 
return which is why I think the last
Burning<00:03:39.229> Legion<00:03:39.290> invasion<00:03:40.190> will<00:03:40.310> be<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.639> most

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
Burning Legion invasion will be the most

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.509 
Burning Legion invasion will be the most
epic<00:03:41.180> one<00:03:41.659> as<00:03:41.930> maybe<00:03:42.260> sir<00:03:42.620> Gareth<00:03:42.979> will<00:03:43.250> show

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
epic one as maybe sir Gareth will show

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.969 
epic one as maybe sir Gareth will show
up<00:03:43.669> in<00:03:43.849> person<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.810> since<00:03:45.109> we<00:03:45.290> totally<00:03:45.769> have

some outside help which could mean that

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.369

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
which could be a possible scenario even

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
see the Burning Legion is the only way

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:26.470 
see the Burning Legion is the only way
to<00:04:25.760> actually

to actually

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
break free and maybe the first thing the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.580 
break free and maybe the first thing the
Burning<00:04:28.670> Legion<00:04:28.700> could<00:04:29.210> do<00:04:29.390> this<00:04:29.600> time<00:04:29.900> as<00:04:30.200> the

Burning Legion could do this time as the

they<00:04:35.570> are<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.140> we<00:04:36.290> definitely<00:04:36.830> we<00:04:36.950> can't<00:04:37.190> stop

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
they are and we definitely we can't stop

the Burning Legion and the old guards so

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.340 
the Burning Legion and the old guards so
obviously<00:04:40.610> in<00:04:40.940> no<00:04:41.180> way<00:04:41.420> could<00:04:41.660> be<00:04:41.720> like<00:04:41.960> defeat

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
obviously in no way could be like defeat

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.020 
obviously in no way could be like defeat
them<00:04:42.560> ourselves<00:04:42.710> with<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.520> Alliance<00:04:43.850> and

now one other possible scenario or at
least<00:04:58.610> in<00:04:58.820> addition<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.600> current

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
least in addition to the current

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.080 
least in addition to the current
scenario<00:05:00.080> is<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.740> we<00:05:01.160> could<00:05:01.460> travel<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:02.000> the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
scenario is that we could travel to the

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.970 
scenario is that we could travel to the
world<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.420> Argos<00:05:02.930> because<00:05:03.320> a<00:05:03.350> lot<00:05:03.620> of<00:05:03.740> people

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
world of Argos because a lot of people

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.500 
world of Argos because a lot of people
are<00:05:04.070> saying<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.550> world<00:05:04.760> of<00:05:04.850> Argos<00:05:05.300> is

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
are saying that the world of Argos is

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.240 
are saying that the world of Argos is
now<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:06.050> main<00:05:06.320> base<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:06.920> Burning<00:05:07.220> Legion

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
now the main base to the Burning Legion

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.970 
now the main base to the Burning Legion
so<00:05:07.940> maybe<00:05:08.360> we<00:05:08.600> won't<00:05:08.840> really<00:05:09.050> destroy<00:05:09.500> sir<00:05:09.740> get

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
so maybe we won't really destroy sir get

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.500 
so maybe we won't really destroy sir get
us<00:05:10.100> on<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.370> world<00:05:10.520> of<00:05:10.640> Azeroth<00:05:11.000> maybe<00:05:11.270> he

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
us on the world of Azeroth maybe he

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.030 
us on the world of Azeroth maybe he
won't<00:05:11.720> show<00:05:11.960> up<00:05:11.990> on<00:05:12.200> the<00:05:12.320> world<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.560> Azeroth

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
won't show up on the world of Azeroth

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.220 
won't show up on the world of Azeroth
but<00:05:13.520> instead<00:05:13.910> we<00:05:14.150> could<00:05:14.330> deflect<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.900> Burning

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
but instead we could deflect the Burning

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.840 
but instead we could deflect the Burning
Legion<00:05:15.260> attack<00:05:15.890> like<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.250> initial<00:05:16.640> attack

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
Legion attack like the initial attack

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.730 
Legion attack like the initial attack
and<00:05:17.240> then<00:05:17.420> we<00:05:17.570> could<00:05:17.720> go<00:05:17.900> through<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.200> portal

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
and then we could go through the portal

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.860 
and then we could go through the portal
just<00:05:19.070> like<00:05:19.190> we<00:05:19.310> did<00:05:19.490> on<00:05:19.640> Draenor<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.330> then<00:05:20.720> we

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
just like we did on Draenor and then we

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.870 
just like we did on Draenor and then we
go<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.290> world<00:05:21.470> of<00:05:21.560> Argos<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.370> face<00:05:22.640> sir

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
go to the world of Argos and face sir

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.790 
go to the world of Argos and face sir
get<00:05:23.120> us<00:05:23.240> there<00:05:23.480> and<00:05:23.690> like<00:05:23.840> finally<00:05:24.200> put<00:05:24.680> the

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
get us there and like finally put the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.380 
get us there and like finally put the
end<00:05:24.980> to<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.310> Burning<00:05:25.610> Legion<00:05:25.640> like<00:05:26.240> there

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
end to the Burning Legion like there

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.060 
end to the Burning Legion like there
would<00:05:26.510> be<00:05:26.540> a<00:05:26.660> really<00:05:27.020> good<00:05:27.170> expansion<00:05:27.770> because

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
would be a really good expansion because

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.280 
would be a really good expansion because
they<00:05:28.460> can<00:05:28.670> introduce<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.300> canoe<00:05:29.540> world<00:05:29.900> and

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
they can introduce the canoe world and

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.500 
they can introduce the canoe world and
we<00:05:30.380> will<00:05:30.560> finally<00:05:30.860> fight<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.550> fabled<00:05:32.180> Burning

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
we will finally fight the fabled Burning

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.750 
we will finally fight the fabled Burning
Legion<00:05:32.540> which<00:05:33.170> is<00:05:33.320> kind<00:05:33.590> of<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.800> center<00:05:34.460> or

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
Legion which is kind of the center or

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.370 
Legion which is kind of the center or
the<00:05:34.820> work<00:05:35.150> f2n<00:05:35.540> evidence<00:05:35.840> that<00:05:35.960> is<00:05:36.050> like<00:05:36.200> the

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
the work f2n evidence that is like the

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.110 
the work f2n evidence that is like the
biggest<00:05:36.800> thing<00:05:36.890> tent<00:05:37.550> in<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:37.790> Warcraft

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
biggest thing tent in the Warcraft

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.180 
biggest thing tent in the Warcraft
universe<00:05:38.270> but<00:05:39.260> then<00:05:39.410> again<00:05:39.530> I<00:05:39.740> mean<00:05:39.980> there's

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
universe but then again I mean there's

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.460 
universe but then again I mean there's
just<00:05:40.460> countless<00:05:40.700> scenarios<00:05:41.150> in<00:05:41.900> ways<00:05:42.170> we

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
just countless scenarios in ways we

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.290 
just countless scenarios in ways we
could<00:05:42.620> face<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:43.070> Burning<00:05:43.340> Legion<00:05:43.370> although

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
could face the Burning Legion although

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.960 
could face the Burning Legion although
I'm<00:05:44.630> almost<00:05:45.320> entirely<00:05:45.830> certain<00:05:46.280> that<00:05:46.550> the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
I'm almost entirely certain that the

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.000 
I'm almost entirely certain that the
third<00:05:47.210> invasion<00:05:48.020> would<00:05:48.350> be<00:05:48.530> like<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.830> biggest

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
third invasion would be like the biggest

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.060 
third invasion would be like the biggest
one<00:05:49.430> by<00:05:49.610> now<00:05:49.790> and<00:05:50.180> that<00:05:50.900> it<00:05:50.990> won't<00:05:51.170> end<00:05:51.410> just<00:05:51.920> by

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
one by now and that it won't end just by

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.680 
one by now and that it won't end just by
hearing<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.490> Burning<00:05:52.760> Legion<00:05:52.790> stopped<00:05:53.390> and

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
hearing the Burning Legion stopped and

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.690 
hearing the Burning Legion stopped and
then<00:05:53.780> going<00:05:54.110> back<00:05:54.140> in<00:05:54.590> planning<00:05:55.010> again<00:05:55.400> to

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
then going back in planning again to

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.550 
then going back in planning again to
like<00:05:55.970> take<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.360> fight<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:56.660> them<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.440> like

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
like take the fight to them and like

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.530 
like take the fight to them and like
completely<00:05:58.310> destroy<00:05:58.670> them<00:05:58.910> getting<00:05:59.270> rid<00:05:59.510> of

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
completely destroy them getting rid of

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.420 
completely destroy them getting rid of
the<00:05:59.900> prime<00:06:00.230> evil<00:06:00.470> in<00:06:00.920> the<00:06:01.040> world<00:06:01.070> caft

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
the prime evil in the world caft

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.850 
the prime evil in the world caft
universe<00:06:01.970> now<00:06:02.630> as<00:06:02.870> I<00:06:03.020> said<00:06:03.230> at<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.410> start<00:06:03.650> of

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
universe now as I said at the start of

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.680 
universe now as I said at the start of
the<00:06:03.950> video<00:06:04.100> a<00:06:04.310> lot<00:06:04.760> of<00:06:04.910> people<00:06:05.240> are<00:06:05.300> thinking

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
the video a lot of people are thinking

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.540 
the video a lot of people are thinking
this<00:06:05.840> is<00:06:06.020> going<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.320> be<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:06.560> final<00:06:06.890> expansion

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
this is going to be the final expansion

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.520 
this is going to be the final expansion
and<00:06:07.850> that<00:06:08.000> we<00:06:08.210> will<00:06:08.330> finally<00:06:08.870> get<00:06:09.050> rid<00:06:09.320> of<00:06:09.350> the

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
and that we will finally get rid of the

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.800 
and that we will finally get rid of the
evil<00:06:09.950> and<00:06:10.250> the<00:06:10.310> Azeroth<00:06:11.060> will<00:06:11.330> live<00:06:11.570> like

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
evil and the Azeroth will live like

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.080 
evil and the Azeroth will live like
happily<00:06:12.320> ever<00:06:12.500> after<00:06:12.980> but<00:06:13.250> I<00:06:13.550> don't<00:06:13.910> think

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
happily ever after but I don't think

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.940 
happily ever after but I don't think
that<00:06:14.390> he<00:06:14.660> has<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:14.990> be<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.230> case<00:06:15.410> I<00:06:15.650> mean<00:06:15.770> that

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
that he has to be the case I mean that

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.710 
that he has to be the case I mean that
could<00:06:16.220> be<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.460> case<00:06:16.670> but<00:06:16.700> it<00:06:17.090> doesn't<00:06:17.360> have<00:06:17.540> to

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
could be the case but it doesn't have to

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.870 
could be the case but it doesn't have to
be<00:06:17.840> because<00:06:18.290> maybe<00:06:18.770> we<00:06:19.100> defeat<00:06:19.460> the<00:06:19.580> Burning

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
be because maybe we defeat the Burning

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.910 
be because maybe we defeat the Burning
Legion<00:06:19.910> and<00:06:20.570> then<00:06:20.810> we<00:06:20.990> just<00:06:21.230> realize<00:06:21.590> that<00:06:21.830> the

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
Legion and then we just realize that the

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.920 
Legion and then we just realize that the
Burning<00:06:22.220> Legion<00:06:22.250> was<00:06:23.030> a<00:06:23.090> puppet<00:06:23.600> of<00:06:23.690> some

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
Burning Legion was a puppet of some

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.260 
Burning Legion was a puppet of some
bigger<00:06:24.140> evil<00:06:24.740> and<00:06:25.100> that<00:06:25.280> there<00:06:25.670> is<00:06:25.790> something

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
bigger evil and that there is something

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.030 
bigger evil and that there is something
much<00:06:26.600> more<00:06:26.660> evil<00:06:27.260> that<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:27.740> Burning<00:06:28.010> Legion

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
much more evil that the Burning Legion

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.010 
much more evil that the Burning Legion
as<00:06:28.490> I<00:06:28.610> said<00:06:28.790> something<00:06:29.210> maybe<00:06:29.390> with<00:06:29.630> a<00:06:29.660> void

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
as I said something maybe with a void

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.380 
as I said something maybe with a void
maybe<00:06:30.770> like<00:06:30.980> a<00:06:31.010> master<00:06:31.550> of<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.760> old<00:06:31.970> cards

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
maybe like a master of the old cards

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.300 
maybe like a master of the old cards
maybe<00:06:32.540> there's<00:06:32.780> like<00:06:32.960> a<00:06:32.990> big<00:06:33.290> old<00:06:33.590> God<00:06:33.890> that<00:06:34.190> is

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
maybe there's like a big old God that is

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.230 
maybe there's like a big old God that is
like<00:06:34.460> the<00:06:34.580> prime<00:06:34.850> E

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
like the prime E

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.360 
like the prime E
in<00:06:35.599> the<00:06:35.720> universe<00:06:36.080> because<00:06:36.500> it<00:06:36.860> is<00:06:37.069> said<00:06:37.340> that

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
in the universe because it is said that

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.640 
in the universe because it is said that
the<00:06:37.580> universe<00:06:38.000> was<00:06:38.180> created<00:06:38.240> when<00:06:38.900> the<00:06:39.139> light

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
the universe was created when the light

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.640 
the universe was created when the light
in<00:06:39.889> the<00:06:40.009> shadow<00:06:40.270> collided<00:06:41.270> and<00:06:41.509> we<00:06:42.139> know<00:06:42.259> a<00:06:42.289> bit

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
in the shadow collided and we know a bit

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.320 
in the shadow collided and we know a bit
more<00:06:42.710> about<00:06:42.979> the<00:06:43.310> light<00:06:43.490> but<00:06:43.729> we<00:06:43.910> don't<00:06:44.090> really

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
more about the light but we don't really

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.749 
more about the light but we don't really
know<00:06:44.539> too<00:06:45.050> much<00:06:45.080> about<00:06:45.500> the<00:06:45.650> void<00:06:45.860> so<00:06:46.340> maybe

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
know too much about the void so maybe

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.939 
know too much about the void so maybe
there<00:06:47.060> could<00:06:47.240> be<00:06:47.300> something<00:06:47.660> more<00:06:47.840> evil<00:06:48.620> and

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
there could be something more evil and

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.580 
there could be something more evil and
maybe<00:06:49.789> the<00:06:50.030> universe<00:06:50.300> is<00:06:50.720> much<00:06:51.020> bigger<00:06:51.349> than

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
maybe the universe is much bigger than

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.180 
maybe the universe is much bigger than
we<00:06:51.770> think

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
we think

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.070 
we think
all<00:06:52.310> right<00:06:52.520> it's<00:06:52.819> all<00:06:53.000> here<00:06:53.389> for<00:06:53.539> this<00:06:53.690> journey

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
all right it's all here for this journey

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.320 
all right it's all here for this journey
