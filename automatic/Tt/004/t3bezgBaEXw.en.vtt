00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.730
 Have you ever seen something like that? 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.129
 I almost do not believe it but I will 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 tell you what's up 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.540
 soon you have to go here for cash 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.290
 so it wants to pay a new law of 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.290
 European Union 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.380
 my name is udo ginczek I am sorry 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.210
 the training center of the company techno in 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.129
 Koblenz we sell machines 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.470
 tools and consumables for 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.270
 the tire retailer in short we are 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.270
 specialists around rescue tires 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.620
 safety through tire pressure 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.730
 control system that's the idea in 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.280
 the new law 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.380
 because we are honest when they have 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.210
 For the last time air pressure on your car 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.220
 tested if at all then maybe 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.440
 penultimate long ride on vacation 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.410
 And if you do not have a vacation every month 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.790
 do what I would treat them then 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.790
 That would not be too often 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.960
 but what happens if the impression 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.680
 is wrong and we are the ride 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.470
 do not notice 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.640
 Let's take a look at optimal 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.860
 The tire has the air pressure 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.930
 entire tread ground contact the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.970
 profile goes off smoothly and the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.320
 Adhesive area is maximally large speaks the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.450
 curve position is stable 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.010
 the braking distance is shortened 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.940
 Air pressure too high then the tire has 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.130
 only with the middle of the tread 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.900
 ground contact the profile drives 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.820
 uneven and faster from the adhesive surface 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.890
 is less negative on the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.140
 brake way affects the third possibility 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.550
 The air pressure is too low in this 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.680
 only the so-called "tires" are kept 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.390
 shoulder contact with ground increases that 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.370
 Abrasion in this area the tires 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.170
 heat up more through the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.730
 lower adhesive surface lengthens the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.950
 braking distance the life of the tire 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.240
 decreases 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.760
 tire pressure monitoring system will help you 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.940
 to always have the tire pressure in sight 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.530
 that has three very specific advantages because 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.570
 optimal air pressure will save you 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.700
 fuel that's her wallet 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.800
 and the environment you increase with it 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.140
 safety because only with the optimal 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800
 Air pressure, they also have the best 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.270
 traction 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.400
 They extend the life of the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.970
 mature and now we come to them 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.950
 Customer 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.930
 you drive a car you need new ones 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.580
 mature and now wonder 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.610
 probably over the greatly increased 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.459
 tire prices right probably yes because 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.470
 still too many questions are open 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.350
 determines about the question of when 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.600
 and whoever is concerned the eu sees 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.750
 before that all vehicles of the class m1 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.600
 that means cars to mobile from the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.140
 newly admitted in november 2014 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.000
 become 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.010
 with a system for monitoring the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.530
 must be equipped air pressure 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.300
 There are two indirect systems for this 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.860
 use tire pressure monitoring systems 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.050
 the wheel speeds to the determination 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.760
 a pressure loss at reduced 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.230
 air pressure increases the rotation of the 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.060
 mature at direct 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.769
 tire pressure monitoring system is located 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.750
 in each tire a sensor of the 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.300
 monitored tire pressure and the driver at 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.150
 pressure drop immediately warns why 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.739
 Does this system cost me money in the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.739
 first set wheels of the factory assembled 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.120
 is already installed sensors if 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.980
 Now you are for a second sentence 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.750
 wheels for winter, for example 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.190
 sensors have to buy 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.250
 is this tire pressure monitoring system 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.710
 also relevant to the tÃ¼v yes it is 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.140
 the system is part of the checklist 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.600
 at the main examination works 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.730
 one of the parts does not have this lack 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.210
 immediately turned off the holder 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.090
 become 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.180
 ok thanks a question i am to 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.590
 finish where can i get into things 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.209
 let tire pressure monitoring system advice 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.860
 we recommend you to the 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.490
 tire dealers of their confidence 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.230
 turn 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.300
 ask him if he is for 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.460
 tire pressure monitoring system certified 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.560
 is 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.150
 We from the company techno early and too

 on the internet all information around 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.590
 around tire pressure monitoring system
