taking the shadow brush and I am drawing

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.830 
taking the shadow brush and I am drawing
a<00:02:04.770> line<00:02:04.950> right<00:02:05.400> along<00:02:05.670> where<00:02:06.000> my<00:02:06.120> socket<00:02:06.630> line

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
a line right along where my socket line

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.710 
a line right along where my socket line
is<00:02:07.140> right<00:02:07.890> where<00:02:08.099> my<00:02:08.129> crease<00:02:08.519> would<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.569> I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
is right where my crease would be if I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.110 
is right where my crease would be if I
had<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.899> more<00:02:10.370> pronounced<00:02:11.370> more<00:02:11.670> defined

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
had a more pronounced more defined

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.380 
had a more pronounced more defined
crease<00:02:12.629> or<00:02:12.959> more<00:02:13.349> defined<00:02:13.680> socket<00:02:14.190> line<00:02:14.390> but

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
crease or more defined socket line but

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.510 
crease or more defined socket line but
I'm<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.659> drawing<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.260> line<00:02:16.470> basically<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.490> I

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
I'm just drawing a line basically so I

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.540 
I'm just drawing a line basically so I
can<00:02:17.790> get<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.030> feel<00:02:18.240> for<00:02:18.540> where<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.810> want<00:02:19.550> the
