00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
interactive medium he can you know stop

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.320 
interactive medium he can you know stop
the<00:04:21.269> class<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:22.049> add<00:04:22.919> in<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.280> page<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:24.090> start

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
the class and add in a page and start

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.379 
the class and add in a page and start
talking<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:25.020> give<00:04:25.409> an<00:04:25.530> example<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.940> know<00:04:27.060> and

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
talking and give an example you know and

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.629 
talking and give an example you know and
write<00:04:27.630> out<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.870> little<00:04:28.110> graph<00:04:28.440> himself<00:04:29.039> whereas

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
write out a little graph himself whereas

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.129 
write out a little graph himself whereas
if<00:04:29.669> you<00:04:29.970> were<00:04:30.090> doing<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:30.599> with<00:04:30.810> just<00:04:30.990> a

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
if you were doing this with just a

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.899 
if you were doing this with just a
simple<00:04:31.349> LCD<00:04:31.919> projector<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.520> he'd<00:04:32.669> probably

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
simple LCD projector and he'd probably

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.080 
simple LCD projector and he'd probably
have<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.500> leave<00:04:34.500> his<00:04:34.740> technology<00:04:35.430> given<00:04:35.880> go<00:04:36.030> to

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
have to leave his technology given go to

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.300 
have to leave his technology given go to
the<00:04:36.210> chalkboard<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:37.110> draw<00:04:37.409> on<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.680> say<00:04:38.070> hey

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
the chalkboard and draw on it say hey

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.300 
the chalkboard and draw on it say hey
this<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.789> actually<00:04:39.330> what<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.539> mean<00:04:39.979> you<00:04:40.979> can<00:04:41.099> see

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
this is actually what I mean you can see

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.920 
this is actually what I mean you can see
it<00:04:41.430> in<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.639> sort<00:04:41.880> of<00:04:41.940> graph<00:04:42.240> with

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
it in this sort of graph with

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.870 
it in this sort of graph with
the<00:04:44.110> technology<00:04:44.919> that<00:04:45.070> we're<00:04:45.220> able<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.580> use<00:04:45.729> in

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
the technology that we're able to use in

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.390 
the technology that we're able to use in
a<00:04:45.940> classroom<00:04:46.150> he<00:04:46.419> doesn't<00:04:46.690> have<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:47.139> do<00:04:47.320> that

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
a classroom he doesn't have to do that

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.490 
a classroom he doesn't have to do that
so<00:04:48.400> not<00:04:48.580> only<00:04:48.729> can<00:04:48.910> he<00:04:49.270> bring<00:04:50.110> up<00:04:50.229> what<00:04:50.410> is

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
so not only can he bring up what is

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.659 
so not only can he bring up what is
essentially<00:04:50.979> a<00:04:51.009> PowerPoint<00:04:51.610> presentation

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
essentially a PowerPoint presentation

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.180 
essentially a PowerPoint presentation
but<00:04:52.330> he<00:04:52.449> can<00:04:52.600> write<00:04:52.810> directly<00:04:52.990> on<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:53.620> he<00:04:54.039> can

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
but he can write directly on it he can

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.529 
but he can write directly on it he can
bring<00:04:54.340> up<00:04:54.490> new<00:04:54.610> pages<00:04:54.880> he<00:04:55.120> can<00:04:55.240> obviously

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
bring up new pages he can obviously

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.840 
bring up new pages he can obviously
bring<00:04:55.870> up<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.080> internet<00:04:56.460> but<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:57.490> think<00:04:57.729> the

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
bring up the internet but I think the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.670 
bring up the internet but I think the
biggest<00:04:58.090> benefit<00:04:58.840> for<00:04:59.080> them<00:04:59.289> is<00:04:59.500> when<00:04:59.650> I

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
biggest benefit for them is when I

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.850 
biggest benefit for them is when I
didn't<00:05:00.009> fully<00:05:00.400> anticipate<00:05:01.120> which<00:05:01.539> is<00:05:01.840> that<00:05:02.740> it

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
didn't fully anticipate which is that it

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.520 
didn't fully anticipate which is that it
turned<00:05:03.070> out<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.280> be<00:05:03.370> fairly<00:05:03.669> easy<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:04.530> record

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
turned out to be fairly easy to record

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.110 
turned out to be fairly easy to record
everything<00:05:06.039> that<00:05:06.280> happened<00:05:06.580> on<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.820> screen

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
everything that happened on the screen

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.749 
everything that happened on the screen
along<00:05:07.539> with<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.840> audio<00:05:08.199> and<00:05:08.530> then<00:05:09.280> post<00:05:09.490> that

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
along with the audio and then post that

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.999 
along with the audio and then post that
stuff<00:05:09.970> at<00:05:10.090> splash<00:05:10.360> files<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:11.440> you<00:05:11.800> can

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
stuff at splash files and you can

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.189 
stuff at splash files and you can
literally<00:05:12.430> go<00:05:12.729> to<00:05:12.789> any<00:05:13.000> computer<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.810> draw<00:05:14.169> up

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
literally go to any computer and draw up

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.210 
literally go to any computer and draw up
colab<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.930> listen<00:05:16.930> to<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.530> lectures<00:05:17.949> which

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
colab and listen to the lectures which

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.430 
colab and listen to the lectures which
is<00:05:18.400> tremendously<00:05:19.090> useful<00:05:19.210> if<00:05:20.110> you're<00:05:20.259> trying

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
is tremendously useful if you're trying

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.960 
is tremendously useful if you're trying
to<00:05:20.530> review<00:05:20.889> if<00:05:21.099> you're<00:05:21.250> not<00:05:21.340> able<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.729> make<00:05:21.880> it

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
to review if you're not able to make it

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.430 
to review if you're not able to make it
to<00:05:22.090> class<00:05:22.240> there<00:05:22.780> are<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.900> few<00:05:23.020> students<00:05:23.349> who

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
to class there are a few students who

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.680 
to class there are a few students who
have<00:05:23.560> class<00:05:23.770> conflict<00:05:24.310> so<00:05:24.550> it's<00:05:25.090> just<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.479> tool

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
have class conflict so it's just a tool

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.719 
have class conflict so it's just a tool
that<00:05:25.720> gives<00:05:25.900> him<00:05:26.259> and<00:05:26.560> also<00:05:27.190> a<00:05:27.400> lot<00:05:27.550> more

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
that gives him and also a lot more

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.610 
that gives him and also a lot more
flexibility<00:05:28.479> that<00:05:28.720> we<00:05:28.870> otherwise<00:05:29.020> would<00:05:29.590> not

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
flexibility that we otherwise would not

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.830 
flexibility that we otherwise would not
have<00:05:29.910> there<00:05:30.910> were<00:05:31.000> two<00:05:31.150> students<00:05:31.539> who<00:05:31.570> had

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
have there were two students who had

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.210 
have there were two students who had
scheduling<00:05:32.289> conflicts<00:05:32.830> who<00:05:32.919> couldn't

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
scheduling conflicts who couldn't

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.770 
scheduling conflicts who couldn't
wouldn't<00:05:33.639> have<00:05:33.940> been<00:05:34.060> able<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.389> take<00:05:34.570> the

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
wouldn't have been able to take the

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.740 
wouldn't have been able to take the
class<00:05:35.020> who<00:05:35.979> are<00:05:36.400> taking<00:05:36.789> it<00:05:36.880> at<00:05:36.970> a<00:05:37.000> distance<00:05:37.449> so

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
class who are taking it at a distance so

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.270 
class who are taking it at a distance so
they<00:05:37.930> don't<00:05:38.320> come<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.590> lecture<00:05:38.770> they<00:05:39.070> watch

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
they don't come to lecture they watch

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.189 
they don't come to lecture they watch
them<00:05:39.580> you<00:05:40.000> know<00:05:40.090> on<00:05:40.270> their<00:05:40.389> own<00:05:40.509> time<00:05:40.750> they

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
them you know on their own time they

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.570 
them you know on their own time they
turned<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:41.560> problem<00:05:41.889> sets<00:05:42.130> when<00:05:42.310> they're<00:05:42.460> due

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
turned the problem sets when they're due

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.629 
turned the problem sets when they're due
and<00:05:42.849> so<00:05:43.000> forth<00:05:43.300> but<00:05:43.599> I<00:05:43.870> would<00:05:44.380> think<00:05:45.160> a<00:05:45.370> lot

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
and so forth but I would think a lot

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.760 
and so forth but I would think a lot
harder<00:05:45.880> before<00:05:46.120> I<00:05:46.360> started<00:05:47.139> posting<00:05:47.380> my

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
harder before I started posting my

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.680 
harder before I started posting my
lectures<00:05:48.190> from<00:05:48.669> you<00:05:49.180> know<00:05:49.300> a<00:05:49.419> big

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
lectures from you know a big

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.750 
lectures from you know a big
undergraduate<00:05:50.409> survey<00:05:50.800> course<00:05:51.070> where<00:05:51.550> my

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
undergraduate survey course where my

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.439 
undergraduate survey course where my
guess<00:05:51.909> is<00:05:52.120> attendance<00:05:52.840> would<00:05:53.050> drop<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:55.180> half

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
guess is attendance would drop to a half

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.180 
guess is attendance would drop to a half
or<00:05:55.659> a<00:05:55.690> third<00:05:55.750> of<00:05:56.349> what<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:56.680> would<00:05:57.159> be

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
or a third of what it would be

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.029 
or a third of what it would be
ordinarily<00:05:57.880> oh<00:05:58.210> geesh<00:05:58.690> diem<00:05:59.080> probably<00:05:59.979> the

think this is a clear case where it does
so<00:06:45.550> what<00:06:45.699> does<00:06:45.849> this<00:06:46.000> mean<00:06:46.060> for<00:06:46.300> the<00:06:46.599> president
