phillips<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:08.729> we're<00:01:08.880> doing<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.150> we're

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
phillips and what we're doing is we're

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.660 
phillips and what we're doing is we're
replacing<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.990> step<00:01:10.260> pad<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.430> machine

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
replacing the step pad on this machine

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.300

and the separation pad on all the laser

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.600 
and the separation pad on all the laser
jets<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.930> what<00:01:15.930> causes<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.650> multiple<00:01:17.310> paint

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
jets is what causes the multiple paint

a higher page count on it they where

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.289 
a higher page count on it they where
this<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> sub<00:01:23.189> pad<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.180> can

this is the sub pad right here you can

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
this is the sub pad right here you can
see<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.570> got<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> spring<00:01:25.080> behind<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.159> can

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
see it's got a spring behind it you can

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.090 
see it's got a spring behind it you can
order<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.360> whole<00:01:27.540> assembly<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.290> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
but the bottom line is what's going to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.880 
but the bottom line is what's going to
happen<00:02:11.430> it's

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
happen it's

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.380

through the pickup roller on this

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.530 
through the pickup roller on this
machine<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.020> little<00:02:17.319> different<00:02:18.209> it's<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.360> no

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
machine is a little different it's a no

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.290 
machine is a little different it's a no
tools<00:02:19.750> required<00:02:19.900> kind<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.800> repair<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.790> I'll

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
the pickup roller on this just requires

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.910 
the pickup roller on this just requires
a<00:02:33.160> small<00:02:34.000> flat<00:02:34.270> blade<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.740> actually<00:02:35.740> there's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
a small flat blade and actually there's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.920 
a small flat blade and actually there's
a<00:02:36.010> you'll<00:02:36.520> only<00:02:36.730> work<00:02:37.030> with<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.330> collar<00:02:37.630> on

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930

the left side and there's a white clip
at<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.360> top<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.980> just<00:02:42.010> simply<00:02:42.489> push<00:02:42.760> it

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
at the top and you just simply push it

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.060 
at the top and you just simply push it
down<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.450> then<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.410> have<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.680> kind<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.890> reach

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
down and then you have to kind of reach

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.750 
down and then you have to kind of reach
your<00:02:45.280> hand<00:02:45.520> in<00:02:45.700> there<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:48.340> not<00:02:48.550> really

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
your hand in there and it's not really

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.960 
your hand in there and it's not really
the<00:02:49.030> easiest<00:02:49.930> thing<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.350> do<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.680> then<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
the easiest thing to do and then the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.150 
the easiest thing to do and then the
roller<00:02:52.209> assembly<00:02:52.690> comes<00:02:52.900> right<00:02:53.170> out<00:02:53.200> just

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
roller assembly comes right out just

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.830 
roller assembly comes right out just
like<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.970> there<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.510> go

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
like that and there you go

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.259 
like that and there you go
this<00:02:56.290> roller<00:02:56.650> actually<00:02:57.160> has<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> spring<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.120> the

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
this roller actually has a spring on the

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.150 
this roller actually has a spring on the
one<00:02:58.480> side<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.410> all<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.620> got<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.830> do<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.010> just

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
one side so all you got to do is just

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.460 
one side so all you got to do is just
release<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.580> color<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.540> left<00:03:01.810> side<00:03:02.110> and

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
release that color on the left side and

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.380 
release that color on the left side and
then<00:03:03.340> when<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.610> put<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.850> roller<00:03:04.000> back<00:03:04.209> in

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
then when you put the roller back in

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.420 
then when you put the roller back in
just<00:03:04.720> turn<00:03:05.050> it<00:03:05.230> like<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.830> then<00:03:06.100> the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
just turn it like this and then the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.340 
just turn it like this and then the
drive<00:03:06.730> coupler<00:03:07.209> will<00:03:07.390> actually<00:03:07.720> lock<00:03:07.989> into

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
drive coupler will actually lock into

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.470 
drive coupler will actually lock into
its<00:03:08.500> place<00:03:08.739> your<00:03:09.459> roller<00:03:09.700> may<00:03:10.000> come<00:03:10.239> with<00:03:10.390> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
its place your roller may come with the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.390 
its place your roller may come with the
idler<00:03:10.780> wheels<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.290> may<00:03:11.560> not<00:03:11.769> if<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.070> doesn't

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
idler wheels it may not if it doesn't

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.530 
idler wheels it may not if it doesn't
just<00:03:12.550> simply<00:03:12.850> install<00:03:13.269> them<00:03:13.420> on<00:03:13.510> your

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
just simply install them on your

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.840 
just simply install them on your
replacement<00:03:14.200> roller<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.620> then<00:03:15.519> just<00:03:15.730> go

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
replacement roller and then just go

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.940 
replacement roller and then just go
ahead<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.120> reinstall<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.810> roller<00:03:17.019> start<00:03:17.829> off

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
ahead and reinstall the roller start off

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.479 
ahead and reinstall the roller start off
with<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.220> left<00:03:18.459> side<00:03:18.730> first<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.980> just

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
with the left side first and then I just

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.190 
with the left side first and then I just
turned<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.120> could<00:03:22.269> hear<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.540> click<00:03:22.989> and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
turned it you could hear it click and

right out of its socket you can see that

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.500 
right out of its socket you can see that
one<00:04:10.840> side<00:04:11.109> down<00:04:11.829> here<00:04:11.859> has<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.670> little<00:04:13.030> circle

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.969 
so again real simple you can see that
both<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.610> these<00:04:48.699> machines<00:04:48.940> are<00:04:49.530> really<00:04:50.530> easy

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
both of these machines are really easy
