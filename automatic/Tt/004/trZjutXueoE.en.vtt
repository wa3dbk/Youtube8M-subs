escape for W or wnr after Jonas I always

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.540 
escape for W or wnr after Jonas I always
go<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.239> side<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.480> guardian<00:04:13.290> angel<00:04:13.650> because

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
go the side of guardian angel because

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.659 
go the side of guardian angel because
you're<00:04:14.940> going<00:04:15.270> to<00:04:15.510> be<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:16.160> their<00:04:17.160> team<00:04:17.430> or

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
you're going to be in their team or

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.729 
you're going to be in their team or
trying<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.540> go<00:04:18.720> around<00:04:18.900> them<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.470> assassinate

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
trying to go around them to assassinate

trying to go around them to assassinate
carries<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.580> that<00:04:21.330> doesn't<00:04:21.930> always<00:04:22.020> work

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
carries and that doesn't always work

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.089 
carries and that doesn't always work
so<00:04:23.400> if<00:04:23.699> you<00:04:23.879> get<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.270> trouble<00:04:24.449> and<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:25.229> get

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
so if you get in trouble and you get

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.999 
so if you get in trouble and you get
killed<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.910> will<00:04:27.060> revive<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.509> just<00:04:28.169> have

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
killed you will revive and just have

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.249 
killed you will revive and just have
another<00:04:29.310> chance<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:29.819> escape<00:04:30.000> or<00:04:30.479> kill<00:04:31.020> someone

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
another chance to escape or kill someone

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
because flash is really important for

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.010 
because flash is really important for
