00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:03.070
 It seems that the school was closed 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.259
 Efforts to put it on the front of the Cross-border Man's Road 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.449
 I got it because I found something called 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.890
 It is eco-friendly but I have never drunk 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.779
 It is this sightseeing day that is a highlight of that day 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.060
 Overwintering because the length was short 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.960
 I caught my eye immediately 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.039
 I got my feet 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.609
 Yes you know the capacity of that canned coffee is small 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.489
 Though it is 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.769
 Oi interchange seems to be Takimae Meitokukan that taste 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.920
 It is said that it is good 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.450
 I imagine before myself 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.050
 The plan is here 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.680
 What does Mr. Daichi's US Nasdaq taste like? 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.970
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.780
 It is such a feeling though it is one of 8 raw material names 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.780
 Is it because you see it? 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.320
 Raw material name 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.040
 I only write 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.040
 I want to be with it 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.170
 It is easier 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.799
 That's the same with pants 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.990
 It is a feeling of black coffee 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.990
 I will try to drink what kind of taste 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.340
 Plese protect 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.680
 I agree 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.960
 Super delicious 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.160
 Not feeling 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 It is easy to drink so 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.679
 taste 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.180
 Is that the height of the construction? 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.500
 I felt like I was doing something a bit impossible 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.160
 You're right as a partner. 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.240
 is not it 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.290
 It is possible to enjoy 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.720
 so you 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.580
 Former teacher 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.570
 From the airport 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.500
 Video 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.279
 It was careless 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.069
 Mr. Taniguchi 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.980
 Mr. Nakajima will announce what year later 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.719
 2 to 2 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.060
 Already one 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.049
 Not feeling 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.589
 Usually delicious 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.759
 That's right if asked if it is recommended 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.429
 It's not that it's awfully bad 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.219
 Air 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:35.309
 Delicious 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.119
 Not even that 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:43.379
 You can listen to Mr. Daichi's lecture. 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.519
 It feels like you can taste the taste of Mino 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.639
 It is such an overwintering feeling 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.790
 Then I think that I want you to scrutinize
