for<00:00:00.299> such<00:00:00.450> a<00:00:00.480> long<00:00:00.690> time<00:00:00.750> now<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.230> obesity

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
for such a long time now the obesity

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.350 
for such a long time now the obesity
epidemic<00:00:01.770> has<00:00:02.490> been<00:00:02.700> looked<00:00:02.879> at<00:00:03.060> as<00:00:03.300> a

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
epidemic has been looked at as a

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.840 
epidemic has been looked at as a
negative<00:00:03.720> thing<00:00:03.980> but<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.310> president<00:00:05.520> is

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
negative thing but this president is

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.390 
negative thing but this president is
really<00:00:06.299> really<00:00:06.480> committed<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.400> solving

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
really really committed to solving

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.850 
really really committed to solving
problems<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> great<00:00:10.500> solution

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
problems and this is a great solution

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.230 
problems and this is a great solution
because<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:11.309> can<00:00:11.490> solve<00:00:11.670> not<00:00:11.849> only<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
because we can solve not only the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.379 
because we can solve not only the
obesity<00:00:12.540> epidemic<00:00:12.830> but<00:00:13.830> also<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.000> energy

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
obesity epidemic but also the the energy

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.720 
obesity epidemic but also the the energy
crisis<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.289> can<00:00:16.529> completely<00:00:17.250> rid<00:00:17.609> ourselves

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
crisis we can completely rid ourselves

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.880 
crisis we can completely rid ourselves
of<00:00:18.180> reliance<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.810> foreign<00:00:19.140> oil<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
of reliance on foreign oil the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.740 
of reliance on foreign oil the
automobile<00:00:20.430> industry<00:00:20.580> really<00:00:21.359> has<00:00:21.539> been

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
automobile industry really has been

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.240 
automobile industry really has been
behind<00:00:21.930> us<00:00:22.260> they've<00:00:22.470> been<00:00:22.650> working<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.100> us

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
behind us they've been working with us

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.580 
behind us they've been working with us
to<00:00:23.430> figure<00:00:23.609> out<00:00:23.850> ways<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:25.140> convert

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
to figure out ways that we can convert

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.820 
to figure out ways that we can convert
cars<00:00:26.160> over<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.000> use<00:00:27.150> cellulite<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.990> fuel<00:00:28.590> it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
cars over to use cellulite as a fuel it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.890 
cars over to use cellulite as a fuel it
burns<00:00:29.099> very<00:00:29.369> cleanly<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.539> use<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> lot

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
burns very cleanly you can use a lot

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.630 
burns very cleanly you can use a lot
less<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.470> go<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> lot<00:00:31.830> farther<00:00:32.070> than<00:00:32.309> on

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
less of it and go a lot farther than on

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.299 
less of it and go a lot farther than on
gasoline<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:33.860> really<00:00:34.860> cut<00:00:35.070> down<00:00:35.100> on

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
gasoline it's really really cut down on

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.069 
gasoline it's really really cut down on
our<00:00:35.460> co2<00:00:35.880> emissions<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.750> we're<00:00:36.899> really

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
our co2 emissions and we're really

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.840 
our co2 emissions and we're really
hoping<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.590> people<00:00:37.800> will<00:00:38.010> people

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
hoping that people will people

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.130 
hoping that people will people
everywhere<00:00:39.210> will<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.629> take<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
everywhere will really take to the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.209 
everywhere will really take to the
solution<00:00:45.500> we're<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.770> Washington<00:00:47.190> DC

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.910 
heard about this fat into fuel for cars
you<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> haven't<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.470> fat<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> fuel

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
you know I haven't the fat to fuel

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
you know I haven't the fat to fuel
program<00:01:23.340> hmm<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> fat<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> fuel<00:01:24.330> program<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
program hmm the fat to fuel program you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
program hmm the fat to fuel program you
know<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.890> rated<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.729> first

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
with plastic surgeons in LA a lot of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.249 
with plastic surgeons in LA a lot of
celebrities<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:36.090> been<00:01:36.150> very<00:01:36.509> supportive<00:01:36.810> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
this cause they're working with plastic

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.440 
this cause they're working with plastic
