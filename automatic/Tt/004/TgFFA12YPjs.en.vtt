00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
stainless steel band that runs around is

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.529 
stainless steel band that runs around is
the<00:06:29.590> primary<00:06:30.190> structural<00:06:30.880> element<00:06:31.389> of<00:06:31.479> the

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539 
the primary structural element of the

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.950 
the primary structural element of the
phone<00:06:31.810> and<00:06:32.610> there<00:06:33.610> are<00:06:33.729> these<00:06:33.880> three<00:06:34.360> slits<00:06:34.810> in

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
phone and there are these three slits in

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.060 
phone and there are these three slits in
it<00:06:35.080> it<00:06:35.259> turns<00:06:35.710> out<00:06:36.240> this<00:06:37.240> is<00:06:37.479> part<00:06:37.900> of<00:06:38.110> some

it it turns out this is part of some
brilliant<00:06:39.400> engineering<00:06:40.150> which<00:06:41.050> actually

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
brilliant engineering which actually

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.760 
brilliant engineering which actually
uses<00:06:42.699> the<00:06:42.849> stainless<00:06:43.419> steel<00:06:43.449> band<00:06:43.930> as<00:06:44.320> part<00:06:44.710> of

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
uses the stainless steel band as part of

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:56.430 
uses the stainless steel band as part of
the<00:06:44.889> antenna<00:06:45.370> system<00:06:45.970> and<00:06:46.530> so<00:06:54.240> yes<00:06:55.240> in<00:06:55.389> GSM<00:06:55.900> so

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
the antenna system and so yes in GSM so

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.610 
the antenna system and so yes in GSM so
it's<00:06:56.710> got<00:06:56.949> these<00:06:57.430> integrated<00:06:58.090> antennas<00:06:58.840> right

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
it's got these integrated antennas right

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.219 
it's got these integrated antennas right
in<00:06:59.889> the<00:07:00.430> structure<00:07:01.090> of<00:07:01.270> the<00:07:01.389> phone<00:07:01.630> it's<00:07:01.870> never

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:02.229 
in the structure of the phone it's never

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:03.180 
in the structure of the phone it's never
been<00:07:02.530> done<00:07:02.710> before

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
been done before

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:13.770 
been done before
and<00:07:03.880> it's<00:07:04.090> really<00:07:04.330> cool<00:07:04.690> engineering<00:07:05.550> so<00:07:12.780> but

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
and it's really cool engineering so but

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.790 
and it's really cool engineering so but
