00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 for a refreshing lemonade 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.950
 we need untreated picture lemons 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.690
 sugar and water that's it 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.639
 I write the exact quantities 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.530
 you in my recipe is after me 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.350
 washed the lemons thoroughly 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.270
 I say the bowl around it 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.640
 The white skin of the lemon should 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.500
 Of course not be delivered because they 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 If I have a bitter taste 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.970
 all lemons have been written off 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.010
 I cut off the ends and cut 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.309
 the lemon into little cubes this 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.719
 Incidentally, I have a recipe from my mom 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.290
 We've been making this lemonade since 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.129
 years and she just wakes me up 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.989
 That's why I do childhood memories 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.210
 She still likes to do it today 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.610
 the only important thing is that one 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.410
 really untreated lemons 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.170
 used the lemon pieces 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 I give them a relatively big shell and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.480
 The hall should be really big 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.109
 so that he can do it all with his hands later 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.539
 good for some, then I can give 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.960
 the sugar on top of it I use 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.119
 2 tablespoons per lemon then pull 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220
 I can one-way gloves on her 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.290
 Of course, do without it and 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.439
 then the sugar becomes good with the hands 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.740
 with stoner kneaded until the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.810
 sugar has completely dissolved the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.520
 grated peel of lemons 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.180
 of course also in this bowl with it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.820
 been 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.650
 and the whole thing I represent really strong 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.930
 with the lemon slice and with the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.420
 so that the flavors are corroded 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.610
 can really unfold after a 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.040
 a few minutes we reach this 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.560
 consistency that the lemon peel 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.659
 right are far kneaded and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.420
 sugar has completely dissolved 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.030
 then we can do that with us 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.450
 clean drinking water mix as use 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.729
 I'm about 300 milliliters per lemon 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.979
 Of course, you yourself with the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.930
 sugar and play with the amount of water 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.240
 if the water is filled then 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.909
 we try it all good again 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.479
 and then it comes in the fridge for 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.909
 about 30 to 45 minutes 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.759
 it should not stand too long 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.430
 stay because the shell can then open 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.810
 begin to give up their bitterness and 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.120
 The result would not be so good 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.280
 That's why 30 to 40 minutes are enough 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.500
 In any case, and then we can 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.510
 even our lemonade from 7 each 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.220
 after what you use for a sieve 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.530
 Of course it could be twice as well 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.690
 if you can be sure 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.180
 I would not like that in the lemonade 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.420
 Lemons test left over in this 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.099
 video I had six organic lemon 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.560
 used the whole yielded a little more 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.769
 than two liters of lemonade I then in 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.300
 suitable bottles have been refilled 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.400
 Whole could of course in the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.410
 fridge and must be really good cold 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.690
 so it just tastes best 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.790
 with a lot of ice cubes and a piece 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.709
 lemon, of course, sees it too 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.360
 really smart of the host and tastes 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.250
 the better I wish you to everyone 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.080
 Have fun while copying and 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.849
 Try and I hope we see each other 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.909
 then bite again at the next video 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.909
 then
