this is going to add a more depth into
our<00:01:24.600> eyes<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.610> once<00:01:26.880> again<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.300> going

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.230 
I'm just going to blend the two colors
together<00:01:37.410> so<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.220> transition<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:38.970> lot

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
together so the transition is a lot

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.820 
together so the transition is a lot
smoother<00:01:41.960> next<00:01:42.960> I'm<00:01:43.080> taking<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.440> dark<00:01:43.680> brown

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.830 
shadow all along the bottom lash line I
tend<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.280> focus<00:01:59.490> more<00:01:59.880> on<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.210> outer<00:02:00.390> part<00:02:00.780> of

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
tend to focus more on the outer part of

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630 
tend to focus more on the outer part of
my<00:02:00.900> eyes<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.470> because<00:02:01.830> that's<00:02:02.070> where<00:02:02.400> most

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
my eyes just because that's where most

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.120

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
of the heavy makeup is at and then I'm

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.040 
of the heavy makeup is at and then I'm
taking<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.640> black<00:02:08.850> eyeliner<00:02:09.300> pencil<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.959> I'm

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
taking a black eyeliner pencil and I'm

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.960 
taking a black eyeliner pencil and I'm
just<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.560> tightline<00:02:10.800> both<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.489> top<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
just going to tightline both the top and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:27.209 
just going to tightline both the top and
bottom<00:02:12.120> lash<00:02:12.480> line

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.830 

and<00:02:28.219> then<00:02:28.430> with<00:02:28.609> an<00:02:28.730> eyeliner<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.390> your<00:02:29.540> choice

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and then with an eyeliner of your choice

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.679 
and then with an eyeliner of your choice
go<00:02:30.140> ahead<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:30.590> wing<00:02:30.859> out<00:02:31.010> your<00:02:31.250> eyes<00:02:31.519> now<00:02:32.209> for

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
go ahead and wing out your eyes now for

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.059 
go ahead and wing out your eyes now for
this<00:02:32.840> look<00:02:32.989> I'm<00:02:33.200> using<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.650> liquid<00:02:33.890> eyeliner

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
this look I'm using a liquid eyeliner

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.789 
this look I'm using a liquid eyeliner
and<00:02:34.579> it's<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.180> little<00:02:35.450> bit<00:02:35.569> hard<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.870> use<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:36.530> I

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
and it's a little bit hard to use so I

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.009 
and it's a little bit hard to use so I
highly<00:02:37.370> recommend<00:02:37.400> using<00:02:37.879> a<00:02:38.180> eyeliner<00:02:38.629> pen

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
highly recommend using a eyeliner pen

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.380 
highly recommend using a eyeliner pen
just<00:02:39.469> because<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.829> have<00:02:39.980> more<00:02:40.219> control<00:02:40.819> but

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
just because you have more control but

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.599 
just because you have more control but
I'm<00:02:41.540> using<00:02:41.719> a<00:02:41.930> liquid<00:02:42.109> eyeliner<00:02:42.349> a<00:02:42.950> felt-tip

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
and I'm just going to do a very thin

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:53.920 
and I'm just going to do a very thin
line<00:02:45.650> all<00:02:45.980> across<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.639> top<00:02:46.879> lid<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:53.030> then<00:02:53.810> I'm

line all across the top lid and then I'm

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.569

going<00:02:54.109> to<00:02:54.200> connect<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.739> outer<00:02:54.980> part<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.519> the

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
going to connect the outer part of the

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:04.360 
going to connect the outer part of the
wing<00:02:55.909> to<00:02:55.939> the<00:02:56.239> bottom<00:02:56.689> lashline

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370

is just going to make it a little bit
more<00:03:13.590> softer<00:03:14.190> at<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.790> same<00:03:14.970> time<00:03:15.180> more<00:03:15.420> sultry

same thing to the bottom lash line but

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.480 
same thing to the bottom lash line but
applying<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.020> black<00:03:28.410> eyeshadow<00:03:28.650> along<00:03:29.340> the

applying the black eyeshadow along the
lash<00:03:29.640> line<00:03:31.970> then<00:03:32.970> I'm<00:03:33.120> gonna<00:03:33.270> do<00:03:33.450> some

lash line then I'm gonna do some

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.030 
lash line then I'm gonna do some
touch-up<00:03:34.050> with<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.320> dark<00:03:34.560> brown<00:03:34.740> from

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
touch-up with the dark brown from

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.770 
touch-up with the dark brown from
previous<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.820> that's<00:03:36.390> usually<00:03:36.600> because

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
previous and that's usually because

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.020 
previous and that's usually because
after<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.410> apply<00:03:37.710> an<00:03:37.860> eyeliner<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.490> gets<00:03:38.760> rid

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
after you apply an eyeliner it gets rid

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.910 
after you apply an eyeliner it gets rid
of<00:03:39.060> all<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.840> hard<00:03:40.110> work<00:03:40.410> with<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.770> eye<00:03:40.800> shadow

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
of all the hard work with the eye shadow

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.040 
of all the hard work with the eye shadow
that<00:03:41.250> we<00:03:41.460> just<00:03:41.640> did<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.300> usually<00:03:42.600> just<00:03:42.810> like

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
that we just did so I usually just like

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.330 
that we just did so I usually just like
to<00:03:43.200> go<00:03:43.320> back<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.680> there<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.130> do<00:03:44.280> some<00:03:44.459> touch-up

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.530 

then<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.730> emphasize<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.360> outer

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
then I like to emphasize the outer

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.510 
then I like to emphasize the outer
corner<00:03:52.020> with<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.410> black<00:03:52.590> eyeshadow<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:53.190> I'm

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
corner with the black eyeshadow and I'm

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.060 
corner with the black eyeshadow and I'm
just<00:03:53.730> slightly<00:03:54.120> shading<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.780> into<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.170> V<00:03:55.770> and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
just slightly shading it into a V and

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.980 
just slightly shading it into a V and
then<00:03:56.490> I'm<00:03:56.610> also<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:57.030> blending<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:57.630> out<00:03:57.780> and

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
then I'm also just blending it out and

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.540 
then I'm also just blending it out and
this<00:03:58.050> is<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.350> gone<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.709> emphasize<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.430> and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
this is just gone to emphasize it and

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.880 
this is just gone to emphasize it and
make<00:03:59.670> it<00:03:59.700> look<00:03:59.880> a<00:04:00.000> little<00:04:00.120> bit<00:04:00.270> more<00:04:00.450> smoky<00:04:02.270> and

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
make it look a little bit more smoky and

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.140 
make it look a little bit more smoky and
