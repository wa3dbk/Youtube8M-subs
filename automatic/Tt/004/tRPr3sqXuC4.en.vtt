00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.649
 nat geo wild caesar asks the idea of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.820
 present cheap to a different note 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.500
 I do not even remember the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.049
 last time we approached another 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.240
 dog as in case with chip 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.320
 I am very afraid of his reaction I enter 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
 do not have right now 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.240
 become aware of what's around you 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.109
 when he is in this state does like that 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.690
 you see okay so less tense 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.820
 never stretched out arms when lily led 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.579
 cheever the others we saw how my 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.200
 precise where she tends the wasquehal 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.510
 cyprus is I'm coming up there you go 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.100
 take that loosen the leze calm the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.100
 dog he lets it go 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:01:01.039
 it is to let go of the columbine 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.039
 like that 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.570
 and painful though it properly I 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.830
 I'm so happy 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.200
 once I managed to relax 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.240
 and let her soft chip has 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.210
 let approach by another dog without 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.250
 get upset you say time we did 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.750
 big progress 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.160
 lily having shown that she can handle 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.600
 leash chip near another dog 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.920
 Caesar wants to go even further 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.920
 baa the agreements the unthinkable 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.420
 we will go for a group walk if 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 the boxers' walk with a dozen 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.509
 other dogs is running smoothly 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.130
 cheap and mocha could well and truly 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.280
 to become the pets of which 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.280
 lily ennahda before always dreaming even 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.259
 if mocha and cyprus have really evolved I 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.410
 still feel completely incapable of 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.530
 take them out with a pack and avoid 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.750
 that there is a worry you could be 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.280
 dog walker and well being to 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.440
 the back like that in our case it's 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.820
 a good thing that the rally designed the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.840
 other than we do not fight against them 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.020
 look at no pretension tension but 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.830
 it's the past 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.680
 here is a departure at home normally 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.250
 I have high hopes at that moment 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.340
 that's fine and then these hours makes us 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.890
 we will change classes you double 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.600
 stop you are going to spend on your 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.610
 left advocated by the left we go 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 drive fashion 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.520
 ok super doubled it changes 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.900
 business 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.470
 I did not even dare to go out with the two 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.300
 dogs together then with a pack sao 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.980
 May it was like I was resuming the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.400
 able to go that's what it's about 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.940
 walks and boxer 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.010
 I was thrilled 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.480
 happiness what a foot I am with my 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.380
 dogs one is followed by a whole group 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.920
 and nothing happens the purpose of 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.320
 exercise 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.130
 is that you taste what it is 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.270

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.010

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.860
 do you realize that you have 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.700
 succeeded without a Caesar you will take 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.910
 insurance I would like you did it 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.000
 it's done I feel like I have the 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.380
 tools to deal with the situation 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.980
 I have hope I am proud of them 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.980
