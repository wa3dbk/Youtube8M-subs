00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.370
 the man of action is always very difficult especially for beginners 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.529
 and there are several possibilities which option we take today 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.839
 does not agree with the court 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.000
 There are also some euros is not as expensive as us 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.060
 what was stolen with the other 20 o'clock 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.269
 while 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.529
 upwards if I do not have a free one 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.150
 on 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.540
 why a first hint why 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.769
 m 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.310
 you do not know which one 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.050
 They were not curious, this is an obstacle 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.590
 in the middle 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.660
 should then the sound was struck then you know what we have 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.440
 and I'll be in front of them too, sometimes in Munich 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.490
 There are now abandoned mines set in Libera 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.550
 in the framework of which the Union countries do not see here 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.550
 the topics range from 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.130
 Dr 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 the Opel 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.090
 BÃ¶hm the people lived 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.790
 with these elements and Wallisellen even the side and young ones 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.010
 Uwe Landau 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.200
 Red s me enough euros 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.620
 Bunge 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.620
 USD 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.200
 be like that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.700
 the citizens move on the mental 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.509
 I can also find you one even if I have St 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.559
 maybe now you are missing like a guitar 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.559
 is recorded 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.049
 not infrequently they now have seven counters 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.929
 DAPD 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.309
 because 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.149
 now it's true that the new site is only a little bit too 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.639
 Workshop but the real ones also paid 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.169
 again the votes breaks off around three are yes or partly is 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.879
 since polyester of course I think that separates when it comes to heat 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.639
 Cold and one day, thanks to three goals was really curious 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.809
 as soon as the ICE the mushrooms did not reach for a new musical instrument 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.289
 what it is which variants would be the warm later, now it goes on 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:18.140
 the guitar 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.120
 because we wanted to explain very briefly about why actually built 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.930
 many do not even know Ahrendt joined as a singer 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.440
 they were called the car, what is important or even important 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.520
 Things while Untertaunus the guitar comes once again very briefly
