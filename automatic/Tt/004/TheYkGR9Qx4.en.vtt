the<00:02:06.840> part<00:02:07.050> because<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.440> wanted<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.770> leave<00:02:08.010> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
the part because I wanted to leave it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.170 
the part because I wanted to leave it

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.630 
leave it
so<00:02:09.510> that<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.810> part<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.650> part<00:02:10.710> I'm<00:02:11.400> not

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so that this part and this part I'm not

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.980 
so that this part and this part I'm not
perfectly<00:02:12.330> clean<00:02:12.630> there<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.380> beauty<00:02:13.710> in

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
perfectly clean there is beauty in

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.620

now<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.840> braid<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.260> don't<00:02:19.410> want<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> be

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
now this braid you don't want it to be

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.590 
now this braid you don't want it to be
super<00:02:19.950> tight<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.550> pull<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:20.910> from<00:02:21.300> your

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
super tight you can pull with from your

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.270 
super tight you can pull with from your
hair<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.530> front<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.800> little<00:02:22.890> bit<00:02:23.040> tighter

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
hair at the front a little bit tighter

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.700 
hair at the front a little bit tighter
but<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.030> tension<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.380> burr<00:02:25.560> on

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
but the tension on this on the burr on

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.260 
but the tension on this on the burr on
the<00:02:25.830> hair<00:02:26.010> from<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> back<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.730> not<00:02:26.940> going<00:02:27.210> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
the hair from the back is not going to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.210 
the hair from the back is not going to
be<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.810> tight<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:31.410> want<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.710> part<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.040> still

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
be as tight you want that part to still

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
be as tight you want that part to still
be<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> little<00:02:32.520> bit<00:02:32.670> messy<00:02:34.190> why<00:02:35.190> because<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
be a little bit messy why because it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.070 
be a little bit messy why because it
looks<00:02:36.510> more<00:02:36.990> natural<00:02:38.720> now<00:02:39.720> when<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.960> get<00:02:40.020> to

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
looks more natural now when you get to

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.630 
looks more natural now when you get to
the<00:02:40.290> section<00:02:40.620> above<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.980> ear<00:02:41.250> you're<00:02:41.490> going

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
the section above the ear you're going

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.000 
the section above the ear you're going
to<00:02:41.730> stop<00:02:41.940> your<00:02:42.270> cornrow<00:02:42.870> there<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.380> turn<00:02:43.830> it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
to stop your cornrow there and turn it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.730 
to stop your cornrow there and turn it
into<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.940> single<00:02:45.480> braid<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.470> you're<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.620> gonna

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
into a single braid so you're just gonna

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.130 
into a single braid so you're just gonna
braid<00:02:47.130> down<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:48.150> not<00:02:48.300> all<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.780> way<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.960> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
braid down but not all the way to the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.350 
braid down but not all the way to the
end<00:02:49.290> actually<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.490> shouldn't<00:02:50.940> say<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.060> it's

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
end actually I shouldn't say that it's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.090 
end actually I shouldn't say that it's
going<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.750> optional<00:02:51.960> maybe<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:52.920> will

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
going to be optional maybe you will

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.160 
going to be optional maybe you will
braid<00:02:53.310> all<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.490> way<00:02:53.610> down<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.970> end<00:02:54.170> it's

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
braid all the way down to the end it's

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.050 
braid all the way down to the end it's
an<00:02:55.350> inspirational<00:02:56.010> guideline<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.790> guys

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
an inspirational guideline so you guys

an inspirational guideline so you guys
can<00:02:57.480> use<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.080> foundation<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:58.920> go

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
can use this as a foundation that you go

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.480 
can use this as a foundation that you go
with<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.640> roll<00:02:59.850> with<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.240> make<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.540> your<00:03:00.780> own

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
with it roll with it make it your own

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.450 
with it roll with it make it your own
then<00:03:02.490> I<00:03:02.520> take<00:03:02.850> these<00:03:03.120> two<00:03:03.420> ends<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.860> pin

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
then I take these two ends and I pin

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.960 
then I take these two ends and I pin
them<00:03:05.640> back<00:03:05.670> with<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.810> jaw<00:03:07.440> clip<00:03:07.880> from<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
wear this style out you want it to look

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.020 
wear this style out you want it to look
a<00:03:54.840> little<00:03:55.080> more<00:03:55.260> put<00:03:55.500> together<00:03:55.590> than<00:03:55.890> using<00:03:56.880> a

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
a little more put together than using a

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.120 
a little more put together than using a
gel<00:03:57.300> clip<00:03:57.570> then<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.170> can<00:03:58.320> use<00:03:58.620> one<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.950> these

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
gel clip then you can use one of these

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.800 
gel clip then you can use one of these
little<00:03:59.190> clips<00:03:59.850> from<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> dollar<00:04:00.270> store<00:04:00.390> which

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
little clips from the dollar store which

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.740 
little clips from the dollar store which
are<00:04:01.070> great<00:04:02.070> for<00:04:02.400> jazzing<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.240> up<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.600> making

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
are great for jazzing it up and making

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.450 
are great for jazzing it up and making
it<00:04:03.900> look<00:04:04.080> a<00:04:04.290> little<00:04:04.470> more<00:04:04.590> purposeful<00:04:05.190> just

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
it look a little more purposeful just

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.010 
it look a little more purposeful just
because<00:04:05.610> gel<00:04:05.850> clips<00:04:06.090> are<00:04:06.300> kind<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.600> like<00:04:06.780> that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
because gel clips are kind of like that

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.470 
because gel clips are kind of like that
