00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.380

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.609
 Georges t 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.609
 how death is leading 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.420
 and covered I let take my advantage «20 minutes» 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.890
 on the one hand we got a nice result 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.890
 confirmed now enteilt 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.540
 Mehrstetten the food processor 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.630

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.630
 4 points too 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.640
 APK 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.010
 then Wienand 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.650
 Sept 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.390
 vanilla sugar 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.450
 a good pinch of salt 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.750
 egg yolk 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.540
 and death 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.740
 The whole is kneaded to a nice smooth dough 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.040
 so both directions and through clarified 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.550
 Decking off 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.930
 and set it again for four and a half hours in a warm place 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.950
 Somalia Pakistan got off to a good start 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.329
 rather the work surface right 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.329
 Nienhaus 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.339
 I have each other 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.339
 a bit rusty you let the donors cool down again 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.509
 coming time 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.509
 then apricots Barthel 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.219
 Hacked too 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.219
 kneaded a bit more colorful now 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.679
 then I diced the marzipan here 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.479
 and lemon peel from an untreated lemon 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.979
 also subtitles 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.069
 and finally the cranberries I've already submitted in Rome 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.889
 mm 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.459
 Bur 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.129
 also still support 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.019
 dat it is shaped into a sphere 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.839
 will be around the airport 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.039
 Press flat 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.999
 and then I roll it into a big square 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.999
 Side 1 cm thick 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.059
 then the area denies water 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.379
 from below a third 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.379
 a role arises 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.879
 and from above the same 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.799
 that creates a thicker role 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.969
 "I wanted him a little bit together 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.209
 and now, in Rome, we put it on baking sheet with baking paper 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.269
 be deliberate 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.209
 and then clearly the smaller roles 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.209
 a little bit 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.870
 That's how our taxes are done 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.659
 and then I covered him for another 20 minutes 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.139
 now the tunnel can already in the oven 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.520
 one and a half hours 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.520
 Weitz movement 180 degrees 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.059
 after 30 minutes of baking time 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.059
 Do not put out the studs here 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.860
 Actelion with all guilty pity that I am so Straub 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.860
 maybe creates 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.550
 and then one hour in the oven 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.050
 No fruits proudly baked ready and slightly cooled 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.050
 now I could cover him with liquid butter 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.909
 like to pull it all in twice 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.319
 Mar dusty 7 or sugar Schönebeck 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.559
 when the wet tunnel then completely cooled it really radiates to them 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:42.289
 the 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.020
 two to three times 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.410
 and after three to four days I can in ascending has the beautiful 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.720
 pulled through the tunnel holds itself four weeks and I wish a lot of fun 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.520
 After Back on a nice Advent season goodbye
