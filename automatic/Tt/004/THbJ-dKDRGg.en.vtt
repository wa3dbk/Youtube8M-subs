crucial<00:00:26.189> weakness<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:28.580> don't<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.640> what<00:00:29.760> that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
crucial weakness I don't know what that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
crucial weakness I don't know what that
is<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.449> assume<00:00:30.900> every<00:00:31.230> team<00:00:31.439> has<00:00:31.619> one

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
is but I assume every team has one

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.490 
is but I assume every team has one
crucial<00:00:32.009> weakness<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> know<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:34.440> not

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
crucial weakness so but I know I'm not

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
crucial weakness so but I know I'm not

spiritomb walling box and

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.549 
spiritomb walling box and
it's<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.719> gonna<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.870> fun<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.350> trying<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it's not gonna be fun so I got trying to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.080 
it's not gonna be fun so I got trying to
got<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> way<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.219> around<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> kind<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
got a way to get around that I kind of

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.560 
got a way to get around that I kind of
thought<00:00:45.480> he<00:00:45.780> would<00:00:45.930> lead<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.410> um<00:00:46.820> was<00:00:47.820> Bremen

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
thought he would lead with um was Bremen

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.590 
thought he would lead with um was Bremen
so<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> decided

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.970 

that<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.560> my<00:00:55.860> plan<00:00:56.989> we'll<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.230> how<00:00:58.410> effective

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that was my plan we'll see how effective

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.760 
that was my plan we'll see how effective
it<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.130> so<00:00:59.670> he's<00:01:00.059> got<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> very<00:01:00.870> very<00:01:01.050> nice

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it was so he's got a very very nice

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.830 
it was so he's got a very very nice
fedora<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> feather<00:01:02.730> stick<00:01:03.030> nominee<00:01:03.660> was

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
fedora with a feather stick nominee was

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.990 
fedora with a feather stick nominee was
going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> joke<00:01:04.260> he<00:01:04.500> leaves<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.250> his<00:01:05.640> high

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000

going to joke he leaves with his high
dragon<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> that's<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.200> thought

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
dragon and that's not what I thought

my<00:01:13.830> uterus<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> little<00:01:14.580> bit<00:01:14.670> more<00:01:14.790> powerful<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
my uterus a little bit more powerful I

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.940 
my uterus a little bit more powerful I
suppose<00:01:15.660> just<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> way<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.619> so
