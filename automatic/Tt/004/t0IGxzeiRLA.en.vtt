here because there is no fuel tank we

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.120 
here because there is no fuel tank we

need to get the speed control mounted

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.070 
need to get the speed control mounted
and<00:03:00.340> we<00:03:00.519> need<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.849> mount<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.239> suitable<00:03:01.660> battery

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
and we need to mount a suitable battery

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.309 
and we need to mount a suitable battery
this<00:03:02.799> 50<00:03:03.340> size<00:03:03.610> combo<00:03:04.209> uses<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> success

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
this 50 size combo uses a success

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.940 
this 50 size combo uses a success
battery<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.660> very<00:03:07.660> popular<00:03:08.200> one<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.739> dual

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
battery and very popular one is the dual

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.360 
battery and very popular one is the dual
sky<00:03:09.190> success<00:03:09.900> 3600<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.620> it's<00:03:11.950> got<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> little

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
sky success 3600 so it's got a little

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.069 
sky success 3600 so it's got a little
bit<00:03:12.580> of<00:03:12.700> weight<00:03:12.849> to<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.420> will<00:03:13.660> need<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.930> be

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
bit of weight to it it will need to be

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.380 
bit of weight to it it will need to be
securely<00:03:14.709> mounted<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.850> how<00:03:16.030> we're<00:03:16.180> going<00:03:16.329> to

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
securely mounted so how we're going to

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.440 
securely mounted so how we're going to
do<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.780> it's<00:03:17.530> very<00:03:17.829> simple<00:03:18.280> we<00:03:18.790> need<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:19.120> keep

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
do that it's very simple we need to keep

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.479 
do that it's very simple we need to keep
two<00:03:19.720> things<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:20.140> mind<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.590> has<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.920> be<00:03:21.070> mounted

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
two things in mind it has to be mounted

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.370 
two things in mind it has to be mounted
so<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.030> won't<00:03:22.209> move<00:03:22.390> around<00:03:22.959> during

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
so that it won't move around during

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.039 
so that it won't move around during
flight<00:03:23.859> or<00:03:24.160> in<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.310> hard<00:03:24.549> landing<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.840> needs

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
flight or in a hard landing and it needs

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.259 
flight or in a hard landing and it needs
to<00:03:26.260> be<00:03:26.410> positioned<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.609> model<00:03:28.060> has

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
to be positioned so that the model has

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.509 
to be positioned so that the model has
the<00:03:29.079> center<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.440> gravity<00:03:29.859> in<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.040> right<00:03:30.220> place

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
the center of gravity in the right place

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.150 
the center of gravity in the right place
which<00:03:30.850> typically<00:03:31.390> will<00:03:31.600> be<00:03:31.750> around<00:03:32.049> here<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
which typically will be around here the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160 
which typically will be around here the
battery<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.790> little<00:03:34.180> bit<00:03:34.329> heavier<00:03:34.750> than<00:03:35.019> the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
battery is a little bit heavier than the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.229 
battery is a little bit heavier than the
fuel<00:03:35.440> tank<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:35.950> we're<00:03:36.519> not<00:03:36.640> going<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:36.940> want<00:03:37.120> it

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
fuel tank so we're not going to want it

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.660 
fuel tank so we're not going to want it
fully<00:03:37.569> forward<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.650> will<00:03:38.829> typically<00:03:39.250> mount

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
fully forward it will typically mount

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.449 
fully forward it will typically mount
somewhere<00:03:40.359> around<00:03:40.480> here<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:41.980> fits<00:03:42.250> very

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
somewhere around here and it fits very

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.520 
somewhere around here and it fits very
easily<00:03:42.819> with<00:03:43.389> room<00:03:43.690> on<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.959> side<00:03:44.200> for<00:03:44.500> the

simply and if you want to have more than

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.120 
simply and if you want to have more than
one<00:04:31.940> battery<00:04:32.389> pack<00:04:32.660> it's<00:04:33.169> very<00:04:33.470> simple<00:04:33.919> to

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
one battery pack it's very simple to

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.969 
one battery pack it's very simple to
change<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.639> pack<00:04:34.880> and<00:04:35.180> fly<00:04:35.840> before<00:04:36.560> you've

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
change the pack and fly before you've

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.670 
change the pack and fly before you've
recharged<00:04:37.580> that<00:04:37.790> first<00:04:38.090> pack<00:04:38.419> if<00:04:39.050> we<00:04:39.350> had<00:04:39.530> an

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
recharged that first pack if we had an

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.610 
recharged that first pack if we had an
airframe<00:04:40.130> that<00:04:40.460> had<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.120> hatch<00:04:41.750> on<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.110> top<00:04:42.470> of

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
airframe that had a hatch on the top of

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.770 
airframe that had a hatch on the top of
the<00:04:42.710> fuselage<00:04:43.250> then<00:04:43.669> this<00:04:43.850> whole<00:04:44.060> process<00:04:44.330> is

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
the fuselage then this whole process is

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.780 
the fuselage then this whole process is
even<00:04:44.960> simpler<00:04:45.500> because<00:04:46.340> you<00:04:46.490> would<00:04:46.639> have

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
even simpler because you would have

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.120 
even simpler because you would have
access<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.540> battery<00:04:48.020> through<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.979> hatch

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
access to the battery through the hatch

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.640 
access to the battery through the hatch
at<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.520> front<00:04:49.820> but<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.510> is<00:04:50.660> very<00:04:51.020> simple<00:04:51.290> even

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
at the front but it is very simple even

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.159 
at the front but it is very simple even
with<00:04:51.979> a<00:04:52.010> model<00:04:52.370> like<00:04:52.400> this<00:04:52.780> one<00:04:53.780> of<00:04:53.900> your<00:04:54.050> other
