update<00:00:21.369> title<00:00:22.090> update<00:00:22.330> 14<00:00:23.200> well<00:00:23.770> that's<00:00:23.950> a

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
update title update 14 well that's a

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.760 
update title update 14 well that's a
very<00:00:24.160> large<00:00:24.610> prediction<00:00:25.150> but<00:00:25.330> is<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.899> day

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
very large prediction but is the day

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.220 
very large prediction but is the day
equivalent<00:00:27.070> of<00:00:27.489> the<00:00:27.640> next<00:00:27.880> update<00:00:28.029> on<00:00:28.419> PC<00:00:28.960> so

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
equivalent of the next update on PC so

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.330 
equivalent of the next update on PC so
it<00:00:29.349> makes<00:00:29.559> sense<00:00:29.680> that<00:00:29.890> we're<00:00:30.099> gonna<00:00:30.220> be

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.479 
chiseled sandstone and Swiss sandstone
blocks<00:00:35.350> which<00:00:35.530> would<00:00:35.680> like<00:00:35.860> originally<00:00:36.340> go

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
blocks which would like originally go

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.160 
blocks which would like originally go
right<00:00:36.700> here<00:00:36.880> and<00:00:36.969> stuff<00:00:37.180> like<00:00:37.300> that<00:00:37.360> but<00:00:38.079> do

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170
