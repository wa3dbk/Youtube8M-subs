00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.019
 hello girls at this video we always try to explain the use of 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.820
 eyeshadow bases because so many of you Italian English stay so beautiful that 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.249
 read then I will first explain to you what the base is for 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.989
 I do not know if you have noticed that the eyeshadows ride the powder eye shadows alone 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.550
 and it is solid composed from when during the course of the day c'est moi non 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.189
 stop agreement 8 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.780
 I will also show you an eye shadow on the segment hand 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.100
 so without anything 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.610
 webcam 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.250
 the courier is not very intense 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.190
 and if you pass us some photos it disappears completely 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.650
 this is expensive 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.460
 because being a powder product it is normal with black with movement 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.950
 municipal down payment code now goes a wound is precisely what product disappears 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.450
 during the effective study day a base as a basis can be used these 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.030
 fill yourself with cream as can be 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.909

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.790
 depends on the time I wanted to do a beautiful thing 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.110
 to use an intimate environment as a base that depending on the eye shadows in cream 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.530
 that you will use the eye makeup color 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.080
 the elements will therefore also change using the same eye shadows but changing 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.130
 the base has a different effect 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.460
 you can give 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.310
 this is an eye shadow always on the subject of the benefit also the latter as 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.030
 based on the theme of cysteine, killing the basis of everything if these yes 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.890
 eye shadow in cream that you want you can still use catholic as for example 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.500
 this 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.240

 you can also find them and bottega verde somma matitone eyeshadow like this one 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.410

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.399
 like this which was the Mediterranean step of the I vad ikea. 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.099
 check out my smooth prone fresh clothes 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.749
 the important thing is that it is a keandra cream product but then 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.189
 stick the eye shadow to make sure that the eye shadow does not go away 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.409
 you do me 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.689
 a test 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.769
 on the hand 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.899
 the date the eye shadow applied with the base underneath 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.369
 it's much more intense 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.089
 the color of why is much more 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.620
 how many darker writes much more 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.529
 and even if I go over the batter with my hand 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.079
 does not disappear 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.229
 just because there is the base is that it keeps it stuck 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:47.300
 to the skin 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.009
 so girls the base is nothing of mysterion prevent shearing 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:56.070
 summarizing these it seems that on May 3 we will be at full speed 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.440
 you can use with reader therefore the important thing that you put something 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.730
