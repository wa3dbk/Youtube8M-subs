00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.740
 and gaming tv and welcome 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.410

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.120
 episode of our pack go to glory yes we 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.559
 I have it now ten o'clock in the evening 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.090
 taken yesterday so i take it 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.620
 right now on monday too i 'm pretty 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.299
 tired because today has the school again 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.789
 started pulling our pack right now 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.699
 and pull obama and the guy is easy 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.740
 incredibly fast 93 tempo and the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.390
 see residual value so we come back 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.010
 I'm pretty tired maybe listening 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.420
 it is not so internally 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.439
 I would most like to go straight to bed 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.810
 fall and pen 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.610
 because it is still the sleep rhythm of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 the vacation in the little sleep had the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.140
 night and then out early she has 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.489
 until 5 o'clock school I still have one today 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.770
 Write klausur after because I had 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.030
 was ill indeed and therefore perhaps the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.500
 Do not comment on it now 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 of the highest level, perhaps 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.530
 Anyway, I'm trying now 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 in one go because I want 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 really simultaneously to bed 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 Definitely will be here now 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.239
 play games and we have now 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.309
 the palermo jerseys and ours applied 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.629
 opponent is called ikea bomber maybe 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.850
 just shopping was Swedish 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.859
 furniture whatever giovinco palace has 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.080
 euroreal pretty fast players and 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.000
 in the back of defense still obama 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.350
 and karin ii so that could be one 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.180
 real fun would be then it's also 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.030
 Immediately go with the first scene ever 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.830
 how dom to simonet deppe the one with the job 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.479
 be tempted on the other side 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.430
 over and gets fouled and then 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.780
 There's the eleven meter there remains 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 umpire nothing else than 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.710
 pointing to the point people will not 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.369
 but palast just has 90 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.799
 penalty 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.990
 what a kracher worth is now running 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.090
 stops and puts the ball in 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.610
 the middle purely what a beautiful 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.009
 conclusion of palacio and there tastes 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.430
 just like his head 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.799
 service yes and then it is already 1 0 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.450
 in the 38 minute we are now the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.950
 opponents on the ball send her palacio 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.930
 on the exterior we are still trying 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.880
 come to sciarrino but that brings 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.640
 the flank and muriel the little man 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.799
 is ready with his beautiful brains 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.149
 and make that from the iss hit now 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.860
 we are already the second 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.360
 half we catch everyone and then 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.340
 there's a foul 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.619
 what is the umpire doing now? 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.479
 the yellow and red card out for giovinco 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.650
 Of course we have to do that again 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.530
 look and then I would say 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.090
 that was not a yellow and red card there 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.430
 there was still the yellow card before and 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.740
 that was absolutely not justified 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.000
 but for us it can only be good and there 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.040
 the opponent already had the next one 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.350
 chance will now bring in the corner 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.120
 and she finds the head of muriel and 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.560
 we can try intercepting now 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.320
 of course, to initiate the counter directly 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.840
 play on top of wagners to obama 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.880
 am loading up or running off of the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.590
 page turn now moves into the 16er 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.160
 he goes with the scooter with the job 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.180
 past 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.590
 that was such a kind of job to hear what 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.209
 So, too, the athener is right 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.830
 fooled that we have such a kind of bridge 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.540
 with the job he goes to the other 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.250
 side over and in the long corner with 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.500
 the help of the post close up then 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.540
 then we are after 73 minutes and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.140
 the enemy does not give up yet 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.570
 a chance 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.940
 citroen with palazzi and again he brings 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.020
 the flank here and there is natural 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.330
 muriel but he does not get in may 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.190
 but lotteries and with good luck 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.100
 then there muriel again ready to shoot 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.840
 or with the header to the place and skin 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.130
 the ball to the 2 2 a 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.840
 and then it goes straight on 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.670
 palast yes times you sent guest was the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.530
 up and away draw by young and 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.060
 then the 5 comes, we have to do that 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.090
 course again in the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.080
 slow motion video evidence please and that was 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.180
 really a very close decision 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.840
 So in doubt for the accused 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.519
 for the striker and thus is the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.110
 situation ruined now is the 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.510
 opponent before the gate brings the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.570
 flank in and three times you guess 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.530
 whoever stands there is muriel that can do it 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.690
 not to be true 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.459
 so now in the backlog run that now 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.220
 afterwards, pepe plays the ball 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.760
 palace and now red i no of course 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.890
 Not 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.530
 we go upstairs and then that 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.019
 important goal golden goal in the 87th 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.519
 minute by balazs io was made before at 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.380
 he really has a shotgun deception 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.730
 well done he was not an end 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.459
 delusions just pulled over 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.660
 no idea what the bombardier crj 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.180
 just miss it 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.860
 and so be as legally we had 33 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.390
 Of course the luck that we in 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.890
 the opponent played the majority 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.890
 was really strong you have to say I think 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.630
 around the 460 march get seven points 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.500
 So overall we have one point 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.090
 to get 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.590
 here we see we have harry place or 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.690
 harriet or whatever 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.250
 likes to sell and we do not have one 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.329
 lower 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.730
 thanks to you as motto yes thank you 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.650
 that you donate us the 50,000 that is 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.540
 really nice of you with it like one 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.460
 small pack opel can do so 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.600
 again many thanks to which I definitely 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.610
 We will be in the next episode 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.620
 of course then the lifebook opening 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.290
 you wanted to have her and now 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.750
 you can start right away with the next one 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.690
 play kfc I think there and exactly 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.910
 so he is has 1 352 ps team with it 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.830
 believe or what is the name of the pirate 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.450
 one eye ear and then he still has 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.560
 hernandez and podolski so very 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.150
 fast players and then it works too 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.400
 go straight with the first scene of her lea 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.530
 on the ball showed his ski it passes 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.450
 with the reverse clasico sculptures now 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.220
 Ã¼bersteiger then again Ã¼bersteiger and 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.910
 then the shot with left but the goes 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.250
 just over 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.960
 very nice skin from elia to the rhine 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.520
 then we stay right in 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.890
 the scene in it catch the ball with juno 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.930
 up ya konan has it now passes by 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.940
 with the roulette and the shot goes 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.730
 again just over so already two 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.500
 Good chances in the first in the first 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.860
 25 minutes but then the opponent is on 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.900
 train 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.700
 hernandez passes by and I know 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.229
 not if the goalkeeper obscured the view 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.580
 or whatever but that falls there 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.930
 otherwise it was like one 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.090
 then Bahnschranke it moves 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.220
 down so that is not at all ulreich and 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.620
 then the long short form wanderfahrt 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.090
 that was a good action from him since 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.860
 once again his left hammer out and 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.720
 then I believe 38 more 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.580
 actions will now be sent here draws 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.010
 passes by where but he does not intend to 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.810
 The pull over and then was 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.400
 but only insert and put the 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.000
 just miss that just can not 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.560
 approach 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.970
 they are the second half and again 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.500
 van der vaart the dealer has yet 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.110
 Just get on the ball 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.979
 go back with her lap and there 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.820
 is the 1 0 of rafael van der vaart 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.380
 our dutchman 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.880
 there again the sight was hidden 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.620
 can not look it up 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.330
 he makes every fall into the long corner 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.720
 Of course it is very precise 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.970
 1 2 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.470
 sorry people and then it goes directly 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.540
 continue with the next scene 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.610
 the flank comes in and we can 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.320
 just so clarify with sam 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.419
 of course he has the pace 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.910
 a diacon in the 50 minutes 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.320
 aQuantive what does he do, he pushes a 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.050
 do the rabbis 1 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.380
 he makes the wonderful lupfer something for 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.390
 a gate of 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.430
 gotha ââof course I will do it 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:30.770
 Just take a look at this look farm 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:33.180
 super sensational good of ours 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.880
 it was here you can even two 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.500
 let's see such a nice gate in the 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.880
 80 minutes made little jump yet 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.730
 sometimes a nice combination gÃ¼ndogan 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.160
