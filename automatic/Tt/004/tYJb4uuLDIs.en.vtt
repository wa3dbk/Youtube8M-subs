00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.769 
remember being like mom can I go to
dance<00:00:19.380> class<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:20.369> not<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:21.270> my<00:00:21.630> mother

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
dance class so it was not like my mother

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.439 
dance class so it was not like my mother
putting<00:00:22.080> me<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:22.560> totally<00:00:22.980> me<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.460> I

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
putting me and it was totally me and I

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.200
