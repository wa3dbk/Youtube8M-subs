organization or well anything at all I
guess<00:01:42.830> but<00:01:43.550> you<00:01:43.670> hold<00:01:43.820> down<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.180> art<00:01:44.360> button

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
guess but you hold down the art button

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.600 
guess but you hold down the art button
and<00:01:44.870> randomly<00:01:45.470> generate<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.040> four<00:01:46.430> digit

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
and randomly generate a four digit

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.469 
and randomly generate a four digit
number<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.480> you<00:01:48.170> attempt<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:49.040> guess<00:01:49.370> and<00:01:49.760> the

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
number that you attempt to guess and the

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.530 
number that you attempt to guess and the
fewer<00:01:50.750> guesses<00:01:51.290> means<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:52.310> smarter<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.360> are

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
fewer guesses means the smarter you are

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.450 
fewer guesses means the smarter you are
I<00:01:53.810> think<00:01:54.200> you're<00:01:54.800> supposed<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:55.159> use<00:01:55.310> your

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
I think you're supposed to use your

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.730 
I think you're supposed to use your
brain<00:01:55.729> which<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.180> that<00:01:56.420> squishy<00:01:57.140> thing<00:01:57.440> inside

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
brain which is that squishy thing inside

brain which is that squishy thing inside
your<00:01:57.890> head<00:01:58.100> you've<00:01:58.940> probably<00:01:59.240> never<00:01:59.600> seen<00:01:59.720> it

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
your head you've probably never seen it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.140 
your head you've probably never seen it
but<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:00.320> it's<00:02:00.560> most<00:02:00.800> likely<00:02:01.250> there<00:02:01.460> anyway

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
but it's it's most likely there anyway

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.700 
but it's it's most likely there anyway
this<00:02:02.270> this<00:02:02.510> can<00:02:02.720> get<00:02:02.810> tricky<00:02:02.870> but<00:02:03.470> if<00:02:03.590> you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
this this can get tricky but if you

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.820 
this this can get tricky but if you
guess<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.310> correct<00:02:04.549> number<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.650> the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
guess the correct number and it's in the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.120 
guess the correct number and it's in the
right<00:02:07.040> slot<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.940> get<00:02:08.090> an<00:02:08.239> H<00:02:08.769> when<00:02:09.769> you<00:02:09.799> hold

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
right slot you get an H when you hold

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.039 
right slot you get an H when you hold
down<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.310> clue<00:02:10.760> button<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.330> my<00:02:11.720> number<00:02:12.019> I

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
down the clue button and my number I

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.600 
down the clue button and my number I
mean<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.410> one<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.680> digits<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.250> ideally

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
mean just one of the digits so ideally

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.550 
mean just one of the digits so ideally
you<00:02:13.700> want<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.060> get<00:02:14.180> four<00:02:14.480> HS<00:02:14.930> which<00:02:15.140> means<00:02:15.380> you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
you want to get four HS which means you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.430 
you want to get four HS which means you
have<00:02:15.769> four<00:02:16.730> numbers<00:02:17.060> in<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.330> right<00:02:17.660> slot<00:02:18.110> if

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
have four numbers in the right slot if

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.410

it's<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> wrong<00:02:20.959> slot<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.620> get<00:02:21.799> a<00:02:21.830> C<00:02:22.190> if

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
it's in the wrong slot you get a C if

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.430 
it's in the wrong slot you get a C if

slots<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.050> just<00:02:47.500> confused<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.040> hell<00:02:48.190> out

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
slots and it just confused the hell out

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.820

of<00:02:48.370> me<00:02:48.610> for<00:02:48.760> many<00:02:48.970> many<00:02:49.060> games<00:02:49.450> until<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.170> just

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
of me for many many games until I just

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.800 
of me for many many games until I just
guessed<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.849> same<00:02:52.120> number<00:02:52.450> all<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.630> way

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
guessed the same number all the way

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.140 
guessed the same number all the way
across<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.470> wrote<00:02:54.340> down<00:02:54.370> which<00:02:54.760> ones<00:02:55.000> were

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
across and wrote down which ones were

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.600 
across and wrote down which ones were
definitely<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.770> computer<00:02:57.220> generated

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
definitely in the computer generated

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.760 
definitely in the computer generated
number<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.239> went<00:02:58.630> backwards<00:02:58.989> from<00:02:59.170> there<00:02:59.319> the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
number and went backwards from there the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.130 
number and went backwards from there the
a21<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.760> see<00:03:00.940> means<00:03:01.150> I've<00:03:01.330> guessed<00:03:01.569> 21

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
a21 that you see means I've guessed 21

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.009 
a21 that you see means I've guessed 21
times<00:03:02.440> which<00:03:02.739> means<00:03:02.980> I'm<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> moron<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:04.019> let's

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
times which means I'm a moron so let's

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.449 
times which means I'm a moron so let's
outsmart<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.709> thing<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.040> do<00:03:06.099> it<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.310> right

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
outsmart this thing and do it the right

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.820 
outsmart this thing and do it the right
way<00:03:06.640> but<00:03:07.269> before<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.019> do<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.260> let's<00:03:08.590> take<00:03:08.800> a

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
way but before I do that let's take a

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.190 
way but before I do that let's take a
look<00:03:09.069> at<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.280> manual<00:03:09.760> with<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.239> robot<00:03:10.750> throwing

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
and now let's play this thing the way it

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.979 
and now let's play this thing the way it
was<00:03:43.630> meant<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.900> be<00:03:44.019> played<00:03:44.790> guessing<00:03:45.790> for<00:03:46.180> 444

will definitively answer whether or not
a<00:03:49.330> four<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.900> actually<00:03:50.079> in<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.470> number<00:03:50.799> which

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
a four is actually in the number which

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.300 
a four is actually in the number which
it<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.549> one<00:03:52.329> of<00:03:52.359> those<00:03:52.630> slots<00:03:52.989> contains<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.890> four

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
it is one of those slots contains a four

it is one of those slots contains a four
I'm<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:55.030> not<00:03:55.180> sure<00:03:55.209> which<00:03:55.540> one<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.250> what

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
I'm just not sure which one so what

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.280 
I'm just not sure which one so what
other<00:03:57.370> numbers<00:03:57.790> could<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.510> be<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.840> turns<00:03:59.109> out

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
other numbers could it be it turns out

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.500 
other numbers could it be it turns out
that<00:03:59.440> there's<00:03:59.620> two<00:03:59.799> sevens<00:04:00.640> in<00:04:00.970> this

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
that there's two sevens in this
