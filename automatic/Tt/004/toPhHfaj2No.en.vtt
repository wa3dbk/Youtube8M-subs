00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.550
 as the luminaries of heaven do not change their route in the positions of their lights and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.810
 as they are all born and they are arranged according to their season and not 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.460
 they disobey their order 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.159
 He looks at us from the earth and pays attention to his works 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.689
 from the beginning to the end like no work of God on earth 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.130
 change and all are visible to you 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.840
 you can see the signs of summer and the signs of winter like the earth 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 whole is filled with water and clouds spray the rain on it 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.899
 chapter 3 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:15.499
 one observes ive as all the trees dry up and all its foliage falls 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.459
 except 14 trees whose foliage remains and wait with all their leaves 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.729
 old until they come new after two or three years 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.269
 chapter 4 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.969
 again and again watch the signs of summer as the sun burns and 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.870
 supports and then on the burning surface of the earth seeks and shadow and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.889
 shelter from the ardor of the sun without finding a way to march or the ground and 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:37.830
 by the rocks 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.399
 because of the heat 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:40.939
 Chapter 5 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.239
 one observes live all the trees as in all of them the leaves 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.520
 green and cover them and all their fruits are for ornament and glory 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.800
 in salta di conside 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.060
 all these works and he knows how the living god 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.060
 he who lives eternally he has done all those things 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.279
 2 as all his works continue from year to year until always and all 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.489
 they obey without alterations and everything happens as God has decreed it 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.899
 you decide how the seas and the media likewise comply and do not change their 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.629
 tasks according to his commandments 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:10.540
 4 but 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.970
 you change and your tasks and not keep your word and instead the 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.569
 you have transmitted and you see your greatness outraged with haughty words and 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.689
 hurtful of your impure mouth 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.069
 hard of heart there will be no peace for you 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.109
 5 why bad citizenship these days and the bush years of life will be lost 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.150
 but the years of bush after destruction will multiply like a curse 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.149
 eternal and there will be no mercy or peace for you 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.629
 6 In those days your names will mean eternal curse for 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.329
 all the righteous and in you will be cursed all the damned and for 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.529
 you will swear all sinners and evildoers 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.540
 seven for the chosen ones there will be light 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.450
 joy and peace and will inherit the earth 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.299
 but for you ungodly there will be a curse 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.739
 8 and then the wisdom will be given to the elect and they will all live and not sin 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.620
 weapons neither for forgetting nor for pride 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.819
 but instead those who are wise were humble 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.859
 9 do not transgress weapons or sin the rest of your life or die for the 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.330
 punishment for divine wrath 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.479

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:16.680
 in eternal joy and peace for all the days of his life
