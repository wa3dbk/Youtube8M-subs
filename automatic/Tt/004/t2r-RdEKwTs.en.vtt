saves updates are in the power shapes

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.509 
saves updates are in the power shapes
program<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.110> last<00:00:10.559> time<00:00:10.740> i<00:00:10.800> did<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.980> european

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
program and last time i did a european

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.780 
program and last time i did a european
power<00:00:11.700> saves<00:00:12.000> update<00:00:12.450> um<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:13.460> still<00:00:14.460> open<00:00:14.700> my

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
power saves update um I still open my

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.189 
power saves update um I still open my
program<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.269> showed<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.660> wasn't<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
program to showed you that wasn't in the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.840 
program to showed you that wasn't in the
American<00:00:16.619> program<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.430> figured<00:00:17.730> it'd<00:00:17.820> be

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
American program but I figured it'd be

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.670 
American program but I figured it'd be
easier<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.300> go<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> actual<00:00:19.020> website<00:00:19.500> and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
easier to go to the actual website and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.849 
easier to go to the actual website and

them<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.860> while<00:02:03.049> anyway<00:02:04.049> yeah<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.409> pretty

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
them in a while anyway yeah it's pretty

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560 
them in a while anyway yeah it's pretty
easy<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.549> make<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> perfect

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
easy now to make this make a perfect

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.910 
easy now to make this make a perfect
Pokemon<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.020> essentially<00:02:07.500> eliminates

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
Pokemon this essentially eliminates

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.260 
Pokemon this essentially eliminates
breeding<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.550> all<00:02:08.670> you're<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.119> is

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
breeding and all you're going to do is

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.900 
breeding and all you're going to do is
have<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.599> Evie<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.739> with<00:02:11.190> super<00:02:11.489> training<00:02:11.730> you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
have to Evie but with super training you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.070 
have to Evie but with super training you
can<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.180> use<00:02:12.540> this

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
can now use this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.720 
can now use this
to<00:02:13.170> give<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.380> all<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.950> bags<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.460> need

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
to give you all the bags that you need

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.200 
to give you all the bags that you need
to<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.570> hit<00:02:16.080> them<00:02:16.260> really<00:02:16.470> quick<00:02:16.830> and

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
to then just hit them really quick and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.520 
to then just hit them really quick and
you'll<00:02:18.210> be<00:02:18.360> maxed<00:02:18.720> out<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:18.990> no<00:02:19.110> time<00:02:19.140> it's

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
you'll be maxed out in no time it's

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.950 
you'll be maxed out in no time it's
really<00:02:19.770> no<00:02:19.920> problem<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:21.510> would<00:02:21.630> be<00:02:21.780> nice<00:02:21.930> if

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
really no problem so it would be nice if

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.170 
really no problem so it would be nice if
they<00:02:22.260> did<00:02:22.410> add<00:02:22.620> EV<00:02:23.220> codes<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:23.820> there's<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> lot

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
they did add EV codes but there's a lot

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.150 
they did add EV codes but there's a lot
of<00:02:24.210> complicated<00:02:24.690> EV<00:02:24.990> sets<00:02:25.500> especially<00:02:25.830> if

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
of complicated EV sets especially if

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.470 
of complicated EV sets especially if
you're<00:02:26.280> smoking<00:02:26.670> fag<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:28.940> yeah<00:02:29.940> there's<00:02:30.420> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
you're smoking fag so yeah there's that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.840 
you're smoking fag so yeah there's that
but<00:02:31.290> yeah<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.860> interesting<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.670> only

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
but yeah this is interesting it's only

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.790 
but yeah this is interesting it's only
for<00:02:33.090> Pokemon<00:02:33.450> y<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.840> Europe<00:02:34.110> right<00:02:34.350> now<00:02:34.410> this

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
for Pokemon y in Europe right now this

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.580 
for Pokemon y in Europe right now this
is<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:34.950> same<00:02:35.280> thing<00:02:35.310> they<00:02:35.790> did<00:02:35.820> with<00:02:36.420> IV<00:02:37.290> codes

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
is the same thing they did with IV codes

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.500 
is the same thing they did with IV codes
after<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:38.340> removed<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> first<00:02:38.880> time<00:02:39.060> this

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
after it was removed the first time this

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.040 
after it was removed the first time this
is<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.840> reduce<00:02:39.990> server<00:02:40.650> wag<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:42.840> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
is to reduce server wag this is so the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.990 
is to reduce server wag this is so the
servers<00:02:43.440> don't<00:02:43.710> blow<00:02:43.980> up<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.370> them<00:02:44.580> they're

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
servers don't blow up on them they're

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.550 
servers don't blow up on them they're
just<00:02:45.060> going<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.360> do<00:02:45.420> one<00:02:45.600> game<00:02:45.810> at<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.990> time<00:02:46.020> one

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
just going to do one game at a time one

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.890 
just going to do one game at a time one
region<00:02:46.980> at<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> time<00:02:47.370> soon<00:02:48.060> following<00:02:48.630> is

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
region at a time soon following is

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.940 
region at a time soon following is
probably<00:02:49.410> going<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.710> be<00:02:49.770> Pokemon<00:02:50.100> X<00:02:50.400> um<00:02:50.670> i

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
probably going to be Pokemon X um i

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.210 
probably going to be Pokemon X um i
would<00:02:52.950> assume<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:54.440> going<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.530> be<00:02:55.620> pokemon<00:02:55.980> x

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
would assume is going to be pokemon x

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.610 
would assume is going to be pokemon x
because<00:02:56.730> that's<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.900> europe<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.230> europe<00:02:58.500> is

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
because that's in europe and europe is

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.150 
because that's in europe and europe is
smaller<00:02:59.040> than<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.640> USA<00:03:00.360> USA<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.170> pretty<00:03:01.560> big

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
smaller than the USA USA is pretty big

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.090 
smaller than the USA USA is pretty big
and<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:03.450> lot<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.720> people<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> US<00:03:04.260> play<00:03:04.709> games

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
longer than that they're pretty biased

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.449 
longer than that they're pretty biased
