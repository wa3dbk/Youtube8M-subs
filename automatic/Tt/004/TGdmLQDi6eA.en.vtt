00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
machine hasn't always been the easiest

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.330 
machine hasn't always been the easiest
thing<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.449> okay<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.800> was<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> bump<00:00:59.219> on

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
thing to do okay so there was a bump on

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
thing to do okay so there was a bump on
the<00:00:59.399> number<00:00:59.730> 5<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.300> apart<00:01:00.930> from<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the number 5 but apart from that you

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319 
the number 5 but apart from that you
just<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> press<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> buttons<00:01:02.940> at

just have to press all the buttons at

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.090 
just have to press all the buttons at
random<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.049> happens<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.769> think

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
random and see what happens I think

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.320 
random and see what happens I think
there's<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> small<00:01:05.610> chance<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.090> might<00:01:06.180> have

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
there's a small chance it might have

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.670 
there's a small chance it might have
been<00:01:06.420> me<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.720> started<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> recession<00:01:07.290> even
