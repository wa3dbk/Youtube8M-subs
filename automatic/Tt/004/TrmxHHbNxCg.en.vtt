difficulty of the tiles were once again

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.320 
difficulty of the tiles were once again
pushed<00:00:41.810> back<00:00:42.140> a<00:00:42.170> bit<00:00:42.350> as<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.250> closest<00:00:43.760> tiles

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330

difficulty with some of them even being

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.610 
difficulty with some of them even being
labeled<00:00:49.370> as<00:00:49.520> trivial<00:00:49.840> not<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:51.080> mention<00:00:51.320> the

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
labeled as trivial not to mention the

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.400 
labeled as trivial not to mention the
tiles<00:00:52.100> are<00:00:52.280> only<00:00:52.460> ten<00:00:52.940> rounds<00:00:53.330> long<00:00:53.600> which<00:00:54.230> is

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
tiles are only ten rounds long which is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.800 
tiles are only ten rounds long which is
unusually<00:00:55.160> low<00:00:55.190> for<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:55.610> ceramic<00:00:56.210> tile<00:00:56.540> I

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
unusually low for a ceramic tile I

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.900 
unusually low for a ceramic tile I
remember<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.770> being<00:00:58.070> at<00:00:58.250> least<00:00:58.490> eighteen

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
remember it being at least eighteen

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.569 
remember it being at least eighteen
rounds<00:00:59.150> plus<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.630> few<00:01:00.020> months<00:01:00.320> back<00:01:00.550> but<00:01:01.550> I

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
rounds plus a few months back but I

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.880 
rounds plus a few months back but I
guess<00:01:01.940> ninja<00:01:02.360> key<00:01:02.630> we<00:01:02.780> thought<00:01:03.079> this<00:01:03.290> game<00:01:03.590> was

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
guess ninja key we thought this game was

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.190 
guess ninja key we thought this game was
too<00:01:04.159> hard<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:04.820> they<00:01:04.970> made<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.299> even<00:01:05.420> easier<00:01:05.750> yet

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
too hard so they made it even easier yet

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.160 
too hard so they made it even easier yet
again<00:01:06.530> not<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.819> don't<00:01:07.880> mind<00:01:08.509> that<00:01:08.749> but

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
again not that I don't mind that but

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.859 
again not that I don't mind that but
damn<00:01:09.829> for<00:01:10.520> me<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:10.819> just<00:01:11.060> means<00:01:11.359> I<00:01:11.630> have<00:01:11.659> a

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
damn for me that just means I have a

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.080 
damn for me that just means I have a
whole<00:01:12.170> load<00:01:12.439> of<00:01:12.499> braid<00:01:12.979> levels<00:01:13.609> that<00:01:13.789> clear

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
whole load of braid levels that clear

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.840 
whole load of braid levels that clear
through<00:01:14.299> now<00:01:14.530> this<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:15.859> the<00:01:16.039> first<00:01:16.310> level<00:01:16.609> of

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
through now this is the first level of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.609 
through now this is the first level of
the<00:01:16.969> three<00:01:17.270> that<00:01:17.509> I'll<00:01:17.659> be<00:01:17.840> showing<00:01:18.079> for<00:01:18.289> this

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
the three that I'll be showing for this

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.010 
the three that I'll be showing for this
video<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.340> it's<00:01:19.729> on<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.060> butterfly<00:01:20.420> track

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
video and it's on the butterfly track

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.260 
video and it's on the butterfly track
one<00:01:21.679> of<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:21.920> hardest<00:01:22.340> tracks<00:01:22.670> in<00:01:22.939> all<00:01:23.090> of

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
one of the hardest tracks in all of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.840 
one of the hardest tracks in all of
monkey<00:01:23.659> City<00:01:23.929> yet<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.649> can<00:01:24.859> still<00:01:25.039> beat<00:01:25.429> it<00:01:25.639> with

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
monkey City yet I can still beat it with

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.219 
monkey City yet I can still beat it with
my<00:01:26.060> eyes<00:01:26.270> closed

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
my eyes closed

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.739 
my eyes closed
it's<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:28.039> shame<00:01:28.310> there<00:01:28.609> is<00:01:28.759> no<00:01:28.939> hardcore<00:01:29.299> mode

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
it's a shame there is no hardcore mode

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.899 
it's a shame there is no hardcore mode
for<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.079> bloom<00:01:30.409> beacon<00:01:30.979> when<00:01:31.369> I<00:01:31.399> went<00:01:31.819> to

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
for the bloom beacon when I went to

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.449 
for the bloom beacon when I went to
check<00:01:32.209> up<00:01:32.420> on<00:01:32.539> it<00:01:32.719> I<00:01:32.869> realized<00:01:33.649> that<00:01:33.950> option

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
check up on it I realized that option

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.149 
check up on it I realized that option
disappeared<00:01:35.179> so<00:01:35.719> for<00:01:35.990> now<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.289> guys<00:01:36.679> have<00:01:37.100> to

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
disappeared so for now you guys have to

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.010 
disappeared so for now you guys have to
suffer<00:01:37.850> through<00:01:37.969> some<00:01:38.270> ridiculously<00:01:38.869> easy

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
suffer through some ridiculously easy

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.550 
suffer through some ridiculously easy
gameplay<00:01:40.119> anyways<00:01:41.119> once<00:01:41.959> you<00:01:42.170> beat<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
gameplay anyways once you beat the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.919 
gameplay anyways once you beat the
balloon<00:01:42.829> beacon<00:01:43.399> tile<00:01:43.700> another<00:01:44.450> one<00:01:44.719> will

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
balloon beacon tile another one will

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.469 
balloon beacon tile another one will
randomly<00:01:45.409> spawn<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.219> closest<00:01:46.759> open<00:01:47.149> tile

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
randomly spawn in the closest open tile

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.480 
randomly spawn in the closest open tile
from<00:01:47.749> the<00:01:47.959> center<00:01:48.319> of<00:01:48.469> your<00:01:48.619> city<00:01:48.950> but<00:01:49.429> only

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
from the center of your city but only

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.239 
from the center of your city but only
after<00:01:49.999> a<00:01:50.209> sixth<00:01:50.719> power<00:01:50.869> cool<00:01:51.289> down<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.189> you

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
after a sixth power cool down so you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:54.099 
after a sixth power cool down so you
can't<00:01:52.609> spam<00:01:52.999> it<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.420> hoard<00:01:53.659> up<00:01:53.869> those

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
can't spam it to hoard up those
