00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
the app we're going to start from

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.170 
the app we're going to start from
scratch<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:48.010> first<00:00:49.010> thing<00:00:49.190> I'll<00:00:49.370> do<00:00:49.610> is<00:00:49.790> I'll

set<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.870> switch<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.200> vintage<00:00:51.800> now<00:00:52.280> I<00:00:52.580> am<00:00:52.940> very

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
set the switch to vintage now I am very

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.210 
set the switch to vintage now I am very
familiar<00:00:53.300> with<00:00:53.600> real-life<00:00:54.140> rectifiers<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.010> I

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
familiar with real-life rectifiers and I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.520 
familiar with real-life rectifiers and I
know<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.700> really<00:00:56.360> like<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.690> vintage<00:00:56.900> voicing

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
know I really like the vintage voicing

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.090 
know I really like the vintage voicing
of<00:00:57.650> that<00:00:58.430> amp<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:58.970> I'm<00:00:59.480> going<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.980> set<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
of that amp and I'm going to set the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.570 
of that amp and I'm going to set the
eq's<00:01:01.640> all<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.540> noon<00:01:08.470> and<00:01:09.470> I'm<00:01:10.280> going<00:01:10.400> to<00:01:10.460> set

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
eq's all to noon and I'm going to set

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.980 
eq's all to noon and I'm going to set
the<00:01:10.700> master<00:01:10.880> way<00:01:11.180> down<00:01:11.390> because<00:01:11.540> I<00:01:11.750> don't<00:01:11.930> know

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
the master way down because I don't know

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.290 
the master way down because I don't know
how<00:01:12.110> loud<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:12.530> is<00:01:14.860> gain<00:01:15.860> at<00:01:16.040> noon<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:17.180> we're

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
how loud it is gain at noon and we're

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:33.660 
how loud it is gain at noon and we're
going<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.450> see<00:01:17.720> how<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:18.500> sounds

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.880 

so<00:01:34.670> right<00:01:34.820> away<00:01:35.000> that's<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.300> little<00:01:35.540> muddy<00:01:35.890> it

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
so right away that's a little muddy it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.890 
so right away that's a little muddy it
could<00:01:37.130> could<00:01:37.430> have<00:01:37.640> Morgaine<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.480> we're

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
could could have Morgaine and we're

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.270 
could could have Morgaine and we're
going<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.050> fix<00:01:39.260> that<00:01:39.350> in<00:01:39.470> just<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.770> second<00:01:40.130> but

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
going to fix that in just a second but

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.740 
going to fix that in just a second but
first<00:01:40.520> I'm<00:01:40.790> going<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.000> sweep<00:01:41.210> through<00:01:41.450> each

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
first I'm going to sweep through each

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.550 
first I'm going to sweep through each
band<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:43.070> EQ<00:01:43.550> section<00:01:43.820> see<00:01:44.330> what<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.080> EQ

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
band of the EQ section see what that EQ

00:01:45.560 --> 00:02:07.499 
band of the EQ section see what that EQ
section<00:01:45.800> is<00:01:46.190> doing

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.660 

so<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.600> this<00:02:08.720> particular<00:02:09.200> instance<00:02:09.500> I'm<00:02:10.220> going

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
so in this particular instance I'm going

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.309 
so in this particular instance I'm going
to<00:02:10.789> reduce<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.240> base<00:02:13.870> I'm<00:02:14.870> going<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.080> keep<00:02:15.200> the

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
to reduce the base I'm going to keep the

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.360 
to reduce the base I'm going to keep the
mids<00:02:15.500> right<00:02:15.709> where<00:02:15.860> they're<00:02:15.980> at<00:02:17.950> I'm<00:02:18.950> going<00:02:19.280> to

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
mids right where they're at I'm going to

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.350 
mids right where they're at I'm going to
boost<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.700> high<00:02:19.850> end<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.060> see<00:02:20.180> how<00:02:20.300> that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
boost the high end and see how that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.170 
boost the high end and see how that
sounds

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.860 

there's<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.239> little<00:02:27.390> bit<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.660> mid-range

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
there's a little bit of mid-range

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.610 
there's a little bit of mid-range
honking<00:02:28.500> us<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:29.959> turn<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.080> down<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.319> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
honking us there turn that down just a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.380 
honking us there turn that down just a
little<00:02:31.650> bit<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.370> I'm<00:02:32.580> also<00:02:32.730> going<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.209> boost

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
little bit and I'm also going to boost

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.850 
little bit and I'm also going to boost
the<00:02:33.540> presence<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.379> little<00:02:34.590> bit<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.800> see

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
the presence just a little bit and see

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.480 
the presence just a little bit and see
how<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.010> sounds

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.130 

that<00:02:42.490> sounds<00:02:42.820> pretty<00:02:43.060> good<00:02:43.330> for<00:02:43.600> just<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.840> bass

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
that sounds pretty good for just a bass

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.010 
that sounds pretty good for just a bass
amp<00:02:44.560> tone<00:02:45.130> now<00:02:45.820> I'm<00:02:46.090> going<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.450> add<00:02:46.630> an

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
amp tone now I'm going to add an

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.350 
amp tone now I'm going to add an
overdrive<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:48.490> particular<00:02:48.940> case<00:02:49.120> it's

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
overdrive this particular case it's

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.350 
overdrive this particular case it's
called<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.630> tube<00:02:49.780> drive<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:52.000> have<00:02:52.210> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
called the tube drive and I have the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.770 
called the tube drive and I have the
overdrive<00:02:52.750> set<00:02:53.020> about<00:02:53.440> noon<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:55.450> level

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
overdrive set about noon and the level

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.660 
overdrive set about noon and the level
about<00:02:56.050> noon<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.530> generally<00:02:57.160> start<00:02:57.220> everything

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
about noon I generally start everything

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.300 
about noon I generally start everything
at<00:02:58.060> noon

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:20.480 

without

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.000 

ok<00:03:21.490> so<00:03:21.550> now<00:03:21.730> we're<00:03:21.850> going<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.180> fine<00:03:22.570> tune<00:03:23.010> this

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
ok so now we're going to fine tune this

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.340 
ok so now we're going to fine tune this
tone<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.730> I'm<00:03:25.330> going<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.600> bump<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.960> gain<00:03:26.140> up

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
tone and I'm going to bump the gain up

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:43.800 
tone and I'm going to bump the gain up
just<00:03:26.800> a<00:03:26.980> smidgen

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.470 

now<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.409> totally<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.190> great<00:03:46.879> tone<00:03:47.150> and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
now this is totally a great tone and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.190 
now this is totally a great tone and
very<00:03:47.900> usable<00:03:48.200> as<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.819> bonus<00:03:49.819> after<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.659> amp<00:03:50.870> in

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
very usable as a bonus after the amp in

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.289
