00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.610
 hello everyone with you kroner looking for me under 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.730
 sight German heavy tank wipe out 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.820
 s201 to the gift tank succeeded for 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.480
 globalku namely chosen by the subscriber 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.070
 my group for this review this week 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.220
 review with us forever is also possible in the group 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.230
 order what we have in this tank with 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.779
 interesting we will see what a cross between 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.420
 lion sneaker there I do not know with whom 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.020
 flash from e-100 oh so we have 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.230
 on armor as we see 200 millimeters forehead 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.600
 it seems like a very strong paint 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.579
 by the way notice here we have here 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.200
 such 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.629
 triplex on the crisis is still something bump 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.289
 jumped up and here there is no so aim 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.260
 there is absolutely no meaning in them 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.710
 the easiest way is just 160 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.280
 millimeters why completely the whole board 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.480
 including the tower side 200 meters in front 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.900
 the tower these parts here 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.060
 here and back 120 millimeters already of course 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.479
 decent decent armor even ass 20 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.780
 this is quite good but everyone remembers 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.939
 Unfortunately, these are the corners of the screen at the tank too 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.980
 there are but screens only covers the tower 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.200
 only 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.920
 not from the turrets and close the gun itself 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.590
 therefore, the meaning of particular grads is not in 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.170
 barton will beat perfect all the more 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.530
 look guslya closes just miserable 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.750
 part if you remove the chassis only lower 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.860
 part of the machine hiding caterpillars then 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.530
 there is a fully honored machine open 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.890
 position 1 by the way the tank is to your forehead 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.710
 here it's because you could become possible 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.320
 calmly pierce the lower armor corner 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.870
 small if you have a good gun to climb 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.330
 in on pride you can just go anywhere 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.480
 absolutely beat not to burn 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.650
 despite the fact that we have the right mechvod 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.100
 on the left sits a radio operator as seen from the rink 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.220
 it's a front wheel drive car and therefore 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.780
 here we are with her transmission and so 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.670
 as it seems like pours mature 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.190
 transmission of the cross that is like this goes 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.840
 powertrain just a strip like that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.120
 so here's another top down and part and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.220
 transmissions 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.120
 Here if you have a gun more or less 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.730
 weak or not possible somehow 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.350
 get him on board studied here 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.240
 such an angle you need to shoot only 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.700
 the front part well let's say there he became 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.640
 for some house only sees the nose 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.920
 aim at this one 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.360
 the part here is see no angle at all 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.230
 absolutely at right angles this 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.100
 Bronelist here how would he 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.540
 pretty wide get into it 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.570
 maybe even meters from 50 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.670
 from a hundred meters but there will be a chance for me 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.580
 will say good gun in some places you can 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.030
 will get near them free 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.630
 Plants this part of your forehead even 8 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.970
 louna but if the tank hit jesus like that 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.680
 such an angle and let him nothing 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.720
 covers the side yes yes there is neither 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.610
 lodge nothing just become that way 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.570
 turned to you cannon and calm 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.510
 shoots on the body well here will be already 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.980
 Naturally there may be neprobitiyam here 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.440
 there may be a ricochet right angle 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.270
 picked up then here will be about here 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.000
 such a corner here shells 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.320
 ricocheting and that they can not punch 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.319
 This part opens 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.340
 wonderful 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.889
 she is visible at this rounding 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.359
 under the tower from here at such an angle 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.670
 makes his way with a bang 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.700
 even the seventh some levels will be his 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.030
 calmly take that corner 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.500
 not all of course but I will take eight 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.739
 sew here you are just a thief that is 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.019
 this part is in this position of the tank 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.450
 ideal for breaking through and moreover judging 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.819
 on the layout of the tank well vangyu vangyu so 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.239
 her side is exactly the same 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.680
 This belt, that is, here and we will be very 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.489
 painful break through very painful a 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.310
 if he is to you naturally 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.759
 overboard you can choose to beat where 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.199
 you can even beat the engine 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:20.900
 the engine he has here is for that is in 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.190
 lobby engine even in the fighting compartment 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.650
 anywhere the main thing is not to shoot 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.610
 caterpillars shoot higher caterpillars and here 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.449
 flowing to the floor 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.430
 corners they have no effect on what 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.960
 you will not pierce him 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.789
 but most likely you will punch 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.710
 absolutely all thoughts will be him to you 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.199
 become so sideways on what if you 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.940
 generally quite simply disgusting 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.860
 gun there without breaking through 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.080
 then the best lesha aim here in this part 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.630
 here, too, there is still some angle 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.150
 some rounding and a little bit going to be 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.440
 armor increase given but here 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.810
 here you will beat at a right angle 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.630
 absolutely but again a single corner 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.400
 there is some kind of back under the turret 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.550
 plant them with a bang 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.039
 Further if he stands so it can be seen 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.360
 only his towers 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.750
 naturally shoot the tower in the forehead you 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.759
 of course you can shoot that part 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.580
 important commander with a big big 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.860
 luck even breaking through here but better 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.490
 still maneuver the whole thing to decide and 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.349
 try to punch a little bit left 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.810
 just to the right of the Muscovite he will turn away 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.060
 so it is worth the corners are ideal 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.409
 here are just perfect but if he 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.820
 turn the turret a little bit already 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.960
 regarding you you are allowed here 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.469
 stand then already side brush under such 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.659
 corner 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.150
 you can also punch this cheek 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:43.240
 can be angled 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.830
 But in principle, the tank pretty 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.140
 interesting in that he back 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.880
 towers but again the back tower taxis 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.620
 just above the hangar where not only these 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.800
 rounding under the tower also rounding 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.810
 fights great just here and back 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.130
 also a moment like that 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.250
 fireflies will be important 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.200
 and if you drove up behind this utyazhek you 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.990
 want him stuffed don't shove him in 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.950
 flap because armor flap 140 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.830
 millimeters of body armor in the turret 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.600
 and the bottom of case 120 so you have 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.040
 there will be more chances to break it in 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.120
 body punch in hatch 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:23.330
 This one's a natural shoot. 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.580
 from the back to the fireflies in round out the fate 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.460
 also a little profitable one hundred and six 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.730
 millimeters I think on the same little chap 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.460
 it is possible to jump at a miracle and 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.290
 good luck that's why 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.330
 Tanchik u all subscribe put 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.070
 likes to comment like a tank 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.650
 next week is selected in group vk 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.100
 I will leave a reference for this video 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.100
 bye everyone
