00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.400
 people today that I am with you 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.320
 It would seem to be a rich ham soup 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.129
 for this are the following we are going to 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.559
 use ham 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:16.129
 let's use tortillas let's use salt 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.180
 let's use an achiote seasoning and we 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:23.000
 to use cilantro chicken broth and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.860
 tortillas here we go 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.470
 I'm going to cut the tortillas in this way 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.540
 I do not want to be so thin or 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.990
 so thick, so I'm going to start 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.540
 3 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.930
 well in three parts now we are going then to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.610
 leave here we have the ham I'm going to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.610
 split into small squares 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.370
 ah 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.160
 the squares must be very small 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.090
 because remember that this is going to be a 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.100
 ham soup so 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.100
 we want strong the small ones 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.750
 I have here and for heating water 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.210
 soup or throw the caldito the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.070
 condiments that I'm going to take are ready 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.070
 I will stir 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.710
 and stir well we're going to take salt 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.710
 taste 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.210
 Salazar, salt, I'm not going to leave the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.210
 that yesterday 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.180
 here I have oil heating up because I'm going 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.160
 to sautÃ© tortillas I'm going to suffer 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.960
 here in the oil and I will also suffer 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.610
 the ham but first 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.500
 Tortillas were suffering because I think 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.630
 the ham is going to leave the oil dirty and not 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.310
 I want the tortillas to dirty like this 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.920
 that the first thing is the tortillas we are going to 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.400
 fry them until you are there in the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.400
 oil 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.710
 here we have already the tortillas are 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.250
 fried and sorry because we told from the 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.610
 principle that we need to be of 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.680
 corn and here I have a paper a role 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.050
 towel and where will I get the tortillas 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.580
 so that I do not get greasy because I do not 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.440
 I want to add fat to the soup 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.220
 so here I'm going to take them out so that 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.200
 is nothing fatty now let's continue 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.490
 Now I have the ham, I 'm going to 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.490
 follow here for a little while 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.310
 well we are already in was ready I what 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.470
 I put there just so that with a little 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.470
 of color you have to leave a little 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.730
 Soup 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.730
 so we 'll be a little 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.060
 now yes I had known now what am I going 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.280
 to take out I like it whenever we let 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.860
 one more roasted less touched for 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.080
 that gives color to the soup equal the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.230
 I leave some tortillas that are golden brown 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.550
 It is all well that they remain as 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.370
 little birds and the others not to give me 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.959
 little color to the soup and they saw how 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.520
 six times that's why I cold first 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.530
 tortillas for me to stay dirty the 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.690
 oil as it got dirty so that's why 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.100
 that I make the tortillas cousin now 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.790
 make broth that I have here is 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.410
 boiling 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.900
 now the tortillitas as you can see 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.450
 here they do not have fat I'm going to put the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.370
 tortillas 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.370
 and then I'm going to put the ham 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.220
 And this is not funny because paper 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.050
 towel removed the fat but very 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.360
 little bit now I'm going to boil there for a few 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.560
 three minutes meanwhile I'm going to 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.500
 chopping cilantro 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.660
 and here we have the cilantro let's 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.099
 apply it often remember that to me 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.690
 he likes the cilantro he's going to take it but if 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.060
 you do not like cilantro does not have 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.340
 that to throw coriander nothing can with his 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.870
 Coriander medicine but like me 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.610
 like so much oscillating I'm going to throw 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.230
 a little bit that gives you better flavor but 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.390
 however the sum will remain rich 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.459
 for this soup it is very easy to make 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.310
 this rise is about 10 minutes already 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.169
 Easy to make list and ingredients 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.919
 it's not easy to get it I hope that the 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:28.050
