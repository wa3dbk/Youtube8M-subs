00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:13.109
 The flight from Brazil 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:18.730
 here every day are produced vehicles that pay an era for their 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.730
 innovations 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.320
 in his more than 25 years of Brazil 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.550
 the curitiba factory contributed to the change in the transportation profile of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.550
 loads and passengers yes all of latin america 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.810
 in this trajectory 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.030
 marked by success the last few years were marked by an evolution 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.109
 internal 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.210
 unprecedented in the history of the people 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.340
 the production of a new family of trucks the hot line 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.870
 would put the organization 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.380
 new technological level 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.040
 innovations that would profoundly alter the production model 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.880
 was the 'feature' nine nine project 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.390
 in just three years 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.979
 to the people what it was like to be a booth factory, a new 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.100
 motors with improved logical technical contours 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.780
 new assembly lines 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.940
 have been processed 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 ground the internal layout 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.220
 the new hill appeared 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.210
 alongside the technological improvement 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.210
 another major change was underway 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.190
 new products and new investments existed 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.250
 new forms of action 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.980
 it was necessary to do differently what would be different 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.630
 thank you 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.400
 in collective development 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.520
 new model of liquidity management self-managing country emerged 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.219
 a prof concept 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.419
 innovative 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.259
 that focused on 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:12.479
 employee 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.039
 what I call a factory 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.509
 according to the person to another 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.010
 since the well 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.119
 and did 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.459
 it could be recognized 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.229
 share responsibility 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.259
 as a guy the challenge 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.289
 to oab / if the success 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:34.939
 in March 1998 the pilot team 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.189
 from the outset a massive awareness 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:42.070
 the discussions 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.439
 encounters 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.450
 new roles needed to be understood 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.679
 people should learn to own their jobs 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.519
 and together with this right 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.519
 victory has had its new responsibilities 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.289
 the transition took over the factory 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.289
 gradually 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.809
 we were invited to work in hand 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.099
 we have no idea what it would be 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.489
 we receive training courses and lectures 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.940
 then we will have notion of what would be the owner valdinei asa 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.029
 divided into 5 large groups 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.309
 and then on several teams 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.459
 in the beginning it was difficult 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.379
 it is natural for the human being 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.619
 and resistance to change 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.289
 we were learning 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.379
 improving decision-making 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.079
 for Serasa to partner with we do not respond directly on the border 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.929
 these responsibilities 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:44.769
 unlike today 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.559
 every week in the following meet to plan activities for the 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.790
 next week we discussed his life insurance affairs 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.979
 safety 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.379
 part of the companionship in some states the process 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:05.830
 there was the leader 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.089
 the person in charge 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:08.189
 supervision 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.369
 after being elected 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.149
 it was that bureaucracy 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.960
 now we will not solve the problems within the team 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.090
 and all that bureaucracy was over 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.379
 the people 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.379
 was faced with the problem and did not know what to do 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.669
 each one knows only his routine 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.900
 I did not know anything about other areas 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.419
 nowadays we are aware of the decisions to be made. 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.400
 process the factory floor gained more power 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.120
 go back do not even think about it today has more to do with sobriety and autonomy 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.770
 the motivation is greater will have access to information the quality 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.379
 also increased 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.379
 dagol work the engine is a bridge of the road 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.880
 today the people have 68 teams in all will be indicted 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.920
 involving about seven hundred and 18 people 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.430
 are groups of people acting with the minimum of direct supervision 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.759
 with activities and interdependent 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.099
 aware and committed to sharing the responsibilities of 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.139
 teams committed to improving their work processes 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.689
 and negotiate the necessary resources to meet the objectives of the 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:24.949
 business 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.029
 the number of participants in each team is directly related to 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.029
 the complexity of the process 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.790
 the opportunity to dialogue and develop ideas is considered one of the things 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.860
 most important in the whole process 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.170
 pass countless other results 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.170
 already hit bieber consulates 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.809
 people and functions are closer 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:00.520
 open communication 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.400
 provided a higher speed of action r action 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:07.729
 creativity has gained strength 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.449
 the clearly stated objectives have leverage the greater involvement 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.199
 the quality of products has grown significantly 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.830
 reaching historical indexes within the group itself the people 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.850
 delegated responsibility 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.249
 generated more autonomy on the factory floor 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:30.129
 the freedom to work 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:31.800
 created the motivation 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.770
 and commitment 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.960
 recognition boosted productivity 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:43.749
 she is known for her innovations already faced herself 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.830
 the beginning of a new era good technology day he fears 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.899
 where it closes in itself and of the transformation state the man
