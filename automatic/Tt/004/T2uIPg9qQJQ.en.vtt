okay<00:00:11.539> we<00:00:11.900> have<00:00:12.110> Brenda<00:00:12.559> here<00:00:12.799> today<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:13.520> we

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
okay we have Brenda here today and we

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.060 
okay we have Brenda here today and we
were<00:00:14.029> doing<00:00:14.209> a<00:00:14.480> medium<00:00:14.900> depth<00:00:15.199> chemical<00:00:15.830> peel

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
were doing a medium depth chemical peel

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.240 
were doing a medium depth chemical peel
on<00:00:16.250> her<00:00:16.690> she's<00:00:17.690> already<00:00:17.930> had<00:00:18.470> a<00:00:18.500> little<00:00:18.919> bit<00:00:19.099> of

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
on her she's already had a little bit of

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.960 
on her she's already had a little bit of
numbing<00:00:19.849> nerve<00:00:20.269> blocks<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:22.400> first<00:00:22.699> part

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
numbing nerve blocks and the first part

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.689 
numbing nerve blocks and the first part
of<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.240> chemical<00:00:23.720> peel<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.380> that<00:00:24.699> 70%

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
of the chemical peel is that 70%

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.099 
of the chemical peel is that 70%
glycolic<00:00:26.630> acid<00:00:27.109> and<00:00:27.289> then<00:00:28.150> after<00:00:29.150> that<00:00:29.329> we're

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
glycolic acid and then after that we're

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.920 
glycolic acid and then after that we're
going<00:00:30.259> to<00:00:30.349> put<00:00:30.589> some<00:00:30.859> TCA<00:00:31.759> or<00:00:32.119> trichloroacetic

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
going to put some TCA or trichloroacetic

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.010 
going to put some TCA or trichloroacetic
acid<00:00:32.960> on<00:00:33.829> that's<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.850> chemical<00:00:35.690> that<00:00:35.720> will

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
acid on that's the chemical that will

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.680 
acid on that's the chemical that will
actually<00:00:36.410> give<00:00:36.650> you<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.880> medium<00:00:38.330> depth

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
actually give you the the medium depth

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.340 
actually give you the the medium depth
kill<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:39.910> chemical<00:00:40.910> peel<00:00:41.180> like<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.600> TCA<00:00:42.230> peel

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
kill so a chemical peel like a TCA peel

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.030 
kill so a chemical peel like a TCA peel
will<00:00:43.310> help<00:00:43.610> with<00:00:44.000> discoloration<00:00:44.680> any<00:00:45.680> sun

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
will help with discoloration any sun

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.730 
will help with discoloration any sun
damage<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:46.850> then<00:00:47.180> fine<00:00:47.870> lines<00:00:48.230> they<00:00:48.560> will

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
damage and then fine lines they will

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.800 
damage and then fine lines they will
help<00:00:48.920> improve<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.970> texture<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.660> skin

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
help improve the texture of the skin

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.150 
help improve the texture of the skin
start<00:00:51.680> with<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.330> glycolic<00:00:53.330> acid<00:00:54.260> go<00:00:55.010> ahead

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
start with the glycolic acid go ahead

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.540 
start with the glycolic acid go ahead
and<00:00:55.340> close<00:00:55.550> your<00:00:55.820> eyes<00:00:56.000> for<00:00:56.330> me<00:00:57.040> great<00:00:58.040> so

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
and close your eyes for me great so

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.820 
and close your eyes for me great so
we're<00:00:59.360> going<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.600> put<00:00:59.840> this<00:01:00.020> on<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.620> glycolic

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
we're going to put this on the glycolic

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.250 
we're going to put this on the glycolic
acid<00:01:01.670> basically<00:01:02.240> will<00:01:02.390> get<00:01:02.630> rid<00:01:02.810> of<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.050> dead

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
acid basically will get rid of the dead

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.350 
acid basically will get rid of the dead
layers<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.250> skin<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.640> superficial<00:01:05.119> dead

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
layers of the skin the superficial dead

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.709 
layers of the skin the superficial dead
layers<00:01:05.950> so<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.340> TCA<00:01:07.969> can<00:01:08.270> penetrate

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
layers so that the TCA can penetrate

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:14.200 
layers so that the TCA can penetrate
better<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:10.719> this<00:01:11.719> part<00:01:12.399> is<00:01:13.399> pretty

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
better and this part is pretty

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.569 
better and this part is pretty
comfortable<00:01:14.810> if<00:01:15.109> there's<00:01:15.499> any<00:01:15.740> stinging<00:01:16.399> it's

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
comfortable if there's any stinging it's

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.510 
comfortable if there's any stinging it's
minimal<00:01:17.179> you<00:01:17.749> just<00:01:18.049> leave<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.439> glycolic<00:01:19.069> acid

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
minimal you just leave the glycolic acid

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.239 
minimal you just leave the glycolic acid
on<00:01:19.700> for<00:01:20.149> a<00:01:20.179> minute<00:01:20.539> or<00:01:20.659> two<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.229> then<00:01:21.409> we<00:01:22.100> will

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.249 
on for a minute or two and then we will

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.749 
on for a minute or two and then we will
actually<00:01:22.460> neutralize<00:01:23.359> it<00:01:23.659> with<00:01:23.689> just<00:01:24.759> saline

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
actually neutralize it with just saline

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.139 
actually neutralize it with just saline
so<00:01:26.569> after<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:26.990> TCA<00:01:27.679> peel<00:01:28.749> the<00:01:29.749> patient<00:01:30.259> normally

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
so after a TCA peel the patient normally

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.889 
so after a TCA peel the patient normally
experienced<00:01:32.149> there's<00:01:32.299> quite<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.539> bit<00:01:32.780> of

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
experienced there's quite a bit of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.410 
experienced there's quite a bit of
healing<00:01:33.319> within<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.310> day<00:01:34.490> or<00:01:34.520> two<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:35.149> skin

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
healing within a day or two the skin

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.349 
healing within a day or two the skin
turns<00:01:35.689> brown<00:01:36.109> and<00:01:36.439> then<00:01:37.219> that<00:01:37.399> skin<00:01:37.759> peels<00:01:38.060> off

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
turns brown and then that skin peels off

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.359 
turns brown and then that skin peels off
it's<00:01:38.689> like<00:01:38.899> if<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:39.200> had<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> really<00:01:40.130> bad

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
it's like if you had a really bad

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.149 
it's like if you had a really bad
sunburn<00:01:40.789> type<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.990> appeal<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.920> sting

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
sunburn type of appeal so the sting

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.569 
sunburn type of appeal so the sting
comes<00:01:43.429> off<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:43.990> little<00:01:44.990> pieces<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.709> sheets<00:01:46.310> of

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
comes off and little pieces of sheets of

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.859 
comes off and little pieces of sheets of
you<00:01:47.149> know<00:01:47.270> skin<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:50.090> need<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.450> keep<00:01:50.659> the

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
you know skin and you need to keep the

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.270 
you know skin and you need to keep the
skin<00:01:51.139> quite<00:01:51.469> a<00:01:51.530> bit<00:01:51.829> lubricated<00:01:52.549> moisturize

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
skin quite a bit lubricated moisturize

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.999 
skin quite a bit lubricated moisturize
and<00:01:55.569> stay<00:01:56.569> on<00:01:57.499> the<00:01:57.829> Sun<00:01:58.479> for<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> good<00:01:59.840> week<00:02:00.049> okay

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
and stay on the Sun for a good week okay

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.039 
and stay on the Sun for a good week okay
so<00:02:01.069> now<00:02:01.459> we're<00:02:01.670> going<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:01.939> put<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.329> TCA<00:02:02.779> on

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
so now we're going to put the TCA on

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.739 
so now we're going to put the TCA on
this<00:02:03.709> is<00:02:03.889> the<00:02:04.100> chemical<00:02:04.969> that<00:02:05.149> I<00:02:05.209> mentioned

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
this is the chemical that I mentioned

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.809 
this is the chemical that I mentioned
gives<00:02:05.959> you<00:02:06.109> a<00:02:06.139> deeper<00:02:06.619> peel<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.279> this<00:02:07.459> is<00:02:07.670> the

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
gives you a deeper peel and this is the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.960 
gives you a deeper peel and this is the
part<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.600> is<00:02:09.009> usually<00:02:10.009> a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
part that is usually a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.460 
part that is usually a
quite<00:02:12.900> stinging<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.810> nerve<00:02:19.050> blocks

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
quite stinging and the nerve blocks

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.460 
quite stinging and the nerve blocks
hopefully<00:02:20.070> will<00:02:20.220> help<00:02:20.810> minimize<00:02:21.810> any

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
hopefully will help minimize any

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.440 
hopefully will help minimize any
discomfort<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.460> we<00:02:23.580> also<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.210> fan

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
discomfort but we also have the fan

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.630 
discomfort but we also have the fan
going<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.110> we'll<00:02:25.260> be<00:02:25.410> putting<00:02:25.620> ice<00:02:25.950> packs<00:02:26.340> on

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
going and we'll be putting ice packs on

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.850 
going and we'll be putting ice packs on
as<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.780> applied<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.470> TCA<00:02:29.430> peel<00:02:30.380> we<00:02:31.380> need<00:02:31.620> to

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
as we applied the TCA peel we need to

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.630 
as we applied the TCA peel we need to
wait<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.710> how<00:02:34.710> much<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.130> chemical

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
wait and see how much the chemical

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.850 
wait and see how much the chemical
penetrates<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.750> tell<00:02:37.350> how<00:02:37.530> much<00:02:37.710> it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
penetrates and tell how much it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.970 
penetrates and tell how much it
penetrates<00:02:38.460> by<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.790> fresh<00:02:39.240> thing<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:40.170> we

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
penetrates by the fresh thing that we

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.400 
penetrates by the fresh thing that we
see<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.520> skin<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.180> starts<00:02:43.080> getting

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
see on the skin so it starts getting

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.900 
see on the skin so it starts getting
white<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.910> we<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.450> try<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.690> get<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.050> uniform

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
white and we just try to get a uniform

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.700 
white and we just try to get a uniform
frosting<00:02:48.410> all<00:02:49.410> around<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.890> skin<00:02:51.350> once<00:02:52.350> we<00:02:52.560> get

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
frosting all around the skin once we get

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.950 
frosting all around the skin once we get
a<00:02:52.770> medium<00:02:53.190> frosting<00:02:53.910> then<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.420> know<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.600> we

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
a medium frosting then we know that we

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:03.430 
a medium frosting then we know that we
got<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.170> medium<00:02:56.010> depth<00:02:56.280> chemical<00:02:57.050> peels<00:03:01.430> okay

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
got a medium depth chemical peels okay

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.170 
got a medium depth chemical peels okay
so<00:03:04.440> that's<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.980> she's<00:03:05.250> getting<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.700> really<00:03:05.880> nice

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
so that's it she's getting a really nice

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.430 
so that's it she's getting a really nice
uniform

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
uniform

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.180 
uniform
frosting<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:09.020> this<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.350> end<00:03:10.560> point<00:03:10.950> of

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
frosting and this is the end point of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.340 
frosting and this is the end point of
the<00:03:11.460> procedure<00:03:12.090> we're<00:03:12.450> just<00:03:12.690> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.960> hold<00:03:13.170> a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
the procedure we're just going to hold a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.800 
the procedure we're just going to hold a
little<00:03:13.590> bit<00:03:13.710> more<00:03:13.950> ice<00:03:14.100> packs<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:15.570> is

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
little bit more ice packs this is

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.150 
little bit more ice packs this is
equivalent<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.700> doing<00:03:17.700> six<00:03:18.570> or<00:03:18.810> more<00:03:19.160> mild

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
equivalent to doing six or more mild

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.500 
equivalent to doing six or more mild
peels<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:22.860> one<00:03:23.190> treatment<00:03:23.490> it's<00:03:24.240> quite

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
peels and so one treatment it's quite

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.390 
peels and so one treatment it's quite
effective<00:03:26.330> are<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.480> doing<00:03:27.750> Brenda<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:29.010> wasn't

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
effective are you doing Brenda it wasn't

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.960 
effective are you doing Brenda it wasn't
too<00:03:29.520> bad<00:03:29.730> with<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> nerve<00:03:30.270> blocks<00:03:31.190> great<00:03:32.190> okay

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
too bad with the nerve blocks great okay

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.250 
too bad with the nerve blocks great okay
so<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:34.940> frosting<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> white<00:03:36.300> discoloration

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
so this frosting the white discoloration

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.930 
so this frosting the white discoloration
and<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.530> see<00:03:37.740> will<00:03:37.890> go<00:03:38.070> away<00:03:38.190> within<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.700> next

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
and you see will go away within the next

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.170 
and you see will go away within the next
couple<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.959> hours<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.590> there<00:03:41.190> will<00:03:41.370> primarily

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
couple of hours and there will primarily

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.960 
couple of hours and there will primarily
be<00:03:42.630> just<00:03:42.959> some<00:03:43.140> redness<00:03:43.620> which<00:03:44.610> then<00:03:44.850> again

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
be just some redness which then again

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.890 
be just some redness which then again
turns<00:03:45.390> into<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.810> brown<00:03:46.940> discoloration<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.810> a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
turns into a brown discoloration and a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.990 
turns into a brown discoloration and a
couple<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.320> days<00:03:49.500> which<00:03:49.830> then<00:03:50.130> will<00:03:50.520> peel<00:03:50.820> off

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
couple of days which then will peel off

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.890 
couple of days which then will peel off
