00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
goes D minor C G to D and then you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.110 
goes D minor C G to D and then you
repeat<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.610> D<00:00:47.940> minor<00:00:49.070> C<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:50.940> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
repeat that D minor C and I would just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
repeat that D minor C and I would just
do<00:00:51.590> whole<00:00:52.590> notes<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.219> point<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:54.030> D<00:00:54.800> now

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
do whole notes at this point to D now

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
do whole notes at this point to D now
we're<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.309> into<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> verse<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
we're going to go into the verse now the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.240 
we're going to go into the verse now the
only<00:00:58.020> thing<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.500> different<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
only thing that's different about the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
only thing that's different about the
verse<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.760> instead<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.120> ending<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> D<00:01:00.989> major

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
verse is instead of ending on a D major

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.100 
verse is instead of ending on a D major
we<00:01:01.710> end<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> D<00:01:02.340> minor<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.539> kept<00:01:03.690> E<00:01:03.840> minor

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we end on a D minor so we kept E minor

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.810 
we end on a D minor so we kept E minor
the<00:01:04.379> truth<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.920> matter<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:06.530> C

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.970 

that's<00:01:11.450> your<00:01:11.690> D<00:01:11.870> minor<00:01:12.140> then<00:01:12.410> you<00:01:12.500> repeat<00:01:12.800> that

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
that's your D minor then you repeat that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.840 
that's your D minor then you repeat that
D<00:01:13.280> minor<00:01:14.230> C<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:17.420> then<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:17.780> go<00:01:18.230> to<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.980> G<00:01:19.340> and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
D minor C and then you go to the G and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.530 
D minor C and then you go to the G and
then<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.330> D<00:01:20.480> minor<00:01:20.720> does<00:01:21.380> that<00:01:21.530> make<00:01:21.680> sense

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
then the D minor does that make sense

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.880 
then the D minor does that make sense
now<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:23.600> go<00:01:23.930> into<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.260> pre-course

point<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:15.980> can't<00:02:16.160> remember<00:02:16.340> if<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.519> did<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:16.910> or

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
point I can't remember if I did this or

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.560 
point I can't remember if I did this or
this<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.230> then<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> borrowed<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:20.239> second

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
this and then I borrowed it the second

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.120 
this and then I borrowed it the second
time<00:02:20.600> around<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:21.080> do<00:02:21.290> whatever<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.890> feel

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
time around you do whatever you feel

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.150 
time around you do whatever you feel
like<00:02:22.190> it's<00:02:22.550> comfortable<00:02:23.500> for<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.950> for

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
like it's comfortable for you and for

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.729 
like it's comfortable for you and for
your<00:02:25.220> hands<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.690> that's<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.049> end<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
your hands so that's the end of the

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.410 
your hands so that's the end of the
pre-chorus<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.340> again<00:02:28.549> if<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:28.970> get<00:02:29.209> that

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
pre-chorus and again if you can get that

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.600 
pre-chorus and again if you can get that
you're<00:02:30.290> solid<00:02:30.769> for<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.010> rest<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.400> song

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
you're solid for the rest of the song

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.820 
you're solid for the rest of the song
because<00:02:32.030> it's<00:02:32.209> just<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:33.320> just<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.620> same

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
because it's just a it's just the same

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.530 
because it's just a it's just the same
thing<00:02:34.070> over<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.580> over<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.940> over<00:02:35.060> again<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
thing over and over and over again the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.140 
thing over and over and over again the
chorus<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.739> same<00:02:37.040> thing<00:02:37.430> as<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.790> verse

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
chorus is the same thing as the verse

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.410 
chorus is the same thing as the verse

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
pretty simple as my producer noted that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.210 
pretty simple as my producer noted that
is<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:19.010> same<00:03:19.250> strum<00:03:19.669> for<00:03:20.419> the<00:03:20.510> Black<00:03:20.720> Keys

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
we did a video for that so if you know

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.250 
we did a video for that so if you know
that<00:03:27.239> strum<00:03:27.599> if<00:03:27.720> you've<00:03:27.870> already<00:03:27.989> learned

that strum if you've already learned

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.630 
that strum if you've already learned
that<00:03:28.349> song<00:03:28.560> then<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.769> already<00:03:29.099> know<00:03:29.220> this

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
that song then you already know this

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.000 
that song then you already know this
drum<00:03:29.970> or<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:30.900> you're<00:03:31.230> learning<00:03:31.379> this<00:03:31.709> strum

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
drum or if you're learning this strum

you can go and you can play tighten up I
just<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.239> think<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:36.599> pretty<00:03:36.720> cool<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.680> only

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
just I think it's pretty cool the only

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.460 
just I think it's pretty cool the only
thing<00:03:38.430> left<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.150> outro<00:03:39.810> which<00:03:40.049> goes<00:03:40.290> on

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
thing left is the outro which goes on

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.949 
thing left is the outro which goes on
for<00:03:40.680> quite<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:41.159> while<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.360> same<00:03:42.690> as

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
for quite a while and it's the same as

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.160 
for quite a while and it's the same as
the<00:03:43.260> intro<00:03:43.739> again<00:03:44.280> D<00:03:44.790> minor<00:03:45.409> C<00:03:47.060> G<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.450> then<00:03:48.959> D

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
the intro again D minor C G and then D

the intro again D minor C G and then D
major<00:03:49.440> which<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.159> such<00:03:50.579> a<00:03:50.610> cool<00:03:50.909> little<00:03:50.970> change

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
major which is such a cool little change

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.770 
major which is such a cool little change
D<00:03:52.079> minor<00:03:52.349> C<00:03:53.510> G<00:03:54.510> major<00:03:54.840> D<00:03:55.579> major<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:57.150> again

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
open with whole notes maybe in the

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.520 
open with whole notes maybe in the
second<00:04:11.819> verse<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.629> can<00:04:12.780> go<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:12.989> those<00:04:13.170> all

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
second verse you can go to those all

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.010 
second verse you can go to those all
downstrokes<00:04:17.180> something<00:04:18.180> like<00:04:18.359> that

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.400 

there's<00:04:23.020> not<00:04:23.199> a<00:04:23.260> lot<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:25.660> really<00:04:25.840> do<00:04:26.110> in<00:04:26.229> this

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
there's not a lot to really do in this
