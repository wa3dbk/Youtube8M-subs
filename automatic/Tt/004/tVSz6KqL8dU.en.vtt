00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
finish it on this one maybe hopefully I

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:01:02.220

okay<00:01:03.230> so<00:01:03.290> I<00:01:03.440> really<00:01:03.890> wouldn't<00:01:04.190> waste<00:01:04.400> too<00:01:04.820> much

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
okay so I really wouldn't waste too much

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.550 
okay so I really wouldn't waste too much
time<00:01:05.059> on<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:06.580> one<00:01:07.580> in<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.910> tombs<00:01:08.180> just<00:01:08.420> or<00:01:09.350> the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
time on the one in the tombs just or the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.380 
time on the one in the tombs just or the
one<00:01:09.800> at<00:01:10.310> least<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:13.610> ones<00:01:13.790> are<00:01:13.940> just<00:01:13.970> kind<00:01:14.270> of

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
one at least the ones are just kind of

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
one at least the ones are just kind of
in<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.600> way<00:01:15.070> so<00:01:16.070> just<00:01:16.250> focus<00:01:16.880> on<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.480> shooting

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
in the way so just focus on the shooting

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.520 
in the way so just focus on the shooting
down<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:18.860> two<00:01:19.100> trees<00:01:19.930> those<00:01:20.930> are<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.170> coins

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
down the two trees those are the coins

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.760 
down the two trees those are the coins
that<00:01:21.850> really<00:01:22.850> great<00:01:23.060> game<00:01:23.770> especially

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
that really great game especially

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.680 
that really great game especially
definitely<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:25.550> really<00:01:26.000> want<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.240> focus<00:01:26.420> on

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
definitely you really want to focus on

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.290 
definitely you really want to focus on
please<00:01:27.220> they're<00:01:28.220> actually<00:01:28.580> easier<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:29.060> hit

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
please they're actually easier to hit

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.080 
please they're actually easier to hit
because<00:01:29.479> they<00:01:29.810> move<00:01:30.140> slower<00:01:31.690> there<00:01:32.690> we<00:01:32.869> got<00:01:33.020> 16

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
because they move slower there we got 16

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.950 
because they move slower there we got 16
that's<00:01:35.090> probably<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.540> highest<00:01:35.660> I've<00:01:35.930> ever

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
that's probably the highest I've ever

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.900 
that's probably the highest I've ever
scored<00:01:36.500> on<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.650> round<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:40.580> could<00:01:40.729> have

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
scored on that round and I could have

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.359 
scored on that round and I could have
gotten<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.180> few<00:01:41.390> more<00:01:41.660> I<00:01:42.020> we've<00:01:42.830> done<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.190> last

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
gotten a few more I we've done the last

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.580 
gotten a few more I we've done the last
few<00:01:43.580> hits<00:01:44.740> but<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:45.770> ran<00:01:46.009> out<00:01:46.160> of<00:01:46.220> bullets<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:47.590> so

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
few hits but I ran out of bullets and so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.550 
few hits but I ran out of bullets and so
here<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.160> trick<00:01:49.460> really<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.270> wait<00:01:51.170> for<00:01:51.530> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
here the trick really is to wait for the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.440 
here the trick really is to wait for the
targets<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.070> pop<00:01:52.280> up<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.640> then<00:01:52.790> shoot<00:01:53.090> them<00:01:53.270> in

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
targets to pop up and then shoot them in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.910 
targets to pop up and then shoot them in
the<00:01:53.480> square<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:53.870> you<00:01:54.140> only<00:01:54.320> want<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.650> waste

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
the square and you only want to waste

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.149 
the square and you only want to waste
one<00:01:55.280> bullet<00:01:55.550> on<00:01:55.909> each<00:01:56.060> target<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:57.950> really

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
one bullet on each target this is really

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.630 
one bullet on each target this is really
where<00:01:59.140> where<00:02:00.140> you're<00:02:00.409> supposed<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.130> score

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
where where you're supposed to score

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.070 
where where you're supposed to score
most<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.060> your<00:02:02.210> points<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.810> where<00:02:03.050> I

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
most of your points this is where I

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.900 
most of your points this is where I
usually<00:02:03.380> for<00:02:03.830> most<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:04.159> my<00:02:04.220> points

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.940 

so<00:02:10.910> as<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.120> can<00:02:11.210> see<00:02:11.390> I've<00:02:11.830> practiced<00:02:12.830> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
so as you can see I've practiced a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:27.720 
so as you can see I've practiced a
little<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.760> know<00:02:14.090> with<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.480> last<00:02:14.690> few<00:02:14.960> tries

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.610 

so<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.240> all<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:29.660> making<00:02:30.080> your

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
so you this is all just making your

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.170 
so you this is all just making your
really<00:02:31.160> what<00:02:31.280> you're<00:02:31.370> trying<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.730> do<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.030> make

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
really what you're trying to do is make

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.530 
really what you're trying to do is make
the<00:02:32.330> last<00:02:32.630> round<00:02:32.990> II<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:34.490> then<00:02:35.120> just<00:02:35.300> try<00:02:35.480> to

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
the last round II and then just try to

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.250 
the last round II and then just try to
do<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.900> last<00:02:36.050> round<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:38.330> last<00:02:38.600> round<00:02:38.840> really

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
do the last round this last round really

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.640 
do the last round this last round really
is<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:43.300> if<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.510> do<00:02:44.690> if<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:44.990> do<00:02:45.140> great<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
is the if you do if you do great in the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.020 
is the if you do if you do great in the
last<00:02:45.830> round<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.220> probably<00:02:46.459> won't<00:02:46.730> matter

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
last round I probably won't matter

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.680 
last round I probably won't matter
because<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:49.130> know<00:02:49.280> if<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.970> did<00:02:50.150> terrible<00:02:50.570> on

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
because you know if you did terrible on

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.110 
because you know if you did terrible on
the<00:02:50.810> first<00:02:51.050> two<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.820> really<00:02:52.820> won't<00:02:53.000> matter

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
the first two it really won't matter

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.420 
the first two it really won't matter
because<00:02:53.420> you're<00:02:54.170> supposed<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.590> score<00:02:54.860> most<00:02:55.220> of

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
because you're supposed to score most of

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.250 
because you're supposed to score most of
your<00:02:55.550> points<00:02:55.880> on<00:02:56.110> first<00:02:57.110> round<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.900> we<00:03:00.140> could

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
your points on first round and we could

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.690 
your points on first round and we could
have<00:03:00.350> gotten<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.650> little<00:03:00.680> more<00:03:01.070> but<00:03:01.370> oh<00:03:01.400> well<00:03:01.670> we

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
have gotten a little more but oh well we

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.840 
have gotten a little more but oh well we
got<00:03:02.000> up<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.180> 51<00:03:02.720> on<00:03:02.990> that<00:03:03.170> one<00:03:03.670> that's<00:03:04.670> only

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
got up to 51 on that one that's only

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.400 
got up to 51 on that one that's only
what<00:03:05.740> for<00:03:06.740> away<00:03:06.920> from<00:03:07.130> my<00:03:07.280> high<00:03:07.459> score<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.290> we

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
what for away from my high score so we

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.390 
what for away from my high score so we
only<00:03:09.530> need<00:03:09.860> 9<00:03:09.890> left<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.580> beat<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.970> mission<00:03:12.400> and

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
only need 9 left to beat the mission and

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.759 
only need 9 left to beat the mission and
that<00:03:13.430> should<00:03:13.730> be<00:03:13.760> easy<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.989> always<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.320> always

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
that should be easy so always a always

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.590 
that should be easy so always a always
started<00:03:16.370> out<00:03:16.489> by<00:03:16.670> pointing<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:17.330> little

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
started out by pointing in this little

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.300 
started out by pointing in this little
square<00:03:17.870> right<00:03:18.080> here<00:03:18.140> there's<00:03:19.070> going<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.250> be

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
square right here there's going to be

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.970 
square right here there's going to be
that<00:03:19.519> target<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.000> pops<00:03:20.239> up<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.680> that's<00:03:21.830> a

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
that target that pops up so that's a

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.820 
that target that pops up so that's a
quick<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.310> easy<00:03:22.430> one<00:03:22.820> at<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.420> beginning<00:03:29.830> when

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
quick and easy one at the beginning when

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.710 
quick and easy one at the beginning when
I<00:03:30.920> hate<00:03:31.100> how<00:03:31.250> they<00:03:31.280> pop<00:03:31.940> up<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.360> then<00:03:32.480> pop<00:03:32.690> back

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
I hate how they pop up and then pop back

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.080 
I hate how they pop up and then pop back
in<00:03:33.140> it's<00:03:33.350> really<00:03:33.680> hard<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.160> catch<00:03:34.370> them<00:03:34.580> this

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
in it's really hard to catch them this

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:46.210 
in it's really hard to catch them this
is<00:03:35.239> definitely<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.780> hardest<00:03:35.959> round<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:46.190> we

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
is definitely the hardest round so we

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.699 
is definitely the hardest round so we
only<00:03:46.459> need<00:03:46.790> four<00:03:47.030> left<00:03:49.450> three

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.599 

now<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.739> only<00:03:55.010> need<00:03:55.310> two<00:03:57.280> or<00:03:58.599> actually<00:03:59.599> one<00:03:59.840> now

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
now I only need two or actually one now

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:08.050 
now I only need two or actually one now
and<00:04:01.609> we<00:04:01.760> did<00:04:01.909> it<00:04:02.060> yay<00:04:06.129> then<00:04:07.129> we<00:04:07.280> still<00:04:07.459> have<00:04:07.489> 21

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
and we did it yay then we still have 21

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.610 
and we did it yay then we still have 21
seconds<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:08.599> let's<00:04:08.780> try<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.109> get<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.260> high

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
seconds so let's try and get a high

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:17.529 
seconds so let's try and get a high
score<00:04:10.069> maybe<00:04:11.000> even<00:04:11.299> up<00:04:11.599> to<00:04:11.780> 70<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:17.090> yeah<00:04:17.269> really

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
score maybe even up to 70 so yeah really

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.409 
score maybe even up to 70 so yeah really
the<00:04:18.079> key<00:04:18.289> to<00:04:18.320> this<00:04:18.500> is<00:04:18.889> just<00:04:19.100> practice<00:04:19.549> listen

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
the key to this is just practice listen

the key to this is just practice listen
it's<00:04:20.989> gonna<00:04:21.229> take<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.680> some<00:04:21.949> time<00:04:21.979> to
