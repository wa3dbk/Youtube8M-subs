00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.120 
updated Unreal Engine 4 tutorial in this
one<00:00:06.930> we're<00:00:07.170> going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.440> create<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.680> flashlight

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
one we're going to create a flashlight

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.830 
one we're going to create a flashlight
the<00:00:08.580> flashlight<00:00:08.610> will<00:00:09.120> always<00:00:09.360> point<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
the flashlight will always point in the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.749 
the flashlight will always point in the
direction<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.380> camera<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.710> facing<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.309> we

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
direction the camera is facing and we

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.339 
direction the camera is facing and we
will<00:00:11.910> add<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.210> functionality<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.840> turn<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.230> on

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
will add the functionality to turn it on

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.919 
will add the functionality to turn it on
and<00:00:13.559> off<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:14.969> quick<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.240> easy<00:00:15.330> so

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
and off so it's really quick and easy so

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.019 
and off so it's really quick and easy so
let's<00:00:16.080> begin<00:00:16.520> okay<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.760> first<00:00:17.880> thing

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
let's begin okay so the first thing

we're going to do is add our action
mappings<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.550> our<00:00:20.699> flashlight<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.840> we're

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
mappings for our flashlight so we're

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.720 
mappings for our flashlight so we're
going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> help<00:00:22.260> set<00:00:22.470> edit<00:00:22.740> project<00:00:23.550> settings

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
character will come to components and we

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.099 
character will come to components and we
can<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.129> add<00:00:56.460> component<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.180> add<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
camera so we're going to add component

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.410 
camera so we're going to add component
and<00:01:08.720> add<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> camera<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.090> jump<00:01:15.270> in

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
not moving up and down so to do that we

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.930 
not moving up and down so to do that we
just<00:01:21.980> simply<00:01:22.520> attach<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:25.160> spotlight<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
camera and we close this go back in and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.110 
camera and we close this go back in and
now<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:30.980> flashlight<00:01:31.430> is<00:01:31.550> looking<00:01:31.820> exactly

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
now the flashlight is looking exactly

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.700 
now the flashlight is looking exactly
where<00:01:32.540> our<00:01:32.930> camera<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.470> pointing<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:36.530> set

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710
