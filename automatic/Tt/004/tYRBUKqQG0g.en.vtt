pinnacle of automotive engineering jobs

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.570 
pinnacle of automotive engineering jobs
really<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:20.030> Formula<00:01:20.420> One<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:21.710> degree<00:01:22.130> here

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
really is Formula One and a degree here

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.010 
really is Formula One and a degree here
at<00:01:22.610> Sussex<00:01:23.120> so<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.390> really<00:01:23.630> kind<00:01:23.960> of

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
working when we believe you I'm now

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
working when we believe you I'm now
looking<00:01:30.920> at<00:01:31.220> how<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.500> measure<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:34.220> creativity

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
looking at how to measure the creativity

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.190 
looking at how to measure the creativity
that<00:01:34.940> somebody<00:01:35.360> would<00:01:35.480> show<00:01:35.720> or<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.170> a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
that somebody would show or that a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.660 
that somebody would show or that a
computer<00:01:36.620> system<00:01:37.010> which

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
computer system which

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.730 
computer system which
it's<00:01:38.119> also<00:01:38.390> helping<00:01:38.930> us<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.320> think<00:01:39.500> about

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
it's also helping us to think about

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.590 
it's also helping us to think about
whether<00:01:40.549> machines<00:01:40.939> can<00:01:41.119> actually<00:01:41.450> be

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
whether machines can actually be

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.600 
whether machines can actually be
creative<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.439> measuring<00:01:43.100> them<00:01:43.220> against<00:01:43.520> the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
creative and measuring them against the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.770 
creative and measuring them against the
example<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.090> we've<00:01:44.270> got<00:01:44.450> which<00:01:44.630> is

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
example that we've got which is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.289 
example that we've got which is
ourselves<00:01:45.770> being<00:01:46.340> bright<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.000> there's<00:01:47.180> so

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
ourselves being bright and there's so

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.240 
ourselves being bright and there's so
much<00:01:47.450> going<00:01:47.659> on<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.259> music<00:01:48.590> scene<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:49.009> great

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
much going on the music scene is great

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.100 
much going on the music scene is great
