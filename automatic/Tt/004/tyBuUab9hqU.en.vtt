00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello this video I'll show you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.620
 some models of sports dampers 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.280
 I'm rodrigo and you're in yours. 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.280
 draws 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.869
 here I only have some models I go 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.760
 speak some of their characteristics 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.590
 so it will get easier you chose 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 a model to supply the car 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.660
 all these damper models they are 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.570
 universally applicable ie they will 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.579
 serve on any car model but 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.739
 before choosing your damper 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.690
 choose the model by aesthetics 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.370
 You'll have to watch for space. 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.920
 enough for him 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.180
 that is, if you are not going to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.059
 Damn it big here in a car 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 too small for this to exist 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.850
 compact dampers like this 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.020
 which will serve perfectly local 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.030
 minors 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.460
 after noting if the space is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.710
 enough is only you to choose your 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.840
 tip you will choose for your taste 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.740
 by the aesthetic or that most matches with 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.420
 your car 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.750
 here we have two models with 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.299
 invisible tip or contain the mother who 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.979
 these are the tips that look like 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.070
 burned that gives a touch of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.619
 aggressiveness in the car has this one with 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.189
 double-outlet nozzle that is well 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.070
 very good sportsman and also has this 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.119
 that the model flattened her tip is 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.189
 flatter 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.400
 I particularly like 10 more because 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.299
 gives a touch of modernity elegance 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.250
 in the car 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.369
 still talking about aesthetics you go 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.490
 find is dampers with the whole body 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.220
 produced a noc and you will also find 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.700
 dampers with the body produced in 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.040
 This is a lot of carbon fiber. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.040
 nice but it will only be useful if it 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 to be apparent, otherwise there is no reason why 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.210
 Do you put a favor in that crash? 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.360
 he is very handsome 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.820
 Now we'll talk a little bit about 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.330
 performance the larger the diameter of the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.640
 more severe muffler body but its sound 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.220
 but this will not depend either alone 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.770
 depending on the model of the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.480
 his car and also his motorization 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.950
 not that a car 1.0 for example 1.0 does not 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.080
 It will get legal. Snoring will change a lot. 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 will be super sporty 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.830
 but if it's a 2.0 car a v8 some 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.670
 thing will change much more will stay 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.980
 well more sporty with ok but because that 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.770
 the sport damper makes this sound more 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.500
 than the original damper 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.480
 see this example gases coming out of 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.630
 motor between a damper through this pipe 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.390
 they leave it because these holes 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.640
 inside the resonator camera provoke it 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.310
 pressure from these others. 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.920
 holes that exit through the outlet tube 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.890
 this process causes the noise 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.019
 more muffled but the engine loses a 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.060
 power because of this 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.780
 pressure that is caused within the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.090
 chamber 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.480
 in the case of the gas sports damper 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.220
 pass without causing pressure and 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.860
 this will generate some horses of 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.440
 power plus your car but rodrigo 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.660
 this back where it engages in the car 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.950
 different in my case will it be 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.260
 right indeed 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.390
 This is a very frequent question but 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.400
 you do not need to worry when 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.769
 you take the sports damper to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.660
 make the installation the professional that 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.760
 will do this situation he will manufacture 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.280
 an extender that extender it will 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.250
 embedded aquino sport damper and 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.310
 soldier in his original exhaust or 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.959
 connection will not solder this 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.269
 connection will not only then when you 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.840
 You want to take it, you can take it without any 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.510
 problem and the value of these tensors it 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.650
 already included is in the installation many 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.660
 times actually 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.790
 so when you take it you can 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.739
 ask if it's already included 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.930
