use those legs first off I'm going to
pull<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.920> hand<00:02:30.130> off<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.700> don't<00:02:30.820> have<00:02:31.030> to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
pull the hand off and you don't have to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.180 
pull the hand off and you don't have to
do<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:32.200> I'm<00:02:32.290> going<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.530> put<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.920> arms

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190

forward

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
forward

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.600 
forward
then<00:02:35.200> what<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.470> can<00:02:35.590> what<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:35.980> could<00:02:36.130> do<00:02:36.310> is

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
then what you can what you could do is

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.810 
then what you can what you could do is
you<00:02:37.180> take<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.570> legs<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:39.100> rotate<00:02:39.640> them

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
you take the legs just rotate them

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.740 
you take the legs just rotate them
straight<00:02:40.660> back<00:02:40.870> like<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:42.000> then<00:02:43.000> fold<00:02:43.510> them

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
straight back like this then fold them

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.630 
straight back like this then fold them
up<00:02:43.900> behind<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.500> head<00:02:44.710> like<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:47.220> now<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.280> can

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
up behind the head like that now you can

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.880 
up behind the head like that now you can
you<00:02:49.570> could<00:02:49.660> choose<00:02:49.930> not<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.350> point<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.740> feet

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
you could choose not to point the feet

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.260 
you could choose not to point the feet
up<00:02:51.070> like<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.400> but<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:52.030> do<00:02:52.150> that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
up like that but I like to do that

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.820 
up like that but I like to do that
because<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.750> makes<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.080> looks<00:02:53.260> like<00:02:53.410> he<00:02:53.680> has

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
because it makes it looks like he has

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.520 
because it makes it looks like he has
missiles<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.520> then<00:02:55.330> there's<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.720> some<00:02:56.170> eret

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
missiles and then there's a some eret

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.150 
missiles and then there's a some eret
room<00:02:57.010> in<00:02:57.190> here<00:02:57.610> for<00:02:57.810> these<00:02:58.810> pegs<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.620> plug<00:02:59.890> in

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
room in here for these pegs to plug in

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.380 
room in here for these pegs to plug in
and<00:03:00.430> then<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.820> just<00:03:01.120> plug<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.710> legs<00:03:03.390> it

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
and then you just plug in the legs it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.000 
and then you just plug in the legs it
doesn't<00:03:04.780> really<00:03:04.900> matter<00:03:05.140> how<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.470> plug<00:03:05.740> it<00:03:05.890> in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
doesn't really matter how you plug it in

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.540 
doesn't really matter how you plug it in
just<00:03:06.280> get<00:03:06.460> them<00:03:06.580> in<00:03:06.670> there<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:08.160> there<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:09.340> go
