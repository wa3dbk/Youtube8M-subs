00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.379

 hd for those who do not know what chdk is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.740
 the program is a program that was 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.060
 created with a society of enthusiasts she 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:30.529
 canon camera memory is loaded and 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.770
 greatly increases his abilities 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 the functionality appears very much 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.780
 features first shows on 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.399
 The screen is with us or the battery charge and you can 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.200
 install additional script 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:51.020
 which let us use 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.390
 camera as a motion sensor 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.629
 motion appeared frame he made a series 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.090
 snapshots or included video recording can 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.100

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.630
 timelapse 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 but the functionality is very very competent 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.850
 list a very long time better go on 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.729
 chdk link website will be under this video 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 and read what it is and how much 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.990
 how much is really useful here 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.140
 and the program I want without this 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.700
 the program does not represent a peak at all 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:33.520
 camera because well, very useful 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.290
 so chdk 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.850
 this is the program i emphasizes they 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.950
 firmware many say that this 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.369
 alternative firmware is not a firmware 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.390
 That is, you can not spoil the camera 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.440
 last resort if something is not 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.900
 it turned out he hung well, quite simply 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.380
 pull the memory card out of the camera and 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.650
 all of them from the device becomes again 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.860
