00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.580
 the first prototype of it performed 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.980
 dump truck with remote 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:29.550
 we will present it differently in April 10 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.560
 when the machine is able to do everything 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.950
 operations that demonstrated 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.960
 today the only flaw is the table on 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.480
 control range of such a machine 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.900
 essentially limited in size 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.220
 over the past two years 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.980
 the theme was developed precisely in the direction 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.680
 even more automation control 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.799
 machine we already started calling him 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.960
 robots and today really is 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.580
 first demonstrated wide 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.760
 to the public 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.730
 possibility is fat itself 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.020
 perform those tasks that would 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.940
 at least once to all means not 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.740
 career operations such as launch 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.740
 engine start braking 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 of management 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.689
 management is all the car u pushed 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.899
 independently on that program for 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.750
 which villa is pre management 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.799
 still happens pre 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.789
 car passes a man behind 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:38.729
 remembers the route and already using 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:41.970
 satellite navigation controlled 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.470
 a repetition of the porcelain that is laid 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.689
 in memory, the degree of automation is such that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.110
 the operator only needs to intervene 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:57.020
 when e100 occurs today 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.650
 But with the modernization that we 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.890
 such 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.450
 even finish 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.969
 thirteenth year 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.209
 we expect to have power on 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:14.180
 release of 2000 units 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:18.739
 mining dump trucks including up to 800 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.739
 semantic voids under 100 tons and above 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.140
 slightly behind our competitor 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.500
 and caterpillar information and tyrex 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.940
 such dump trucks 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.940
 expect me 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.470
 10 years in competition wearing 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.470
 collectible 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.090
 the rival didn't develop this car 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.930
 so she had her chip 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.209
 she was made electromechanical 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.569
 really counting on the fact that 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.739
 benefits such as 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:03.460
 cost of ownership and labor 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.630
 maintenance almost 30 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.290
 in electric cars 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.550
 less than 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.060
 clinically 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.060
 do n't care
