00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
because I don't want to disturb the UV

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.749 
because I don't want to disturb the UV
curing<00:01:26.119> properties<00:01:26.749> of<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.170> resin<00:01:27.770> it's<00:01:28.549> not

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
like a regular like two part epoxy resin

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.779 
like a regular like two part epoxy resin
where<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.319> throw<00:01:33.979> all<00:01:34.130> kinds<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.549> things

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
where you can throw all kinds of things

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.539 
where you can throw all kinds of things
in<00:01:34.999> there<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.479> then<00:01:35.749> it'll<00:01:35.929> cure<00:01:36.259> this<00:01:37.039> resin

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
in there and then it'll cure this resin

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.870 
in there and then it'll cure this resin
needs<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.240> be<00:01:38.359> hit<00:01:38.539> by<00:01:38.719> UV<00:01:39.079> light<00:01:39.289> so<00:01:39.770> if<00:01:40.069> you're

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
needs to be hit by UV light so if you're

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.669 
needs to be hit by UV light so if you're
going<00:01:40.999> to<00:01:41.060> put<00:01:41.270> inclusions<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.170> you've<00:01:42.469> got

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
going to put inclusions in it you've got

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:43.749 
going to put inclusions in it you've got
to<00:01:42.770> make<00:01:42.890> sure<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.249> they're<00:01:43.399> small<00:01:43.729> enough

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
to make sure that they're small enough

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.480 
to make sure that they're small enough
that<00:01:44.499> they're<00:01:45.499> not<00:01:45.649> going<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:45.889> interfere<00:01:46.100> with

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
that they're not going to interfere with

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.570 
that they're not going to interfere with
the<00:01:46.609> curing

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.150 

so<00:01:51.580> now<00:01:51.730> I've<00:01:51.880> mixed<00:01:52.150> it<00:01:52.450> in<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:53.200> I'm<00:01:53.920> just

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
so now I've mixed it in and I'm just

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.860 
so now I've mixed it in and I'm just
making<00:01:54.490> sure<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.700> it's<00:01:55.030> floating<00:01:55.420> around<00:01:55.510> in

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
making sure that it's floating around in

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.890 
making sure that it's floating around in
there<00:01:56.020> nicely<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:58.210> going<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.570> make<00:01:58.750> sure

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
there nicely and I'm going to make sure

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.780 
there nicely and I'm going to make sure
to<00:01:59.050> clean<00:01:59.230> my<00:01:59.470> tool<00:01:59.740> because<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.250> wouldn't<00:02:00.580> want

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
to clean my tool because I wouldn't want

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.240 
to clean my tool because I wouldn't want
the<00:02:00.940> UV<00:02:01.240> resin<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.720> cure<00:02:01.960> on<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.470> I'm<00:02:03.100> going

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
the UV resin to cure on it and I'm going

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.990 
the UV resin to cure on it and I'm going
to<00:02:03.310> take<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.610> outside<00:02:04.530> onto<00:02:05.530> my<00:02:06.460> florida

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
piece like so and I think I'll probably

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.729 
piece like so and I think I'll probably
turn<00:04:02.640> this<00:04:02.700> into<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.209> pendant<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.870> was<00:04:04.379> thinking

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
turn this into a pendant I was thinking

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.259 
turn this into a pendant I was thinking
about<00:04:04.829> making<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.340> ring<00:04:05.579> too<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.940> could<00:04:09.090> make<00:04:09.209> a

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.099 
neat a ring easily by embedding a hoop
of<00:04:11.370> wire<00:04:11.579> that<00:04:11.909> you<00:04:12.030> can<00:04:12.209> then<00:04:12.360> wrap<00:04:12.629> around<00:04:12.959> a

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
of wire that you can then wrap around a

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.199 
of wire that you can then wrap around a
mandrel<00:04:13.349> and<00:04:13.620> size<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:17.430> now<00:04:17.609> let's<00:04:17.940> talk

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
mandrel and size it so now let's talk

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.060 
mandrel and size it so now let's talk
about<00:04:18.269> how<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.780> get<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.079> shine<00:04:19.350> back<00:04:19.380> on<00:04:19.949> the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
about how to get the shine back on the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.159 
about how to get the shine back on the
surface<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.669> piece<00:04:20.910> I'm<00:04:21.690> just<00:04:21.959> going<00:04:22.139> to

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
surface of the piece I'm just going to

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.990 
surface of the piece I'm just going to
take<00:04:22.440> my<00:04:22.740> piece<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.340> get<00:04:24.180> my<00:04:24.330> gloss<00:04:24.630> back<00:04:25.020> and

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
take my piece and get my gloss back and

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000 
take my piece and get my gloss back and
throw<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.030> little<00:04:27.240> ring<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.139> it<00:04:28.289> onto<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.740> high

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
throw a little ring of it onto the high

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.610 
throw a little ring of it onto the high
points<00:04:30.260> just<00:04:31.260> by<00:04:31.320> hand<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.840> find<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.020> when<00:04:34.320> I

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
points just by hand I find that when I

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.800 
points just by hand I find that when I
do<00:04:34.740> pieces<00:04:35.400> like<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:35.789> this<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.330> best<00:04:36.570> way

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
do pieces like this this is the best way

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.689 
do pieces like this this is the best way
to<00:04:36.870> make<00:04:37.139> them<00:04:37.289> really<00:04:37.590> shiny<00:04:37.979> on<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.430> front

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
to make them really shiny on the front

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.100 
to make them really shiny on the front
and<00:04:40.100> then<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.310> can<00:04:41.460> also<00:04:41.610> do<00:04:41.910> selective<00:04:42.600> areas

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
and then you can also do selective areas

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.900 
and then you can also do selective areas
like<00:04:43.410> I'm<00:04:43.680> just<00:04:44.010> going<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.220> put<00:04:44.280> little<00:04:44.610> rings

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
like I'm just going to put little rings

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.690 
like I'm just going to put little rings
around<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.419> petals<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.340> allow<00:04:47.340> everything

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
around the petals and allow everything

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.320 
around the petals and allow everything
else<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.300> be<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:49.349> not<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:49.860> shiny<00:04:50.130> finish<00:04:50.430> now

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
else to be the not so shiny finish now

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.870 
else to be the not so shiny finish now
if<00:04:51.630> you<00:04:51.810> had<00:04:52.020> less<00:04:52.320> texture<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.370> could<00:04:53.550> stand

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
if you had less texture you could stand

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.500 
if you had less texture you could stand
it<00:04:54.090> also<00:04:54.510> it'll<00:04:54.900> work<00:04:55.260> with<00:04:55.500> a<00:04:55.970> very<00:04:56.970> high<00:04:57.240> grit

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
it also it'll work with a very high grit

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.180 
it also it'll work with a very high grit
sandpaper<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:58.320> bring<00:04:58.530> back<00:04:58.710> some<00:04:58.979> of<00:04:59.010> that

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
sandpaper to bring back some of that

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.930 
sandpaper to bring back some of that
shine<00:05:00.380> but<00:05:01.380> i<00:05:01.410> figure<00:05:01.979> the<00:05:02.160> resin<00:05:02.490> sticks<00:05:02.760> to

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
shine but i figure the resin sticks to

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.060 
shine but i figure the resin sticks to
itself<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.539> it<00:05:03.630> cures<00:05:03.870> so<00:05:04.110> quickly<00:05:04.560> why<00:05:04.889> not

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
itself and it cures so quickly why not

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.860 
itself and it cures so quickly why not
just<00:05:05.310> use<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:06.060> shine<00:05:06.599> itself<00:05:07.020> back<00:05:07.289> up<00:05:07.700> and

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
just use it to shine itself back up and

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.379 
just use it to shine itself back up and
it<00:05:09.870> also<00:05:10.020> gives<00:05:10.229> me<00:05:10.620> a<00:05:10.650> chance<00:05:10.949> to<00:05:11.330> allow<00:05:12.330> that

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
it also gives me a chance to allow that

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.839 
it also gives me a chance to allow that
clay<00:05:12.960> you<00:05:13.919> know<00:05:14.010> I've<00:05:14.130> got<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.400> little<00:05:14.610> bit<00:05:14.820> of

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530
