00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
with a brushless said it so I believe he

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.120 
with a brushless said it so I believe he
gonna<00:00:25.999> do<00:00:26.179> a<00:00:26.210> bracelet<00:00:26.599> set<00:00:26.960> up<00:00:27.079> on<00:00:27.259> his<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.099> I

to<00:00:43.600> slide<00:00:44.600> up<00:00:45.019> against<00:00:45.469> my<00:00:45.710> extended<00:00:46.460> tail

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
to slide up against my extended tail

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.840 
to slide up against my extended tail
boom<00:00:46.969> miles<00:00:47.359> this<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:48.079> mill<00:00:48.640> carbon<00:00:49.640> fiber

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
boom miles this is to mill carbon fiber

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.020 
boom miles this is to mill carbon fiber
ah<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:50.480> standard<00:00:51.050> tail<00:00:51.260> boom<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.859> I<00:00:52.250> used<00:00:52.550> a

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
ah a standard tail boom and I used a

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.459 
ah a standard tail boom and I used a
piece<00:00:53.570> of<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:54.019> to<00:00:54.640> slide<00:00:55.640> in<00:00:55.879> here<00:00:56.140> so<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:57.440> a

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
piece of it to slide in here so it a

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.880 
piece of it to slide in here so it a
field<00:00:57.829> lap<00:00:58.210> so<00:00:59.210> it<00:00:59.510> would<00:00:59.660> be<00:00:59.809> secured<00:01:00.739> in

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
field lap so it would be secured in

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.369 
field lap so it would be secured in
there<00:01:01.070> then<00:01:01.309> I<00:01:01.399> took<00:01:01.460> some<00:01:01.760> CA<00:01:01.999> glue<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.660> glue

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
there then I took some CA glue and glue

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.219 
there then I took some CA glue and glue
around<00:01:03.679> the<00:01:04.070> edges<00:01:04.369> of<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:05.449> also<00:01:05.570> glued<00:01:06.020> at

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
around the edges of it and also glued at

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.300 
around the edges of it and also glued at
the<00:01:06.259> little<00:01:06.619> hole<00:01:06.770> right<00:01:06.799> here<00:01:07.299> um<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:09.310> what's

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
the little hole right here um and what's

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.249 
the little hole right here um and what's
so<00:01:10.460> good<00:01:10.670> about<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:11.119> if<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.360> motor<00:01:11.600> goes<00:01:11.930> up

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
so good about it if the motor goes up

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.030 
so good about it if the motor goes up
you<00:01:12.770> can<00:01:12.950> unplug<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.670> right<00:01:14.479> here<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.409> take

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
you can unplug it right here and take

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.760 
you can unplug it right here and take
the<00:01:16.130> motor<00:01:16.340> out<00:01:16.869> plug<00:01:17.869> another<00:01:18.200> motor<00:01:18.500> in<00:01:18.740> it

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
the motor out plug another motor in it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.039 
the motor out plug another motor in it
and<00:01:19.130> there<00:01:20.119> you<00:01:20.240> have<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.479> um<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:22.240> flew<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.479> did<00:01:24.020> a

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
and there you have it um I flew it did a

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.520 
and there you have it um I flew it did a
test<00:01:24.320> flight<00:01:24.500> on<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.220> it<00:01:26.060> works<00:01:26.360> great<00:01:26.659> it

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
test flight on it and it works great it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.319 
test flight on it and it works great it
works<00:01:27.829> rid<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.280> age<00:01:28.460> see<00:01:28.790> I<00:01:28.820> got<00:01:29.090> enough

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
works rid of age see I got enough

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.030 
works rid of age see I got enough
clearance<00:01:29.630> here<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.200> that's<00:01:30.649> without<00:01:30.829> the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
clearance here and that's without the

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.249 
clearance here and that's without the
battery<00:01:31.369> sitting<00:01:32.060> in<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.719> I<00:01:32.750> got<00:01:33.020> enough

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
battery sitting in it so I got enough

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.649 
battery sitting in it so I got enough
clearance<00:01:33.560> here<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.159> everything<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.299> I<00:01:35.329> kept

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
clearance here and everything so I kept

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.690 
clearance here and everything so I kept

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
the blade the tail the tail blade the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.179 
the blade the tail the tail blade the
same<00:01:37.939> link<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.360> didn't<00:01:38.659> cut<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:38.960> there<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:39.860> it

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
same link I didn't cut it there but it

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.469

how I fly and it flies good i have like
ninety<00:01:51.799> percent<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.869> travel<00:01:53.869> on<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:55.670> arm

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
ninety percent of travel on this arm

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.929 
ninety percent of travel on this arm
heli<00:01:56.630> now<00:01:56.899> for<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.680> four

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
heli now for the four

heli now for the four
tribal<00:02:00.939> adjustments<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:02.079> brushless<00:02:02.380> upgrade

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
tribal adjustments the brushless upgrade

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.609 
tribal adjustments the brushless upgrade
works<00:02:03.460> great<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:04.149> think<00:02:04.750> eflite<00:02:05.200> should<00:02:05.439> come

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
works great I think eflite should come

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.460 
works great I think eflite should come
up<00:02:05.829> with<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.340> version<00:02:06.549> brushless<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.600> really

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
up with the version brushless I really

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.170 
up with the version brushless I really
do<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:09.399> works<00:02:09.700> great<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:11.370> using<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.790> S<00:02:12.970> or

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
do it works great and using the S or
