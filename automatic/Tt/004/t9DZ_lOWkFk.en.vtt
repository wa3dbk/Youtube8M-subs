00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.440
 professionals and welcome to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.780
 be a further follow last 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.699
 minecraft today in this episode it goes 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.710
 Minecraft figures you can at 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.090
 animals or even small male be there 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.369
 We are here from our construction team member 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 Wake in 21 pieces provided 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.180
 I have the parts in two parts 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.890
 that means this longer bath 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.090
 deals with the animals below 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.800
 other bathroom deals 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.910
 mainly with the mario figures 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.350
 could be for one or the other 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.760
 be very cool and interesting 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.620
 So I do not want to hesitate for a long time 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.329
 let's start directly yes that's here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 just a few example animals and long ago 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.940
 not all of them would be fine 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.590
 if he does some more in the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.640
 So comments would write which 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.410
 can offer themselves but in times 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.329
 miniature form to build but now for 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.340
 first animal what a hai should represent 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.860
 or a cat shark year at least one 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.239
 is built quite small and therefore large 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.309
 narrow and has a wide open mouth 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.989
 in it , snow, so to speak, sets the teeth 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.820
 there are a few more 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.410
 mini heads that represent the eyes 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.850
 should definitely get sick 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.049
 dangerous from age but otherwise 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.909
 If we had a curved one there 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.380
 tail and a very long nose 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.090
 yes and the underground you have here with 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.710
 different blog decorated around that yet 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.450
 to make that a bit more authentic 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.460
 second copy is also an underwater 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.350
 animal and represents a krake, so to speak 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.060
 this compared to the anna right 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.799
 of course he has her sick ones 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 fishing arms made of wool and clay 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.610
 are the big head of it too 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.229
 it matters because you have to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.850
 so to speak the cartoon form 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.080
 then you can imagine such animals 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.369
 the fastest eyes are completely 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.990
 plain with black carbon blocks 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.119
 held although I do not remember 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.530
 if the eyes have it but it fits 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.329
 Nevertheless, the next small one is pure 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.829
 animal is a mouse or rather sooner 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.600
 In any case you have a mouse cengiz 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.729
 here the succinct nose and feet 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.200
 both expanded and kept very bright 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.030
 the eyes are small button eyes 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.140
 shown again with mini heads 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.820
 and last but not the one 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.680
 tail forgot this one very much 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.600
 long is the dark brown color highlights 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.189
 from the rest of the next 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 we have the seals in small and 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.060
 great design has the small version 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.790
 a mini head a claim block and a 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.590
 level as body and brown carpet as 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.290
 fins of it there are two whole pieces 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.060
 hero amateurs age but what else to me 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.250
 more interesting was the big robbe 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.599
 looks an overly big cartoonist 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.000
 he has the head of course 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.710
 fit 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.420
 quartz fangs and tied on the side 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.220
 as eyes the back part is rather 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.790
 standard but as thought-provoking belief 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.040
 I'm fine 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.440
 the crawl comes next 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.780
 Constructed almost of acacia wood and a 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.550
 bit surrounded with clay are the legs 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.620
 the small stilts and represented with 2 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.270
 which is okay with the reality 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.740
 that's why it 's okay 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.810
 In addition, one would have a smaller one 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.970
 Armor from half steps on the head 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.560
 the crab or yet cancer i know it 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.880
 Not at all, but you could say that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.410
 I remember number six is ​​one 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.209
 Gorilla looks in my opinion too 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.610
 really funny but also here were 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.080
 again trains of reality observed such as 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.870
 a big pregnant head the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.700
 clenched fists and the color change in the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.200
 the body also runs the ears 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.970
 live here with heads made that 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.320
 next and at the same time more dangerous 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.959
 Tiers also shown here again 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.000
 though who is silly more dangerous either 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.190
 so nel the gorilla that disengages or 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.930
 keep crocodile that is aggressive me 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.280
 will interest your opinion but now 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.320
 continue with the crocodile which 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.970
 Sandstone stages as teeth owns one 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.200
 very flat back and the splayed 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.640
 Here again, the picture is very good 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.320
 I always hop through the moor 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.880
 next animal and that simple 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.440
 Snail the snail has a big one 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.820
 green armor the man is not built around 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.470
 This is because she became something 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.970
 shown diagonally so is the snail 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.400
 is built up a little better and will 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.110
 not so static and square come to it 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.850
 her eyes are not really any 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.500
 but eyes are still through this 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.790
 Buttons should be suggested here 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.380
 Also make sure that the students 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.820
 not too long because that's in 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.080
 neither of the reality nor what 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.790
 Of course, just with a snail 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.170
 not to be missed is the mucus the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.670
 you have here with gray glass plain 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.350
 represented a color change in the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.940
 armor is also here on so 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.590
 has the snail once green and one 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.030
 light green clay blocked we come now 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.560
 but to the next animal and that is 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.970
 this time a flying yes this 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.560
 Bat is just in flight 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.390
 represented and has quartz , so to speak 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.040
 stages as fangs this sting 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.049
 every case out just as well 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.489
 the lava in the eye is striking 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.320
 looks really dangerous in any case 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.910
 but it's cool with a little mouth 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.799
 black wood is also included and 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.209
 even large watches made of black clay are 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.680
 installed here maybe what for build 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.750
 in itself is again very important is the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.370
 color change so the color changes in the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.110
 Run the bat backwards always 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.670
 brighter the whole thing goes almost to the 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.530
 feet and from it we look at each other 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.209
 the next thing is, so to speak 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.979
 a flying machine but rather a special one 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.479
 bird or just a flying parrot 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.370
 Well, in any case you will find here 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.410
 but again many elements again 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.970
 Here is the head a bit bigger and also 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.840
 the flights are a bit different 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.100
 behind 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.990
 then there are , so to speak, individual 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.220
 feathers that continue to spread away from it 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.080
 below the bird stands out 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.610
 oranges feet out and a long one 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.380
 tail pulls out as it were 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.880
 Steering stability from the body to after 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.620
 back through the we leave that way 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.790
 stand and come to a butterfly 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.770
 I think that's really interesting 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.270
 because the body itself is minimalist 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.550
 that is , it is maintained 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.500
 theoretically go four blocks and five blocks 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.030
 a fence but otherwise procured 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.530
 of course the wings are immense 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.060
 I think you need an impression of that 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.180
 do not say much I just fly 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.919
 so around it so zac and here we are 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.360
 already at the next animal and that flies 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.860
 also really is even smaller and 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.450
 poses a bee or wasp, so to speak 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.010
 there through the sting on the abdomen 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.690
 I rather guess on a wasp's 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.669
 Wasps are here with yellow and brown ones 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.139
 claim blocks laminated and have small 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.120
 wings yes they are really 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.470
 pretty small and with colored glass 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.330
 represented there would still have the 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.950
 found body but when I'm so through 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.900
 look directly at the next animal 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.430
 and that's a ladybug that 's the one 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.510
 roughly presented and the effect comes 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.310
 only if you are a bit further away 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.080
 flies in the end really judge 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.400
 over the ground here and it does not stand that 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.550
 I want to say do that again something 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.660
 authentic and otherwise there is 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.280
 therefore not so much to say 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.039
 the one can recreate the really good 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.080
 penultimate animals what should that be me 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.270
 think of a kind of exe has a green 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.889
 Coloring and many individual pink 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.240
 the back of glass panes as 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.440
 You can also use the eyes here 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.970
 Mouth was simply omitted but 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.830
 The feet are a bit more for that 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.570
 pronounced so you have individual nonsense 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.789
 Gradually used the claws better 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.650
 display that's it as far as this and 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.990
 now to the last animal for this first 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.490
 half of the last of his minecraft 16 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.410
 success that recognizes I believe right 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.970
 Of course this is a breeze through the long 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.070
 neck and long legs he has ostrich 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.539
 a predestined form that leaves 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.710
 I also find myself very good neighbors 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.599
 here at I recommend as in the example 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.000
 These fences are still out there 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.710
 four blocks consist of the body and the 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.570
 wings of course these had snow 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.250
 again something refreshing in the end 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.690
 a cool construction and leaves 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.220
 of course in every app so a bit 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.690
