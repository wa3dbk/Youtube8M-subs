00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
time to cook that and when I'm turning a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.559 
time to cook that and when I'm turning a
fish<00:03:32.950> with<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.310> much

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
fish with this much

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.679 
fish with this much
on<00:03:34.659> the<00:03:34.780> fan<00:03:35.489> I'm<00:03:36.489> going<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.790> tilt<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.150> pan<00:03:37.420> to

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
on the fan I'm going to tilt the pan to

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.839 
on the fan I'm going to tilt the pan to
me<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:37.959> way<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.620> oil<00:03:38.799> runs<00:03:39.430> down<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.700> the

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
me this way so the oil runs down to the

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.270 
me this way so the oil runs down to the
bottom<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.810> when<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.019> flip<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.319> over<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:42.010> doesn't

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
bottom so when I flip it over it doesn't

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.360

splash<00:03:42.549> all<00:03:42.819> over<00:03:42.849> me<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.290> burn<00:03:47.590> myself<00:03:47.799> less

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
splash all over me so I burn myself less

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:57.599 
splash all over me so I burn myself less
that<00:03:48.700> way<00:03:55.650> well<00:03:56.650> that's<00:03:56.799> a<00:03:56.889> nice<00:03:57.069> color<00:03:57.370> on

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609

that way well that's a nice color on
that<00:03:57.760> side<00:03:58.030> isn't<00:03:58.269> it<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.900> can<00:03:59.049> see<00:03:59.230> it

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
that side isn't it and you can see it

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.259 
that side isn't it and you can see it
