00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.710 
practice for very long time even at
night<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:13.799> neighbors<00:01:14.159> won't<00:01:14.400> hear<00:01:14.610> me

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.420 

so<00:01:18.720> oh<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.380> loud<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.040> plug<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.310> into

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.090 
the computer what's your favorite thing
about<00:01:35.430> playing<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> drums<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.560> like<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
about playing the drums I like that the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.030 
about playing the drums I like that the
drums<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:39.270> such<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> big<00:01:40.170> part<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> band

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
drums are such a big part of the band

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
drums are such a big part of the band
but<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.549> think<00:01:41.700> people<00:01:41.850> realize<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.509> if

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
but I don't think people realize that if

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.469 
but I don't think people realize that if
you<00:01:43.290> listen<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.829> song<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.700> take<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you listen to a song and you take the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.510 
you listen to a song and you take the
drums<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.290> such<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> dramatic<00:01:47.070> change

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
drums out it's such a dramatic change

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.560 
drums out it's such a dramatic change
and<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.250> being<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.299> huge

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and so I like that it's being a huge

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.600 
and so I like that it's being a huge
part<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> band<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.770> drive

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
part of the band and you have to drive

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.730 
part of the band and you have to drive
the<00:01:53.820> band<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.780> drummer<00:01:55.079> sets<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the band because the drummer sets the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.679 
the band because the drummer sets the
time<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> drummer<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.119> all<00:01:57.240> over<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
time so if the drummer is all over the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:32.900 
time so if the drummer is all over the
place<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.619> mess<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.670> entire<00:01:59.759> song

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.390 

do<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.000> have<00:02:34.150> any<00:02:35.280> funny
