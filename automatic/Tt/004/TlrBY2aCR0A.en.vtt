00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
how to do this cuz there we're having

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.390 
how to do this cuz there we're having
trouble<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:21.110> while<00:02:21.650> you're<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.980> go<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.160> go

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
trouble so while you're to go to go

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.150 
trouble so while you're to go to go
properties<00:02:22.880> again<00:02:23.440> then<00:02:24.440> go<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.650> Sharon<00:02:24.980> and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
properties again then go to Sharon and

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.039 
properties again then go to Sharon and
then<00:02:25.670> uncheck<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.360> internet<00:02:26.870> connection

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
then uncheck that internet connection

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.020 
then uncheck that internet connection
sharing<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:29.230> everything<00:02:30.230> should<00:02:30.350> be<00:02:30.410> fine<00:02:31.030> so

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
sharing and everything should be fine so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.110 
sharing and everything should be fine so
press<00:02:32.239> ok

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.390 

and<00:02:36.629> now<00:02:37.340> click<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:39.200> net<00:02:40.200> who<00:02:40.890> are<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.069> local

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
and now click this net who are the local

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.800 
and now click this net who are the local
area<00:02:41.640> connection<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.209> wireless<00:02:42.510> network

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
area connection in the wireless network

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.559 
area connection in the wireless network
connection<00:02:43.200> now<00:02:43.800> has<00:02:44.010> bridge<00:02:44.250> connection<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
connection now has bridge connection so

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.360 
connection now has bridge connection so
it<00:02:45.690> should<00:02:45.840> take<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.590> little<00:02:46.890> while<00:02:47.040> like

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
it should take like a little while like

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.699 
it should take like a little while like
a<00:02:47.550> minute<00:02:47.910> 2<00:02:48.060> minutes<00:02:48.360> as<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.349> see<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
a minute 2 minutes as you can see the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.740 
a minute 2 minutes as you can see the
network<00:02:49.890> has<00:02:50.160> been<00:02:50.190> bridge<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:51.599> still

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
network has been bridge but it's still

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.160 
network has been bridge but it's still
waiting<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.260> moment<00:02:53.299> now<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.720> has<00:02:54.930> been

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
waiting at the moment now it has been

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.309 
waiting at the moment now it has been
bridged<00:02:56.090> now<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.330> can<00:02:57.480> see<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.989> network

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
bridged now as you can see the network

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.619 
bridged now as you can see the network
has<00:02:58.500> been<00:02:58.530> bridge<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.510> there's<00:03:00.510> no

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
has been bridge and there's no

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.170 
has been bridge and there's no
connections<00:03:01.080> but<00:03:01.200> now<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> basically

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
connections but now it is so basically

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.400 
connections but now it is so basically
it<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.450> identifying<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.200> network<00:03:04.500> bridge<00:03:04.910> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
it is identifying the network bridge and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.850 
it is identifying the network bridge and
basically<00:03:07.410> you're<00:03:08.190> done<00:03:08.310> right<00:03:08.459> there<00:03:09.380> now<00:03:10.380> as

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
basically you're done right there now as

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.460 
basically you're done right there now as
soon<00:03:11.040> as<00:03:11.099> it's<00:03:11.430> identifying<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.569> my<00:03:13.319> parents

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
soon as it's identifying but my parents

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.900 
soon as it's identifying but my parents
connected<00:03:14.090> huh<00:03:15.410> see<00:03:16.410> now<00:03:16.829> is<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.040> X<00:03:17.220> because

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
connected huh see now is the X because

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.440 
connected huh see now is the X because
Oh

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
Oh

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.910 
Oh
because<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.049> reason<00:03:19.170> why<00:03:19.290> gives<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.560> X<00:03:19.709> is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
because the reason why gives that X is

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.640 
because the reason why gives that X is
because<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.790> X<00:03:20.940> boxes<00:03:21.299> are<00:03:21.420> on<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.959> your

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
because the X boxes are on so your

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.199 
because the X boxes are on so your
network<00:03:22.950> area<00:03:23.370> connection<00:03:23.670> doesn't<00:03:24.150> know

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
network area connection doesn't know

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.880 
network area connection doesn't know
where<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.420> send<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.690> connection<00:03:24.959> at<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.739> your

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
where to send that connection at so your

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.199 
where to send that connection at so your
Wi-Fi<00:03:26.190> works<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.519> your<00:03:26.610> computer<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:27.090> now

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
Wi-Fi works on your computer but now

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:37.800 
Wi-Fi works on your computer but now
your<00:03:27.329> Xbox<00:03:27.690> 360<00:03:28.140> let<00:03:28.769> me<00:03:28.860> turn<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.040> my<00:03:29.160> xbox<00:03:29.430> 360

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.920 

um-hum<00:03:38.810> integer<00:03:39.079> there<00:03:39.890> go<00:03:40.390> do<00:03:41.390> change<00:03:41.659> as<00:03:41.810> you

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
um-hum integer there go do change as you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.030 
um-hum integer there go do change as you
can<00:03:42.049> see<00:03:42.519> change<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.790> wired<00:03:44.150> connection

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
can see change it to a wired connection

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.390 
can see change it to a wired connection
icon<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.640> this<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.420> not<00:03:47.569> connected<00:03:48.400> enabled

icon and this is not connected enabled

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.330 
icon and this is not connected enabled
enable<00:03:50.299> and<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:51.079> network<00:03:51.349> has<00:03:51.469> been<00:03:51.500> rich<00:03:51.769> so

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
enable and the network has been rich so

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.860 
enable and the network has been rich so
