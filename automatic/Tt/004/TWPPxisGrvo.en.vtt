00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:08.189
 so come on 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:13.049
 Look at one end of the sinop connected here 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.580
 the phase sensor and the other end has a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.820
 rotation sensor 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.289
 here you do not need more than two channels 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.670
 in your purchases speak the truth with 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.199
 two channels that work very well with 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.140
 the car is is here on the bottom this one 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.099
 here square wheel sign a sensual 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.460
 of the upstream phase sensor 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.309
 the rotation sensor is a lady like 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.170
 heroes and here through the failure that the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.960
 failure of two teeth of the phonic wheel 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.129
 in this same here there are flaws 2004 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.030
 I'm sorry if he's well framed. 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.030
 look just cool guys 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.410
 then the pm's exactly at fault 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.530
 exactly at fault at the same time I 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.300
 I could see if I had a goal and 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.220
 I could become a hero of failure 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.040
 should to tooth gap 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.550
 are 14 to understand that it is 14 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.710
 of the phase by rotation and 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.840
 I 'm going to build my database too. 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.700
 since the standard car for later I 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.410
 take another car to have the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.260
 base of reference 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:30.360
 then the sea and 2.4 soon on the fault of two 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:33.070
 teeth webart consensus phase exactly 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.470
 He who observes us also has 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.619
 some error in the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.180
 national rotation of his I can be 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.940
 with a dirt in the sensoji of the icms 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.520
 I can could have even a break 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.580
 on the axis I could be with one per day 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.899
 with some training or other training 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.210
 badly fixed 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.119
 I could have a defect that would generate me 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.399
 this form of oil that is cool 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.560
 only that it would be interesting since it is 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.140
 with 2.4 connected here that is frozen to 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.470
 screen we have a pattern is on 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.300
 here but there is another 2.4 here the people 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.190
 can even make a comparison with 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.740
 it we will move the equipment by 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.660
 that person just so you have a notion 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.350
 if the one that is also beating with the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.350
 first test 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.990
 we connect the equipment in the same way 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:32.980
 setting here on the other tide 2.4 and 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.860
 now it will freeze and we can see 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.710
 a difference has a small difference 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.810
 that the 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.810
 we can even fly over the year 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.860
 he already has a difference 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:57.160
 look at the other there is the signal from the sensor 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.280
 well here at the beginning of the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.090
 speaks of two teeth here giving 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.510
 practically in the environment in the door 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.430
 one tooth off and on the timing belt as well 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.220
 cool look that takes a person like 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.569
 equipment detects this failure and 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.519
 just the right way 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.430
 Do you see what it's like to be the hero here? 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.530
 of the sensoji of rotation it is much more 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.230
 regulated that the previous one another 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.519
 creator of the car, right? 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.010
 exactly will always need the 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.840
 reference of the perfect car in the car 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.910
 that we have moved has framed 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.810
 perfectly to know which of the two 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.120
 that's right 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.319
 exactly the tool is very cool 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.599
 very useful 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.819
 quickly without disassembling anything on the 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.650
 car without dismounting so much of 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.510
 back without putting any tools or 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.950
 watch comparator a boring car right? 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.599
 complex two signals the equipment and 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.200
 ready you show your client on time 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.200
 if you need to move on to the belt or not
