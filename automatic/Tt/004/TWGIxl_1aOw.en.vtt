immediately<00:01:03.359> notice<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.019> that's<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.559> my

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
immediately notice that that's not my

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
immediately notice that that's not my
normal<00:01:05.369> discharge<00:01:05.700> graph<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.780> the

other<00:01:07.080> ones<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
other ones on it so I know some of you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.280 
other ones on it so I know some of you
out<00:01:09.270> there<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.689> probably<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.229> be

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
out there are probably going to be

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380 
out there are probably going to be
hoping<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.460> means<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.090> trying

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
hoping that that means that I'm trying

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.730 
hoping that that means that I'm trying
to<00:01:12.420> hide<00:01:12.659> something<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> through<00:01:13.560> some

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
to hide something in it through some

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.010 
to hide something in it through some
conspiracy<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.610> coverup<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.390> that's

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
conspiracy and coverup going on that's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.929 
conspiracy and coverup going on that's
not<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> case<00:01:16.439> at<00:01:16.650> all<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> first

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
not the case at all see when I first

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
not the case at all see when I first
tested<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.259> one<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> these<00:01:20.220> SPC<00:01:21.150> packs<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.840> my

tested out one of these SPC packs on my

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
tested out one of these SPC packs on my
bulb<00:01:23.100> discharger<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.909> same<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
bulb discharger the same way that I

bulb discharger the same way that I
always<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.350> actually<00:01:25.770> posted<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.430> my

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
always do I actually posted it up my

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.600 
always do I actually posted it up my
normal<00:01:27.360> discharge<00:01:28.229> graph<00:01:28.740> which<00:01:28.979> has<00:01:29.009> several

other packs on it for reference and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.200 
other packs on it for reference and
because<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> showed<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.500> SPC<00:01:35.280> pack<00:01:35.520> was

ordered<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.849> new<00:02:08.910> SPC<00:02:09.660> pack<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.140> ordered<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
ordered this new SPC pack I ordered a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.230 
ordered this new SPC pack I ordered a
brand-new<00:02:10.709> gens<00:02:11.489> ice<00:02:11.640> pack

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
brand-new gens ice pack

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.570 
brand-new gens ice pack
a<00:02:12.270> couple<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.990> them<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.320> brought<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.280> Jen's

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
a couple of them I brought this Jen's

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.070 
a couple of them I brought this Jen's
ice<00:02:14.760> pack<00:02:15.030> up<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.510> same<00:02:15.720> number<00:02:16.050> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
ice pack up to the same number of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.830 
ice pack up to the same number of
charges<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.740> had<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.580> SPC<00:02:18.270> pack<00:02:18.540> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
charges that I had on this SPC pack and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.010 
charges that I had on this SPC pack and
then<00:02:18.990> ran<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.590> tests<00:02:19.890> again<00:02:20.430> back<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.630> back<00:02:21.810> at

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
then ran the tests again back to back at

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.470 
then ran the tests again back to back at
the<00:02:22.110> same<00:02:22.350> time<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.890> day<00:02:23.070> using<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.180> most

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
the same time of the day using the most

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960 
the same time of the day using the most
identical<00:02:25.410> testing<00:02:25.860> methods<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.640> could

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
identical testing methods that I could

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.260 
identical testing methods that I could
reasonably<00:02:27.540> pull<00:02:27.900> off<00:02:28.110> literally

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
reasonably pull off literally

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.960 
reasonably pull off literally
back-to-back<00:02:30.270> one<00:02:31.020> then<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.920> other<00:02:31.970> getting

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
back-to-back one then the other getting

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.970 
back-to-back one then the other getting
them<00:02:33.090> as<00:02:33.210> close<00:02:33.450> as<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.750> could<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.200> also<00:02:34.470> put

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
them as close as I could and I also put

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.180 
them as close as I could and I also put
in<00:02:35.220> line<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.850> Novak's<00:02:36.690> entry<00:02:37.200> data<00:02:37.500> logger<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
in line a Novak's entry data logger to

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.850 
in line a Novak's entry data logger to
confirm<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.510> relative<00:02:40.080> positions<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.710> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
confirm the relative positions of the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.950 
confirm the relative positions of the
two<00:02:41.010> curves<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.700> also<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.120> confirm<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.780> both

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
two curves and also to confirm that both

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.230 
two curves and also to confirm that both
packs<00:02:43.470> were<00:02:43.740> being<00:02:44.010> drained<00:02:44.400> at<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.000> same

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
packs were being drained at the same

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.990 
packs were being drained at the same
rate<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.200> that's<00:02:46.440> how<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.710> got<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.640> chart

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
rate and that's how I got this chart

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.730 
rate and that's how I got this chart
here<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.900> reason<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.230> I'm<00:02:49.380> not<00:02:49.410> putting

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
here and the reason that I'm not putting

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.920 
here and the reason that I'm not putting
the<00:02:50.070> scale<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.880> there<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> voltage<00:02:51.480> scale<00:02:51.780> is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
the scale on there the voltage scale is

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.360 
the scale on there the voltage scale is
because<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.170> don't<00:02:52.440> want<00:02:52.620> anyone<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.100> try<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
because I don't want anyone to try to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.060 
because I don't want anyone to try to
compare<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.330> other<00:02:54.800> discharge<00:02:55.800> graphs

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
compare this to other discharge graphs

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.560 
compare this to other discharge graphs
that<00:02:56.190> I've<00:02:56.370> posted<00:02:56.550> before<00:02:56.910> because<00:02:57.480> you

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
that I've posted before because you

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.840 
that I've posted before because you
cannot<00:02:57.990> compare<00:02:58.500> them<00:02:58.680> they're<00:02:59.010> not<00:02:59.310> under

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
cannot compare them they're not under

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.330 
cannot compare them they're not under

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
these same conditions my previous test

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.670 
these same conditions my previous test
did<00:03:02.550> not<00:03:02.580> have<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.330> data<00:03:03.600> logger<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.170> there<00:03:04.350> it

did not have the data logger in there it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.580 
did not have the data logger in there it

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
regardless as you can see still the gens

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.350 
regardless as you can see still the gens
a<00:03:15.960> pack<00:03:16.290> did<00:03:16.980> hold<00:03:17.250> slightly<00:03:17.940> more<00:03:18.150> voltage

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
a pack did hold slightly more voltage

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.530 
a pack did hold slightly more voltage
throughout<00:03:19.140> its<00:03:19.440> entire<00:03:19.590> charge<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.940> SPC

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
throughout its entire charge but the SPC

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.770 
throughout its entire charge but the SPC
pack<00:03:21.810> being<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.340> 5200<00:03:23.340> which<00:03:23.850> we've<00:03:24.210> now<00:03:24.390> seen

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
pack being a 5200 which we've now seen

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.610 
pack being a 5200 which we've now seen
is<00:03:25.530> actually<00:03:26.340> underrated<00:03:27.330> did<00:03:27.750> last<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.440> little

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
is actually underrated did last a little

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.470 
is actually underrated did last a little
bit<00:03:28.740> longer<00:03:28.830> than<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.460> Jemez<00:03:29.820> ace<00:03:30.000> pack<00:03:30.240> which

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
bit longer than the Jemez ace pack which

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.140 
bit longer than the Jemez ace pack which
is<00:03:30.630> also<00:03:30.810> underrated<00:03:31.590> but<00:03:32.040> regardless<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
is also underrated but regardless the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.050 
is also underrated but regardless the
SPC<00:03:33.630> pack<00:03:33.810> did<00:03:34.140> have<00:03:34.380> more<00:03:34.650> capacity<00:03:35.340> on<00:03:35.460> it<00:03:35.610> so

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
SPC pack did have more capacity on it so

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.880 
SPC pack did have more capacity on it so
does<00:03:36.270> that<00:03:36.300> mean<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.900> gens<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.350> pack<00:03:37.680> is

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
does that mean that the gens a pack is

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.730 
does that mean that the gens a pack is
better<00:03:38.160> than<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.550> SPC<00:03:39.120> pack<00:03:39.390> not<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:40.320> my<00:03:40.470> book

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
better than the SPC pack not in my book

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.440 
better than the SPC pack not in my book
that<00:03:40.980> was<00:03:41.340> only<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.610> beginning<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:42.060> my<00:03:42.210> test

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
that was only the beginning of my test

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.140 
that was only the beginning of my test
next<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.410> actually<00:03:43.560> put<00:03:44.040> both<00:03:44.520> of<00:03:44.550> these<00:03:44.790> packs

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
next I actually put both of these packs

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.210 
next I actually put both of these packs
in<00:03:45.390> back-to-back<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.740> same<00:03:46.980> vehicle

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
in back-to-back in the same vehicle

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.010 
in back-to-back in the same vehicle
under<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.700> same<00:03:48.000> conditions<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.690> actually

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
under the same conditions and actually

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.880 
under the same conditions and actually
drove<00:03:49.320> it<00:03:49.530> on<00:03:49.740> a<00:03:49.770> track<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.400> see<00:03:50.640> how<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.940> felt

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
drove it on a track to see how it felt

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.350 
drove it on a track to see how it felt
and<00:03:52.890> what<00:03:53.070> has<00:03:53.160> become<00:03:53.310> an<00:03:53.670> increasingly

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
and what has become an increasingly

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.450 
and what has become an increasingly
common<00:03:54.870> occurrence<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.890> track<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.430> I
