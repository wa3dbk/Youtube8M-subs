hi<00:00:00.269> I'm<00:00:00.390> Jason<00:00:00.630> Mac<00:00:00.900> Genius<00:00:00.930> and<00:00:01.650> we're<00:00:01.920> going

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hi I'm Jason Mac Genius and we're going

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.830 
hi I'm Jason Mac Genius and we're going
to<00:00:02.100> talk<00:00:02.220> about<00:00:02.370> file<00:00:02.909> sharing<00:00:03.240> today<00:00:03.449> between

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
to talk about file sharing today between

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.340 
to talk about file sharing today between
computers<00:00:04.730> basically<00:00:05.839> to<00:00:06.839> start<00:00:07.080> with<00:00:07.200> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
computers basically to start with the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.709 
computers basically to start with the
external<00:00:07.980> options<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.849> have<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.059> flash<00:00:09.420> drive

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
external options you have a flash drive

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.070 
external options you have a flash drive
which<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.940> usually<00:00:11.940> USB<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.630> look<00:00:12.780> right<00:00:12.900> into

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
which is usually USB to look right into

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.919 
which is usually USB to look right into
a<00:00:13.200> USB<00:00:13.530> port<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:15.150> will<00:00:15.389> allow<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
a USB port and this will allow you to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.210 
a USB port and this will allow you to
transfer<00:00:16.199> files<00:00:16.560> quickly<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.130> easily

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
transfer files quickly and easily

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.400 
transfer files quickly and easily
between<00:00:17.580> computers<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.449> flash<00:00:18.900> drives<00:00:19.199> will

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
between computers and flash drives will

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.130 
between computers and flash drives will
work<00:00:19.590> between<00:00:20.490> macs<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:20.910> pcs<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.960> no

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
work between macs and pcs with no

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.540 
work between macs and pcs with no
problem<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.680> then<00:00:22.859> you've<00:00:23.010> also<00:00:23.130> got

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
problem and then you've also got

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.269 
problem and then you've also got
external<00:00:24.449> storage<00:00:24.720> which<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.439> an<00:00:25.680> actual<00:00:25.949> hard

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
external storage which is an actual hard

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.070 
external storage which is an actual hard
drive<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.720> smaller

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
drive and this is a this is a smaller

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.529 
drive and this is a this is a smaller
two<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> half<00:00:28.859> inch<00:00:29.160> hard<00:00:29.369> drive<00:00:29.539> enclosed

two and a half inch hard drive enclosed
in<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.840> case<00:00:31.230> which<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.650> also<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.790> flash

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
in a case which is also like the flash

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.729 
in a case which is also like the flash
drive<00:00:33.090> bus-powered<00:00:33.809> which<00:00:34.290> means<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.649> when

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
drive bus-powered which means that when

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.010 
drive bus-powered which means that when
you<00:00:34.829> plug<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:36.210> powered<00:00:36.540> by<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.690> bus

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you plug it in it's powered by the bus

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680 
you plug it in it's powered by the bus
on<00:00:37.460> your<00:00:38.460> computer<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.210> don't<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.600> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
