00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
probably have to take a lot of risks in

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.120 
probably have to take a lot of risks in
a<00:04:24.660> show<00:04:24.840> like<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:25.199> yeah<00:04:25.440> absolutely<00:04:25.530> here

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
a show like this yeah absolutely here

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.830 
a show like this yeah absolutely here
you<00:04:26.220> don't<00:04:26.370> take<00:04:26.520> risks<00:04:26.910> it's<00:04:27.120> really<00:04:27.600> hard<00:04:27.750> to

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
you don't take risks it's really hard to

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.760 
you don't take risks it's really hard to
get<00:04:27.930> anything<00:04:28.169> done<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.810> how<00:04:34.229> do<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:34.560> have<00:04:34.650> to

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
get anything done so how do you have to

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.860 
get anything done so how do you have to
infuse<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.370> fronds<00:04:35.610> for<00:04:35.850> so<00:04:36.449> we<00:04:36.570> let<00:04:36.750> that

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
infuse the fronds for so we let that

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.600 
infuse the fronds for so we let that
cook<00:04:36.930> on<00:04:37.260> low<00:04:37.440> heat<00:04:37.470> for<00:04:37.800> about<00:04:37.949> 10<00:04:38.130> minutes

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
cook on low heat for about 10 minutes

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.760 
cook on low heat for about 10 minutes
and<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.630> should<00:04:39.870> get<00:04:40.229> all<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.440> flavor<00:04:40.650> out

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
and that should get all the flavor out

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.230 
and that should get all the flavor out
and<00:04:41.040> then<00:04:41.130> we're<00:04:41.280> going<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.490> strain<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:42.090> and

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
and then we're going to strain it and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.960 
and then we're going to strain it and
when<00:04:42.690> we're<00:04:42.840> done<00:04:42.990> we<00:04:43.199> should<00:04:43.380> have<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:44.520> nice

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
when we're done we should have a nice

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.240 
when we're done we should have a nice
mixture<00:04:45.510> that<00:04:45.780> hopefully<00:04:46.650> has<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.919> flavor<00:04:47.160> a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
mixture that hopefully has the flavor a

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.100 
mixture that hopefully has the flavor a
fennel<00:04:47.610> if<00:04:47.729> you<00:04:47.850> steep<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:48.780> for<00:04:48.960> long<00:04:49.080> enough

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
fennel if you steep it for long enough

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.629 
fennel if you steep it for long enough
kind<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.590> like<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.740> tea<00:04:49.950> are<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.430> paying

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
kind of like a tea are you paying

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.340 
kind of like a tea are you paying
attention<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.300> camera<00:04:51.780> yeah<00:04:52.020> because

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
attention to this camera yeah because
