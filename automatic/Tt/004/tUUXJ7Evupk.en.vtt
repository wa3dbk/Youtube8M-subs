00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
anymore to see the Undertaker when he

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.630 
anymore to see the Undertaker when he
shows<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:30.960> year<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.530> bad<00:01:31.829> excited

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
don't think that his return would be

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.370 
don't think that his return would be
something<00:01:38.429> that<00:01:38.610> would<00:01:38.759> garner<00:01:39.119> all<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:40.140> this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
