00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
never had the close remove there might

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.920 
never had the close remove there might
be<00:00:57.850> a<00:00:57.970> little<00:00:58.090> bit<00:00:58.239> hard<00:01:00.210> remember<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.720> press

be a little bit hard remember to press
all<00:01:02.140> screws<00:01:02.500> on<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.710> side<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.160> make<00:01:03.220> sure<00:01:03.340> not

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
all screws on the side and make sure not

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.080 
all screws on the side and make sure not
to<00:01:03.640> lose<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.010> two<00:01:09.280> screws<00:01:09.580> at<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.790> top

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
to lose for the two screws at the top

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.460 
to lose for the two screws at the top
you'll<00:01:10.300> need<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.660> T<00:01:11.229> 15<00:01:13.170> once<00:01:14.170> you<00:01:14.290> have<00:01:14.380> the

you'll need the T 15 once you have the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.290 
you'll need the T 15 once you have the
two<00:01:14.680> screws<00:01:14.979> out<00:01:15.160> will<00:01:15.759> be<00:01:15.850> as<00:01:15.970> easy<00:01:16.270> as

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
two screws out will be as easy as

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.700 
two screws out will be as easy as
popping<00:01:16.660> out<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.080> entire<00:01:17.320> cluster

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710

once<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.340> remove<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.760> you're<00:01:23.910> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.120> have

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
once you remove it you're going to have

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.710 
once you remove it you're going to have
to<00:01:24.600> wire<00:01:25.530> harnesses<00:01:26.190> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.370> back<00:01:29.570> all<00:01:30.570> right

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
to wire harnesses in the back all right

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.350 
to wire harnesses in the back all right
as<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.080> can<00:01:31.230> see<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.820> how<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:32.970> looks<00:01:33.240> in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
as you can see this is how it looks in

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
as you can see this is how it looks in
the<00:01:33.420> back<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:34.500> remove<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.920> you're<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.190> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the back to remove it you're going to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.210 
the back to remove it you're going to
have<00:01:35.370> to<00:01:35.520> press<00:01:35.790> down<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:37.500> part<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
have to press down on the part here and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.220 
have to press down on the part here and
then<00:01:39.470> flip<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.650> over<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.360> that's<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:43.790> and

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
then flip that over and that's one and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.720 
then flip that over and that's one and
then<00:01:46.230> on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> other<00:01:46.500> side<00:01:46.680> same<00:01:47.520> process

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.040 

all<00:01:52.210> right<00:01:52.390> once<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.720> remove<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.200> put<00:01:53.700> the

all right once you remove it put the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.750 
all right once you remove it put the
make<00:01:56.050> sure<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.350> wire<00:01:56.530> harness<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.520> little

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
make sure the wire harness is a little

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.560 
make sure the wire harness is a little
bit<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.030> back<00:01:58.890> put<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.920> gauge<00:02:00.490> closer<00:02:00.820> so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
bit on the back put the gauge closer so

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.480 
bit on the back put the gauge closer so
the<00:02:01.780> top<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.230> above<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.680> steering<00:02:02.980> wheel<00:02:03.100> and

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
the top is above the steering wheel and

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.730 
the top is above the steering wheel and
simply<00:02:03.940> pull<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.270> out

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.500 

all<00:02:10.130> right<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.430> next<00:02:10.760> step<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.120> there'll<00:02:11.480> be

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
all right the next step is there'll be

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.550 
all right the next step is there'll be
five<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.140> six<00:02:12.460> size<00:02:13.460> t10<00:02:14.240> bed<00:02:14.540> through<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.410> the

five to six size t10 bed through in the
back<00:02:16.750> switch<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.990> t10<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.420> removal

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.370

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
remember try not to lose the screws in

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.080 
remember try not to lose the screws in
place<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.010> side<00:02:42.340> you'll<00:02:43.340> have<00:02:43.460> one<00:02:43.910> on

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
place it to the side you'll have one on

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.660 
place it to the side you'll have one on

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
center up and two at the top if you use

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.320 
center up and two at the top if you use
any<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.480> magnetic<00:03:00.230> Torx<00:03:01.010> heads<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.580> don't

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
any of the magnetic Torx heads I don't

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.430 
any of the magnetic Torx heads I don't
suggest<00:03:02.510> use<00:03:02.960> it<00:03:03.170> because<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.130> magnetic

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
suggest use it because the magnetic

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.870 
suggest use it because the magnetic
might<00:03:06.640> interfere<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.520> last<00:03:10.700> one

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
might interfere and then the last one

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
might interfere and then the last one
flip<00:03:11.150> over<00:03:21.370> alright<00:03:22.370> once<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:22.700> did<00:03:22.850> that

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
flip over alright once you did that

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.200 
flip over alright once you did that
