style<00:00:08.460> tents<00:00:08.910> from<00:00:09.150> our<00:00:09.420> Explorer<00:00:09.929> inch<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
style tents from our Explorer inch the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.410 
style tents from our Explorer inch the
tent<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.340> have<00:00:11.490> here<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.910> our<00:00:12.090> Eclipse

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
tent that we have here is our Eclipse

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.419 
tent that we have here is our Eclipse
500<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.290> what<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.590> show<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.860> will<00:00:14.130> apply<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
500 but what we show you will apply to

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.910 
500 but what we show you will apply to
other<00:00:14.700> tents<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.360> similar<00:00:15.780> style<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.800> we'll

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
other tents of a similar style so we'll

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.290 
other tents of a similar style so we'll
just<00:00:17.039> take<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.220> out<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> bag<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.940> show<00:00:18.000> you

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
just take it out of the bag and show you

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.800 
just take it out of the bag and show you
how<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.690> started

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.050 

so<00:00:26.590> once<00:00:26.770> you<00:00:26.860> have<00:00:26.980> your<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.280> fly<00:00:27.580> sheet<00:00:27.790> lead

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
so once you have your a fly sheet lead

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.030 
so once you have your a fly sheet lead
out<00:00:28.240> into<00:00:28.540> place<00:00:28.750> and<00:00:29.020> we're<00:00:29.740> just<00:00:29.860> going<00:00:29.980> to

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
out into place and we're just going to

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.160 
out into place and we're just going to
assemble<00:00:30.700> the<00:00:30.850> pulls<00:00:31.120> this<00:00:31.720> has<00:00:31.870> made<00:00:32.020> really

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.170 
assemble the pulls this has made really

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.290 
assemble the pulls this has made really
easy<00:00:32.380> because<00:00:32.740> each<00:00:33.250> pole<00:00:33.520> is<00:00:33.760> shot<00:00:33.940> coded

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
easy because each pole is shot coded

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.820 
easy because each pole is shot coded
from<00:00:34.420> one<00:00:34.630> side<00:00:34.840> all<00:00:35.080> the<00:00:35.170> way<00:00:35.260> through<00:00:35.470> to<00:00:35.710> the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
from one side all the way through to the

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.490 
from one side all the way through to the
other<00:00:35.950> with<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.490> shot<00:00:37.120> card<00:00:37.330> there<00:00:37.510> so<00:00:38.170> as<00:00:38.470> I

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
other with the shot card there so as I

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.410 
other with the shot card there so as I
say<00:00:38.710> we'll<00:00:39.490> just<00:00:39.670> put<00:00:39.850> these<00:00:39.970> together<00:00:40.090> and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
say we'll just put these together and

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.500 
say we'll just put these together and
show<00:00:40.690> you<00:00:40.780> what<00:00:40.900> to<00:00:40.930> do<00:00:41.140> next<00:00:41.170> so<00:00:42.150> I<00:00:43.150> know<00:00:43.360> that

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
show you what to do next so I know that

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.700 
show you what to do next so I know that
the<00:00:43.570> poles<00:00:43.780> are<00:00:43.930> assembled<00:00:44.260> we'll<00:00:44.440> just<00:00:44.590> put

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
the poles are assembled we'll just put

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.780 
the poles are assembled we'll just put
them<00:00:44.830> through<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.100> pool<00:00:45.280> sleeves<00:00:45.580> just

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
them through the pool sleeves just

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.610 
them through the pool sleeves just
remember<00:00:46.630> here<00:00:46.780> that<00:00:46.960> some<00:00:47.140> poles<00:00:47.380> will<00:00:47.590> be

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
remember here that some poles will be

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.680 
remember here that some poles will be
color<00:00:47.920> coded<00:00:48.130> to<00:00:48.309> match<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:49.030> color-coded

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
color coded to match the color-coded

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.180 
color coded to match the color-coded
sleeves<00:00:49.840> on<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.260> tent<00:00:50.500> making<00:00:50.830> sure<00:00:50.950> that<00:00:51.100> you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
sleeves on the tent making sure that you

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.310 
sleeves on the tent making sure that you
get<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.460> right<00:00:51.550> one<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.030> right<00:00:52.150> place<00:00:52.480> so

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
get the right one in the right place so

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
get the right one in the right place so
what<00:00:53.440> we're<00:00:53.530> going<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.680> do<00:00:53.800> here<00:00:54.070> is<00:00:54.220> start

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
what we're going to do here is start

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.220 
what we're going to do here is start
with<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.730> two<00:00:54.879> longer<00:00:55.210> poles<00:00:55.420> at<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.780> back<00:00:55.960> to

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
with the two longer poles at the back to

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.930 
with the two longer poles at the back to
create<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.590> dome<00:00:56.770> section<00:00:57.250> of<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.580> tent<00:00:57.790> and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
create the dome section of the tent and

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.020 
create the dome section of the tent and
then<00:00:58.930> we'll<00:00:59.350> show<00:01:00.100> you<00:01:00.129> how<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.489> poles<00:01:00.879> are

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
then we'll show you how the poles are

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.460 
then we'll show you how the poles are
actually<00:01:01.330> attached<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.930> fly<00:01:02.080> sheet<00:01:02.260> from

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
actually attached to the fly sheet from

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:33.179 
actually attached to the fly sheet from
there

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.639 

so<00:01:33.999> you<00:01:34.060> see<00:01:34.270> here<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.479> we<00:01:34.659> have<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:35.079> rain

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
so you see here that we have the rain

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:36.749 
so you see here that we have the rain
coal<00:01:35.920> attached<00:01:36.399> here

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
coal attached here

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.300 
coal attached here
the<00:01:37.149> good<00:01:37.299> idea<00:01:37.569> is<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.840> attach<00:01:38.499> this<00:01:38.740> at<00:01:39.100> this

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
the good idea is to attach this at this

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.249 
the good idea is to attach this at this
point<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:39.819> that<00:01:39.999> M<00:01:40.149> if<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.509> are<00:01:40.780> not<00:01:41.049> tall

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
point so that M if you are not tall

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.450 
point so that M if you are not tall
enough<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:41.500> reach<00:01:41.740> up<00:01:42.009> when<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.280> tent

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
enough to reach up when the tent

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.099 
enough to reach up when the tent
actually<00:01:42.789> pitched<00:01:43.030> you'll<00:01:43.630> find<00:01:43.810> this<00:01:43.899> a<00:01:43.990> lot

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
actually pitched you'll find this a lot

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:54.719 
actually pitched you'll find this a lot
easier

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.219 

so<00:01:55.729> know<00:01:56.119> that<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.359> poles<00:01:56.569> are<00:01:56.749> in<00:01:56.780> place<00:01:57.020> and

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
so know that the poles are in place and

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.719 
so know that the poles are in place and
the<00:01:57.409> wrinkle<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:57.950> attached<00:01:58.249> what<00:01:58.520> we're<00:01:58.609> going

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
the wrinkle is attached what we're going

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.849 
the wrinkle is attached what we're going
to<00:01:58.759> do<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.210> show<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.479> how<00:01:59.749> to<00:02:00.259> attach<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
to do is to show you how to attach the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.709 
to do is to show you how to attach the
poles<00:02:01.280> at<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.549> end<00:02:01.729> onto<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.240> eyelets

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
poles at the end onto the eyelets

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.410 
poles at the end onto the eyelets
well<00:02:02.960> then<00:02:03.109> raise<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.009> pulls<00:02:04.670> up<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:05.149> create

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
well then raise the pulls up to create

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.419 
well then raise the pulls up to create
the<00:02:05.509> dome<00:02:05.659> section<00:02:06.079> at<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.289> back<00:02:06.469> here<00:02:06.709> a<00:02:06.890> good

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
the dome section at the back here a good

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.430 
the dome section at the back here a good
tip<00:02:07.609> is<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.850> start<00:02:08.030> arching<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.140> pole<00:02:09.410> that

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
tip is to start arching the pole that

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.650 
tip is to start arching the pole that
sits<00:02:09.799> on<00:02:09.979> top<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.910> here<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.480> way<00:02:11.629> you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
sits on top of the to here that way you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:23.920 
sits on top of the to here that way you
should<00:02:12.019> find<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.349> little<00:02:12.440> bit<00:02:12.650> easier

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.630 

you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.150 

a<00:02:28.050> note<00:02:29.050> we<00:02:29.170> just<00:02:29.350> repeat<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.680> process<00:02:29.710> with

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
a note we just repeat the process with

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.009 
a note we just repeat the process with
the<00:02:30.310> other<00:02:30.340> pole<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:31.000> create<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.480> dorm

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.509 

so<00:02:37.019> once<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.650> Dom<00:02:37.920> section<00:02:38.340> in

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
so once you have the Dom section in

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.369 
so once you have the Dom section in
place<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> back<00:02:39.269> we<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.569> take<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.110> front

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
place at the back we just take the front

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:58.910 
place at the back we just take the front
Pole<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.129> create<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.940> front<00:02:42.180> porch<00:02:42.510> area

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.860 

so<00:02:59.520> know<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.819> all<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.240> poles<00:03:00.420> are<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:00.630> place

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
so know that all the poles are in place

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.240 
so know that all the poles are in place
and<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.380> free<00:03:01.620> standard<00:03:01.950> structure

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
and you have a free standard structure

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.980 
and you have a free standard structure
what<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:03.510> choose<00:03:03.660> exactly

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
what we can do is just choose exactly

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.720 
what we can do is just choose exactly
where<00:03:04.380> we're<00:03:04.470> going<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.650> pitch<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.040> tent<00:03:05.069> so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
where we're going to pitch the tent so

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.890 
where we're going to pitch the tent so
we'll<00:03:05.819> just<00:03:05.970> do<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.450> then<00:03:06.600> what<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.810> can

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
we'll just do that and then what you can

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.690 
we'll just do that and then what you can
do<00:03:07.020> is<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.350> peg<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.740> back<00:03:07.920> corners<00:03:08.370> once

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
do is just peg the back corners once

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.130 
do is just peg the back corners once
that's<00:03:08.910> done<00:03:09.120> we'll<00:03:09.390> come<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> front<00:03:10.020> and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
that's done we'll come to the front and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:32.470 
that's done we'll come to the front and
peg<00:03:10.440> dots

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.699 

once<00:03:33.480> your<00:03:33.629> peg<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.900> four<00:03:34.050> Chronos<00:03:34.440> we're<00:03:34.590> just

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
once your peg to four Chronos we're just

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.770 
once your peg to four Chronos we're just
going<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.890> roll<00:03:35.069> up<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> door<00:03:35.489> here<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.879> we'll

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
going to roll up the door here and we'll

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.180 
going to roll up the door here and we'll
just<00:03:36.959> take<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.170> bedrooms<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.769> put<00:03:37.950> them<00:03:38.069> in

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
just take the bedrooms and put them in

00:03:38.190 --> 00:04:19.979 
just take the bedrooms and put them in
place

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.300 

once<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.110> bedrooms<00:04:21.440> are<00:04:21.560> in<00:04:21.650> place<00:04:21.829> we're

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
once the bedrooms are in place we're

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.710 
once the bedrooms are in place we're
just<00:04:22.340> going<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.640> take<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.970> groan<00:04:23.420> sheet<00:04:23.600> that

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
just going to take the groan sheet that

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.900 
just going to take the groan sheet that
comes<00:04:23.900> with<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.140> tent<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.560> just<00:04:24.620> pop<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.640> into

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
comes with the tent and just pop it into

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:40.640 
comes with the tent and just pop it into
the<00:04:26.030> front<00:04:26.150> here<00:04:26.330> here

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.129 

so<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.639> final<00:04:41.820> piece<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.270> setup<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.840> do<00:04:42.960> is

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
so the final piece of setup to do is

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.750 
so the final piece of setup to do is
just<00:04:43.410> all<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.800> pegging<00:04:44.100> points<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.580> the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
just all of the pegging points and the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.400 
just all of the pegging points and the
guylines<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.690> we're<00:04:45.780> just<00:04:45.810> going<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.110> roll

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
guylines so we're just going to roll

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.230 
guylines so we're just going to roll
down<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.740> door<00:04:46.919> here<00:04:47.160> or<00:04:47.610> zip<00:04:47.790> down<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.090> door

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
down the door here or zip down the door

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.240 
down the door here or zip down the door
rather<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:48.720> then<00:04:49.440> we'll<00:04:49.560> peg<00:04:49.770> all<00:04:49.979> the<00:04:50.160> way

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
rather and then we'll peg all the way

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.320 
rather and then we'll peg all the way
around<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.550> side<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.970> tent

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
around the side of the tent

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.150 
around the side of the tent
we'll<00:04:51.630> take<00:04:51.780> out<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.050> guylines<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.650> peg<00:04:52.979> them

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
we'll take out the guylines and peg them

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:12.830 
we'll take out the guylines and peg them
into<00:04:53.370> place

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.540 

so<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.870> few<00:05:14.260> hints<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.830> tips<00:05:15.010> for<00:05:15.250> when<00:05:15.430> you're

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
so a few hints and tips for when you're

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
packing the tent away you can see that

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.020 
packing the tent away you can see that
we've<00:05:17.470> already<00:05:17.620> taken<00:05:18.100> up<00:05:18.340> all<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:18.790> pegs

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
we've already taken up all of the pegs

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.150 
we've already taken up all of the pegs
we've<00:05:19.390> rolled<00:05:20.020> up<00:05:20.200> all<00:05:20.320> of<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.500> guy<00:05:20.650> lanes<00:05:20.890> and

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
we've rolled up all of the guy lanes and

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.580 
we've rolled up all of the guy lanes and
removed<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.210> poles<00:05:22.450> and<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:23.200> ground<00:05:23.380> sheet

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
removed the poles and the ground sheet

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.680 
removed the poles and the ground sheet
from<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.920> front<00:05:24.130> what<00:05:25.060> we'll<00:05:25.180> do<00:05:25.300> is<00:05:25.480> show<00:05:25.630> you

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
if you choose actually pack this away

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.220 
if you choose actually pack this away
separately<00:05:31.000> with<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.270> bedroom<00:05:31.660> and<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:32.050> fly

sheet but as I say we'll show you how to

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.080 
sheet but as I say we'll show you how to

good<00:05:37.270> tip<00:05:37.450> here<00:05:37.660> is<00:05:37.810> just<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.050> remember<00:05:38.260> that

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
good tip here is just to remember that

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.780 
good tip here is just to remember that
if<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.680> tent<00:05:38.890> is<00:05:39.040> quite<00:05:39.310> wet<00:05:39.490> when<00:05:39.700> you're

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
if the tent is quite wet when you're

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.460 
if the tent is quite wet when you're
putting<00:05:39.970> away<00:05:40.120> just<00:05:40.510> to<00:05:40.660> dry<00:05:41.080> at<00:05:41.320> your

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
putting away just to dry at your

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.040 
putting away just to dry at your
earliest<00:05:41.650> convenience<00:05:42.420> as<00:05:43.420> I<00:05:43.540> say<00:05:43.690> then<00:05:43.900> we'll

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050
