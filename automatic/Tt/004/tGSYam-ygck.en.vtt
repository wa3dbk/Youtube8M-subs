00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.569 
ever gonna think to look here actually
this<00:01:18.409> probably<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.799> most<00:01:18.920> obvious<00:01:19.340> places

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
this probably the most obvious places

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.819 
this probably the most obvious places
zones<00:01:19.880> gonna<00:01:20.090> try<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.270> look<00:01:20.450> well<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:21.380> guess

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
zones gonna try to look well I guess

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.830 
zones gonna try to look well I guess
this<00:01:22.009> is<00:01:22.189> what<00:01:22.640> can<00:01:22.819> you<00:01:22.909> get<00:01:23.119> wait<00:01:23.509> a<00:01:23.539> second

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
this is what can you get wait a second

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.789 
this is what can you get wait a second
you<00:01:23.899> might<00:01:23.929> be<00:01:24.170> able<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.319> get<00:01:24.499> on<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.770> outside

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
you might be able to get on the outside

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.919 
you might be able to get on the outside
of<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:25.579> there's<00:01:26.270> like<00:01:26.390> there's<00:01:26.569> a<00:01:26.630> hole

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
of this there's like there's a hole

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.450 
of this there's like there's a hole
there<00:01:27.170> I'm<00:01:27.409> thinking<00:01:27.439> maybe<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.069> could<00:01:28.280> get

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
there I'm thinking maybe you could get

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.779 
there I'm thinking maybe you could get
on<00:01:28.700> top<00:01:29.119> of<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:30.039> power<00:01:31.039> cut<00:01:31.369> our<00:01:31.460> trip<00:01:31.700> to

on top of it power cut our trip to
interpret<00:01:32.359> it<00:01:32.509> how<00:01:33.289> oh<00:01:33.319> how<00:01:33.770> could<00:01:33.979> I<00:01:34.100> get<00:01:34.280> on

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
interpret it how oh how could I get on

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.969 
interpret it how oh how could I get on
top<00:01:34.579> of<00:01:34.639> it<00:01:34.850> how<00:01:34.999> about<00:01:35.179> maybe<00:01:36.049> I<00:01:36.469> try<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.799> go

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
top of it how about maybe I try to go
