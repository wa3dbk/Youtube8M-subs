00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
plays that have killed our momentum and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.249 
plays that have killed our momentum and
we<00:01:02.820> feel<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.479> we've<00:01:03.659> talked<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:04.110> already

we feel like we've talked about already
we<00:01:04.799> haven't<00:01:05.129> had<00:01:05.190> that<00:01:05.309> turnovers<00:01:06.060> which<00:01:06.270> are

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
we haven't had that turnovers which are

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
we haven't had that turnovers which are
a<00:01:06.600> tremendous<00:01:07.289> momentum<00:01:07.979> play<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.789> team

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
a tremendous momentum play for your team

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.359 
a tremendous momentum play for your team
and<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.899> can<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.259> really<00:01:11.009> counterproductive

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and they can be really counterproductive

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.999 
and they can be really counterproductive
to<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> team<00:01:12.149> you're<00:01:12.270> playing<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.679> think

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
to the team you're playing so I think

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.520 
to the team you're playing so I think
the<00:01:14.280> turnovers<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:14.909> help<00:01:15.060> us<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.530> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the turnovers will help us with that and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.899 
the turnovers will help us with that and
then<00:01:16.710> making<00:01:17.130> sure<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:17.759> hurt

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
then making sure that we don't hurt

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:33.760 
then making sure that we don't hurt
ourselves<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.539> penalties<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:19.729> turnover

didn't<00:05:43.889> appreciate

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
didn't appreciate

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.019 
didn't appreciate
I<00:05:47.330> know<00:05:47.629> you<00:05:47.749> haven't<00:05:47.990> seen<00:05:48.229> the<00:05:48.379> features

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
maritime road saturday but that show

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.050 
maritime road saturday but that show
national

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.910 

that<00:05:58.060> we<00:05:58.150> talked<00:05:58.630> a<00:05:58.780> while<00:05:58.930> ago<00:05:59.290> about<00:05:59.410> you

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
that we talked a while ago about you

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.640 
that we talked a while ago about you
know<00:06:00.040> that<00:06:00.280> we're<00:06:00.460> willing<00:06:00.790> to<00:06:00.880> give<00:06:01.030> access

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
know that we're willing to give access

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.020 
know that we're willing to give access
probably<00:06:02.650> more<00:06:02.860> so<00:06:03.040> than<00:06:03.250> maybe<00:06:03.400> any<00:06:03.610> program

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
probably more so than maybe any program

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.980 
probably more so than maybe any program
in<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.240> country<00:06:04.360> because<00:06:04.600> I<00:06:04.690> think<00:06:04.750> it's

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
in the country because I think it's

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.590 
in the country because I think it's
important<00:06:05.470> to<00:06:05.650> change<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.670> perception<00:06:07.360> of

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
important to change the perception of

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.900 
important to change the perception of
animal<00:06:08.410> football<00:06:08.740> ethic<00:06:08.980> perception<00:06:09.700> is

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
animal football ethic perception is

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.760 
animal football ethic perception is
probably<00:06:10.720> our<00:06:10.900> biggest<00:06:11.080> challenge<00:06:11.710> to

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
probably our biggest challenge to

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.700 
probably our biggest challenge to
overcome<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.720> every<00:06:13.720> time<00:06:13.960> somebody<00:06:14.500> comes

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
overcome and every time somebody comes

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.710 
overcome and every time somebody comes
in<00:06:14.980> here<00:06:15.340> and<00:06:15.460> leaves<00:06:16.120> with<00:06:16.390> a<00:06:16.420> positive

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
in here and leaves with a positive

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.750 
in here and leaves with a positive
experience<00:06:17.350> and<00:06:17.710> goes<00:06:17.860> out<00:06:18.100> and<00:06:18.310> tells<00:06:18.580> our

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
experience and goes out and tells our

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.760 
experience and goes out and tells our
story<00:06:18.820> to<00:06:19.420> the<00:06:19.510> rest<00:06:19.660> of<00:06:19.810> the<00:06:19.900> world<00:06:20.110> then<00:06:20.740> I

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
story to the rest of the world then I

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.170 
story to the rest of the world then I
think<00:06:21.010> we<00:06:21.130> have<00:06:21.220> a<00:06:21.250> chance<00:06:21.490> to<00:06:21.730> change<00:06:21.910> those

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
think we have a chance to change those

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.060 
think we have a chance to change those
perceptions<00:06:22.690> and<00:06:23.080> I<00:06:23.170> haven't<00:06:23.500> seen<00:06:23.650> this<00:06:23.830> show

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
perceptions and I haven't seen this show

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.860 
perceptions and I haven't seen this show
I<00:06:24.100> heard<00:06:24.670> it's<00:06:24.850> good<00:06:25.000> but<00:06:25.180> I<00:06:25.240> haven't<00:06:25.450> seen<00:06:25.720> it

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
I heard it's good but I haven't seen it

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.660 
I heard it's good but I haven't seen it
I'm<00:06:26.110> hoping<00:06:26.470> it's<00:06:26.740> good<00:06:26.890> because<00:06:27.070> you<00:06:27.250> do<00:06:27.400> take

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
I'm hoping it's good because you do take

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.310 
I'm hoping it's good because you do take
some<00:06:27.910> risks<00:06:28.510> there<00:06:28.660> as<00:06:28.750> well<00:06:28.930> whenever<00:06:29.110> you

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
some risks there as well whenever you

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.110 
some risks there as well whenever you
allow<00:06:29.470> people<00:06:29.710> you<00:06:30.370> know<00:06:30.460> that<00:06:30.640> much<00:06:30.880> access

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
allow people you know that much access

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.110 
allow people you know that much access
to<00:06:31.360> your<00:06:31.570> program<00:06:32.160> you<00:06:33.160> know<00:06:33.280> everybody<00:06:33.730> has

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
to your program you know everybody has

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.510 
to your program you know everybody has
issues<00:06:34.570> everybody<00:06:35.230> has<00:06:35.350> concerns<00:06:35.860> and<00:06:36.070> get<00:06:36.490> a

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
issues everybody has concerns and get a

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.910 
issues everybody has concerns and get a
chance<00:06:36.760> to<00:06:36.880> see<00:06:37.060> those<00:06:37.240> things<00:06:37.450> no<00:06:38.440> place<00:06:38.710> is

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
chance to see those things no place is

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.650 
chance to see those things no place is
perfect<00:06:38.980> but<00:06:39.430> I<00:06:39.490> think<00:06:39.760> the<00:06:39.910> fact<00:06:40.150> that<00:06:40.270> people

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
perfect but I think the fact that people

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.630 
perfect but I think the fact that people
can<00:06:40.780> come<00:06:40.900> in<00:06:41.110> and<00:06:41.230> focus<00:06:41.440> on<00:06:41.830> the<00:06:42.370> real

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
can come in and focus on the real

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.400 
can come in and focus on the real
positive<00:06:43.240> stories<00:06:43.600> that<00:06:43.750> we<00:06:43.870> have<00:06:43.990> gone<00:06:44.200> on

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
positive stories that we have gone on

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.080
