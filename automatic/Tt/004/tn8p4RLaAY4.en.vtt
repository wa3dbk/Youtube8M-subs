00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.430
 today I propose to you to realize 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.930
 a salmon quiche 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.360
 I can tell you that she is very good 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.789
 because I have already tasted for it 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.160
 we need 20 centilitres from the east 20 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.369
 centilitres thick cream 3rd thick 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.580
 about 450 grams of salmon a 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.029
 small bunch of chives with salt and 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.670
 pepper 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.100
 to start we will put our dough 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.489
 in the pie pan for the dough 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.410
 broken 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.800
 do not forget that you can farm 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.390
 and zon by following our recipe 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.670
 we hamm is directly in the mold 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.059
 with the parchment paper we can 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.520
 keep 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.300
 it will be easier to unmould then 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.710
 and I'm new there and with a 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.809
 little fork we will sting the bottom 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.730
 it will prevent the paw from inflating the 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.079
 time we prepare our garniture 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.070
 will still put it in the fridge 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.660
 it will be better 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.260
 to take this moment we will cut it in 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.260
 big dice 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.729
 and now we will prepare what by 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.140
 at home we call migraine it's 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:24.159
 damn the quiche device we go europe 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.159
 break our 3 e 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:37.090
 or failing that was a little bit of 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.280
 then add the thick cream 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.250
 it's the fresh cream that goes with the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.730
 Egg allowing the quiche appliance 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.460
 to be firm but also be pretty 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.480
 unctuous we can possibly note 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.770
 now give away a little whip a 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.030
 once it's mixing well you can 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:03.350
 finish by adding the milk we add the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.880
 chives and we do this with chisel these 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.430
 the chives we put what we 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.440
 unfortunately wants this tax you can 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.280
 really customize it as you 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.540
 want you can change the herbs 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.430
 wholesalers we put a little quantity 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.430
 we want to follow if we like 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.410
 a lot the sigoulette not me I like 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.410
 then we mix again 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.750
 and then of course we season very 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.070
 important otherwise it's going to be fan so 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.590
 salt pepper mix n 1 small 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.850
 blows then we will recover our dough to 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.790
 pie that is in the fridge 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.780
 so here we start with m the salmon in 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.730
 the bottom of the pie 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.010
 we have the little animals under our hands 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.030
 like that and we pay our little 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.590
 miguel often chive tends 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.950
 to want to go back above it is very 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.500
 serious 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.360
 all is well spread out all alone 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.630
 can possibly sprinkled with a little bit of 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.820
 Parmesan cheese or gruyere cheese 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.680
 be careful again if you 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.270
 add cheese is often salty 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.820
 so it's a little bit less your 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.220
 device and then now we stuffed 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.290
 so in our oven preheated to 200 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.800
 degrees for the oven avoid heat 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.560
 favorite rotating rather a mode where 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.450
 your hot oven this by the room it's up to 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.209
 say from below so that the bottom of the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.540
 earth is well cooked or 45 minutes is 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.540
 left 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.760
 1 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.450
 and that's our now ready 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.820
 we will be able to go to the table to cut it 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.820
 and drink started inside 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.140
