pesticides<00:01:54.160> okay<00:01:55.000> but<00:01:55.300> let's<00:01:56.140> say<00:01:56.550> if<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:57.700> go

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
pesticides okay but let's say if you go

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.890 
pesticides okay but let's say if you go
to<00:01:57.910> dinner<00:01:58.120> and<00:01:58.540> all<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.350> had<00:01:59.500> was<00:01:59.530> these<00:01:59.920> just

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
to dinner and all you had was these just

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.030 
to dinner and all you had was these just
vegetables<00:02:01.900> that<00:02:02.110> are<00:02:02.170> grown<00:02:02.530> with<00:02:02.860> whatever

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
vegetables that are grown with whatever

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.470 
vegetables that are grown with whatever
kind<00:02:03.370> of<00:02:03.430> pesticide<00:02:03.820> that's<00:02:04.030> still<00:02:04.240> better

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
kind of pesticide that's still better

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.330 
kind of pesticide that's still better
than<00:02:04.840> eating<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.440> meet<00:02:05.650> with<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.830> pesticides

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
than eating to meet with the pesticides

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.190 
than eating to meet with the pesticides
definitely<00:02:07.090> think<00:02:07.300> about<00:02:07.360> how<00:02:07.840> many<00:02:07.900> times

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
definitely think about how many times
