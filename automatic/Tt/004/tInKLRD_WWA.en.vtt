00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
something around there the reason to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.730 
something around there the reason to
this<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:29.429> Lisa's<00:00:30.179> five<00:00:30.510> our<00:00:30.779> task<00:00:31.199> which

this is that Lisa's five our task which

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.049 
this is that Lisa's five our task which

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
is release snakes from other

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.620 
is release snakes from other
Springfield's<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.050> another<00:00:34.860> town<00:00:35.219> actually

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
Springfield's or another town actually

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.979 
Springfield's or another town actually
she<00:00:36.630> physically<00:00:37.350> goes<00:00:37.739> into<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.600> town<00:00:39.840> of

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
she physically goes into the town of

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.560 
she physically goes into the town of
your<00:00:40.110> choice<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.850> take<00:00:41.850> some<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.450> their

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
your choice and take some of their

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.690 
your choice and take some of their
snakes<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.290> I'm<00:00:43.739> pretty<00:00:44.070> sure<00:00:44.160> she<00:00:44.489> gives

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
snakes and I'm pretty sure she gives

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
snakes and I'm pretty sure she gives
them<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.320> she<00:00:46.320> only<00:00:46.410> takes<00:00:46.590> three<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.129> them

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
them to you she only takes three of them

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.060 
them to you she only takes three of them
but<00:00:48.120> sometimes<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.170> she<00:00:49.440> takes<00:00:49.680> more

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
but sometimes I think she takes more

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.250 
but sometimes I think she takes more
because<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> lot<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> people<00:00:50.760> are<00:00:51.300> saying<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
because a lot of people are saying that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
because a lot of people are saying that
they've<00:00:52.440> gotten<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.890> lots<00:00:53.190> taken<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
they've gotten like lots taken out and I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.600 
they've gotten like lots taken out and I
doubt<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.960> 20<00:00:55.920> people<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.370> sending

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
doubt that like 20 people are sending

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.110 
doubt that like 20 people are sending
their<00:00:56.850> Lisa<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:58.230> specific<00:00:58.530> town<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.879> I'm

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
their Lisa to one specific town so I'm

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.819 
their Lisa to one specific town so I'm
not<00:01:00.300> sure<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.750> think<00:01:01.020> she<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.260> take<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> lot<00:01:01.770> more

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
not sure I think she can take a lot more

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.860 
not sure I think she can take a lot more
than<00:01:02.250> three<00:01:02.609> she<00:01:03.270> might<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.480> able<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.660> take<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
than three she might be able to take a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170 
than three she might be able to take a
lot<00:01:04.199> more<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.400> might<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.850> able<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
lot more but you might only be able to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
lot more but you might only be able to
take<00:01:06.360> 3<00:01:06.659> i'm<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.110> sure<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
much i even even made her do the task

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.660
