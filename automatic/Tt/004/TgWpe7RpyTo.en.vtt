mega tree stand and what I did is I got
rid<00:00:46.420> of<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.690> screws<00:00:47.110> that<00:00:47.469> were<00:00:47.620> letting<00:00:47.890> me

down with traditional tree stands the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.380 
down with traditional tree stands the
screws<00:00:50.440> would<00:00:50.649> either<00:00:50.949> Bend<00:00:51.460> break<00:00:51.789> rust

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
screws would either Bend break rust

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.569 
screws would either Bend break rust
strip<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:52.960> then<00:00:53.140> over<00:00:53.530> goes<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.890> tree<00:00:54.129> I've

gone to a patented clamping system that

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.540 
gone to a patented clamping system that
uses<00:00:57.460> solid<00:00:57.910> nylon<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.829> these<00:00:59.829> will<00:01:00.070> not<00:01:00.219> Bend

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
uses solid nylon and these will not Bend

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.220 
uses solid nylon and these will not Bend
they<00:01:00.760> won't<00:01:00.969> break<00:01:01.269> or<00:01:01.480> anything<00:01:01.899> let<00:01:02.079> you

they won't break or anything let you

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.350 
they won't break or anything let you
down<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.680> three<00:01:03.460> thousand<00:01:03.850> percent<00:01:04.120> more

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
down and three thousand percent more

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.970 
down and three thousand percent more
surface<00:01:04.780> area<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.350> tree<00:01:05.530> trunk<00:01:05.800> is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
surface area of the tree trunk is

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.090 
surface area of the tree trunk is
actually<00:01:06.310> being<00:01:06.520> held<00:01:06.760> onto<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.080> I'm<00:01:08.830> not<00:01:09.040> a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
actually being held onto so I'm not a

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.100 
actually being held onto so I'm not a
very<00:01:09.310> big<00:01:09.550> person<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.450> can<00:01:10.660> do<00:01:10.780> this<00:01:10.930> by

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
very big person and I can do this by

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.020 
very big person and I can do this by
myself<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:12.100> that's<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.580> great<00:01:12.760> thing<00:01:12.820> about

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
myself so that's the great thing about

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.930 
myself so that's the great thing about
this<00:01:13.420> is<00:01:13.660> it's<00:01:13.840> very<00:01:13.900> easy<00:01:14.500> any<00:01:15.010> woman<00:01:15.670> can<00:01:15.790> do

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
this is it's very easy any woman can do

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.430 
this is it's very easy any woman can do
it<00:01:16.060> by<00:01:16.180> herself<00:01:16.300> you<00:01:16.720> don't<00:01:17.080> need<00:01:17.260> your

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
it by herself you don't need your

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.830 
it by herself you don't need your
husband<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:17.980> don't<00:01:18.190> need<00:01:18.340> your<00:01:18.490> man<00:01:18.780> holds<00:01:19.780> a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
husband you don't need your man holds a

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.360 
husband you don't need your man holds a
gallon<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.200> water<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:20.650> it's<00:01:20.830> very<00:01:20.890> very

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
gallon of water and it's very very

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.280 
gallon of water and it's very very
stable<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:24.160> I<00:01:24.190> was<00:01:24.580> actually<00:01:25.000> inspired<00:01:25.780> to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
stable so I was actually inspired to

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.960 
stable so I was actually inspired to
invent<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.860> Omega<00:01:27.190> tree<00:01:27.490> stand<00:01:27.760> when<00:01:27.940> I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
invent the Omega tree stand when I

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.420 
invent the Omega tree stand when I
became<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.480> new<00:01:28.720> mom<00:01:28.960> my<00:01:29.590> daughters<00:01:30.040> burned

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
became a new mom my daughters burned

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.660 
became a new mom my daughters burned
very<00:01:30.640> very<00:01:31.000> close<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.450> Christmas<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.670> my

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
very very close to Christmas and my

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.000 
very very close to Christmas and my
Christmas<00:01:34.120> tree<00:01:34.150> fell<00:01:34.690> over<00:01:34.720> for<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.680> last

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
Christmas tree fell over for the last

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.520 
Christmas tree fell over for the last
time<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.150> thought<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.510> know<00:01:37.600> what<00:01:37.780> not

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
time and I thought you know what not

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.910 
time and I thought you know what not
only<00:01:38.560> is<00:01:38.920> this<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.130> huge<00:01:39.550> mess<00:01:40.230> but<00:01:41.230> it's<00:01:41.710> not

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
only is this a huge mess but it's not

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.500 
only is this a huge mess but it's not
safe<00:01:42.250> if<00:01:42.520> you've<00:01:42.700> got<00:01:42.880> pets<00:01:43.180> or<00:01:43.480> small

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
safe if you've got pets or small

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.690 
safe if you've got pets or small
children<00:01:44.230> it's<00:01:44.680> just<00:01:44.950> not<00:01:45.100> safe<00:01:45.400> to<00:01:45.670> have

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
children it's just not safe to have

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.060 
children it's just not safe to have
something<00:01:46.240> unstable<00:01:46.900> so<00:01:47.560> there<00:01:47.740> we<00:01:47.860> go

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
something unstable so there we go

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.220 
something unstable so there we go
I<00:01:48.250> didn't<00:01:48.670> tie<00:01:48.820> myself<00:01:49.060> but<00:01:49.510> it<00:01:49.600> usually<00:01:49.840> takes

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
I didn't tie myself but it usually takes

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.670 
I didn't tie myself but it usually takes
me<00:01:50.470> 15<00:01:50.680> seconds<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.490> pick<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:51.670> up

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
me 15 seconds to pick that up

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.790 
me 15 seconds to pick that up
it's<00:01:53.830> easy<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:55.000> holds<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.660> gallon<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:56.020> water<00:01:56.230> no

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
it's easy it holds a gallon of water no

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.310 
it's easy it holds a gallon of water no
