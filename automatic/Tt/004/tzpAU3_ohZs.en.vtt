00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.430
 so I mean here in 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.800
 Chemnitz at the Ringerverein man 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.390
 knowledge ringerverein looks outside 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.609
 not so nice to say so 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.109
 the best place to do it here today 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.050
 Of course, spending here is in the 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.369
 ringer hall and yes, we certainly 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.349
 Yesterday we were already in the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.720
 we looked at 106 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.850
 participants and yes as you would expect 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.559
 because of the juniors and was the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.720
 Of course, name teen usually 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.220
 usually only one participant per class 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.809
 even two or three that's called here 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.760
 So there will only be nordic battles 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.010
 which will be on the financial 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.839
 in generation pleasing there we have 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.610
 but a weight class where at least 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.110
 start six or seven participants 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.299
 So here we will be over pool 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.830
 Otherwise, I think 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.040
 the story be around relatively quickly 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.659
 and the disadvantage of this 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.239
 it just has to be district championship 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.130
 but you have to say that has only natural 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.530
 very very few participants are there because 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.960
 many have to prepare themselves, of course 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.579
 or have to participate in the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.409
 ongoing team fighting the 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.670
 back round is already running and we 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.950
 even today have digital home 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.450
 met with quite a bit here 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.670
 they are also a bit on the spot 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.770
 Stress at half past two must be back 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.289
 Back to Talheim is too far from here 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.920
 but at least 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.270
 There are also some there 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.950
 Preparations to meet what we now 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.689
 The youngsters have noticed the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.670
 to struggle here from the thalheim 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.689
 to do not have this evening to have a go 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.359
 nonetheless, fight is a student 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.179
 It's a bit stressful and we are 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.350
 are once again at the organizers 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.579
 ask why here for it 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.899
 apparently also has decided 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.729
 already for several years 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.229
 this district championship here 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.549
 Actually, 2014 already counts in 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.509
 2013 to do here and yes 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.539
 actually in the middle of the 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.969
 Team fighting with his reason 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.100
 and you will accept it 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.380
 that's why, unfortunately, you have to say 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.069
 Of course the number of participants here is something 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.069
 is reduced 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.280
 I have 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.440
 well 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.120
 what German want 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.810
 dpa 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.170
 v 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.929
 rank 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.929
 No 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.990
 Hello you are the one from which club 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.699

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.630
 age group starts today or 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.190
 which weight class the 29 first question 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.830
 was being driven this morning ago has 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.539
 I'm sure so goals and wishes something 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.169
 One would like to have this wish 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:36.270
 fulfilled today or not for vettel so 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.910
 When you ask yourself what rules 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.870
 You 're right, because I have it very much 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.430
 Excited, you knew all the opponents 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.100
 or or just some of today's 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.660
 opponent means there you can get one 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.039
 bit set or on the fight 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.510
 but that does not mean that one does 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.010
 if you think you know the opponent 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.970
 that one says yes I can already 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.099
 you have to keep moving 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.780
 go in and feed in the junk 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.240
 you have to look what they are 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.599
 offers and if I may ask 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.220
 which patients are well occupied today 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.660
 so first so that's yes 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.940
 actually more is not possible 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.510
 That means your dream here today is one 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.740
 gone fulfillment and we have them 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.740

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.740

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.390
 So since 2011 so now 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.720
 already two years and you are now 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.830
 How old did you come to the ring? 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.090
 have you had a buddy or 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.690
 somehow friends or like us 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.560

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:45.540
 my father who was earlier times 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.640

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.680

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.620

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:05.670
