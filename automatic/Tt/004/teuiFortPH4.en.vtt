00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.750
 that the one that my name of July touches tcp 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.260
 and today I have information about the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.480
 high this grand theft auto 5 and also 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.160
 information about this new mode is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.590
 can say that they had created the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.960
 missions and basically that create 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.490
 missions yourself you decide how you 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 He does everything for that, let's talk 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.230
 specifically in the nest and nothing this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.110
 you know why there are hackers and they go 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.420
 to the system to the game code and 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.820
 discover this and I'm going to leave 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.960
 description and that everything 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.179
 I'm going to talk today that basically 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.149
 about those two things and nothing is 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:44.309
 start with the sites this we have gone 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.579
 what is it that matters most of the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.739
 people and this and nothing basically what 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.749
 I have information is from one of the sites 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.699
 which I imagine is a plan several to the 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.749
 once they add one nothing else that would be 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.850
 well study but if this stage is called 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:01.850
 the nats bank ice I do not know how to say it 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.070
 that's what this is called and basically this goes 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.580
 to be the hies and down the map and so that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.820
 see if the map is stolen from a bank 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.940
 and you can choose between being a hacker 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.640
 this the guide or a goldman and I think that 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.050
 there are four if I think there are four like that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.380
 I do not know what the fuck to do fourth 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.200
 but if this and when the mission is over 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.330
 because the money that has him for that 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.800
 apparently they are 180 thousand pesos but the 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.630
 problem is that that money you have to 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.790
 share with your friends so you rehearse 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.830
 only more than 20 thousand pesos each 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.350
 Well, it says here that it's the first time 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.580
 playing there so I do not know if the second 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.000
 time a little more 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.920
 or maybe you are the mini one that you get 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.830
 in this mission so maybe in other 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.259
 in others there is this other truth that 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.040
 I do not know let's see what bell and this and the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.960
 review then you get a thousand 140 that is being 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.390
 there more or less but this the money what 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.120
 I think that is the most important thing 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.400
 a 2 is fine only that is short that 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.039
 You know what you think and so yes 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.160
 we've basically taught the map this one 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.720
 start at the blue dot there are two 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.850
 puntitos a low for which is more 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.110
 down that is where we started and 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.850
 then the one that is a little bit more 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.350
 up that you hardly notice the difference 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.630
 Well, that's where the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.970
 vehicles the cars and that and the one that is 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.130
 well above the blue point then there is 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.100
 where the bank is and it will be stolen and 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.319
 that this and nobody the point where it was 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.940
 active I have no idea what the hell but 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.650
 if this is basically the information 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.060
 that we have about the highs is here in 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.770
 the description the information goes down 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.980
 here have these conversations and all 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.209
 that they are going to have on the heights and everything I 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.030
 I do not know how it will kill people 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.700
 find this but if it is there it is 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.590
 all that information now I'm going to talk 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.300
 about those created from visions that 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.730
 basically if you create your own mission 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.040
 you can catch how many players are going to 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.170
 need for that mission this one go back to 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.090
 be the point of that mission that what 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.800
 they're going to be stealing what I know 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.320
 cocaine 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.100
 we have killing people I do not know what it is 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.800
 what they choose this 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.950
 the minimum level to these forget and the 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.330
 minimum level for what I did is 60 but 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.030
 I imagine that with a friend who is in the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.290
 level 60 you can invite everyone 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.690
 as long as it is one since the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.670
 level 60 all are fine this but if 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.130
 this the creator of missions you can 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.070
 with the level you need to pass that 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.700
 mission this the objective the amount of 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.430
 people who vehicle will start to 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.200
 go to this mission whatever this 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.330
 life I think that they can also 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.910
 raise the life and that this one if they are going to see 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.520
 same day this if you are going to see that it was the 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.800
 fire engine this ambulance and that 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.380
 basically everything they will choose from 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.480
 the routes and that's all I'm going to leave a 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.720
 video in the description that this guy already 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.340
 you can do it even if it's half 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.620
 half bad this one but he can do it 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.420
 basically what to create missions and that 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.370
 they can do everything they wanted 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.440
 speak English that the informal because 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.690
 he likes the video if you liked this 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.520
