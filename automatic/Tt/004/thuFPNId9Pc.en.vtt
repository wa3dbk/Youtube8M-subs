00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and build up that coordination

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
and build up that coordination
eventually<00:00:53.819> you'll<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.120> kind<00:00:54.359> of<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:55.230> doing

eventually you'll just kind of be doing
that<00:00:55.559> without<00:00:55.679> even<00:00:56.039> thinking<00:00:56.069> about<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that without even thinking about it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.130

1 and the 2 and the 3 and the 4 number
to<00:01:32.369> add<00:01:32.640> some<00:01:33.210> eighth<00:01:33.390> notes<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> bass

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
to add some eighth notes on the bass

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.969 
to add some eighth notes on the bass
drum<00:01:34.289> 1<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.340> 2<00:01:35.369> 3<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.869> bold<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.380> number

drum 1 and a 2 3 and the bold and number

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.609 
drum 1 and a 2 3 and the bold and number
three<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.549> where<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.270> eighth<00:01:39.450> rest<00:01:39.869> comes<00:01:40.350> in

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
three is where the eighth rest comes in

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.529 
three is where the eighth rest comes in

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
so on count three you're playing nothing

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.789 
so on count three you're playing nothing
but<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> end<00:01:43.079> you're<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.469> to<00:01:43.560> play<00:01:43.680> the

and I'll speed it up for you number four

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.300 
and I'll speed it up for you number four

are<00:04:02.500> coordination<00:04:03.310> exercises<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.120> they're

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
are coordination exercises so they're

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.210 
are coordination exercises so they're
not<00:04:04.450> all<00:04:04.660> meant<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.110> sound<00:04:05.260> great<00:04:05.650> they're

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
not all meant to sound great they're

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.700 
not all meant to sound great they're
meant<00:04:06.490> to<00:04:06.580> gradually<00:04:07.560> progressively<00:04:08.560> get<00:04:08.680> a

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
meant to gradually progressively get a

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.960 
meant to gradually progressively get a
little<00:04:08.920> more<00:04:09.010> difficult<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.700> build

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
little more difficult and build

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.770 
little more difficult and build
coordination<00:04:11.010> exercises<00:04:12.010> aren't<00:04:12.490> fun<00:04:13.060> but

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
coordination exercises aren't fun but

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.060 
coordination exercises aren't fun but
it's<00:04:13.960> fun<00:04:14.260> after<00:04:14.770> you<00:04:14.860> build<00:04:14.980> that

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
it's fun after you build that

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.500 
it's fun after you build that
coordination<00:04:15.520> because<00:04:15.820> you're<00:04:16.090> able<00:04:16.300> to<00:04:16.390> do<00:04:16.480> a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
coordination because you're able to do a

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:30.180 
coordination because you're able to do a
lot<00:04:16.600> more<00:04:16.810> things<00:04:17.350> so<00:04:18.190> number<00:04:18.370> 9<00:04:18.610> and<00:04:29.190> number

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
lot more things so number 9 and number

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:43.860 
lot more things so number 9 and number
10<00:04:30.610> number<00:04:42.150> 11<00:04:43.150> is<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.360> first<00:04:43.570> one<00:04:43.780> that

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
10 number 11 is the first one that

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.350 
10 number 11 is the first one that
throws<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.080> bass<00:04:44.380> drum<00:04:44.560> on<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.830> E<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.430> D

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
throws the bass drum on the E and the D

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.960 
throws the bass drum on the E and the D
so<00:04:47.200> there's<00:04:47.410> no<00:04:47.620> high<00:04:47.830> hat<00:04:48.010> with<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.310> at<00:04:48.430> all<00:04:48.550> 1

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
so there's no high hat with it at all 1

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:59.600 
so there's no high hat with it at all 1
and<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.840> 2<00:04:50.050> p-10<00:04:50.770> plug<00:04:51.250> 3<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:57.720> start<00:04:58.720> slowly

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
and the 2 p-10 plug 3 and start slowly

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:11.750 
and the 2 p-10 plug 3 and start slowly
speed<00:05:00.610> up<00:05:02.760> repeat<00:05:03.760> that<00:05:03.940> over<00:05:04.090> and<00:05:04.210> over<00:05:09.570> and

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
speed up repeat that over and over and

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.640 
speed up repeat that over and over and
12<00:05:12.760> mixes<00:05:13.210> both<00:05:13.450> you've<00:05:13.720> got<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.960> AA<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:14.440> then

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
12 mixes both you've got the AA and then

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.400 
12 mixes both you've got the AA and then
and<00:05:14.860> then<00:05:14.920> the<00:05:15.490> e<00:05:15.520> on<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.150> count<00:05:16.330> of<00:05:16.420> four<00:05:17.020> so

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
and then the e on the count of four so

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:28.230 
and then the e on the count of four so
for<00:05:17.620> e

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.369
