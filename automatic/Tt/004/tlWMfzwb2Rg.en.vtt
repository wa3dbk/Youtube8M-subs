00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
okay Ross on a rivo part one I didn't

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.499 
okay Ross on a rivo part one I didn't
actually<00:00:03.929> record<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.830> part<00:00:05.160> first<00:00:05.549> but<00:00:06.420> I'm

going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.660> go<00:00:06.779> ahead<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.140> stick<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:07.500> in<00:00:07.589> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
going to go ahead and stick it in the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.070 
going to go ahead and stick it in the
beginning<00:00:07.830> because<00:00:08.580> some<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.630> things<00:00:09.870> I'm

going to cover in it are probably things

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.839 
going to cover in it are probably things
that<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.679> should<00:00:13.860> do<00:00:14.040> first<00:00:14.309> before<00:00:14.639> you

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
that you should do first before you

out<00:00:33.090> piece<00:00:33.719> by<00:00:33.750> piece<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.250> bought<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> Ross

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
out piece by piece so I bought the Ross

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.220 
out piece by piece so I bought the Ross
module<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:38.600> lithium<00:00:39.600> battery<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.110> goes

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
module and the lithium battery that goes

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.020 
module and the lithium battery that goes
with<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> 10<00:00:41.579> T<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.770> basically<00:00:44.000> when<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
with it for a 10 T so basically when you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
with it for a 10 T so basically when you
get<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.870> Ross<00:00:46.140> module<00:00:47.750> this<00:00:48.750> wire<00:00:49.020> right

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
get your Ross module this wire right

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.930 
get your Ross module this wire right
here<00:00:50.600> as<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:52.829> call<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.280> jst

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
here as a I think they call that a jst

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700 
here as a I think they call that a jst
connector<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:54.719> positive<00:00:54.960> somebody<00:00:55.530> can

correct me if I'm wrong this plugs

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.000 
correct me if I'm wrong this plugs
directly<00:00:59.460> into<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> on/off<00:01:00.989> switch<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.680> 10

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
directly into the on/off switch on a 10

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.920 
directly into the on/off switch on a 10
T<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:05.159> make<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.580> work<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.210> your<00:01:06.450> Revo

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
T and to make it work with your Revo

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.830 
T and to make it work with your Revo
switch<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> decided<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.630> MIT<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
switch and the way I decided to MIT to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.039 
switch and the way I decided to MIT to
do<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.830> either<00:01:11.010> buy<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:12.180> female<00:01:12.689> side

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
do it you can either buy the female side

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.990 
do it you can either buy the female side
of<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> jst<00:01:13.920> connector<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.390> solder<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.759> to

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.830 

your<00:01:21.000> switch<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.720> plug<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:23.210> or<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> can

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
your switch and plug it in or you can

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.109 
your switch and plug it in or you can
just<00:01:25.170> cut<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.799> splice<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.400> solder<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.970> two

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
just cut and splice and solder the two

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.700 
just cut and splice and solder the two
together<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> used

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
together now what I used

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.090 
together now what I used
Fernan<00:01:29.700> off<00:01:29.909> switch<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.869> Revo<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
Fernan off switch for the Revo is the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.700 
Fernan off switch for the Revo is the
stock<00:01:32.460> original<00:01:33.229> Revo<00:01:34.229> on/off<00:01:35.159> switch<00:01:35.490> which

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
stock original Revo on/off switch which

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.899 
stock original Revo on/off switch which
of<00:01:37.710> course<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> take<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
of course when you take it out of the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.700 
of course when you take it out of the
truck<00:01:39.229> looks<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.130 

and<00:01:43.830> all<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:44.580> did<00:01:44.760> was<00:01:45.470> take<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.830> connector

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
and all I did was take this connector

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.360 
and all I did was take this connector
which<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> connector<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:50.160> be<00:01:50.280> at

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
which is the connector that would be at

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.270 
which is the connector that would be at
the<00:01:50.490> bottom<00:01:50.700> side<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.450> truck<00:01:52.160> that<00:01:53.160> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the bottom side of the truck that you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.730 
the bottom side of the truck that you
plug<00:01:53.730> into<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.210> recharge<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.080> batteries<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
plug into to recharge the batteries and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.460 
plug into to recharge the batteries and
you<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.160> take<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.120> plug<00:01:57.330> apart<00:01:57.660> and<00:02:00.470> you

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
you just take the plug apart and you

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.240 
you just take the plug apart and you
snip<00:02:01.890> off<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.540> connections<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.020> flood

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.919 

and<00:02:08.250> hold<00:02:08.490> on<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> second<00:02:09.090> I'll<00:02:09.240> get<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.690> thing

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and hold on a second I'll get that thing

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.880 
and hold on a second I'll get that thing
apart<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.350> show<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.679> what<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.890> mean<00:02:12.680> ok<00:02:13.680> when

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
apart and show you what I mean ok when

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.150 
apart and show you what I mean ok when
you're<00:02:14.340> inside<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.910> plug<00:02:15.150> itself<00:02:19.160> that

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
you're inside the plug itself that

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.449 
you're inside the plug itself that
connector<00:02:20.670> end<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.850> plug<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:25.280> see<00:02:26.280> that

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
connector end in the plug you see that

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.750 
connector end in the plug you see that
ok<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.110> very<00:02:28.320> end<00:02:28.590> one<00:02:28.920> basically<00:02:29.610> you're

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
ok is the very end one basically you're

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.420 
ok is the very end one basically you're
just<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.150> snip<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.570> off<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.430> make

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
just going to snip that off and make

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.220 
just going to snip that off and make

make it work so anyway that's all I

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.400 
make it work so anyway that's all I
wanted<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.240> include<00:05:47.570> for<00:05:47.870> this<00:05:47.990> first<00:05:48.230> video

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
wanted to include for this first video

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.250 
wanted to include for this first video
just<00:05:48.890> to<00:05:49.730> get<00:05:49.850> you<00:05:50.000> started<00:05:50.030> and<00:05:52.780> there's<00:05:53.780> more

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
coverage on switch modifications and

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.560 
coverage on switch modifications and
things<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.700> think<00:05:58.760> in<00:05:59.230> part<00:06:00.230> four<00:06:00.500> B<00:06:01.450> all<00:06:02.450> right
