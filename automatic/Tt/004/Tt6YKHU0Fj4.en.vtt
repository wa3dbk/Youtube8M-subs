hey guys in this video do a detailed

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.800 
hey guys in this video do a detailed
speed<00:00:02.010> test<00:00:02.159> comparison<00:00:02.669> between<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:03.060> LG<00:00:03.419> g4

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
speed test comparison between the LG g4

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.079 
speed test comparison between the LG g4
versus<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.319> galaxy<00:00:04.710> note<00:00:04.859> flat<00:00:05.009> so<00:00:05.279> just<00:00:05.490> just

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
versus the galaxy note flat so just just

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.230 
versus the galaxy note flat so just just
quickly<00:00:06.390> boot<00:00:07.049> up<00:00:07.290> both<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.620> these<00:00:07.859> two

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
quickly boot up both of these two

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.180 
quickly boot up both of these two
flagship<00:00:09.240> phones<00:00:09.510> at<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.750> same<00:00:09.960> time<00:00:10.200> here

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.580 

here<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.370> go<00:00:15.830> LG<00:00:16.830> vs.<00:00:17.310> samsung<00:00:18.230> so<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.410> got

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
here we go LG vs. samsung so we got

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.099 
here we go LG vs. samsung so we got
exodus<00:00:20.130> 742<00:00:20.730> zero<00:00:20.970> plus<00:00:21.240> four<00:00:21.510> gigabyte<00:00:21.900> of

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
exodus 742 zero plus four gigabyte of

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.700 
exodus 742 zero plus four gigabyte of
ram<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.500> note<00:00:22.859> five<00:00:23.490> versus<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.710> snapdragon

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
ram on note five versus the snapdragon

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.849 
ram on note five versus the snapdragon
808<00:00:26.359> plus<00:00:27.359> 3x2<00:00:27.840> ram<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.890> LG<00:00:29.189> g4<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:31.320> let's

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
808 plus 3x2 ram on the LG g4 so let's

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.370 
808 plus 3x2 ram on the LG g4 so let's
see<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.450> no<00:00:33.660> five<00:00:33.899> booted<00:00:34.260> up

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
see as you can see no five booted up

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.330 
see as you can see no five booted up
faster<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:36.050> mean<00:00:37.050> no<00:00:37.200> five<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.649> winning<00:00:38.100> this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
faster I mean no five is winning this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.030 
faster I mean no five is winning this
boot<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:39.000> around<00:00:39.210> vs.<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.590> phones<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.950> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
boot up around vs. all the phones that I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
boot up around vs. all the phones that I
have<00:00:41.219> compared<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.059> far<00:00:42.300> compare<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.050> with

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
have compared it so far compare it with

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.110 
have compared it so far compare it with
so<00:00:43.379> far<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> lower<00:00:45.090> down

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
so far so I'm just going to lower down

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.549 
so far so I'm just going to lower down
the<00:00:45.420> brightness<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> little<00:00:45.899> bit<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the brightness a little bit so that you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.490 
the brightness a little bit so that you
can<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.890> more<00:00:47.280> clearly<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.930> am<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
can see more clearly and I am going to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.650 
can see more clearly and I am going to
pause<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.129> update<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:52.670> okay

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.720 

resume<00:00:57.660> download<00:00:58.230> cancel<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.460> already

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
resume download cancel so it's already

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.900 
resume download cancel so it's already
paused

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
paused

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.090 
paused
yeah<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.149> pause<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.750> we're<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> go<00:01:04.710> so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
yeah it's pause so we're good to go so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
yeah it's pause so we're good to go so
let's<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.510> everything<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.260> closed

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
let's just see if everything is closed

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.640 
let's just see if everything is closed
in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> background<00:01:08.750> no<00:01:09.750> recent<00:01:09.960> application

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
in the background no recent application

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.690 
in the background no recent application
so<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.970> journal<00:01:12.330> look<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
so in a journal look you can see that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.870 
so in a journal look you can see that
both<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:15.150> perform<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:16.549> equal<00:01:17.549> you're

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
both will perform really equal you're

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.429 
both will perform really equal you're
not<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> notice<00:01:18.390> any<00:01:18.750> lag<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.290> anything

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
not going to notice any lag or anything

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.999 
not going to notice any lag or anything
like<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:20.310> LG<00:01:20.790> g4<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.869> note<00:01:22.290> 5<00:01:22.560> both

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
like that on LG g4 or or note 5 both

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.620 
like that on LG g4 or or note 5 both
will<00:01:23.250> perform<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.240> smooth

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
will perform really really smooth

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.740 
will perform really really smooth
buttery<00:01:25.380> smooth<00:01:25.799> performance<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.640> let's<00:01:27.570> just

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
buttery smooth performance so let's just

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.530 
buttery smooth performance so let's just
open<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.140> different<00:01:28.560> applications<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.540> here

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
open up different applications so here

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.179 
open up different applications so here
we<00:01:30.659> go<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> pretty<00:01:32.970> equal<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:34.009> mean<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.100> we

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
we go so pretty equal there I mean if we

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.590 
we go so pretty equal there I mean if we
talk<00:01:35.340> about<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.610> benchmark<00:01:36.060> noir<00:01:36.270> 5<00:01:36.450> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
talk about the benchmark noir 5 is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.230 
talk about the benchmark noir 5 is
better<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.619> real<00:01:38.159> thing<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> real<00:01:39.000> live

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
better but real thing is the real live

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.490 
better but real thing is the real live
performance<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.140> I'm<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
performance that's what I'm going to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
performance that's what I'm going to
compare<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.460> with

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
compare it with

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
compare it with
so<00:01:42.829> contacts<00:01:45.649> equal<00:01:47.450> open<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.049> let's<00:01:49.890> see

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
so contacts equal open up the let's see

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.289 
so contacts equal open up the let's see
if<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.299> check<00:01:51.659> out<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:53.299> music

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
if we can check out the music

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.160 
if we can check out the music
application<00:01:54.600> here<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:57.360> seems<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.930> both

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
application here that seems like both

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.190 
application here that seems like both
for<00:01:58.640> pretty<00:01:59.640> equal<00:02:00.680> something<00:02:01.680> messaging

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
for pretty equal something messaging

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.679 
for pretty equal something messaging
very<00:02:04.200> equal

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
very equal

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:13.530 
very equal
let's<00:02:06.619> open<00:02:06.829> up<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.929> gallery<00:02:08.929> here<00:02:12.220> again

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
let's open up the gallery here again

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.050 
let's open up the gallery here again
very<00:02:14.540> equal<00:02:16.900> let's<00:02:17.900> see<00:02:18.709> if<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.220> can<00:02:19.459> check<00:02:19.849> out

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
very equal let's see if we can check out

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.619 
very equal let's see if we can check out
file<00:02:20.510> manager<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:22.640> we<00:02:22.760> go<00:02:23.260> oops<00:02:24.260> my<00:02:24.830> bad<00:02:25.629> just

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
the settings see here we go again

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.339 
the settings see here we go again
so<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.849> can<00:02:49.940> see<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.269> even<00:02:50.810> though<00:02:51.140> this<00:02:51.260> is

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
so you can see that even though this is

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.770 
so you can see that even though this is
a<00:02:51.470> snapping<00:02:51.829> an<00:02:51.920> 808<00:02:52.280> chipset<00:02:52.849> which<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.599> of

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
a snapping an 808 chipset which is of

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.500 
a snapping an 808 chipset which is of
course<00:02:54.019> not<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.459> top<00:02:55.459> dog<00:02:55.760> out<00:02:56.060> there<00:02:56.299> but

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
course not the top dog out there but

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.110 
course not the top dog out there but
still<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:57.049> is<00:02:57.530> pretty<00:02:57.980> equal<00:02:58.459> when<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.790> comes

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
still it is pretty equal when it comes

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.330 
still it is pretty equal when it comes
to<00:02:59.329> the<00:02:59.540> real<00:02:59.959> live<00:03:00.170> performance<00:03:00.680> as<00:03:00.890> compared

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
to the real live performance as compared

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.420 
to the real live performance as compared
to<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.489> note<00:03:01.670> 5<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.040> we're<00:03:04.040> going<00:03:04.129> to<00:03:04.190> take<00:03:04.400> a

to the note 5 so we're going to take a

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.059 
to the note 5 so we're going to take a
look<00:03:04.700> at<00:03:04.910> some<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.599> internet<00:03:06.560> tests<00:03:06.829> there

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
look at some of the internet tests there

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.800 
look at some of the internet tests there
well<00:03:07.370> let's<00:03:07.790> just<00:03:07.910> open<00:03:08.120> up<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.329> camera<00:03:08.510> app

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
well let's just open up the camera app

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.620 
well let's just open up the camera app
first<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:10.359> just<00:03:11.359> going<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:12.250> see<00:03:13.250> now<00:03:13.519> here<00:03:14.420> we

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
first so just going to see now here we

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.410 
first so just going to see now here we
go

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
go

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.210

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
it seems like the note 5 was actually

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.460 
it seems like the note 5 was actually
faster<00:03:19.459> here<00:03:19.880> we're<00:03:20.120> going<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.269> do<00:03:20.420> with<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.690> do

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
faster here we're going to do with it do

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.430 
faster here we're going to do with it do
this<00:03:21.739> one<00:03:22.010> one<00:03:22.940> more<00:03:23.120> time<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:27.430> here<00:03:28.430> we<00:03:28.579> go

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
this one one more time so here we go

this one one more time so here we go
yeah<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.680> note<00:03:30.859> 5<00:03:31.069> is<00:03:31.099> slightly<00:03:31.760> faster<00:03:32.239> but

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
yeah the note 5 is slightly faster but

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.710 
yeah the note 5 is slightly faster but
of<00:03:32.959> course<00:03:34.030> given<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.060> amount<00:03:35.299> of<00:03:35.389> money<00:03:35.630> that

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
of course given the amount of money that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.650 
of course given the amount of money that
you<00:03:35.989> are<00:03:36.049> paying<00:03:37.599> so<00:03:38.889> yeah<00:03:39.940> note<00:03:40.940> 5<00:03:41.180> wins<00:03:41.419> that
