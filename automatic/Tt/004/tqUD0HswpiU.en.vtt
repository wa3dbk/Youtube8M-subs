00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
damage if you use that for modding

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.830

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and all these saves are pretty much just

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.310 
and all these saves are pretty much just
geared<00:00:47.850> towards<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.480> gun<00:00:48.660> drop<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.079> save
