00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.319
 cc stener clear if you want to teach 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.660
 You have 20 photos and four videos to explain the whole house 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.779
 there are a number of essential things 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.639
 facades garden pool and common areas 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.480
 photography on sunny days in the central hours of the day ensures that the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.640
 Facade is not shadow 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.939
 photography in a single shot the pool green areas and the facade of the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.569
 building funds 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:35.599
 it is more interesting to show a common area than a portal facade 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.090
 terrace and views 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.730
 Get close to the window 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.250
 teaches the pool the little park al kiel another open space 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.330
 photograph the sunny terrace and try to show the views it has 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.750
 the living room 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.780
 It is the fundamental piece of the house 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.630
 to see all the space put in one of the corners shows the doors and the 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.310
 windows 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.910
 Plant a lot of light through the window do not stand in front of her 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 photograph furniture fronts 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.740
 the kitchen 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.079
 the kitchen is another of the essential photos of the house 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.340
 turn on all the lights including the one in the fume hood 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.390
 maybe all the objects swallows food and other utensils to leave the countertop 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.560
 empty and clean 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.200
 bedrooms 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.660
 the most adequate photo of the master bedroom is the one that shows the space 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.920
 with the bed and the access door to the bathroom with the light on 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.869
 just one photo of each room from the main you can make two 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.869
 doors or windows should always appear 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.400
 bathroom 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.020
 the bathroom is one of the most difficult pieces to photograph 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.610
 It is a very small space with a very particular lighting 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.110
 take the photo from one of the top angles of the door, 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.440
 camera to try to see the toilets and the tiling 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.059
 if the bathroom is extraordinarily small photograph some detail of 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:17.579
 the toilets as the taps and a section of tiling wanted to understand 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.889
 the general state of space 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.889
 lower the toilet lid and open the bath screen 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.859
 other photos there are other spaces that can appear in the photos 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.579
 after showing the most important areas it shows the rest of the 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.069
 property 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.279
 storage stairs 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:41.359
 garage 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.099
 details of finishes 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.529
 landscape photos such as street gardens or are best known nearby 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.259
 add the plans of the apartment 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:57.079
 there are some details that mark the differences when photographing a 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.239
 space 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.639
 turn on all the lights of the house even if it is day 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.919
 photograph the spaces as ordered as possible 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.929
 the furniture great dimension to the rooms 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.089
 take the pictures before emptying 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.389
 the door frames should appear vertical 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.449
 the space seems neat if your photo looks nicer 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.979
 photograph the spaces without people 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.069
 take the photo from a natural height 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.059
 more or less as we see it 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:34.289
 with digital cameras you have a great advantage 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.289
 It is the picture immediately after making them 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:42.969
 if it is very dark or very burned look for the most - useless and fallacious button 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.479
 If the photo is dark, take it to the more so that the camera takes more 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.279
 light 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.409
 If the photo is badly burned, the aci is taken - at least 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.109
 so that it takes less light 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.919
 as simple as that 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.389
 2 if the house does not have active flash light 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.389
 yes no better leave it off 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.509
 any digital camera is used to take pictures of houses 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.609
 If you are thinking of buying a keep in mind this 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.810
 you do not need a megapixel camera these images are for 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:16.959
 Internet 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.959
 you do not need a team with professional features 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.419
 if the camera records videos in addition to taking photos the best 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:27.150
 We are already waiting for your photos
