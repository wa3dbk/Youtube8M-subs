this rigs right arm interact with the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.590 
this rigs right arm interact with the
table<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.579> rest<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> body<00:00:42.180> moves

table as the rest of the body moves
using<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.800> fixed<00:00:44.100> command<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> wrist

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
using the fixed command on the wrist

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.569 
using the fixed command on the wrist
let's<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.110> happens<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:47.039> move<00:00:47.340> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
let's see what happens when we move this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.510 
let's see what happens when we move this
guy's<00:00:47.820> torso<00:00:48.590> note<00:00:49.590> how<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.770> wrist<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.280> still

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
guy's torso note how the wrist is still

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.750 
guy's torso note how the wrist is still
rotating<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.600> don't<00:00:51.989> want<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> second

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
rotating we don't want this so a second

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
rotating we don't want this so a second
fix<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.120> required<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> tip<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> hand

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
fix is required at the tip of the hand

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
fix is required at the tip of the hand
to<00:00:55.800> prevent<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> hand<00:00:56.489> itself<00:00:56.670> from<00:00:57.210> rotating

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
to prevent the hand itself from rotating

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.990 
to prevent the hand itself from rotating
now<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.770> move<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:58.980> figure<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> hand<00:00:59.789> is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
now when we move the figure the hand is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.080 
now when we move the figure the hand is
firmly<00:01:00.329> planted<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.140> table<00:01:01.820> we<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.940> also

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
firmly planted on the table we can also

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
firmly planted on the table we can also
pivot<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> elbow<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.229> move<00:01:04.530> any<00:01:04.769> other<00:01:05.010> part

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
pivot the elbow or move any other part

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
pivot the elbow or move any other part
of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> character<00:01:05.909> by<00:01:06.180> clicking<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
of the character by clicking and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109 
of the character by clicking and
dragging<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.320> it'll<00:01:08.010> react<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.729> expect

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
dragging and it'll react like you expect

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.050 
dragging and it'll react like you expect
it<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.659> majority<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.830> ik<00:01:11.220> booster<00:01:11.610> users

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
it to the majority of ik booster users

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.090 
it to the majority of ik booster users
get<00:01:12.299> stuck<00:01:12.600> at<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.930> point<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.799> looks<00:01:14.040> very

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
get stuck at this point this looks very

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.580 
get stuck at this point this looks very
cool<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.119> there's<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.630> extra<00:01:15.900> step<00:01:16.110> required

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
cool but there's an extra step required

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.289 
cool but there's an extra step required
to<00:01:16.830> make<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> fixed<00:01:17.400> command<00:01:17.700> work<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
to make the fixed command work in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.200 
to make the fixed command work in
animation<00:01:19.020> by<00:01:19.920> doing<00:01:20.220> some<00:01:20.400> animation<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.030> can

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
animation by doing some animation we can

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.969 
animation by doing some animation we can
see<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> rig<00:01:21.720> behaving<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:22.770> would

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
see the rig behaving like one would

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.910 
see the rig behaving like one would
expect<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.180> keyframes<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:25.799> we

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
expect on the keyframes but when we

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.460 
expect on the keyframes but when we
scrub<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> timeline<00:01:26.670> after<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> fact<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
scrub the timeline after the fact the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
scrub the timeline after the fact the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
arm is floating around this drove me

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.950 
arm is floating around this drove me
crazy<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> longest<00:01:32.070> time<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:33.659> fixed

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
crazy for the longest time the fixed

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
crazy for the longest time the fixed
command<00:01:34.259> does<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:35.100> ik<00:01:35.340> booster<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
command does this because ik booster is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.719 
command does this because ik booster is
a<00:01:36.030> part-time<00:01:36.900> ik<00:01:37.409> system<00:01:38.130> essentially
