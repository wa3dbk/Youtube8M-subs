00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
what it's about you don't have to worry

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.540 
what it's about you don't have to worry
about<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.840> thin<00:00:37.079> cardboard<00:00:37.410> box<00:00:37.980> because

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
about the thin cardboard box because

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.720 
about the thin cardboard box because
this<00:00:38.790> thing<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.590> rather<00:00:40.590> well<00:00:40.950> packed<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
this thing is rather well packed in the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.590 
this thing is rather well packed in the
styrofoam<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.550> looks<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.789> at<00:00:45.180> least<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.510> was

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
styrofoam so looks like at least it was

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.110 
styrofoam so looks like at least it was
packaged<00:00:46.079> nicely<00:00:46.430> seems<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> fairly

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
packaged nicely seems to be a fairly

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.650 
packaged nicely seems to be a fairly
nicely<00:00:48.510> pointed<00:00:49.020> unit<00:00:50.090> I've<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> couple<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
nicely pointed unit I've got a couple of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.470 
nicely pointed unit I've got a couple of
LEDs<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.559> over<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.850> red<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> guess<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
LEDs on it over here the red I guess is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.430 
LEDs on it over here the red I guess is
temperature<00:00:54.960> yellow<00:00:55.590> means<00:00:56.750> reverse<00:00:57.750> maybe

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
temperature yellow means reverse maybe

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
temperature yellow means reverse maybe
and<00:00:58.770> green<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.000> probably<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> power<00:01:01.230> light<00:01:02.570> this

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and green is probably a power light this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.190 
and green is probably a power light this
is<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:03.930> reverse<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.390> momentary<00:01:06.390> stays<00:01:07.049> in

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
is your reverse here momentary stays in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160 
is your reverse here momentary stays in
the<00:01:07.290> off<00:01:07.409> position<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:09.150> standard<00:01:09.659> run

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the off position or the standard run

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.030 
the off position or the standard run
position<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> slot<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.119> CDs<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.530> or

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
position there is a slot for CDs and or

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.320 
position there is a slot for CDs and or
DVDs<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:16.080> also<00:01:16.290> has<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> nice<00:01:16.920> sticker<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.729> if

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.080 
okay when you turn on the power switch
on<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.319> right<00:02:09.470> side<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.890> unit<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.429> get<00:02:11.060> a

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
on the right side of the unit you get a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.809 
on the right side of the unit you get a
green<00:02:11.330> light<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.750> turns<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:15.129> put<00:02:16.129> it<00:02:16.220> on<00:02:16.430> and

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
green light that turns on put it on and

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:24.670 
green light that turns on put it on and
it<00:02:16.910> runs<00:02:17.950> put<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.190> off<00:02:20.769> reverse<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.590> that's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
it runs put it to off reverse and that's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.050 
it runs put it to off reverse and that's
that<00:02:25.069> so<00:02:25.340> now<00:02:25.489> we're<00:02:25.610> going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.790> start

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
that so now we're going to start

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.300 
that so now we're going to start
shredding<00:02:26.330> some<00:02:26.660> stuff<00:02:26.930> according<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
shredding some stuff according to the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.580 
shredding some stuff according to the
instructions<00:02:28.970> if<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.209> leave<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:29.930> it

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
instructions if you leave it here it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.470 
instructions if you leave it here it
should<00:02:30.860> automatically<00:02:31.640> turn<00:02:32.030> on<00:02:32.060> when

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
should automatically turn on when

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.530 
should automatically turn on when
something<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.530> entered<00:02:34.000> she<00:02:35.000> looks<00:02:35.209> kind<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
something is entered she looks kind of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.350 
something is entered she looks kind of
sloppy<00:02:35.690> so

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.949 

take<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.080> right<00:02:43.290> down<00:02:44.750> very<00:02:45.750> smooth

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.470 

we'll<00:02:50.079> find<00:02:50.319> all<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.709> stuff<00:02:50.769> here<00:02:54.329> maybe<00:02:55.329> not

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
we'll find all this stuff here maybe not

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.059 
we'll find all this stuff here maybe not
necessarily<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.290> fastest<00:02:56.769> thing<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:56.980> the

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
necessarily the fastest thing in the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.160 
necessarily the fastest thing in the
world<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:59.349> that<00:02:59.829> problem<00:03:00.579> there's<00:03:01.510> an<00:03:01.870> old

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
world is that problem there's an old

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.670 
world is that problem there's an old

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.119 

they<00:03:08.680> say<00:03:08.889> don't<00:03:09.069> do<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.340> kind<00:03:09.819> but<00:03:10.139> did<00:03:11.139> it

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.319 

bloke<00:03:17.129> like<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.430> pulls<00:03:18.329> up<00:03:18.569> on<00:03:18.750> itself<00:03:20.329> and

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
bloke like that pulls up on itself and

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.959 
bloke like that pulls up on itself and
some<00:03:22.109> paper<00:03:22.349> this<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.950> think<00:03:23.189> three<00:03:23.519> sheets

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:23.969 
some paper this is I think three sheets

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:37.870 
some paper this is I think three sheets
of<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.359> 27<00:03:25.230> pound<00:03:26.000> bond
