00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.070 
found this on the entertainment time sky
fantasmic<00:05:24.200> is<00:05:24.320> showing<00:05:24.680> three<00:05:25.430> times<00:05:26.080> Friday

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
fantasmic is showing three times Friday

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.610

to<00:05:27.230> Tuesday<00:05:27.880> that's<00:05:29.140> that's<00:05:30.140> new<00:05:30.350> right

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
to Tuesday that's that's new right

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.840 
to Tuesday that's that's new right
that's<00:05:30.860> I<00:05:31.070> don't<00:05:31.220> think<00:05:31.370> I've<00:05:31.460> ever<00:05:31.580> seen<00:05:31.790> that

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
that's I don't think I've ever seen that

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.800 
that's I don't think I've ever seen that
before<00:05:32.000> where<00:05:32.330> they<00:05:32.390> do<00:05:32.450> it<00:05:32.600> three<00:05:32.780> times

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
before where they do it three times

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.600 
before where they do it three times
usually<00:05:33.290> it's<00:05:33.410> just<00:05:33.440> too<00:05:33.650> much<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:34.190> show

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
usually it's just too much to show

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.670 
usually it's just too much to show
tonight<00:05:34.880> I<00:05:34.910> know<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.300> lot<00:05:35.450> easier<00:05:35.630> to<00:05:36.110> do

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
tonight I know it's a lot easier to do

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.620 
tonight I know it's a lot easier to do
it<00:05:36.880> you<00:05:37.880> know<00:05:37.970> three<00:05:38.120> times<00:05:38.240> during<00:05:38.510> that

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
it you know three times during that

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.940 
it you know three times during that
during<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:38.960> winter<00:05:39.170> season<00:05:39.410> when<00:05:39.740> it<00:05:39.830> gets

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
during the winter season when it gets

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.550 
during the winter season when it gets
dark<00:05:40.130> at<00:05:40.280> 5:00<00:05:40.460> 5:30<00:05:40.760> but<00:05:41.660> even<00:05:42.200> still<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.440> don't

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
dark at 5:00 5:30 but even still I don't

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.450 
dark at 5:00 5:30 but even still I don't
think<00:05:42.680> they've<00:05:42.890> ever<00:05:42.950> thought<00:05:43.190> that<00:05:43.250> before

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
think they've ever thought that before

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.670 
think they've ever thought that before
and<00:05:43.760> that<00:05:43.880> could<00:05:44.060> be<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.240> result<00:05:44.420> of<00:05:44.750> the

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
and that could be a result of the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.620 
and that could be a result of the
Fastpass<00:05:46.040> system<00:05:46.520> where<00:05:46.640> they<00:05:46.760> they're<00:05:47.330> able

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
Fastpass system where they they're able

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.630 
Fastpass system where they they're able
to<00:05:47.720> be<00:05:47.810> more<00:05:47.960> efficient<00:05:48.410> and<00:05:48.530> get<00:05:49.190> crowds<00:05:49.430> in

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
to be more efficient and get crowds in

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.350 
to be more efficient and get crowds in
and<00:05:49.760> out<00:05:49.850> of<00:05:49.970> there

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
and out of there

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.869 
and out of there
with<00:05:50.629> more<00:05:50.870> ease<00:05:51.110> I<00:05:51.470> don't<00:05:52.430> know<00:05:52.490> I'd<00:05:52.699> like<00:05:52.819> to

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:52.879 
with more ease I don't know I'd like to

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.730 
with more ease I don't know I'd like to
see<00:05:53.120> what<00:05:53.240> happens<00:05:53.659> I'd<00:05:54.229> like<00:05:54.439> to<00:05:54.530> be<00:05:54.680> here

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
see what happens I'd like to be here

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.050 
see what happens I'd like to be here
tonight<00:05:54.949> but<00:05:55.129> maybe<00:05:55.400> we'll<00:05:55.639> spend<00:05:55.819> a<00:05:55.879> night
