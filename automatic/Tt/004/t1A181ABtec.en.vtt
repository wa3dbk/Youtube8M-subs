00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
see i'm moving from the left side

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.410 
see i'm moving from the left side
instead<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.300> right<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:50.520> i<00:01:51.520> should<00:01:52.330> have

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
instead of the right so i should have

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.889 
instead of the right so i should have
seen<00:01:52.840> his<00:01:53.050> movements<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.210> he<00:01:55.660> got<00:01:55.840> away<00:01:57.899> for

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
seen his movements so he got away for

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.020 
seen his movements so he got away for
glyphs<00:01:59.289> and<00:01:59.560> talents<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.280> stuff<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:00.759> believe
