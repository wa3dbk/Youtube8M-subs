00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.220 
to talk about recalibrating a ps3 disk
drive<00:00:12.820> so<00:00:13.820> basically<00:00:14.119> what<00:00:14.449> you<00:00:14.539> need<00:00:14.660> is<00:00:14.900> your

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
disk drive they need to recalibrate the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.490 
disk drive they need to recalibrate the
reason<00:00:17.210> I'm<00:00:17.300> recalibrating<00:00:17.570> this<00:00:18.050> disk<00:00:18.289> drive

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
reason I'm recalibrating this disk drive

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.710 
reason I'm recalibrating this disk drive
today<00:00:18.710> is<00:00:19.100> is<00:00:19.430> I'm<00:00:20.179> going<00:00:20.269> to<00:00:20.359> put<00:00:20.449> it<00:00:20.570> this

disk drive in my ps3 but this disk drive

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.259 
disk drive in my ps3 but this disk drive
before<00:00:24.169> got<00:00:24.470> taken<00:00:24.710> on<00:00:24.769> another<00:00:24.890> ps3<00:00:25.640> someone

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
before got taken on another ps3 someone

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.790 
before got taken on another ps3 someone
had<00:00:26.390> actually<00:00:26.570> opened<00:00:27.019> it<00:00:27.109> up<00:00:27.199> and<00:00:27.259> taken<00:00:27.710> the

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
had actually opened it up and taken the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.919 
had actually opened it up and taken the
disk<00:00:27.980> out<00:00:28.189> of<00:00:28.339> this<00:00:28.460> drive<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.449> when<00:00:29.630> I<00:00:29.720> put

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
disk out of this drive so when I put

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.979 
disk out of this drive so when I put
this<00:00:29.960> disc<00:00:30.289> drive<00:00:30.439> in<00:00:30.560> my<00:00:30.650> new<00:00:30.859> ps3<00:00:31.490> the<00:00:32.240> ps3

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
this disc drive in my new ps3 the ps3

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.479 
this disc drive in my new ps3 the ps3
right<00:00:33.380> now<00:00:33.500> is<00:00:33.650> assuming<00:00:34.130> that<00:00:34.160> there's<00:00:34.400> a

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
right now is assuming that there's a

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.460 
right now is assuming that there's a
disk<00:00:34.730> end<00:00:35.030> because<00:00:35.540> someone<00:00:35.810> took<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:36.020> disk<00:00:36.260> out

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
disk end because someone took a disk out

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.470 
disk end because someone took a disk out
of<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.130> disk<00:00:37.340> drive<00:00:37.580> why<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:37.760> power<00:00:38.060> was<00:00:38.240> off

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
of the disk drive why the power was off

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.270 
of the disk drive why the power was off
so<00:00:39.260> that<00:00:39.290> means<00:00:39.590> I<00:00:39.680> have<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:39.920> go<00:00:40.040> in<00:00:40.160> and

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
so that means I have to go in and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.340 
so that means I have to go in and
recalibrate<00:00:40.880> the<00:00:41.000> drive<00:00:41.240> it<00:00:42.020> sounds<00:00:42.260> a<00:00:42.290> little

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
recalibrate the drive it sounds a little

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.750 
recalibrate the drive it sounds a little
more<00:00:42.560> difficult<00:00:42.950> than<00:00:42.980> it<00:00:43.100> really<00:00:43.220> is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
more difficult than it really is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.220 
more difficult than it really is

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
to like I said everything is plastic if

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.309 
to like I said everything is plastic if
