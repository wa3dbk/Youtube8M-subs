00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.190
 yes welcome to our boxing video the Asus Eee PC 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.360
 10 18 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.690
 The coupons in a very first step do what in the box it does 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.659
 you buy them then 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.789
 available at the top of course the device itself 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.789
 the network outward look what we hide under it 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.159
 March on a tightrope becomes positive 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.779
 works now makes on the win further below 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.210
 not much but the necessary do not even drive the net and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.300
 supporter 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.699
 + the power supply itself 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.290
 was briefly explain 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.770
 but more about that right now 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.830
 We'll take a look at the device 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.810
 first and very positive very very nice surface very nice 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.660
 processed quite a bit of the forest 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.820
 and you have to formulate the connection to other side from left to right 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.530
 from her graduation certificate beer connection 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.810
 then there will be no connection under Vista and the Kensington Lock 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.760
 on the other side you can find them here 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.250
 once the connection for the kids the map on the far left 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.710
 then go Kopftor connection maps microphone 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.350
 another short BBI 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.420
 and here a day solved quite well 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.070
 to their network in the connection 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.410
 which one can easily work too, I am quite so noticeable and far right 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.810
 has determined 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 So for 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 Schaumburg the device sometimes from the back 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.530
 the water samples 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.570
 Waitz 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.680
 and that sits two covers once the retrieve 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 and so you can get the cover for the memory latch 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.369
 www Aupeo com that this is not easy to solve 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.960
 and spectacular 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.600
 And what but already solved so is a customer in advance the memory latch 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.930
 As usual you can record well here 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.619
 after a protective film 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.730
 Lehmann already Platon memory latch 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.380
 You can squat and exchange comfortably 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.380
 for example, we're fine 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.770
 Solis on and the device was long enough from the outside Cook time 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.180
 it worked too 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.330
 and so on completely different design 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.360
 just around the mirrored display 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.890
 A camera this provides a simple mechanical vibration to run 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.099
 fold 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.099
 now playing 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.649
 we catch surface for the very high quality 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:24.909
 July to Ernst takes brushed on this one too at fault 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.869
 optical contrast to the black Wednesday evening 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.370
 at Ticketmaster Tour 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.259
 this can be justified at the circuit breaker 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.159
 and 2 so too 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.369
 the bonds are already waiting 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:39.369
 a total of 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.739
 sda speed tests that was best described just sets times 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:45.129
 tuned 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.419
 and how the time 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.449
 we are fine 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:48.909
 the device will be so 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.089
 finally dry cough is Heinz van Baal in a state of rest 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.289
 installed is cell Windows Vista 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.399
 and percent are the consequences and you just uncommented 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.559
 What is your impression of getting the city of St 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.529
 barely 20 seconds over now 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.410
 he works 30 customers appears 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.169
 Goal of the environment 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.229
 actually from the poster the motto CeBIT yes what they can and what picture from 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.369
 filming 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.369
 before rescued RÃ¼ttgers quite normal 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.739
 and there popped up on the desktop 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.739
 now to 50 seconds 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.309
 Norbert a bit more 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:47.549
 Zaman essential now 1 so to buy these customers by 4 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:50.329
 Droemer poppy themes 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.959
 Start the device more real from the ground up Bangkok 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.239
 dear God is love that is bitter 40 clock state with starting number possible 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.809
 the hibernation now I have printed on it 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:04.079
 and you can see before he is to Manuel Schunter 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.519
 I'm so often now to talk 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.019
 endless moms ca 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.959
 at that time I only have a few seconds the device is ready to use 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.389
 So very nice 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:14.949
 overall is fast 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.759
 Krause fastest one touch of a button is enough 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.759
 the war 'feels again in Ruiz Bestandes Blick 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.160
 so Roman are locked over to look at the multifunction device 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.050
 change this passage 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.050
 and it is modern to our city what disturb the guests 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.110
 is primary 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.400
 demands Gilles Simon Example ISAF document 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.610
 you could not even go the Apple typical with the magnify the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.610
 Kids little two fingers on touches 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.810
 the tour still another function 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.059
 namely, for example, turning a document 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:54.050
 what goals the shown 2 4mr rotary motion should work Bespoke 

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:56.559
 Effect KTW last Cottbus 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.629
 So it all takes a bit of getting used to 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.400
 Also Michelin's other feature is three finger wipes 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.259
 to the left or right 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.599
 so you can leaf through documents 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.749
 and back, of course 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:12.809
 our teammate Tomczyk has to 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:14.439
 that was his 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.829
 differently of course, great works on one side as a buyer 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.240
 yes this time finger control have seen life bring up the rear 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.180
 the tide is also on the desktop 6 times short with South goal we must be comfortable 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.569
 automatically larger 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.199
 until now it seems that they are smaller again 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.520
 so could completely 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.520
 to adapt his personal habits 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.389
 yes you have to look at two special function of the device 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.439
 Our test is supposed to prove that rescue services mostly have to 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.940
 right for the current one 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.469
 abolished again 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.309
 Do what happens to Steinert performance group 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:50.970
 there you can have different 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.479
 Mooney plowed through 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.449
 Once in the future, it must be one from 2 August 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.889
 vs-villingen or products from 1 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:02.419
 in Athens 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.260
 how to save paper or 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.020
 Bolzano 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.139
 Although looking to have the balance sheets 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.729
 also relatively easy 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.520
 in mountain in the beginning US and brother turn on again or both 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.369
 is checked 

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:18.180
 GIZ speak 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.180
 Adapter on or off 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.729
 yes final test should draw with 17 18 between great device 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.629
 very nicely processed 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.099
 the first objects 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.949
 Also this argument seriously and very good 20 o'clock in the evening really convinced that 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:35.479
 device 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:37.389
 it depends on us
