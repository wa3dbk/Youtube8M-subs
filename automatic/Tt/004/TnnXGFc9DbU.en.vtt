us<00:06:53.190> to<00:06:53.310> know<00:06:53.370> what<00:06:53.639> they're<00:06:53.789> thinking<00:06:53.970> and<00:06:54.360> I

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
us to know what they're thinking and I

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:55.909 
us to know what they're thinking and I
think<00:06:54.690> there's<00:06:55.110> more<00:06:55.349> of<00:06:55.530> that<00:06:55.650> coming

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
think there's more of that coming

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.370 
think there's more of that coming
together<00:06:56.160> and<00:06:56.580> and<00:06:56.940> with<00:06:57.539> the<00:06:57.660> track<00:06:57.900> operator

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
together and and with the track operator

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.990 
together and and with the track operator
at<00:06:58.560> the<00:06:58.620> table<00:06:58.979> as<00:06:59.099> well<00:06:59.130> I<00:06:59.310> think<00:06:59.550> there's

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
at the table as well I think there's

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.749 
at the table as well I think there's
lots<00:07:00.419> of<00:07:00.539> positives<00:07:01.139> towards<00:07:01.949> the<00:07:02.490> rules

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
lots of positives towards the rules

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:05.960 
lots of positives towards the rules
everyone<00:07:03.419> has<00:07:03.479> to<00:07:03.780> play
