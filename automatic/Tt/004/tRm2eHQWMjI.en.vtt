00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
in size head units in the late 80s to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.420 
in size head units in the late 80s to
90s<00:00:38.989> they<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.530> cassette<00:00:40.829> mechanism

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
plugged into the main board and held on

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.350 
plugged into the main board and held on
by<00:00:44.399> three<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.149> four<00:00:45.360> screws<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:47.460> unit<00:00:48.090> has

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
by three or four screws this unit has

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.209 
by three or four screws this unit has
the<00:00:48.570> same<00:00:48.809> setup<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.469> manufactured<00:00:49.980> by

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the same setup it is manufactured by

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.790 
the same setup it is manufactured by
alpine<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.710> i<00:00:52.770> looked<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:54.590> basically<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
alpine so i looked and basically this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.010 
alpine so i looked and basically this
was<00:00:56.070> my<00:00:56.219> project<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> their<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.329> find<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.870> i

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
was my project to their as find out if i

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.220 
was my project to their as find out if i
can<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.469> put<00:00:58.829> some<00:00:58.859> kind<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.670> dash

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
can actually put some kind of in dash

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.780 
can actually put some kind of in dash
unit<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.539> it<00:01:03.539> does<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:04.790> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
unit so as you can see it does have the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.170 
unit so as you can see it does have the
screen<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.590> which<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.310> shows<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> DVD

check to remove the consent mechanism
cut<00:01:16.500> into<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> case<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:18.000> accommodate<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
cut into the case to accommodate the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.670 
cut into the case to accommodate the
width<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:20.060> dense<00:01:21.060> size<00:01:21.360> unit<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.470> this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
width of dense size unit in this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.510 
width of dense size unit in this
situation<00:01:23.009> i<00:01:23.310> used<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.670> half<00:01:23.880> den<00:01:24.180> sized<00:01:25.520> DVD

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
situation i used a half den sized DVD

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
situation i used a half den sized DVD
player<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.290> i<00:01:28.430> have<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> mounted<00:01:29.729> into<00:01:30.320> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
player so i have it mounted into the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
player so i have it mounted into the
back<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.840> i<00:01:33.840> also<00:01:34.259> cut<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.430> front

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
back there and i also cut that front

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
back there and i also cut that front
plate<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.079> no<00:01:37.290> longer<00:01:37.470> has<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
plate there so I no longer has the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.880 
plate there so I no longer has the
opening<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.540> cassette<00:01:39.750> opening<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.380> place

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890

anyone<00:01:46.829> has<00:01:46.950> ever<00:01:47.070> done<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
anyone has ever done this this kind of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.630 
anyone has ever done this this kind of
project<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.479> unique<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.640> having

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
project so it is very unique and having

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
project so it is very unique and having
all<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.479> front<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.590> very

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
all this up front is just very

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
all this up front is just very
convenient<00:01:56.549> since<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> don't<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.360> pull

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
convenient since you don't have to pull

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.469 
convenient since you don't have to pull
over<00:01:57.649> just<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.770> change<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.399> CD<00:01:59.759> cartridge<00:02:00.299> or

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
over just to change a CD cartridge or

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.500 
over just to change a CD cartridge or
whatever

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.780 

I<00:02:05.570> know<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.440> three<00:02:06.770> series<00:02:07.130> has<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.400> CD<00:02:07.700> player

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
I know that three series has a CD player

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.810 
I know that three series has a CD player
in<00:02:08.030> dash<00:02:08.270> but<00:02:08.780> that's<00:02:08.930> as<00:02:09.200> far<00:02:09.500> as<00:02:10.160> it'll<00:02:10.430> go<00:02:10.520> at

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
in dash but that's as far as it'll go at

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.090 
in dash but that's as far as it'll go at
that's<00:02:11.060> limit<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.260> what<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.440> do<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.650> incorporate

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
that's limit so what I do is incorporate

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:33.320 
that's limit so what I do is incorporate
a<00:02:14.020> DVD<00:02:15.020> player<00:02:15.050> mp3<00:02:15.500> player<00:02:16.070> MPEG<00:02:16.490> player

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.270 

and<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.660> stereo

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.480 

always<00:02:38.940> come<00:02:39.180> on
