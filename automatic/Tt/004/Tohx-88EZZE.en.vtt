thing<00:07:20.070> I<00:07:20.430> really<00:07:21.060> enjoyed<00:07:21.510> it<00:07:21.720> I<00:07:21.810> really

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.200 
thing I really enjoyed it I really

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.600 
thing I really enjoyed it I really
learned<00:07:22.410> a<00:07:22.530> lot<00:07:22.560> it<00:07:22.800> was<00:07:22.890> about<00:07:23.010> small<00:07:23.340> shop

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
learned a lot it was about small shop

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.880 
learned a lot it was about small shop
production<00:07:24.300> the<00:07:25.020> production<00:07:25.050> part<00:07:25.740> never

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:25.890 
production the production part never

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.580 
production the production part never
really<00:07:26.160> paid<00:07:26.400> off<00:07:26.430> but<00:07:26.790> I<00:07:26.820> learned<00:07:27.030> how<00:07:27.300> to<00:07:27.590> you

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590 
really paid off but I learned how to you

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.590 
really paid off but I learned how to you
know<00:07:28.710> build<00:07:28.980> a<00:07:29.130> lot<00:07:29.340> of<00:07:29.520> jigs<00:07:29.820> and<00:07:30.090> and<00:07:30.390> some

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:30.600 
know build a lot of jigs and and some

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.260 
know build a lot of jigs and and some
techniques<00:07:31.110> that<00:07:31.320> really<00:07:31.710> I<00:07:31.950> think

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
techniques that really I think

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.980 
techniques that really I think
ultimately<00:07:33.270> improve<00:07:33.960> the<00:07:34.260> quality<00:07:34.500> of<00:07:34.860> my

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990 
ultimately improve the quality of my

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:41.510 
ultimately improve the quality of my
and<00:07:38.480> other<00:07:39.480> than<00:07:39.690> that<00:07:39.780> no<00:07:40.110> I'm<00:07:41.010> learning<00:07:41.400> on

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 
and other than that no I'm learning on

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.310 
and other than that no I'm learning on
every<00:07:42.000> guitar<00:07:42.450> that<00:07:42.690> I<00:07:42.720> do<00:07:42.890> like<00:07:43.890> this<00:07:44.040> one
