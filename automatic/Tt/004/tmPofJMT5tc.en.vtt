00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.160
 hello thank you very much for being in a 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.740
 new video of this channel today we are going to 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.869
 see how to install this sidebar of 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.520
 samsung so we can open two 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.680
 applications at the same time of a 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.660
 way a little easier as you see 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.510
 works perfectly you can manage 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.300
 both applications without any problem 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.239
 it's true that I'm from a galaxy s2 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.550
 but as you will know in galaxy s2 no 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.680
 this version is available and also 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.470
 I'm not running software 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.690
 samsung I am running android 4.4 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.879
 pure kitkat so it does not have any 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.440
 samsung software this module and this 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.589
 application are available for 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.809
 any device with android 4 for 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.940
 up so make sure that you 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.710
 device is compatible now yes 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.809
 let's start to explain how it 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.940
 install to start you should have 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.739
 installed the ex post framework and so 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.960
 so much must already be superuser 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.909
 if you do not know how to install this expelled 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.159
 framework I have a video where I teach you 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.740
 How are we in the installer? 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.390
 go to the download category and here in 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.290
 download let's press the button 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.200
 search now let's write x 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.600
 multi windows and as you see open the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.600
 second result and here it shows us a 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.660
 small description of this module you are going to 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.520
 click on download to start 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.490
 download this module and then 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.140
 it will automatically start the installation 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.870
 we press install, we wait for 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.630
 seconds and then we do not open it we're going to 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.160
 give finished after finishing 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.130
 we have to go back to the screen 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.590
 main of the exposed framework go to the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.330
 category of modules and here we are going to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.119
 activate this module that we just 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.430
 install press the button and now 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.940
 we just have to restart our 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.090
 device so let's do it and 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.189
 then we come back 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.920
 and well since it has started again 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.960
 our device we are going to go to the drawer 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.390
 of applications and we already have the option x 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.129
 multi window this function already allows us 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.379
 open two applications at the same time 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.290
 but we still do not have the sidebar of 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.230
 samsung for that let's go to the browser 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.450
 to download a special application for 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.900
 let this little sidebar be added 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.390
 We are going to enter this website in the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.150
 Description I put the address as 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.459
 this is the official page of the file 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.530
 installer and if you want to be safe and 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.269
 have no problems the best thing is that the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 download is from here in the first 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.190
 part gives a description and the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.040
 instructions below in the second 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.280
 post you can see what it says download 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.900
 and here where it says attack files you go to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.940
 find the file that we have to 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.810
 download that is multi windows site bar 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.030
 of 1.0 so if you're watching this 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.799
 video on some other occasion more 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.569
 ahead there may already be new 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.209
 versions but if you are entering this 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.010
 official page you will find only 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.120
 the official downloads once 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.700
 download terminus 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.620
 the file and you open it you will leave this 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.739
 simple interface to install this 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.360
 new service so we give install and 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.060
 now we only wait for a few 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.590
 seconds and ready this time not 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.959
 we have to restart the restart 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.940
 device because it is not a module of 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.340
 I exposed framework so we can click 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.470
 open as you see when opening the application is 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.450
 a configuration screen the first 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.129
 option is to enable or disable 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.040
 the service as you see if I pulse it already 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.110
 the little eyelash appears here and if I go back to 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.480
 pressing the first option disappears the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.700
 next is for you to activate is that this 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.709
 service starts as soon as you start the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.530
 phone now in the third option 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.239
 you have to select a plant mode x 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.370
 multi window which is the one that we already have 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.379
 finally installed in the fourth option 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.480
 is that you can add the applications 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.220
 you want to be available either 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.360
 individually or in groups we will 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.600
 add some for example calculator 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.900
 calendar 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.520
 gallery and here you can add 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.530
 all you want to have 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.750
 installed in a very simple way very 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.580
 easy the truth and if you want you can 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.980
 add a group of two applications 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.020
 so that they open automatically in 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.359
 couple for example I will select 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.269
 browser up and 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.509
 clock down now I just have to 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.580
 Click create group and we're going to 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.860
 back in the appearance section 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.270
 you can modify the left position or 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.219
 right where you want the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.599
 tab and the size although I'll 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.610
 I recommend that you do not move there 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.560
 too much now we are going to start the 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.270
 service and we can already go back to the 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.340
 initial screen this eyelash 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.949
 you can move in a very simple way and 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.439
 now if we can be anywhere 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.629
 and open two applications simultaneously 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.789
 for example let's open calculator 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.490
 we simply drag it towards the 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.229
 screen and then drag any 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.710
 another one that we want to open for example 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:00.409
 google play store and as you see we have 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.870
 both applications running without 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.819
 no problem at the same time and 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.400
 we can do it in a very 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.189
 similar to that of the galaxy finally 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.750
 if we open one of the group that we believe that 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:15.050
 is for example the last one that says the 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.639
 browser and watch if I give it over it 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.740
 are going to open two applications 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.020
 simultaneously without me having to 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.089
 select one by one 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.200
 if you want to hide this tab because 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.330
 it's already bothering you 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.030
 you have to go to the application drawer and 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.450
 find where it says multi windows 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.640
 and here you press the option that 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.590
 says all the service and clever is hidden 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.200
 to show again you press again 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.070
 all the service and it comes back here 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.620
 Appear 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.110
 the tab and well that was all for 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.020
 this video I hope you liked the 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.660
 it's really interesting to be able to install 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.790
 this little bar to have two 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.590
 applications running simultaneously 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.840
 remember that you can subscribe to the channel 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.560
 to not miss any new video we 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.560
 we see the next 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.740
 ah
