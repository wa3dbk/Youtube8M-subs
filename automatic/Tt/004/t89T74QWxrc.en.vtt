00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello and welcome here 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.389
 was with the next part of my egon 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.219
 Geis series today with an add-on no 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.469
 not with the name kader but in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.509
 eton with the name el sheikh said land 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.640
 does nothing but the whole 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.460
 to automatically sell gray ages 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.930
 whenever you are a npc dealer 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.240
 click that alone too 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.180
 great I can configure here 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.980
 the automatic sank then I have off 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.210
 provided that there are a maximum of twelve years 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.439
 sold and I have to partially the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.850
 Just click on dealers and me 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.739
 Think it's about tent wall button 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.989
 yes, no matter 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.340
 gold gate and the soul spam that shows 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.020
 then just sold me something 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.660
 was and a lot of gold in total 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 I got a very useful one 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.980
 but the special function is that itself 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.440
 can automatically add items 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 who are sold with and you know 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.559
 that there are a few teams that just 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.120
 no gray ones are not sick 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.539
 classified but knows for example 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.100
 Here this then party will when you 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.480
 certainly one or the other 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.489
 have found times 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.040
 and I can add that by myself 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.600
 just him on here draw on this 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.460
 item window there you see i st 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.380
 just have a few white bars 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.850
 bought at the npc dealer only a few 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.930
 I still have items to continue 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.140
 can add 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.939
 also the drag &amp; drop i in this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.229
 small windows in and then look 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.930
 We are all the same at the same time 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.299
 would work ok here 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.520
 then also return to gain and now 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.590
 Let's see what cell does and how long 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.210
 you see the five items are out 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.280
 my inventory disappeared without that 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 I still had to click something 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.890
 even if there is a sell long button 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.900
 But there is in the case 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.460
 automatically works if you so 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.990
 something needs a bit of order 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.729
 still in your pockets 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.409
 even if you cost a lot and 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.290
 he gets a lot of stuff that he usually does 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.329
 sold on the walls then I think 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.960
 This could be just right for you 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.640
 his 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.020
 i hope the smoothly failed me 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.509
 Hope it was fun if so 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.600
 I would be very happy if you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.969
