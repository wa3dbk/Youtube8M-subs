00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.719
 in dreams the experience and you're 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.210
 living here thanks to my alias 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.220
 continue to enjoy the number one moment 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.420
 Itunes has been because as if not 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 wants the thing 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.610
 in the morning you find yourself if you really 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.820
 you're saying it's wonderful and the 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.820
 true 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.620
 and this I think has given us the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.870
 opportunity me at least in my case 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.130
 Alberto's staff recognized Alberto 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.130
 Basque but yesterday I did not know them 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.550
 you think you imagine is a way to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.480
 meet people but I think that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.290
 it's a little bit what we are 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.290
 getting with this 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.580
 know the foreign singers 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.170
 can we do topics because there is a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.330
 company that is supporting us because I 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.550
 I say blind ministers very well companies 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.900
 supported the subject possibly could not 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.810
 have left 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.370
 the whole story I would love it to be 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.380
 so let's see how it works we're going to 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.810
 see how it is supported and I think that there 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.730
 It has been ultra respectful everything 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.310
 we want to create if the project 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.260
 is going to be good for everyone I think 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.480
 the good thing is not just that he leaned on the 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.770
 product or a song but that is 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.770
 generic and support music 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.979
 the labels are not good today 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.830
 you have to join they had had a 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.290
 good a good idea and above I think that 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.780
 the choice he has had with all 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.130
 we did not see very well we are with 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.259
 people very well I have always said that 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.119
 because no more people because we do not 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.520
 we join because and suddenly by looking 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.080
 because there's nobody coming out there's a lot 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.360
 fear and people do not realize that the 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.009
 make and easy for everyone something way 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.500
 interpret this when you have a success 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.030
 or a popular impact a protected what 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.280
 I have already won so that nobody else has 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.260
 access to that and the other way of saying 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.420
 good thing is that this canada if what 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.680
 I share or if I help in case that support goes 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.190
 to make this defect that I have 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.170
 will grow of salt already with this meeting more 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.819
 beyond the tica partner festival 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.680
 dono let's click what it does is that it's not 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.140
 a fashion not the only best can not 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.580
 get to 40 but all together if you have to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.240
 join as they do in other countries but 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.010
 they do very well 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.840
 and it is the secret to each one from a 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.000
 style of a genre we are not as we are 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.490
 but we live in the same sector of the sector 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.600
 of music then its grain of sand 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.600
 is positive 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.850
 in default of brands 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.459
 I think it would also be interesting to 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.020
 face the future multiply that is 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.360
 musicians have an artist who 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.800
 It turns out that you have met the project 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.150
 output you are interested in that they report but 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.160
 I would think that it has to be a 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.489
 singer exclusively music 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.489
 electronics 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.980
 yes 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.780
 electronic music 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.700
 I think it would be very cool if 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.680
 get it out to position itself as 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.750
 the platform here becomes music 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.620
 electronics we all have friends that do not 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.599
 they have nothing to do with music 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.160
 electronic and when you talk about what 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.050
 that you do for them the only thing 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.550
 ok is the photo in which it is 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.650
 student a lot of people with the 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.980
 hands up such an easy life I do not 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.350
 they see neither the hours of study nor the 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.620
 pressure that they submit to you and that you 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.360
 you submit neither the airplane hours nor that 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.340
 when you're going to click, it does not matter if you're 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.780
 sick that people do not care about that 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.790
 he does not care just at the moment 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.440
 Well, I think that this would do 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.299
 so that the global audience 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.950
 I understood a little more what it means 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.200
 be the one he said that behind that there's a lot 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.549
 more there is a lot of professional load that 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.190
 would make even the profession itself 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.299
 will earn a respect we are earning little to 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.080
 little but I think there's still 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.080
 win it make question
