provide<00:02:04.320> us<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.590> first<00:02:05.040> experiences<00:02:05.910> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
provide us with first experiences of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.719 
provide us with first experiences of
movement<00:02:06.780> over<00:02:07.140> rugged<00:02:07.320> terrain<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.099> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
movement over rugged terrain and to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.979 
movement over rugged terrain and to
learn<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> crawler<00:02:09.720> might

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
learn how the crawler might

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.470 
learn how the crawler might
independently<00:02:10.830> overcome<00:02:11.400> obstacles<00:02:11.610> without

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:17.999 
of course that the robot will manage to

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.479 
of course that the robot will manage to
find<00:02:18.269> its<00:02:18.420> own<00:02:18.659> way<00:02:18.689> and<00:02:19.200> perform<00:02:19.709> given<00:02:20.069> tasks
